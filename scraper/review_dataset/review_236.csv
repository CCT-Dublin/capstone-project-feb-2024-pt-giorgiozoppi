236,Friendliest staff in the world!,"This was our first trip to Dublin and we wanted a hotel with a central location, good ratings and near several places to eat and of course drink.  Although the hotel warned us there was renovation construction ongoing on the first and second floor but would be kept to daylight hours, we only heard an occasional hammering in the late morning.  The accommodations are very nice and our room appeared to have been recently upgraded.  The central facilities like reception desk, restaurant and lobby are very nice and comfortable.
As this was our first visit to Ireland, we cannot really compare this hotel to others in Ireland, but without question the best feature of this hotel are the staff members.  In particular was Connor who seems to work the front door, lobby and even the restaurant.  When checking in after a red eye flight from Florida, our room was not ready, but Connor introduced himself, asked our names, took care of our luggage and sat us down in the restaurant for a cup of coffee or tea recognizing our fatigue. During the entire visit, he recognized us, greeted us by name and inquired if he could be of any service to us. He made great restaurant recommendations, assisted us in the correct pronunciation of KIlmainham Gaol, ordered us taxis as needed, and directed us to his favorite bookstore when he learned we lost our copy of Rick Steve's Best of Ireland (which we used to plan our entire week long visit to Ireland).  If we could not find a copy, he even offered to give us his personal copy of the book he had at home. Fortunately we could download an online copy and declined his generous offer the next morning.  The front desk staff and even the housekeeping staff were always pleasant, friendly and helpful.  Maybe all hotel staff in Ireland are like this, but since this was the only Irish hotel experience for us - we cannot compare them to other Irish hotels. However, we have experienced MANY hotels in the USA (Hawaii - our home, Napa, Sonoma, NYC, Boston, DC, SF, LA, Miami, etc) as well as the world (Scotland, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, Tahiti and French Polynesia) and the staff at the Brooks were one of the best if not the best.  Connor is certainly the clear leader among all we have ever met. 
The hotel was a wonderful discovery and the staff, in particular Connor, made it a wonderful visit. We will definitely return here if visiting Dublin again.",5,2024,10,19
236,Compromise required,Could love this place if the rooms were all renovated. Ask for that and an upper floor off the street. Bathrooms sorely need updating. Good mattresses and pillows. Terrific staff. Great breakfasts served efficiently. Can’t beat the location.,4,2024,10,13
236,Great experience at the Brooks Hotel Dublin Ireland,"Great location and wonderful staff. Perfect place to stay and walk to many shops, restaurants and bars. Connor, was the absolute best. Greeting us at the door, helping with our luggage and lots of suggestions and information on places to go. The rooms were nice, breakfast was delicious and all the staff were great! We would definitely stay there again!",5,2024,10,13
236,Brooks Hotel,"We stayed 1 night at the Brooks Hotel. Connor was great! He was always at the lobby to assist with questions, luggage and had great recommendations for us! Great Front desk staff and easy check in and out. Our room was nice. Shower very hot and great water pressure!",5,2024,10,13
236,Solo travelers beware,"While check-in is officially 3pm, it appears that couples get preferential treatment over solo travelers!  I personally witnessed this treatment and when I asked why, the receptionist responded is your room is now ready.  Quite a coincidence.",2,2024,10,11
236,Always a good stay,"This is my go-to place in Dublin for more than a decade now.  The service is excellent, the rooms are clean and well equipped.  The fitness room is small but never busy.  Breakfast is excellent as is the hotel location.  Wifi is good.  All in all a good choice in central Dublin.",5,2024,10,01
236,Excellent hotel city center,"5 star hotel in the middle of the city!  We had breakfast & drinks at night ☘️ the staff was awesome & so helpful.  Just ask and they will provide an answer.  Beautiful hotel.  Look at the elevator to see something unique.!  Close to Temple Bar, Grafton st, and much more.",5,2024,09,24
236,Fantastic,Really great hotel. You couldn't get more central and very reasonably priced. I stayed with my friend who has been several times and although this was my first it won't be my last. Staff are all very helpful and make the effort to chat with you throughout your stay. Cant wait to go back.,5,2024,09,13
236,Very overpriced for what you get. Non existent WiFi in rooms on Level 6.,"The online booking process was chaotic. When we arrived we found that the only records front of house referred to were paper based. This lead to confusion as I had booked 2 rooms one for us and another for my adult daughters as we were attending a family wedding, the number of mistakes made with the booking is too lengthy to list. 

The room had no refrigerator. It was difficult to use the bath to take a shower and for my husband who is approx 6’ 4”

We stayed for 4 nights, the cleaner’s trolly obstructed our door all day, everyday. 

The concierge was excellent.",3,2024,09,10
236,Worth considering if you can get a good rate,"Brooks is well located for sightseeing around Dublin.  Bear in mind that Drury Street is a “party” street and if the weather is good then the other end of Drury Street may be a mass of people having a good, noisy time.  Ask for a room at the back of the hotel, which is quiet.  We had a deluxe room which had plenty of space but a shower over the bath.  Our room was missing a fridge but this was rectified.  Bed was comfortable.  There were signs of leaking on the ceiling and some rotting wood in the bathroom but then this hotel is in an older building.  It does have aircon, unlike some other hotels in Dublin in older buildings.  We did see a Classic room which was quite a bit smaller but did have a walk in shower.  It also faced the noisy street.

Breakfast was a typical hotel buffet. The cooked options looked fine.  We did not use the bar or have dinner so can’t comment.  Reception staff were good but prior to check in, we encountered repeated confusion regarding our booking, which may have been attributable to, what appeared to be, a paper based booking system.  Beware.  Also, on the sixth floor, the WiFi showed a strong signal but was virtually non-existent, even for simple tasks. It’s a good ten years since I’ve had to go to the lobby to get decent WiFi.  Consequently, we went through much more of our international roaming than would be normal.

Value wise, our rate was expensive for what we got though I suspect other guests in largish tour groups were getting a better rate.  If you can get a good deal, this would  be worth considering but if not, shop around.",3,2024,09,10
236,Great service level!,"The customer service was exemplary. Connor, Marvin, and Rueben were just great. However, Vaya at the main desk was so kind, helpful, and was attentive to all of our questions with accurate information being provided. She deserves a raise for her hard work. Dan Miller
( feel free to reach out if you want more information.)",5,2024,09,09
236,"Excellent service, great location.","We had a very pleasant stay in three days at the hotel with excellent and helpful service from the staff. Special thanks to concierge  Connor O'Connell who from day one gave us some very good and useful tips about what we should to do and  experience in Dublin. And allways with a  nice comment. We got a very nice, clean and quiet room. The breakfast was very tasteful and varied.  The location of the hotel is very good right in the middle of Dublin. We warmly recommend the hotel and will be happy to return another time.",5,2024,09,07
236,Favourite Hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed numerous times and the hotel and staff never fail to disappoint, infact I fall in love with it more every time I stay. Myself and my friend stayed for the Coldplay concert in Dublin, not only was it the only hotel which wasn't an extortionate price, but the hotel was very busy however this didn't effect the level of service. Anne, the general manager makes time for each guest, asking how they are getting on and checking in when she can. She took the time to ask what our plans were when we were checking out and gave recommendations for things to do at our next location. All staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, traits which can be lost in a big city hotel. The breakfast is one of the nicest hotel breakfasts in Ireland and the beds are probably the most comfortable I have slept in. I parked in the carpark facing the hotel which was only 16Euro for an overnight stay, unheard of in Dublin. I look forward to returning to Brooks.",5,2024,09,06
236,4 star doubtful,"i don't understand how this is a 4 star hotel. It has  absolutely a great location and the bed and bedding are very comfortable however it stops there.
cons
1 tiny bathroom
2 high tub difficult to enter and exit
3 bottom of tub rounded and feet very uncomfortable
4 Electrical system from the dark ages only 1 outlet available for all devices 
5 no alarm clock
6 ancient hair wall dryer mounted  in bath not usable modern one provided however
no outlet in bath had to dry hair in main room
7 no business office 
8 few amenities as would be expected in a 4 star hotel",1,2024,09,06
236,Dirty carpet uncomfortable bed.,The best part of this hotel was the concierge Conor O’Connell.  We made our reservation in February. Our room was on the street side on the second floor where the noise from people walking home kept us awake until 2 am. The  carpet in our room was stained  the bed creaky and uncomfortable .  The overall feeling of the hotel room was grungy.  The lobby was  nice and the breakfast buffet they put  on  looked amazing  but we did not eat as our flight left too early.  Location is central but the dirty carpet and uncomfortable bed tainted this visit,2,2024,08,31
236,Nice introduction  to Dublin.,"Just finishing up trip to Ireland.  Our first 3 nights stay at the Brooks was the nicest of stays in our 10 day experience.  The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.  The staff from front desk, restaurant and concierge  were all professional, friendly and paid every attention to our well being.  Very nicely located to most sites we were visiting.  Well done Brooks",5,2024,08,18
236,Thank You Brooks Hotel and Staff!,"We stayed at the brooks hotel for our family vacation to Dublin. They were beyond helpful and accommodating to our needs. Whether it was a room change or tweaking our itinerary, there were there without question. Special mentions to Darren, Marvin, and Caitlyn. They really set aside time to explain our options to us so we can confidently make decisions on how we want to move forward for our trip of Ireland. Will be coming again & would suggest anyone coming to Dublin to stay at the Brooks.",5,2024,07,31
236,Great Boutique Hotel and a good price,"Great boutique hotel
Perfect location in city centre 
Staff was great and the bar was excellent for dinner after a long excursion
Room was clean and there was a nice tub in the bath
Breakfast is offered if you wanted
I was impressed by the fast little elevator best I have ever seen",5,2024,07,24
236,Needs a revamp,A truly average hotel. The room we were given was small and in desperate need of an update. Tired and a bit tatty. The television was a relic. The worst part was the bathroom with a door on automatic closer and a shower head too low for most adults. The €15 breakfast is just about edible. The only bright spot is the thoughtful and attentive staff who are doing their best with a hotel owner who needs to invest in this place. Clientele appears to be American tour groups. Plenty of hotels around that are better value.,3,2024,07,19
236,Brooks Hotel - excellent in every way,"An absolutely outstanding hotel in every way- service, food/breakfast, room, helpfulness. Tara at the front desk made the experience that much more pleasant. Each hotel has its own “vibe” and the Brooks Hotel has a warm, “business casual’ vibe that we really liked. Absolutely recommend.",5,2024,07,19
236,Pleasant and Comfortable Hotel to start your Ireland exploration,"Very convenient location to all activities and local sites
Great selection at breakfast with easily accessible tables and good service
Friendly, knowledgeable staff
Nightlife at your doorstep
Prompt request for taxi service
Thank you",5,2024,07,15
236,I won’t be staying again,"The hotel is very well located, have great internet photos, on the check in the receptionist informed that we would receive an upgrade  for a brand new room however we noticed the room was not new but very old, the hair dryer didn’t work, no mini bar, but that’s.
We bought in advance the breakfast vouchers for 2 people and explain we have a son living in the city, eventually he could join us for 1 or 2 days, and receptionist informed the payment could be done later on the check out.
When our son informed our room to the front desk staff, immediately the staff wrote in their control our room, and ok, however it seems the oriental lady who manage the breakfast didn’t accepted, she asked for the other breakfast voucher and we explain exactly the orientation earlier provided, she was extremely rude, strongly demanding another voucher, as if we were going to eat and not pay, so my husband stopped his meal and went to reception to pay, was embarrassing until she pointed at us during our meal.  I won't be staying again and I won't even suggest the hotel due to the inability of its staff to deal with guests.",3,2024,07,10
236,Don’t scratch the surface,This is a very well located hotel with very nice staff.  It  has the makings of a grand hotel but did not follow through.  Our room was huge and we were happy for that. It  was clean and functional - in a somewhat odd way. On first impression it was lovely. But when you looked closer things were tired and well worn. The bed was terribly uncomfortable.  But again the location and staff were great.,3,2024,07,03
236,"Central, comfy and quiet!",We loved the Brooks Hotel. It is in a great location-- right in the middle of things-- but was totally quiet! The bed was so comfortable-- the best in our whole trip. The breakfast was delicious. The staff is super helpful and friendly. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.,5,2024,07,01
236,"Perfect location, fantastic service","I've stayed in a lot of hotels in my life, and the Brooks Hotel was one of my best experiences ever, anywhere. The room was on the small side, but it was clean, cozy, and comfortable. It had a classic look and feel, but with modern conveniences in the bathroom. The continental breakfast that came with our reservation was wonderful, with a huge assortment of delicious, quality offerings. What set our experience apart from all other hotels was the service: everyone we encountered was friendly, personable, and professional. Connor, the concierge, was especially warm and helpful ~ truly one of a kind. One more important detail: the location can't be beaten.",5,2024,06,23
236,"Location, location, location","My wife fell in love with the concierge Connor,  he gave all the guest that special attention that is so rare these days.  The hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin, an easy walk to most all historic sites in the city center.  Accommodations, breakfast, and service were all grand.  The hidden study in the basement was a nice escape.  St. Stephen's Green, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Chester Beatty, Trinity College, the Temple Bar district, the National Gallery, Archaeology Museum, and the River Liffey are all within minutes walk from the Brooks.  A little further, but still easily walkable, is the EPIC center and the harbor areas.

It was a very active night time area, but we were never bothered by the goings-on.",5,2024,06,19
236,Perfect for a one night stay in Dublin. Would come again because it's so easy to find in the centre of a very busy city,Super comfy room and king bed . Location is perfect for central Dublin. Staff at the check in were very professional and accommodating and the same leaving. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. Parking across the street is very convenient and reasonable.,5,2024,06,18
236,"Great location, clean, awesome breakfast","The Brooks Hotel is in a great location in the center of Dublin City. You can walk to most of the Dublin sites in a 30 minute or less. There are great restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was awesome! we took the 700 bus to the Aston Quay bus stop and walked about 4 blocks.",5,2024,06,15
236,Great location!,Very clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The doorman was very sweet and nice. It has A/C!! Bed linens were good. Towels a touch thin. Complimentary water/tea/coffee was a nice touch. Plenty of light and insulated well from outside noise.,5,2024,06,09
236,Fabulous Location!,"The Brooks Hotel is located in the Temple Bar area in Dublin which is a very lively area, mostly from tourists.  The hotel is a 10-minute walk to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.  My room was very comfortable and more than adequate for a solo traveler.  The bathroom is quite large.  My only 'complaint' was the bathroom door didn't stay open.  This was only a concern after taking a shower and the room was steamy.  Easily resolved by propping the chair in the doorway.  The breakfast buffet was well laid out and had a lot of choices.  Everyone I encountered at the hotel was warm and friendly.  If you arrive before your room is ready, there is a lounge on the lower floor.  Definitely recommend staying at the Brooks Hotel!",5,2024,06,04
236,Poor value for money,"Very small, overcrowded room (so much furniture you could barely move), small bed, very noisy at night. Also a service trolley was blocking the corridor to our room for much of our stay. Having paid almost e300 for the room I was disappointed.",2,2024,06,02
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin Ireland,"My husband and I have stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin twice, once in April 2024 and at Christmas 2023.  Both times the experience was tremendous, and we enjoyed it immensely.  Their service and cleanliness are beyond reproach, the staff personnel are exemplary, and their breakfast is fantastic.  The hotel is centrally located and quiet.  It is near many tourist attractions and the Hop-on-hop-off bus provides a good tour of the area.  It was a fabulous experience all around.",5,2024,05,29
236,Nice stay in central Dublin,"Great location within walking distance of everything, friendly staff on reception, in corridors and at breakfast. Large room & bathroom, and a delicious, made-to-order breakfast. We’ll try to stay here again next year when we visit Dublin again.",5,2024,05,28
236,Stay here in Dublin.  Excellent hotel in perfect location.,"Great hotel.  Perfect location to walk to most of the sites.  Book of Kells, St Patrick’s, St Stephen’s green, etc.  excellent shopping, food and pub areas nearby.   Staff are excellent.  We had excellent breakfast at hotel most mornings.   Clean excellent rooms.",5,2024,05,24
236,Good hotel on the top end of the scale,"Very comfortable, very relaxed hotel with good facilities 
I did feel it was overpriced, however the staff were very professional and willing to help
Location was good this enabled us to walk the city and cover every angle
Room was well appointed",5,2024,05,24
236,Highly recommend,"This is a beautiful hotel. They have well appointed rooms. It's a great breakfast with continental buffet and hot foods. The staff are very attentive. You couldn't ask for a better location - it's right near all the action in Dublin, pubs and shopping.",5,2024,05,21
236,My 4th or 5th Stay,"This is either my 4th or 5th stay in this hotel. I was disappointed with the room this time  the  decor was dark and it was back of hotel with noise from generators all night so if you are a light sleeper like me be prepared. However the room & bathroom were clean
The breakfast I was prepared for not a great variety and at 8.30am they were out of watermelon. However the hot food is good except one morning I could see plates left for collection & it happened to be ours & both were just lukewarm.
The staff were all very helpful and friendly especially the reception staff and the booking staff
Would I go back maybe but definitely a front room requested",3,2024,05,21
236,Comfortable lodgings in a good location,"Great central location and cordial staff, especially Conner the Bellman who warmly greets you by name every time you return. The room was comfortable but somewhat noisy with the window open as it faced out onto the street. They could do a better job in the housekeeping department as a large toe nail clipping was found on the bathroom floor upon our arrival which necessitated an additional cleaning of our bathroom. Additionally, there were no facial tissues in the room and the front desk assured us some would be brought to the room, however that never happened. Excellent breakfast buffet.",4,2024,05,20
236,Terrible fr check-in to check-out.,"I was very disappointed in my stay at the Brooks hotel.  I had reserved 2 rooms far in advance and when we arrived at 4p one of the rooms was not ready even though check-in time is 3p.  We were told it would be ready in 30 minutes but at 5p it was still not ready.  When we returned from visiting Trinity college at 9p the front desk took 20 minutes to find the paperwork my friend had completed at 4p.  No apologetic gestures were offered and we were told this happened because they had a big meeting there that day.  The next day, another group of people had a similar problem.  Once we received our rooms, they were no where close to each other despite booking them together. The WiFi worked only very sporadically, the shower was so small my husband could not move once in it, the shower door hinge was misaligned, the TV remote in my friend’s room did not work (another guest had the same issue the day we checked in).  For what they charge per room, these are not issues that should have occurred and when issues do occur, I would expect the staff to go out of their way to make it right. The hotel is clean and located close to many of the tourist sites, bars, and restaurants.  However, I will not be returning to the Brooks Hotel after this experience.",2,2024,05,19
236,Fantastic Hotel and well located in Dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin. Great staff that make you feel at home. Thank you to Anne and her team Ashley, Connor and Liam to name a few for making our stay so memorable.
The breakfast was fantastic and really highlighted what a Full Irish breakfast is all about.",5,2024,05,12
236,Ten out of ten,Stayed here many years ago. And decided it was time to revisit. Perfectly situated in the heart of Dublin City. Only walking distance to Grafton Street. Staff at check in were so welcoming and very good to us. They upgraded our room for us which was superb. The concierge was a wonderful man who went out of he's way to sit and chat with us. I was wearing the limerick jersey and he came over to talk hurling with us. The room itself was very comfortable. And all the amenities in the room from the iron to toiletries were a welcome. Breakfast in the morning was fantastic. You have a choice of a continental buffet or a good hearty fry that was cooked to order. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one. And myself and my partner will definitely be staying here again. As it has everything we need in a good hotel and it has to be said the staff were amazing.,5,2024,05,11
236,Best efforts and friendly service wins the day.,"Excellent accommodations and service. This is what I would call a boutique hotel, but our Deluxe room had more space than expected, but far less than a suite that would get at an embassy suites or residence inn. Overall the service, room, location, staff was on the high side of my scale. Clean and well conceived were the rooms. The breakfast included in our package was excellent. From the time we arrived to the time we left, the staff was pleasant and welcoming. We checked in over Three hours early. They we're just very accommodating even when they could not come up with an answer or did not know. Located within way walking distance to many of the local attractions. We walked everywhere. There was parking available directly across the street, but we arranged through Costco to have Enterprise deliver it auto on our last day. This was the first stop in our countryside Irish self drive tour. ",5,2024,05,10
236,Best hotel in the best location,"A great hotel, fantastic location, and a delicious breakfast, I’ve stayed in a number of different rooms over the years and the rooms are very comfortable and always spotlessly clean. 
The team always gives a great welcome and standard of service.",5,2024,04,22
236,Fantastic hotel in a great location ,"Elegant hotel in a fabulous Dublin location, well located to all the sights. We were staying with friends and they accommodated us all really well. Breakfast was fab, excellent full Irish and beautifully appointed rooms. Will definitely return, highly recommended ",5,2024,04,20
236,Great stay with friendly service,"We regularly stay overnight in Dublin when we travel in on nights out and it had been some time since we had previously stayed in Brooks hotel, we were also pleased we did and won’t leave it as long again in the future have already cancelled other reservations for other hotels over the summer months to book Brooks instead, nice old world charm and genuinely great service, rooms lovely and special mention to the concierge, lovely welcoming face",5,2024,03,31
236,Best sleep in Ireland,"The best sleep I had in Ireland.  Bed and pillows nice.  Coinsurer was wonderful.  He was helpful, entertaining and funny but there only during the day.  The evening desk service was hard to understand, English was not so good.  Location was perfect and bar area nice way to wind down at the end of the day.  Seemed that most people staying there were using the bar at the end of the night",5,2024,03,26
236,Pleasant stay,"Check in was quick and no complaints, friendly welcoming staff into lovely reception with bar and restaurant visible, both look nice. 
£50 will be reserved on your card so be aware of that. 
Booked a standard room, very clean but very very dated and extremely snug.
Advertised and told at reception there was a fridge but wasn’t. Provide you with bottled water but it’s warm. 
Showers were freezing, and hard to improve the temperature. 
Cleaner was about early morning and was very loud. 
Visited the bar for one drink, again lovely are and friendly staff. 
Able to book breakfast but there are plenty of places nearby to explore. It was €15 to book on arrival but went up to €20 if turned up. 

Great location in dublin for nightlife, shops. 8min walk to temple bar area, 30min walk to Guinness tour.

Check out in 12noon and able to leave bags until ready. 

All in all pleasant stay",4,2024,03,03
236,Great location and friendly staff.,"My husband and I stayed here with my family for our wedding weekend as our wedding was nearby.

We chose the hotel because the location is perfect, right in the city centre and close to lots of restaurants, shops and pubs.

We received a free room upgrade and our room (505)  was lovely. Spacious, bright and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet despite being in the city centre. 

Breakfast was delicious with a nice selection of buffet and menu items. The bar was also a nice spot to have a drink and relax.

The only downside was that on checkin there seemed to be some confusion over my booking with the staff member on the desk seemingly unaware of my reservation and informing me there was no booking under my name. This was cleared up by another staff member and the rest of the stay was very smooth. This blip was surprising as all email communication I had prior to arrival was excellent and all staff I met after checkin were friendly, attentive and made us feel very special. 

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",4,2024,02,18
236,Excellent City Centre Hotel!,"Stayed for a night with work and was very impressed with this “boutique’ style hotel. 

Check-in was welcoming and I was given a nicely appointed room. The hotel has a very classical yet stylish feel and that was definitely reflected in the room I had. The welcome cookies were also appreciated and nicely devoured after a long day travelling.

Had a very comfortable sleep and a great shower in the morning. The Rituals toiletries were a welcome treat as it’s rare to find such a good high street brand in hotels. Although the ancient yet functioning hair dryer in the bathroom on the wall should be replaced. 

Breakfast the next morning was a lovely affair with a buffet for cold food and the hot food was cooked freshly by the chefs in the kitchen. The lady at breakfast, Anne the General Manager was very nice to talk to and it is great to see a business leader engaging so well with their customers. 

Check-out was efficient and they called me a taxi to the airport which arrived within minutes. 

I definitely enjoyed my stay and can recommend to others. I will return for sure.",5,2024,02,16
236,"Lovely hotel, let down by the food","We stayed here as we had tickets for the Olympia theatre and the location was perfect for that. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere and very friendly staff. We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel and wouldn't recommend either. At 10am housekeeping knocked on our door and entered straight away without waiting for a reply, which I thought was very rude. We would stay in this hotel again but wouldn't eat here.",4,2024,02,04
236,Absolutely fantastic experience smack-dab in the middle of Dublin,"We had a fantastic experience here. We had booked this hotel without really looking into it, we just wanted to see Dublin - but I can say that the hotel, the staff and the food far exceeded our expectations.

I would like to personally mention and appreciate both Connor and Zula. Two fantastic members of staff that made our stay extra memorable. 

Connor is just a blast to chat with; he's advised us on many things to see, to do, and to enjoy. And I can say that for every thing that Connor praised and recommended, every single one of those things ended up being fantastic. He was also kind enough to arrange a taxi for us on the way back to the airport. Connor is an absolute delight, and I am so grateful for having him be part of our experience in Dublin. I cannot recommend it more to have a chat with Connor.

Similar things can be said for Zula: every morning we enjoyed the continental breakfast in the hotel, and Zula was there in the restaurant area assisting us every step of the way. We had made an honest mistake in our booking, by only getting the breakfast option for a single person instead of our full party. Zula was the one to inform us of this and she handled it fantastically. We were offered a discounted rate for the continental breakfast, which was of course much appreciated. Zula is a delight to be around, and I fully trust she'd deliver the same service and kindness to anyone else.

Upon arrival, we received an upgrade to a nicer room as well. We ended up staying in room 504. The room was very nice, and very cleanly. Housekeeping staff also made sure that the room was kept in top shape throughout our stay. We didn't spend much time in our room though, and didn't end up using some of the offered amenities in our room. We were out exploring the city. But rest assured, the room experience was great.

The jasmine bar is also a nice place to relax and sit down at the end of the day. We experienced it only once, but it was a nice experience. No music is played in the background, while I personally would like it more if some music would be played at low volume just to keep the room from sounding dead silent if there's nobody actively talking. The bar offers a nice decently sized selection of drinks; the drinks that you'd want to drink are on there. The bar offers a nice range of seating options all throughout, for solo people to large groups. Of course, the service at the bar is as fine as it is anywhere else in the hotel.

Yeah, overall it was a fantastic experience at the Brooks. I will definitely be coming back to this one in the future.",5,2024,01,26
236,Great stay in Dublin!,Wonderful choice from Delta vacations. Great location. Awesome breakfast. Nice rooms. Hotel bar was excellent. Roger at the hotel bar took care of our crew every night. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this hotel. Clean and cozy with a great staff and location.,5,2024,01,19
236,Staycation,"Absolutely fab stay at Brooks Hotel. Couldn't fault it from the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we felt welcomed by every single member of staff, what a great team. Enjoyed the sauna. Breakfast cooked to order was delicious. Everything on your doorstep, residents bar was greatly appreciated, like pre COVID times. 10/10",5,2024,01,15
236,2nd time. Not as good.,"Check-in was great, lovely lady from Turkey on reception. 
Asked for, and received an upgrade, which was great, room 503. Thank you to the duty manager.
In the bathroom, there was an irritating loo seat that had to be held up whilst loo being used. Totally unnecessary, just poor design. Bath had rust spots.
Areas of the floor in the bathroom were not cleaned in the 3 days we were there, and tiles behind the toilet were not cleaned in what would appear to be a long time.
Bedroom area fine, but surprisingly, no iron/ironing board, just a trouser press.

I was looking forward to breakfast as I remember it was great. However, on 3 mornings, there were no staff visible when we entered the breakfast room. 
Breakfast orders were taken, and on 2 mornings, mine were wrong. One morning, almost a 20-minute wait for porridge.
Things don't appear to be quite as good as on our2 previous visit.
The 3 concierges we encountered were great.",4,2024,01,06
236,"Room for improvement, over priced","It’s location was its stand out. Great atmospheric bar. 

The fabric of the hotel is tired. Lots of stuff frayed. Other stuff broken. Not fixed when pointed out. Staff uneven. Some top notch. Really top notch. Others inexperienced, struggling. 

All in all they’ve some work to do to deserve to charge at their current rates which are excessive for the product.",3,2024,01,01
236,Not Quite The Same,"The Brooks Hotel has been our “go to” accommodations in Dublin for our recent annual trips to Ireland. We started these annual visits in 2003. Then, in 2020, not long after we’d checked out to return home, the Pandemic hit.

Three years later the Brooks was sold and a few months after that, we returned.

And things were not quite the same. 

The location remains perfect. The lobby welcoming. The Doorman superb. The Front Desk commendable. A warm greeting and a waiting twin room with a thermostat that did not work and an engineering department that never came to fix it. Would that the room was as warm as the greeting. 16 Celsius. 61 Fahrenheit. A bit brisk to say the least. No blankets in the room. A call to the folks at the front desk requesting two blankets and informing them of the issue revealed that they could over-ride the malfunctioning thermostat and alert engineering. So. Problem solved. Or so we thought.

Departing the Brooks for a nearby breakfast and sightseeing, we returned to find that only one blanket had been deposited in our room and the temperature, though having risen, was not adequate. Another call to the desk. Another thermostat over-ride. Another promise to alert engineering. However the other blanket never appeared. And on at least one evening we returned to find the window open (not our doing)! The heat exchange with the front desk became a feature of our stay. Not what we’d come to expect in the past.

Housekeeping was interesting. Some days all used towels & wash clothes were replaced. Somedays, just towels. Some days the floor was vacuumed. Some days not. The room was kept clean & tidy, but not quite up to the prior standards. 

The bathroom tap was a puzzlement. Every use was a challenge to find the cold water. Even the toilet occasionally flushed with hot water (don’t ask)! And on our last day, the shower vacillated between warm and cool water. It was never hot. Toilet paper appeared (or perhaps more precisely did not) at a premium. And the quality varied. Again. Not what we’d come to expect.

Internet connectivity in the room via Wi-Fi or cellular was rubbish. Perhaps it was the location of the room in the hotel (2nd floor rear), or the number of devices (3 - not at the same time - not that it mattered-it was lousy even with only 1 device making an attempt to reach the internet). Sometime you could connect. Most times not. This was more than just less of what we’d previously experienced, it was aggravating.

The staff was, without exception pleasant, cheerful and, for the most part, efficient. The restaurant staff was wonderful. The food, delicious. 

That Engineering never fixed or replaced the recalcitrant thermostat during our stay is troubling. That a window was opened and left open in 5 degree inclement weather for heaven knows how long is troubling. That internet access, admittedly once a luxury but now an expectation and a necessity, was now so unreliable is just unacceptable. And these were issues we never experience over many prior stays.

Now, with all that said, my opinion remains that this is a fine hotel (with some issues) in a perfect location for those wishing to experience all that Dublin has to offer. The Book of Kells, Christ Church Cathedral, Marsh’s Library, Grafton Street, some great pubs, shops, food, history, culture, and memorable sights are all within an easy stroll from The Brooks. And even more of the same is just a short tram or cab ride away. But I worry.

Would we stay here again? I mean, we have a pleasant history with the place. But would we stay here again? Well…. We’ll be reading the reviews in the future and following how (if?) new ownership resolves the above issues to determine if next year’s Dublin trip finds us staying at The Brooks Hotel. Or if it is time to move on.

236,Wonderful hotel,Just back from a family trip to Dublin and again stayed in Brooks.  Anyone who hasn’t stayed here is defo missing out.  Staff amazing in this centrally located hotel.  CONOR as always is the life and soul of the hotel and earns every Penny.  3rd visit and will most definitely be booking again.  ,5,2023,12,04
236,Average hotel in a good location,"Have stayed at the Brooks several times, but won’t stay there again. There was nothing horribly wrong with our last stay, but the room, restaurant/bar, and service were just average. I considered giving the hotel a lower rating because the front desk staff were unhelpful when we discovered we had left an important item in the room after we checked out; but that was our mistake, not theirs.",3,2023,11,08
236,Perfect for short stays in the heart of Dublin,"A well placed boutique style hotel in the centre of Dublin situated opposite a 24hr multi story car park, which offers a reduced rate for hotel customers. A few minutes walk away from Grafton Street and St. Stephens green etc.
Pleasant decor, and very clean. Friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast offered available in light airy dining room. Hot breakfast selection cooked to order. Bedrooms well appointed, comfortable beds, and very quiet, could not hear any street noise  due to the well insulated windows. Ideally placed for both business and pleasure when visiting Dublin.

236,Great Hotel in a prime spot in Temple Bar.,"We had come to Dublin to visit our cousins as we do each year before Christmas. We have stayed in many hotels around Dublin but this was our first at Brooks Hotel. We had an absolutely brilliant time and really cannot find any negatives to mention. The hotel is situated in the heart of all things happening in and around Temple Bar. 
When we arrived at Dublin Airport Terminal 1 we used the Dublin Express Bus 782 and we stayed on this bus until Wellington Quay. Our return ticket for the two of us was 28 euros. From the bus stop to the hotel is 10 minutes walk. Upon arrival at the hotel we had a very quick and efficient check-in and also had our room upgraded. We were given room 111 which was just amazing, comfortable, clean and very spacious. Breakfast in the morning was just superb and I managed to have the Full Irish Breakfast which is very filling. The amount of buffet meats, cheeses, pastries, cereals etc will ensure everyone has something they like.
The staff are all so lovely, efficient and very friendly. We loved our two nights here and would highly recommend this place. Thank you for a truly superb visit. I am sure we would stay here again next time we are over as we did love its location to the city centre.",5,2023,10,16
236,Nice hotel to stay if you want to splurge.,"Very nice hotel. Pricey. In Central Dublin so walking to many sites and restaurants was no problem. They don’t have parking on site but have an agreement with parkade across the street for guests to park at for 16 euro. Super easy and convenient. The room was lovely, comfortable bed and breakfast buffet was top notch. Highly recommend if you want to splurge.",5,2023,09,22
236,"Overpriced, Over-rated,  and Under Served","Our experience started at check-in.  The young lady checking us in appeared annoyed and her attitude towards us was no different. This seemed to be a continuing theme with most of the hotel employees during our stay for 3 nights. 

Our room was less than acceptable.   We requested a King Room and received a Double Occupancy Room with a Queen and single bed.  We highly recommend you bring slippers.  The carpet in the room was less than desirable. The many stains throughout the room showed the age of the hotel. 

When we got back to the room after 9pm to go to bed one night, we realized the cleaning service had failed to put a mattress protector on the bed.   When we asked to have it fixed, it required multiple trips from the front desk person to understand what it was that we were talking about.  It was finally remedied,  but not without a great deal of frustration.  

Our several dining experiences, 2 breakfast, 1 dinner,  1 sitting for cocktails, was disastrous. The hosts were unattentive,  and slow to respond to requests.   Simple requests like asking for Napkins, a Glass of Ice, or even an extra set of dinnerware was unsuccessful.   Our first night at dinner, our server was agast with our order. He huffed, and rolled his eyes when we only ordered appetizers.  

Our overall experience was not pleasant.  In most cases,  the initial answers to requests were,""No, we don't do that"".  Only after pushing back on a few needed things did the staff agree to help.  

The one shining aspect of the hotel was the elevators.  They were prompt at call, and swift for arrival to the requested floor. 

Two stars were awarded because of the great elevators, the comfortable bed, and the consistent and quiet A/C system that kept the room at the perfect temperature.  ",2,2023,09,22
236,A great little hotel,The hotel is located in the heart of the city centre of Dublin you can walk to everything ! The room we had was clean and well kept . The hotel has a bed and breakfast feel with the amenities of a four star hotel . The dining and bar at the hotel had good food and the atmosphere was relaxing after a long day of visiting museums and churches and shopping. Our experience staying at the Brooks hotel was outstanding!,5,2023,09,16
236,Amazing Location,"Can't beat the location of this hotel. In the heart of city center -  Close to Grafton street, St Stephen’s Green, pubs and restaurants.  Staff was helpful and assisted with our cab to the airport which was they only time we needed service.  Everything is within walking distance.  First experience in Dublin and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,09,08
236,Great experience. Would return,"The hotel is clean, has very friendly staff, good breakfast, GREAT location, super comfy beds. You can park across the street for a discounted rate so be sure to tell the desk you have a car. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brooks and would return again in the future. ",5,2023,08,15
236,Poor customer service ,"Checked back into the Brooks Hotel in Dublin after returning from Belfast. Our first stay was pleasant enough. Upon checking in the second time we found our rooms ( 2 rooms) smelling musty and they were HOT. We turned on the AC and then went out for dinner and a stroll. Returning about 3 hours later, the condition of the rooms hadn't changed.  I went to the reception and said something to the person on duty. She just stood there with a blank stare. Her English was so so. I asked to speak to the manager on duty. He apologized and said he was aware that some rooms had broken AC units earlier in the day. However, his initial response was not satisfactory.  He said no one can come until the morning. He also said "" he thought we would not notice"".  I told him for the price we are paying per night we should have AC since this is a "" luxury"" hotel. How do you knowingly place guests in "" sauna-like conditions""? After back and forth, as well as threatening to call my credit card company to dispute the charges, he finally "" found"" 2 other rooms and upgraded us.  It seems the Brooks is staffed by inexperienced help. Pity!",3,2023,08,14
236,Best beds ever,"Just stayed here 2 nights, not cheap, neither should it be, very central, short walk to loads of restaurants, bars, theatre etc.
All staff at this hotel are exceptional,great breakfast nice bar , seriously one of the best beds we have ever slept in.",5,2023,07,30
236,Great Location ,"We had a great experience at this hotel. The service was excellent and the room was comfortable. We arrived early so our luggage was stored and by the time we got back to the hotel after a full day of touring Dublin, our luggage was waiting for us in our room. The location is very convenient with fabulous shops and restaurants right outside the hotel. ",4,2023,07,12
236,Nice hotel,Great location with plenty of things to do nearby. Staff was really friendly and the experience in Dublin was new. I would definitely recommend this location and the many things that are within distance is a sure stay. Located near many pubs and eateries. ,5,2023,06,30
236,Brooks Hotel--Great Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for one night prior to flying out from Dublin.  We wished we had stayed longer, as the hotel is very comfortable and located right in the centre of the city.  Many restaurants and bars close by.  We were there for Pride weekend so it was pretty crazy!  Would stay there again next time in Dublin.",5,2023,06,26
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin,The staff at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin made our party of eight feel welcome. Connor the concierge was extremely helpful and knew all of our names before we left a day later. The rooms were ample sized and the showers hot with great water pressure. Breakfast ,5,2023,06,20

236,First stay at the Brooks,"This was my first stay here. The room was average, had issues with the window as it didn't open properly. The room had a strange smell initially and the air-conditioning was ok. The staff and breakfasts were good. Great location in the city. Our ironing board was missing and had to call reception 3x for someone to bring it. The lifts were very small.",4,2023,06,08
236,Great hotel and perfectly placed near most everything.,"Great hotel. We were on a Golf trip with friends. 

Nice buffet breakfast with continental or menu got our day started right. Opened at 7 (7:30 AM weekends) was helpful for a golf trip. 

Rooms were cleaned and service was good. You can choose the level of cleaning service to your room as you please, they are well appointed.

The hotel is well situated for evening activities tours and attractions.

I would book this hotel again",5,2023,06,06
236,Average Stay in Dublin,"Disappointed.  First two nights of our stay room was OK - little dated, but relatively clean and not too cramped.  When we returned for the final night of our stay, about a week and a half later, the room was on the first floor and seemed much smaller.  The room was also very warm and the controls for the A/C did not appear to work.  On check-out I was told I should have let them know - pretty tough to do at about midnight and we left the next morning.  Also,  one of the complimentary bottled waters had been opened and a little bit had been drunk. The bottle was left as new along with the other bottle.  This was probably an oversight due a rushed housekeeping staff, but that made me question how thoroughly other things in the room had been cleaned. 
On a positive note breakfast quality and service was very good.  The location is very convenient, and the gentleman who worked in the lobby was incredibly accommodating.  
Overall, average hotel for location and price.   ",3,2023,06,04
236,Lovely Dublin Hotel,"The Brooks is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. The place is very clean and the rooms are cozy. The gym is very small but functional. There is also a wonderful library downstairs, very relaxing. The staff was friendly and efficient and the Bellmen were Fantastic. If you arrive there early from an over night flight, you probably won’t get in your room. We waited until 2pm to get our room. Best to book the extra night so it’s your room when you arrive.",5,2023,05,30
236,Expensive and not worth star rating.,Bed and bedding very comfortable. Room quite cramped and had to ask for new hairdryer as wires showing in flex. Noisy most of the night due to people leaving bars at 2am and bottle recycling at 6am. Breakfast serving slow but staff friendly. ,3,2023,05,23
236,Terrible check in experience,We show up early and no room was available for a six night stay. That is fine BUT ever time they said to come back the room was not ready. This happened multiple times. Must be a shortage of house cleaning staff. Front desk didn’t seem to care and did not even want to call housekeeper.,1,2023,05,21
236,Huge Disappointment,"This hotel does not measure up in any way. It is supposed to be part of the Small Luxury Hotel club but there was nothing that justified this. The rooms were small and cramped - even the upgraded room. They were dark and tired looking. The wood was peeling. The rooms were bland.  The staff were cool and did not make any extra efforts and barely said hello. The toilet roll holder was broken. And after three days still not fixed. The cold breakfast was basic fast food. Nothing homemade, all from a package and exactly the same everyday. The hot breakfast was bland and not fresh ingredients.   This hotel should be avoided if you are looking for the standards of a SLH. It is far from it and not worth the extra money they charge under that membership.",1,2023,05,05
236,A most wonderful gem in Ireland,"We just returned from a most wonderful stay at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin. Beside being in the most convenient location, we had a very comfortable, lovely room, with the best Irish breakfast ever! Lucas, our waiter, was so very warm and helpful, and Conor, the concierge, helped us at every turn, as well as all at the front desk. ...We so hope to come back again ...Such a special place.

236,Brooks Hotel,"I visited Brooks Hotel with a group of school friends from London. We were met in reception by Anne, who is the manager, and Connor, who is the concierge. They both gave us a very warm welcome, they truly couldn’t have been more obliging. All the staff were very friendly & professional. The room was spacious and quality furnishings. The location is ideal—a 3 minute walk to Stephen’s Green shopping centre. We were impressed by the choices for breakfast. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for atmosphere and location.",5,2023,04,28
236,Good Hotel Great Location,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Amazing Breakfast, Excellent Location in the heart of Dublin.
Traveling with 4 friends for the weekend this was the perfect hotel.
We were all very pleased with our choice of hotel.
Very near all the amazing bars and restaurant's as well as the shopping centres.

The rooms we were allocated were very good very clean & tidy good size bathroom with comfortable bed and tv in room.

The only problem you may have in this Hotel is the Noise and music from the local bars
If you are at the front of the hotel the noise and music can be very loud and go on till the early hours in the morning as we experienced. but we put up with it due to the fact that we were only staying for the weekend and we were participating in the bars with music.

Would be good if better sound proofing was installed on all the windows.

However we would stay again but possibly find a room at the back of hotel.

Roger the bartender was very professional and helpful and attended to everyone with a smile.

236,Excellent service excellent food excellent night sleep,"We came for 2 days so that my husband could do some work for a client, and tagged on a couple of days to do some sightseeing. The hotel is very much in the centre of the city within walking distance of most of the places you want to see. We reserved a classic double but there was a problem with the shower and we were very pleased to be upgraded to a deluxe room where we greeted with complementary plate of chocolates and a very nice letter of apology. 
Everything about the room was first class. We had a cooked breakfast every morning and lunch a couple of days. I have to say that the seafood chowder was delicious.  The staff around the various departments were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. A special mention for the housekeeper who looked after our room - Room 307. I think she is Italian. So kind and attentive to detail. 
If we come back to Dublin it will be Brooks Hotel for sure",5,2023,02,20
236,Great location and nice accommodations,The location of this hotel was perfect! Right in the center of the city with easy walking access to everything and directly across front a parking garage that they validate for $16 per day. The lobby was elegantly decorated and the rooms were very small but clean and comfortable. We loved being able to leave our car and walk around the city and easily come an go from our room (last time we stayed outside the city center and this was so much better). The price was also one of the best we found in the city for the night we were there so we were very happy to find it clean with nice decor. We would definitely stay here again!,5,2023,02,19

236,"Convenient hotel, friendly staff","We stayed at the Brooks for 4 nights in early December. The interior of the hotel was decorated festively for Christmas, but we were a bit disappointed that the outside didn't look like the photos on the website (with lots of additional Christmas lights). However, knowing what a struggle hotels have had in the past few years, that wasn't a big deal. Our room was nicely appointed, had a good view (room 608), and although we could hear a bit of street noise on Saturday night, from outdoor revelers on nearby Fade Street, nothing overly disturbing from inside or out.

We had purchased the room with breakfasts included and were glad we did as there was a very nice continental spread as well as a hot breakfast menu included. We never ate other meals at the hotel, but enjoyed the ambiance of the bar area one evening.

This hotel was walk-able to everything in central Dublin. We have stayed over by Christ Church and off O'Connell Street on other Dublin stays, but while those locations were convenient, this proved the best. We bought a 3-day Leap Visitor card to get around when walking would have been a bit far (like our visit to the Botanical Garden and Glasnevin cemetery). Unfortunately that didn't include the Dublin Express bus route from the airport (an additional 7 euro each way). We got off at Wellington Quay and the walk was less than 10 minutes to the hotel.

The hotel had a nice basement lounge that was a bit under-used. A ""fire"" in the fireplace down there would have been nice. Or, they might add a printer/business desk there for guests, since one was no longer available.

We didn't try any of the fitness offerings.

This is someplace we would stay again.",4,2022,12,27
236,Great location with great staff,"This hotel is in a great location within walking distance of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green. Amazingly comfortable bed!

236,Great Location in Downtown Dublin,"My wife and I were celebrating our 42nd Wedding Anniversary by touring Ireland for a month. We chose the Brooks Hotel because of it's central location to main tourist attractions and previous Tripadvisor reviews. Were were very satisfied with the Brooks Hotel. We arrived on a morning flight from the U.S. We took a taxi to the hotel. We arrived too early for check-in. So they stored our bags for us. When we arrived later in the afternoon, our room was ready and our bags were already in our room. Our room was clean, well appointed, and a little larger than typical European hotel rooms. I suggest eating breakfast at the hotel. Many of the local sidewalk cafe's were not open early in the morning. All of the local tourist attractions were within  a 15 minute walk from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel and lively evening venues. We will return to the Brooks Hotel when we visit Dublin again.",5,2022,11,26

236,Great hotel and great location,We had a lovely stay at this hotel. We were generously given an upgrade to a spacious suite with a balcony that was well appointed and beautiful. Every member of the team at the Brooks was kind and helpful. We enjoyed a tasty room service dinner one night. Also the treadmill in the fitness room was much appreciated. The hotel is in a central and fun location. Thank you for a lovely time!,5,2022,11,21
236,Simply Perfect!,"This was the third time I have stayed at Brooks Hotel. My first visit was great, the second not so much BUT I attribute some of the issues I encountered in my second visit to the chaos that COVID created for all of us. So my review back then reflected my frustration. This third visit was perfect. The hotel is back 100%, the staff is warm and welcoming, my room was fully serviced every day and the location is ideal. If you're looking for a beautiful boutique hotel that has all of the personal touches, look no further than Brooks. You'll love the experience and you'll look forward to coming back again and again.",5,2022,11,20

The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
Breakfast was really good and it was included in our price which was nice.",4,2022,11,04
236,Disappointed ,"Check in was quick. Only take credit card at check-in to secure payment. Can charge other cards on checking out. Car park across the road €16.  Room and bathroom was tiny and at the front of the building.  We stayed on a Saturday night for the marathon. It was a terrible night. The street noise and night club are very close to the hotel. It felt like we were in the middle of the club.  Terrible night sleep then having to run the marathon. I would NEVER stay here again. Very expensive to stay and not get any sleep.  The room we were in had another door, behind this door were pipes and electric. The pipes were from the toilet waste from the room above us So everytime the toilet was flushed above us we could hear it. The mattress protector should be changed everytime the bedding sheets are changed. It had hairs embedded into it. The bathroom sink and floor had hairs that were not cleaned properly. The hotel is nice if you don't have to stay a night. Very disappointed and expensive for what is on offer. 
Avoid if you like to sleep when you book a hotel. It was 2am when finally the noise and crowed stopped. Then we had to listen to the loudest humming of probably an Aircon machine for the rest of the night. 
Breakfast.. was good. We had to order porridge so waited a little bit. Irish breakfast was good. Lovely scrambled eggs. Very disappointed.

236,Great stay,"Close to the Main Street. Easily located the stops for the hop-on hop-off bus. Here’s my around Dublin City was made easy because of its location. Restaurants aplenty and pubs too, all within walking distance. Close to tourists places such as Trinity College. Within the day tour, we could only many the Guinness Storehouse, and that was a good choice. 
Breakfast menu was a great. We get hot food which we ordered from the menu. The bread, cereal and juices were on the table. 
Great stay.",5,2022,10,28
236,Great place to stay,The hotel was perfect - the best part is there is public parking right across the street - I would recommend this to anyone - the placement of the hotel is just right in a good spot and plenty of food and drink right around the corner - the breakfast was well done - it even has a good place for dinner.,5,2022,10,23
236,"Loud, Next to a late night club, poorly insulated,","The first thing I look for in a hotel is a good night’s sleep.  This hotel is next to at least one very loud nightclub.   We are in room 200.   The room is poorly insulated and just across the street from the club, so even with earplugs on it’s impossible to sleep.   If you like quiet and a good nights sleep in your room when you travel, look elsewhere.",1,2022,10,21
236,Great Experience ,"Everything about the Brooks was great.  Couldn't have been happier with our stay.  A great location, super comfortable beds, very quiet, lovely breakfast, and, as many people have commented,  the concierge Conner is the best",5,2022,10,16
236,Great Stay,We loved the location of this hotel. Our rooms were updated and comfortable - not like others in some reviews. Staff is excellent. We did not get the breakfast so we couldn't comment on that. Nice bar that stays open fairly late. We would return.,5,2022,10,03
236,Excellent location,"Let me start with the good - excellent location, friendly staff, restaurant had good food and service.  Room was clean and bed was comfortable.  It is in a busy area so weekend nights can be a little noisy on street side but nothing a little fan noise can’t cover up.  The bathroom could use a little attention - the shower curtain was so flimsy it flew at you while taking a shower and water spread all over the floor.  A sign in shower illustrating how to keep curtain inside tub was almost insulting. There was no venting in bathroom and no way to keep door open so bathroom stayed wet and steamy for hours after shower unless we propped door open.  A strange old hair dryer hung to wall and was knocked off by our left handed guest when he brushed his teeth.  Should not keep you from staying here - I only post this in hopes the hotel will make these updates as I am guessing all bathrooms are done this way. Otherwise, great stay.",4,2022,10,03
236,Disappointing,"The Brooks is neither luxury nor boutique.  The rooms are tired.  The breakfast is substandard - even the coffee is to be avoided.  The front desk staff is friendly, the rooms are quiet, and the location is convenient.  But the room and food quality is a long way from luxury or boutique.",2,2022,09,17
236,Absolutely wonderful ❤️,"We booked the Brooks hotel after we got tickets to see Garth Brooks. Very apt!!  Hotel was very nice, decor was very modern. Loads of toiletries in the bathroom. Super comfy bed. The concierge  Connor was a legend. The breakfast was stunning. Started with fruit and yoghurt, pastries then a full Irish breakfast. Kept me going until 3pm. Us Welsh can eat!! 
The hotel is in the city centre. Close to everything. 
We will definitely be coming back here, couldn't fault it. Only that I wished we stayed more than one night!
The Dublin experience was one we will never forget.",5,2022,09,12
236,Wonderful Boutique Hotel with Great Location,We recently had the pleasure to finally visit and stay at the Brooks hotel after several years of Covid delays.  The staff was so responsive and easy to work with throughout the years of delays.  Megan was wonderful to deal with and very informative regarding questions.  We were met by the very personable and helpful Connor upon our arrival and felt like we were personal friends immediately.  Just a great overall experience and I would highly recommend them.  Location was walking distance to just about everything and the rooms and breakfast were perfect!,5,2022,08,22
236,"Well located, friendly hotel","Great, friendly atmosphere. Good location within walking distance. Staff all friendly and really accommodating. Need a late meal or a few drinks with friends after a long day of touring? They go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one.  Would come back when in Dublin again.",5,2022,08,17
236,Very good location,"Brooks hotel is perfectly located for a city break, near to restaurants, shops, theatres and everything you want from a stay in Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and we'll equipped if a little dated. Breakfast was very good too.",4,2022,08,07
236,Lovely visit,We liked the Brooks a lot. It was in a wonderful location in the city center and had a great Breakfast. The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful. Service was good and we would stay there again.,5,2022,07,19
236,"Quiet, comfortable, fantastic location","Hotel is quiet, comfortable, fantastic location.  Breakfast food / service excellent.
     But Reception folks were hard to understand.  No reason for the outdated masks and silly plastic screen, which prevented a true welcoming experience.",4,2022,07,18
236,Fantastic hotel  and staff,"Absolutely fabulous hotel and staff
I can honestly say the staff in this hotel are the nicest I've met anywhere and nothing was too much trouble for them
Room was lovely, spotlessly clean, plenty of towels and toiliteries and the bed was so comfortable.
Breakfast was cooked to order so very fresh, the tea, coffee and toast arrived promptly
Will most definitely pay a return visit in the future ",5,2022,07,15
236,"Excellent hotel, very comfortable and great location.","Hotel was excellent, very comfortable rooms and pillow menu was a lovely treat.

Efficient, friendly staff who went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable. 

Located very near Grafton street for shopping and restaurants. Luas very close to get to other areas.

I left passports behind in the safe and reception posted them to me the next day, thankyou !",5,2022,07,14
236,Great choice!! A must stay,First time staying at the Brooks and I highly recommend it. I’ve always stayed at a different hotel on the river Liffey but so happy I made a decision to try something new. The location is walking distance to EVERYTHING. It’s so central. The rooms are very spacious even without having to upgrade to a larger room. There’s nothing you need to request for your room. It’s got everything but the best part is the staff. They are absolutely so accommodating and professional. Just stellar.,5,2022,07,11
236,Excellent Hotel,"I recently returned to stay in the Brooks Hotel in the center of Dublin and it proved again to be an excellent choice.  It is an independent hotel and the welcome received was very special.  Particular thanks to Anne Kinsella who handled the reservations, she was exemplary. Looking forward to returning again.

236,Within walking distance of the best of Dublin,"The Brooks is located one block from Trinity College and within easy walking distance of most every attraction you might like to see in Dublin. Their restaurant, Francesca's opens at 7AM and their food is good with a good variety.  Front desk service was great especially with nightmare, Ashley. While older than some, the hotel is clean, attractive, and given the near by pubs...soundproof. I would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2022,06,27
236,Good hotel at great location,"This is a fine hotel that I view as average for a four-star establishment.   Location is excellent and on a relatively quiet street given its central location.   There was insufficient hot water at peak times (in the morning).  Service was generally good but uneven.   Rooms are serviced only upon request -- we put in a standing order for our rooms to be made up every day.  Restaurant had trouble keeping up with the crowds at breakfast, e.g., keeping the buffet refilled.",3,2022,06,17
236,Nice hotel with friendly staff in Dublin,"Our travel agent booked us into this hotel.  It's in a great location, comfortably furnished with a friendly and helpful staff. The doorman is a fount of knowledge and a wonderful conversationalist.  We had to wait until checkin time before we could get in our room.  We should have booked the night before our arrival as we flew overnight from the states and got very little sleep.  The Brooks is in a perfect locations for walking through Dublin.  It's close to Temple Bar and the river, along with museums, restaurants and pubs.  We met some very friendly tourists who loved Ireland as we did.  The breakfast including the coffee was perfect.",4,2022,06,14
236,Fantastic location,Friendly hotel in a great location. Walked everywhere we wanted to go. Room was clean and tasteful. Would stay there again if we ever get back to Dublin. Many restaurants nearby. Very clean and up to date.,5,2022,06,14
236,Lovely city centre hotel,Very nice traditional hotel in the heart of Dublin. Excellent location for seeing the sights but the street it’s on is relatively quiet. Very friendly staff who are always willing to help. The bar looked nice but with so many pubs and bars and restaurants within 2-3 minutes walk I’m afraid I didn’t use it. Next time maybe!,5,2022,06,13
236,Great location breakfast rooms outdated ," location is great as it is in the city centre. Breakfast was very good.

Paid for an upgrade to a deluxe room and it was not worth it.  Room was outdated stains on curtains marks all over furniture etc bathroom shower was tiny hence why question the upgrade and the premium price attached.

Location 9/10
Breakfast 8/10
Value for money 5/10

Would I return possibly but it would be solely dependant on the hotel rate for the night which at the moment is very much overpriced

One thing that I also questioned was I heard an American tourist been told that their rooms are not serviced daily due to covid which I thought was a bit rich as nearly every sector has returned to normal ",4,2022,06,12
236,Brooks Hotel superb,This smaller boutique hotel is situated right in the popular area of Dublin but it is on a quiet street so you dont feel the crowds.  The location gives you easy access within walking distance or a short cab ride to everything.  The staff and service are excellent.  The irish breakfast is amble and delicious. Rooms are small for American standards but everything is clean and beds are comfortable.,5,2022,05,31
236,Wonderful stay in the heart of Dublin,"The staff at the Brooks Hotel were so very courteous and kind. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the little expresso machine in the room made delicious coffee and tea. Our bed was perfect and the bathroom large and well laid out.  We loved the central location making it easy to walk to most tourist spots on our list.
Next time we are in Dublin, we will definitely book a stay at the Brooks!",5,2022,05,27
236,Very Nice Experience in the Heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for 3 nights, upon our arrival in Ireland, starting May 8, 2022.  Being jet-lagged, we particularly appreciated how very quiet our room was, on the back side of the hotel, even though there was not much of a view.  The room was lovely in every regard.  We didn't prefer the fact that the bathroom door closed automatically, so we tied it open.  Other guests might like the automatic closing.  A door stopper would be nice to have, to provide an option for keeping the door open, when desired.
Connor, the concierge, is incredibly attentive and so willing to assist in every way possible. A true gentleman. We would definitely suggest asking his advice for restaurants and let him arrange taxi transport, if needed.  We don't rent cars in large European cities, so we did not have any experience with the parking.
Brooks is minutes (on foot) from St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College, and many other sights which tourists would typically visit.  We walked to the Guinness Storehouse, which is a longer jaunt to the west.  If you enjoy seafood, the restaurant named ""Sole"" is nearby and was outstanding.  Connor can make the reservation for you.
The ""Hairy Lemon"" pub is right next door, which has good food and live music.  Very convenient, especially if you're tired and don't want to venture too far.
Supposedly due to Covid, they were not refreshing the rooms daily, unless requested to do so.  Daily service doesn't matter to us, but they were very willing to provide additional coffee for self-service in the room. (Another reviewer indicated that there was not a coffee maker in the room; they probably just did not find it.)
Our breakfast was included in the room price and it was excellent, with options to order off of the menu, as well as a lavish continental buffet.  The pastries were fresh and delicious.  We enjoyed the bar a couple of times for an evening nightcap.
We would stay here again, without even considering another hotel. We'll definitely be recommending Brooks to any friends traveling to Ireland in the future.
If you are picky about hair dryers, it's a good idea to bring your own (with adapter).  The built-in hair dryers in European hotels are often rather wimpy in terms of air volume.",5,2022,05,25
236,Overated,The staff not all were sometimes very indifferent 😕.We put this down to being English.Americans seemed to get a lot of attention.We stayed 5 nights .We asked for a paper for each morning we only received 2 .When we asked about this the concierge said here have this one from reception no apology . Parking was opposite.We weren’t told how to get our refund so paid as usual only to read on another review you need to see the person at the window to get you’re discount .The room was lovely .Hotel very expensive.Wouldn’t stay again .,3,2022,05,24
236,Nice hotel in the heart of Temple Bar,"Excellent location for an upscale hotel.  This hotel is in the heart of Temple Bar and to say it is bustling is an understatement.  We're from Chicago, and we were shocked at how busy it was on the weekend.  Festival-level amount of people out on the streets Saturday evening.  There are tons of restaurants, shops, and bars near the hotel.  Many tourist sites easily within walking distance (e.g., Dublin Castle, Trinity College).  

The hotel is nice as well with large rooms (we had a deluxe double room) and nice size bathroom.  The rooms are nicely decorated with nice period touches, and beds are comfortable.  Nice soft towels, too.  Currently, there is no in-room cleaning due to covid, but they said they would make up the rooms if we requested it (we did not since we were only staying two nights).  There is no in-room coffee maker, but there was an electric kettle for instant coffees and tea.  They had a restaurant/bar on the first floor of the hotel that is cozy.  We only went there for cocktails so I cannot comment on the food.  

Overall, a good hotel with a good location for the heart of Dublin.  Very friendly staff, and I would stay there again.  Easy check-in, parking across the street at a car park, and they even upgraded our friends to a suite since their room wasn't ready upon check-in!",4,2022,05,24
236,"nice, central hotel","This is a good, centrally located hotel in Dublin. Service is very good and friendly. Breakfast was excellent. However, I feel that is a bit outdated with regards to the overall building & rooms. Insulation of my room was very poor and I had to turn on the heating in mid-April as cold air was coming in through the window frame. Otherwise the room was clean and well furnished. As most hotels in Dublin this is not a cheap place to stay.",4,2022,05,24
236,Great stay.,"We stayed at this hotel on the 9th, 14th-16th & the 18th May & can say  say every time we stayed we had a good stay the staff were always polite & helpful . the bedroom was very nice & clean, the bathroom had a bit of a smell but that was no problem, if you wanted a bath & was over 1.5 mts tall it was a bit tight. The view from our window was not that good we had a multi story car park opposite, but we only slept in the room. 
The breakfast was very good lots  of choice from cooked to continental & pastries.
I would recommend this hotel. the location is good for sightseeing & shopping",5,2022,05,22
236,I  want to live at Brooks,"What can I say but I love this hotel
* great location. - very central
 The staff are amazing - everything was achieved with a smile and the welcome was warm
My room was stunning - clean and well equipped
Loved the Roberts radio in the room and going to buy one myself
I could gush for hours but Brooks has Irish hospitality to an art form 
Thank you 
Ps Conor on concierge is outstanding and reception are approachable and awesome",5,2022,05,21
236,Outstanding Customers Service,"Anne the manager, Ann and Meghan who also work with her go above and beyond to help customers as we found from first hand experience.  We had problems with getting a rental car and needed another night at the Brooks.  They not only made it happen but tried to problem solve our issues.  They were beyond kind, sympathetic and we will never stay anywhere else but the Brooks thanks to these great individuals.  Saying thank you hardly does it.  Besides, the hotel is clean, staff are great and location cannot be beat.  Thanks from two visitors from New Mexico!",5,2022,05,19

236,Weekend away in Dublin,We are just home from a fabulous weekend in Brooks Hotel.  From the moment we arrived the staff were exceptional welcoming and very helpful Conor the doorman a true gentleman nothing was a problem.  We had dinner on rye Friday night our waiter was lovely no rush very relaxed in the background while we were eating was a pianist he was fabulous.  Our room was beautiful everything you could every need and even a radio.  We couldn’t believe how quiet the hotel was not from a guests point of view it was busy but from a noise point of view located in the centre of dublin.  Location wise you couldn’t choose better everything was in walking distance.  Secure car park just across the street.  All in all we had a wonderful time in Brooks Hotel and we will visit again a true Irish Hotel with a big Irish welcome💕🥂,5,2022,05,10
236,"Good hotel,let down by poor catering","This hotel has a great location in Dublin with a car park across the road which is great and only 16 euro per day for residents.The hotel has good rooms and a nice bar /lounge.The staff are really helpful,although the doorman can be quite familiar but very friendly and helpful.However I would eat elsewhere if I stayed again  as I don’t think the food is up to scratch,it’s a shame as the hotel has so many good points.",3,2022,05,05
236,Perfect Location,"We booked the Brooks because it was the pick-up hotel for a group tour we were going on. Well, it turned out to be the perfect choice. It is easily in the most perfect spot in town. Tons of restaurants (book ahead), tons of pubs, tons of happy young people making the city come alive again. We booked what I think was one of their better rooms; still not expensive. We were not disappointed. Everything was as should be, nothing really special about the room, but simply fine.
When we checked in we were greeted at the door by Colon (sp?), who makes everyone his best friend and, if he lived next door to you, would become your best friend; just a great guy, and great employee.
Breakfast was included in the room price, and was all you could ask for; self-service for cold cereals, pastries, etc, and servers to bring you hot dishes like eggs. Couldn't beat it.
We changed our minds about going out for dinner one evening and, instead, ate at the hotel restaurant, Francesca's. Not a destination spot for sure, but everything we ordered was very good.
As check-out was at noon, and we weren't being picked up until three, we checked out earlier, left the bags with Colon, walked a couple of blocks to St Stephan's Green, and spent a couple of hours on the Hop On, Hop off bus; a few hours well spent. We then returned to the hotel, and had a very nice lunch. I could not have asked more from a hotel.",5,2022,04,26
236,Good location,"Excellent location in walking distance to numerous shops & restaurants. 

I thought I detected a slight odor (sewage pipe break?) upon entering the lobby - not particularly pleasant but it was only there that I noticed it.

It's old - dark narrow halls, small elevators, etc. The room was clean & comfortable but nothing fancy. No view - looked out at a parking garage. Staff was friendly and helpful.",4,2022,04,25
236,Nice enough rooms but annoying 'upgrade' policy and no gym to speak of!,"I stayed here on a work trip a few weeks ago. Overall the hotel is charming, with an old-world vibe and nice details to have it stand out from the chain hotels out there. When I arrived I decided to personally pay for an upgrade to the deluxe room, as I had been travelling for several days before that. The upgrade cost was not insignificant (45 EUR each night over 2 nights) but I thought it would be worth it. I didn't notice anything deluxe or special about the room when I entered, and I also would find out later that people with the standard room had exactly the same room as me, literally the same room but without a bath. If I'm going to pay almost 100 EUR extra I would expect this to translate into something meaningful. I also tried to use the gym but I really wouldn't call it such, it's a room with 3 aging cardio machines, a bench, and a few freeweights maxing out at 10kg. This is an old hotel trick of being able to have a token gym. The bar area was nice, and there was a communal living room with sofas which I didn't use but was a nice touch. Without some fixes to the above policy, and maybe small upgrades to the fitness room (heavier weights, a nicer bench and something like TRX which will give people a range of exercises to do in the smaller place).",3,2022,04,25
236,Hotel accomodations,"Very comfortable hotel.  Doorman, Connor O’Connel was the greatest.  We are directional challenged and Connor nearly walked all the way to the restaurant we wanted to eat at to make sure we did not get lost.  He had a great semse of humor and was so helpful in all ways.",5,2022,04,24
236,Ideal hotel!,"We loved this hotel, you won’t get a better location, 5 mins from Grafton St, 10 mins to Temple Bar. We had a large room on the 6th floor. Breakfast was very good and cooked to order although on the Saturday morning it was quite busy so the pastries weren’t replenished. The staff, without exception were friendly and always had a smile and  the concierge,  Connor, deserves a special mention. 
I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2022,04,17
236,Amazing hotel,"I am making this my first review because our stay here was that good!! All of the staff absolutely went above and beyond. Excellent food, drinks, service and amenities. Not to mention, close to everything. When we return to Dublin we will be staying here from now on! They really went out of their way for us and I can’t express how grateful I am! Parking across the street, easy to get to from the airport. In-house Lounge and food are top notch! 5*",5,2022,04,16
236,Wonderful hotel,"Spent the day in My hometown of Dublin City, brought my children up for the day.  We all went for lunch in Brooks hotel.  Can not believe that We have never been here before. The staff were brilliant and the conscierge Connor was great.  Will defo stay for a night here soon",5,2022,04,14
236,Would stay again,"Great location, quiet rooms. Walk in shower, comfortable beds. Breakfast wasn’t great, but it’s ok. Plenty of excellent restaurants and shops just a few blocks away. Team was overall helpful with restaurant recommendations, etc. We had to wait a bit for a room and were offered coffee while we waited.  Rooms are not cleaned due to Covid, but hopefully that changed soon.",5,2022,03,31
236,2 nights stay,"Brookes is a regular stay for me, I’ve been using the hotel for about 4 years, and have always found the staff, food and more so the accommodation to be of a high standard. 
Rooms are clean as is the common areas of the hotel.
The team are happy to help with any requirements, needs or questions, and Conor is always there to offer a friendly hello. 
Will be heading back there in May.",5,2022,03,26
236,4-STAR HOTEL WITH NO PUBLIC FACILITIES,"I visited Brooks Hotel in Drury Street, Dublin, on Saturday 6th March with the intention of having lunch and probably drinks in the bar/restaurant, where I had been a regular customer in recent months.

To my surprise I was informed by the staff that there were no toilet facilities available at the hotel other than for guests, and that the nearest public facilities were located at the Stephens Green Shopping Centre, a walk of about 15 minutes’ distance.  The reason given was that the public restrooms in the hotel were under renovation.

It had been my impression that any establishment serving food and beverages to the public had a legal obligation to provide public restroom facilities.  Certainly apart from any legal considerations I would have thought that any hotel with reasonable standards of professionalism would ensure to have such facilities available for visitors.  It really is unthinkable that any customer in the middle of a meal or drinks at a hotel who found themselves needing to use the restrooms would be obliged to interrupt their meal and walk to the nearest shopping centre to use the toilets.

To lack such a basic facility reflects very poorly - to put it mildly - on what is supposed to be a 4-star hotel, so I would advise any intending visitors to proceed with caution!",1,2022,03,15
236,A wonderful stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The one night BB with dinner, wine and a late checkout was a winning combination for us celebrating my husband's birthday.  Considering the location and quality the €295 price was  good value for what we got.  Outstanding point was the friendly staff.  And hassle free with the subsidized car park right across the road.   At the upper end of four stars.",5,2022,03,14
236,Brilliant stay,"We stayed here with family for a wedding and all I can say the stay was fantastic. The rooms were great and beds comfy. 
The house keeper every morning was asking us if we required anything.
The staff on reception were also great and good not do enough for you.
Conor got chatting to us and asked him the wedding went and talked about old dublin which was brilliant. 
The food and breakfast was fab.
Will definitely go back and recommend to friends. ",5,2022,02,26
236,"Great location,food could be improved.","Probably one of the best locations in Dublin,the rooms are very good and there is a car park opposite _ the hotel gave us a great rate of only 16 Euro for our overnight stay.The staff were very friendly and accommodating,however we were rather disappointed with our dinner, it was quite bland.The hotel did not charge us for the meal,so the hotel really tries to make your stay enjoyable.Breakfast was not that great either,but maybe the pandemic has affected the hotels catering.However I would stay again as the staff did try to make our stay enjoyable.",4,2022,02,20
236,Short stay in Dublin made more enjoyable by the friendliness of the Hotel staff and the overall standard of what is on offer in ,From the time we checked in from the time we left we were looked after really well by a friendly and attentive staff you couldn't do enough for you.Looking forward to my next visit as this Hotel is in a great location and has lovely rooms and a great place to relax,5,2022,02,14
236,Weekend break,"So glad to be able to be back in Dublin to watch six nations rugby and when we do we always stay at this wonderful hotel
The staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you, the rooms are very comfortable and always give a good night's sleep
In conclusion we don't think that there is a better hotel on Dublin we will return soon thanks to all the staff at Brooks Hotel",5,2022,02,07
236,Very nice hotel,"We stayed for four nights (booked via Small Luxury Hotels). We only had breakfast on one day (it was not included in our rate so an additional 12.5 euros per person) - and we didn't really like it that much...

But apart from that, we thought that the hotel was lovely - the bed was extremely comfortable and, importantly to me, it was possible to open the window. It is also very conveniently located. We would not hesitate to recommend it to others and would certainly look to book here again if we return to Dublin",5,2022,02,07
236,A gem in heart of Dublin,"A gem in the heart of Dublin which even in these difficult times has maintained its high standard of customer care. The staff definitely prioritize the customer and although busy still have time for a chat. 
Rooms lovely, food excellent, location perfect and parking at a very competitive rate directly across the street.
This hotel has retained the charm of “old Dublin”",5,2022,01,11
236,A true Dublin home from home,"An absolutely outstanding hotel in the heart of Dublin,  walking distance to all of the major attractions.  Under the expert guidance of Anne , the manager,  Brooks has an exceptional team of happy , knowledgeable and extremely attentive staff who made my stay there an absolute pleasure.  Big rooms with luxurious comfort guarantee a great night's sleep . Fantastic food , an extremely comfortable bar and with a true Dublin legend in Conor the concierge if you need anything  make this an absolute joy to visit . I look forward to returning soon to my Dublin home from home .What more do you need? Outstanding . Thsnk you Anne , thank you Brooks !",5,2021,12,18

Special mention for the concierge, Conor, a true Dublin gentleman.",5,2021,10,26
236,Best location and fantastic staff!,"We have stayed at Brooks Hotel in Dublin at least 15 times and during the pandemic we missed coming to this friendly hotel. It has the perfect location downtown with walking distance to almost everything. 

When you arrive at the hotel there is a very welcoming atmosphere. Our favorite is their concierge Connor, the most helpful guy in the whole world and he makes sure that you have a really nice stay. His greeting when we returned after the pandemic was the warmest (and when we left a few days later we all cried!). We also want to highlight Marvin, a really good concierge suggesting great restaurants, he is also very helpful whatever you need. Oh, I have to add the reception and restaurant staff as well, since they all do a great job. And the housekeeping staff are always so polite too. Looks like I now included them all, and they deserve it. 
But once again; Connor is our absolute favorite, every time I want to put him in my luggage and take him home to Sweden! <3 

The rooms are quiet and clean, maybe not the biggest but big enough since we do not spend so much time in the room during our stays. 

Their Irish breakfast is tasty and has everything you need. 
And do not forget to have a drink in the lounge in the afternoon, so relaxing! 

Brooks might not be the cheapest hotel, but I do not think that you will be disappointed if you decide to stay there!",5,2021,10,22
236,Great Stay,"We were very lucky to stay 4 nights at the wonderful Brooks Hotel in Dublin,  Great location to get around Dublin - everything is within walking distance.  But the highlight of the stay was the staff.  From Anne Kinsella in the Front office who helped us so much even before we arrived in Dublin, to Marvin and Connor at the concierge desk.  Everyone was fantastic.  They introduced us to Robbie Daly who drove us around Ireland for a day and a half!  Hire him!  He knows history and where and what to do in Ireland!  We’d go back in a heartbeat!",5,2021,10,20
236,Fabulous hotel ,"My sisters booked the hotel for me and my friends as I was celebrating a special occasion. From the moment I entered the hotel, everything was 100% perfect. 
The staff are all welcoming and friendly and aim to make you feel right at home.
The rooms are spacious and modern and come with toiletries,  water and a fridge which is very convenient.
I enjoyed cocktails and cupcakes in the bar.
The location is central and in walking distance to many shops, restaurants and bars.
The food in the restaurant was delicious and the service was top class. The brownie is rich and epic. A piano player beautifully serenaded us during our meal.
After our dinner, we moved to the library area which was very comfortable and had plenty of relaxing seats.
There was something for everyone next morning at breakfast, a huge variety on the menu and it was all so tasty.
All my friends really enjoyed their relaxing stay in Brooks and we can't wait to return again. Hopefully,  next time we'll get to visit the private cinema.
Thank you all for a wonderful,  special stay.

236,Quaint Hotel,"This hotel was very nice and in the heart of everything. We were able to walk to all the major attractions and lots of choices of restaurants. The room and bed were nice. The complimentary breakfast was nice and had lots of choices. Two things make this hotel stand out above the others, first they have a quiet room. For those of you have travel a lot you know what it's like to arrive at 9am and not be able to check in until 3 pm. Well the Brooks hotel has a quiet room for you to sit and relax in. It kind of looks like a study with lots of chairs and sofas to relax on, it was great to rest until our room was ready. Second and the best part of the Brooks hotel was the concierge, Connor. He was so wonderful. He was on top of everything and always willing to help, a true gentleman, I would go back to this hotel just to say Hello to Connor.",5,2021,10,04
236,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I just wanted to thank you all for my wonderful stay at the Brooks hotel last month. Your hotel is a gem. 

This was my second stay at your hotel and will definitely come back for a third visit! 

All of the staff were very helpful and made me feel at home, breakfast was delicious with poached eggs cooked to perfection. 
Nice spacious room, with all commodities and plenty of space. 
On the hotel doorstep all the bars, restaurants and pubs you could wish for, excellent shopping with Grafton street and St Stephens Green behind the hotel. 

I didn’t catch everyone’s name, So I thank all of you and in particular:
Sarah and Monika and the reception and Connor for the nice chats and tips.

Can’t wait for my next visit.",5,2021,10,04
236,The Brooks,"The location was fairly central to easily walkable sites and amenities . The staff was professional, quick check in. Great room and bed. 

Restaurant and bar stall very friendly and gave great service.  The food was wonderful.  I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2021,09,29
236,A gem in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel has charm, class and soul in the middle of a bustling Dublin city.

On entrance to the beautiful hotel, we were greeted by the very charming, engaging and personable Conor, which seemed to set the tone for the rest of the team in the hotel who were very gentle, caring and efficient. 

The location is ideal for shopping, dining or entertainment in the Grafton Street area but we still managed to get a great night sleep, regardless of the energy outside on the street.

The rooms were plush and cozy with great attention to detail, such as, grab bars at the bath tubs for safety, adequate mirrors and lighting, security sensor on the doors to let us know if our door wasn't closed properly, mini fridge, umbrellas, just the extra things that make you feel that someone else is doing the thinking for you, so that all you have to do is relax and enjoy your stay.

The little piano bar, was the perfect spot to have a few drinks with friends. Breakfast was organised and calm. The food was beautifully prepared, delicious, hot and fresh, with a great choice on the menu.

I brought 3 friends with me who are now advocates.

In such a tough climate, with the hospitality sector facing many challenges, well done to this team for delivering an outstanding customer experience. ",5,2021,09,26
236,5 Stars in heaven,"We stayed at the Brooks during Sept. 2021. A 3 night stay. At this time a mask is still required and you will need to carry your vaccine card to eat in at most restaurants. 

This was the first stay for us upon arrival in Ireland.  The hotel is well located in the heart of Dublin and is within walking distance of many attractions including Trinity College.  
Bottom line first - excellent on all levels and we absolutely would return for another stay.
Our room was a decent size with all the proper and expected features. Clean with a comfortable bed and soft towels. The restaurant served great Irish breakfast and the service was excellent.   
The staff was very helpful with our questions and other minor matters such as making change for us.  As American travelers we needed a converter - actually a couple with one capable of providing for USB charging.  For those who are driving there's a large parking ramp directly across the street from the Brooks.",5,2021,09,20
236,Best Beds!!!,"The staff are lovely!  But having stayed in 6 other hotels in a week, beds are important. We had a driver guide on our tour of castles and stayed in a different town every night. We walked miles every day. Brooks was our first and last hotel. It's in the city center and you can easily walk to many landmarks. I love Brooks.",5,2021,09,18
236,Excellent,"We have been visiting  Dublin regularly for 40 years and usually stay in one of three 5 star city centre hotels. This was the first time we stayed in Brooks.  We found the staff to be very helpful and professional, the location perfect (with a 24 hour carpark just opposite), and the breakfast efficient and well-presented.  We were in one of the smaller rooms, which was very well appointed.  The nearby streets can be busy with outdoor diners (good to hear the hum of people enjoying themselves), but the window soundproofing was really good.  Will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,08,23
236,Practically perfect in every way. . . . ❤,"From the moment we entered Brooks Hotel we were treated so well.  Our deluxe room was gorgeous and the little plate of goodies to congratulate us was very much appreciated.  Dinner was flawless and so flavoursome and our server ""Alp""?? He was so well trained  and such a lovely person.  The location is spot on, I love  this part of town.  We will definately be back and thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,08,22
236,Lovely weekend away,"Lovely hotel, all staff were excellent and attentive, bedroom was lovely and the bed was huge! Breakfast was very nice and drinks in the residents bar too. Would recommend for anyone to stay here it’s very good and in a great location right in Dublin City centre.",5,2021,08,22
236,A Haven in the City,"We stayed in Brooks for only two nights but will definitely be back. The room was spacious and had all we needed to relax. Even though the hotel is bang in the city centre surrounded by bars and restaurants we ate in the both nights and we’re very happy with the. The staff were very helpful and nice, even offering advice on l amenities that are open at the moment. Would highly recommend and look forward to making a trip to Dublin again soon!",5,2021,08,20
236,Quality hotel,One of the best experiences I've had in an Irish hotel. Friendly staff at reception and a warm welcome from the concierge. We were given a free room upgrade and left our bags at receprion as the room wasn't ready. When we later returned to get our bags and check in we were informed they had been brought to the room for us. A nice suprise. Very central location but so quiet inside you wouldn't even know it. Will return here in the future.,5,2021,08,15
236,Warm welcome,"We booked a night in Brooks to catch up with friends. It was the location that attracted me but the hotel is so much more than that.
I got a lovely warm welcome from staff at reception and on the door. All staff in bar and restaurant are so friendly. It made it a great experience.
Prior to my stay, all questions were answered with great patience. It is hard for all keeping up with C19 restrictions!
The food is great. We enjoyed a lovely dinner. The strawberry and meringue desert was amazing! Cocktails are fab too.
The quality of the breakfast is excellent and served to you at a table while you chat away.
If it’s a catch up with friends you are after, Brooks will make the perfect place in Dublin. The lovely, comfortable rooms are quiet too.",5,2021,08,12
236,Fantastic Hotel ,"Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of Dublin. All the Staff were lovely & very friendly.
The dinner & breakfast were delicious would highly recommend this hotel, in a nice quiet location but close to everything.

",5,2021,08,07
236,Amazing Stay!!,"My friend and I stayed in Brooks Hotels for 2 nights. The staff were extremely friendly, the restaurant is lovely and  the food was amazing( Brownies well recommended) , even with all the covid restrictions we felt safe. A Big thanks to Anne that got us  upgraded to a Junior suite which was really beautiful room with the Balcony. 
Couldn't recommend the hotel more!",5,2021,08,05
236,Brooks Hotel,"We had an excellent stay in Brooks Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful in every way and the standard of food was excellent.( We had Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner.)
I would highly recommend Brooks as a central location for any length of time in Dublin. Also parking at reduced rates is in the Drury car park across the road from the hotel.",5,2021,07,30
236,Home from home in Dublin,"If you want the perfect location in Dublin near Grafton St., at reasonable prices, a great breakfast, a quiet friendly bar, safe convenient ( validated)  parking and being welcomed like family - Brooks is your hotel! The rooms are clean and quiet and the staff are second to none!",5,2021,07,21
236,Central location,"Pleasant average hotel in a great location which was what we wanted. Housekeeping staff very accommodating with every request. Very disappointed with restaurant and food. Ate in restaurant the first evening as it was a bad night weather wise, I would not recommend. Got gnocchi which was swimming in cheese and not a good meal at all. Breakfast was not great either.",3,2021,07,13
236,Fabulous,"Everything was fantastic,room,food, and staff.We did the wine&dine package and couldn’t fault a single thing,lovely ambiance with the pianist. Brilliant parking at a great price. Super location. We will be back.Thanks for a wonderful breakaway.",5,2021,06,28
236,Real Treat,"We can not recommend this hotel highly enough. From first speaking with Anne when making our booking, we felt we were in for a real treat. As soon as we arrived, early check in was facilitated. Reception staff on Saturday morning, June 12th, were very welcoming and friendly. I hadn’t realized how great the location was. We were on Grafton Street within 3 minutes. We had come up from Galway for a trip to Dublin and availed of the dinner, bed and breakfast deal. Fabulous food, a great atmosphere and nothing was any trouble. All the staff we had dealings with (I’m sorry I wasn’t asking names) from arrival to the young man looking after us in the restaurant (beautiful dinner) to departure (again, late check out facilitated) were top class. A great buzz in the general area on Saturday night. I will be staying again, and will recommend this hotel to any friends who plan a night in Dublin....",5,2021,06,20
236,Birthday gift to spouse ,"Given the challenges faced by Covid 19, Brooks hotel really had  fabulous service, a fabulous room, super clean everywhere within, lovely food menu and great drinks. Great location also.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would certainly recommend a visit. ",5,2021,06,13
236,Birthday Bank holiday weekend at Brooks,"Just back from another great stay in Brooks and despite it being their 1st proper weekend back after lockdown, it was our best one yet. We included a dinner and wine package this time as all restaurants and bars in Dublin were take out only, and we had such an enjoyable evening. The food, service and music were great and my husband still raves about the ice cream at dinner and the chocolate plate in our room as a birthday welcome gift!
Customer service was very impressive, and from Conor the concierge, management on duty, reception, restaurant and bar staff, we felt welcome and that all staff were happy to be there. In all areas I overheard at least a few times where they were very thorough in their customer service and as a customer, and a customer service professional, I appreciated the whole experience.
The rooms were even better than I remembered and throughout the hotel the adherence to Covid guidelines and cleanliness seemed top priority. When we were leaving on Sunday afternoon, the lovely girl who'd been on reception all weekend said that she'd see us again soon, and because of that I will most probably book again for the next bank holiday weekend!",5,2021,06,07
236,A wonderful stay at Brooks Hotel,"We staying one night in Brooks Hotel in Drury Street and it was thoroughly enjoyable.  We were a little unsure what to expect with covid restrictions just lifting but from the moment we arrived we were put at ease and found throughout our stay that all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a lovely room and they even managed to give us a view which was totally unexpected. 

The room was comfortable, nicely decorated and spotless. We had a package including dinner and breakfast both of which we excellent. 

The city centre location was great and we took in a number of attractions including the Book of Kells and The Little Museum of Dublin. Both within very easy walking distance as were many other great places to visit, had we only had a few extra days to stay. We travelled in and out by luas and again had we had more time could have used the luas to visit many more places of interest. 

We will certainly be recommending Brooks to family and friends looking to stay in the city centre and also as a great place for dinner. We will definitely return for another city visit in the future.",5,2021,06,04
236,"Fabulous Hotel and Location, Excellent Staff","My son is a medical student and elected to say home due to Covid-19.  We make several trips per week to Dublin so he can attend labs, staying at the Brooks Hotel when needed.   The Staff, Facilities, Food and Cleanliness are all excellent.  The Staff are extremely professional, helpful, accommodating and run a very tight ship.  The menu was limited due to the lockdown but good overall.  The full Irish is great!",5,2021,03,05
236,Wonderful staff in a special hotel,"We had to postpone our wedding due to COVID so we decided to book a stay in Brooks to mark the occasion anyway. The staff all went above and beyond to make it special. The room, food and drinks were faultless. They have great safety measures in place so you know you’re looked after and don’t need to worry about COVID. We loved it so much we’ve decided to make it an annual event. The cinema is a massive plus!",5,2021,01,10
236,Excellent hotel,"Really nice stay, we booked the cinema and watched a movie before having a meal at the restaurant. Would recommend staying here for a city break, great location in the centre of the city, parking available across the road for €12.50 for a full day which is extremely cheap for Dublin city ",5,2020,10,18
236,A hidden gem of the city centre,"There are some far more visible and highly promoted hotels in the city, but this is among the best at it's price point.

Centrally located, the room was modern and comfortable, and we got a warm welcome (including home made cookies). Cocktails in the bar were very good and well priced, and the staff were all very friendly. 

Highly recommended.",5,2020,09,07
236,A nice retreat in the heart of Dublin,"Had a lovely, relaxing and fun stay here with friends. Such a treat to have a staycation in Dublin Fairs City after period of lockdown. We were warmly welcomed & rooms were so comfortable. We had a lovely meal followed by movie in the hotels cinemas. I cant recommend it highly enough.",5,2020,08,23
236,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here last Friday with a few friends. Had a great time! Firstly, to address the whole Covid situation, we felt completely safe in the hotel with their policies and practices. 
The rooms were so lovely, cosy and luxurious. I was delighted to come into the room and hear lyric fm playing on the radio. 
We had booked in for dinner and the mini cinema. 20 large arm chair seats, plenty of room for social distancing. What else would a group of women in their early 40s watch but Magic Mike. So much craic! 
Dinner was fantastic! I'm vegetarian so I'm often disappointed by the meals that I am offered but it was delicious! Breakfast didn't let us down either. The jam was homemade from berries that the chef had foraged himself!!!!! 
The staff are excellent too, so friendly and attentive.
Also the hotel is right in Dublin city centre, really can't fault this place.",5,2020,07,22
236,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I enjoyed a two night stay, our first since the covid restrictions.
We cannot praise this hotel enough, staff, location, food everything was perfect.
We hope to visit again later this year.",5,2020,07,05
236,Mr Murphy ,"Just booked into our favourite Hotel for the 1st time in months! 
Super very warm welcoming and spotless clean & safe room as always!!! 
Great to be back in Dublin’s finest and looking forward to seeing everything getting back to normal....

",5,2020,07,03
236,Great location,"Firstly, this hotel isn't really my style, instead it's quite traditional. The room was a decent size and very clean but a little dated style and decor wise, think early 2000's. bathroom was a decent size and the shower pressure was good too. 
The location is excellent, within a few minutes walk from most attractions and shops in the centre. 
It is a good hotel, just a little pricey for the style of the rooms etc, I don't think I'd stay again.",3,2020,06,14
236,"Great Location! Friendly, helpful staff!",The hotel is located within walking distance of literally everything in Dublin!  This was the type of hotel my husband and I were looking for as we decided on walking this trip!  We especially enjoyed the 'reading room' and the small gym!,5,2020,04,23
236,Great spot,Excellent hotel. Rooms are beautiful and very well looked after. Breakfast was excellent. We were able to get a meal after 9pm - beautiful gnocchi. City centre location but very quiet. Carpark across street with good discount. Highly recommended.,5,2020,03,06
236,"Great Location, Great Staff, Great Room!!","We were traveling with our grandsons (11 and 13) and wanted to stay close to meGrafton Street.  The Brooks is la 1-0-minute walk to Grafton Street  and to Trinity College.  The stop for the hop on/hop off bus is also very close.

To me first impressions are critical.  When we arrived at the hotel, the two receptionists at the front desk were simply awesome!!  We had arrived early and our rooms weren't quite ready and so they worked their magic to find two adjoining rooms that were ready.  (It has been my experience that, in 99% of the hotels I have visited, the receptionist would have told me to come back later!!)  

The receptionists and the concierge were extremely helpful in advising us where and when to travel to see the sights on our bucket list.  The ""when"" is the operative word because the weather during our visit was less than ideal!!

Our rooms were spacious, well appointed and clean.  The bathroom had both a tub and shower which made my wife quite happy!!  My wife was also happy that the bathroom had a hair dryer.

The beds were very comfortable.  More importantly, the thermostat in our room ACTUALLY worked!!!  We could set the temperature lower before retiring for the evening which made for a great night's sleep!!

As for our grandchildren, the one amenity that the hotel offered which transcended all of the other nice things about the hotel was ... the pillow menu!! They were totally and completely enamored of this and are still taliking about it. 

We did eat breakfast in the hotel and, if there was a weak spot, it was the limited  number of choices for breakfast items.  Another nit was that  there were empty trays where breakfast meats and croissants should have been.  (Following our first experience, we ate breakfast at a wonderful cafe around the corner!)

 I would definitely recommend this hotel to travelers going to Dublin.",5,2020,03,01
236,Another lovely stay!,"We stayed at Brooks over New Years but unfortunately were ill so we went back last week and were again looked after so well by Ann and her team. Great breakfasts, a lovely bar area and easy and cheap parking opposite in a central location makes this a perfect city break hotel. The waiter, Sinisa, too, very good care of us and was attentive and helpful. We love it at Brooks and look forward to returning soon.",5,2020,02,25
236,Awesome Hotel ,"Very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are comfortable and the hotel is quiet. The breakfast menu provided has a large selection - I had the Irish breakfast and it was very tasty and plentiful. Close to pubs, restaurants and access to buses. ",5,2020,02,21
236,Brooks hotel,"Another lovely stay in Brooks. This is a great hotel with helpful friendly staff. It is situated in central Dublin and so very near theatres, shops, sites and galleries. The hotel offers a range of comfortable well appointed rooms and good food.",5,2020,02,19
236,"Just book it, brilliant hotel...","I stayed here for 2 nights finishing my tour of Ireland before flying back. From the moment I stepped into the hotel and was welcomed I knew this was going to be great. The room was lovely, the staff were lovely and the location was great, nice walk from Temple Bar, however there are much nicer areas and around the hotel in particular.
Each morning a gentleman by the name of Conor greeted me in reception, a true gent with a very professional and more importantly genuine personality.
I’ve stayed at many hotels across the world and I can  with confidence say this is excellent. I intend to take another break with my wife this summer, and Brooks it shall be.",5,2020,02,18
236,Wonderful hotel,"We booked this hotel for our first time in Dublin and really enjoyed it. The location is fantastic with lots of pubs, restaurants and city sights within easy walking distance. Our flight arrived late in the evening so I emailed the hotel to tell them we’d be late checking in, and they responded saying they would note it down. When we arrived we went straight to our room and although we were on the first floor facing the street it was very quiet. Breakfast in the morning was fantastic with a large buffet selection or cooked breakfast to order, I ordered cooked breakfast both days and wasn’t disappointed.
This will be our first choice for a hotel next time we’re in Dublin.",5,2020,02,17
236,Simply a wonderful hotel and staff.,"The Brooks is one of those exceptional hotels that can make traveling to a city so special. The room, the staff, the ambience, the location -- it's all there. Can't praise it enough.  Wouldn't dream of going anyplace else in our next visit to Dublin.",5,2020,02,13
236,Breakfast well below par,Stayed here (group of 6) in 3 rooms costing €840 in total for one night. Breakfast service was just abysmal- 30 minute wait in all cases and food just about edible. Enquired numerous times to be told “it’s on the way” each time. Very basic bar with a very limited selection of beers and sluggish service. Really expected more and would t rush back.,3,2020,02,13
236,Great hotel in a brilliant location,"Stayed here as a couple attending an event in 3Arena. This hotel ticked all the boxes for us. Location cant be beat, it was within walking distance of the main shopping areas and around the hotel there are plenty of choices of bars and restaurants. Taxi'd to and from 3Arena for the show. Car parking is available in a multi storey car park right opposite the hotel. You get a discounted rate for 24 hour stay (i think it was €11 - which is very reasonable).
Room was well presented, clean and the bed comfy. Only slight negative is the hotel bar, not much going on in it, but with so much on your doorstep there really does not need to be.
Will be recommending to family/ friends and will be returning next time we're in Dublin.",5,2020,02,13
236,Wont find better in central Dublin,"We chose this hotel for its location and we werent disappointed - its near to lots of things we were interested in doing.  We were travelling as a family group for a birthday celebration (60th), needed a triple and a double room.  The hotel staff were lovely.  I had asked for an early check in and the rooms were available when we arrived - just mid morning.  Reception girls could not have been more helpful or more pleasant. 
 The extra treats I had arranged with the hotel were fantastic and we thoroughly enjoyed them!  The rooms themselves were beautiful.  Roomy and spotlessly clean.  Bathrooms were grand too.  The pillow menu is a novelty and the complimentary water welcome!  I love that this hotel has power points at the side of the bed rather than only on or near the desk.  We decided to eat in the hotel too and had a fantastic meal - compliments to the chef.  Everyone really enjoyed their food and drinks.  Breakfast is really good - one of the best Ive had in Dublin -even on par with a couple of 5 star hotels Ive stayed in.  All in all a great stay and we would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for quality across the board in central Dublin.",5,2020,02,12
236,Very good hotel. Location can't be beat.,"Excellent check in and concierge service. Stayed in room 208, which faces Drury Street car park. Soundproofing was good enough to block the noise of the cars, but not quite good enough to block out the drunken revellers on Friday night / Saturday morning. So if you're a light sleeper staying on the weekend, avoid this room. We also had a drunken moron who locked himself out of his room and then banged on our door in his confusion. In fairness, not the hotel's fault—and they kindly extended our check out time as a result. 

Otherwise, the room was great: lovely bathroom with bath / shower. Breakfast is excellent, a cut above most hotels. And the location really is superb. Just a stone's throw from so many nice pubs and restaurant's (especially liked P.Mac's, Sisu, and Masa). 

We would certainly stay again but opt for a quieter room.",4,2020,02,04
236,Great hotel in a great location,"Originally we weren't going to hire a car, but the initial reason for our visit was because I was working in Dublin and decided to make a weekend of it.

I ended up needing a car, so having a car park directly opposite was a big bonus, even though we had to pay (at reduced rates).

The welcome from the reception staff was lovely and we checked in in just a few minutes. 

The room on the 6th floor was spacious and clean. The view wasn't great, as it faces the rear of the property, but we were in a city so expected nothing more.

During our stay we heard no noise from other rooms or the corridor, which is unusual. There was not traffic noise unless we opened the window and the curtains were pretty much blackout, so there was no disturbing light.

The bed was huge and very comfortable. I certainly slept through with no issues, which is probably my most important measure.

A small issue with the sink not draining properly was promptly attended to and we experienced no further problems. Some people think things like that are an issue, but when they are cleared up quickly it's hardly a reason to complain.

There was a really good cold breakfast buffet selection with cereals, fruit, pastries etc., together with a cooked breakfast menu that was really good quality.

Staff in the breakfast restaurant were friendly and efficient,

We really enjoyed our stay here and will return when next in the city.",5,2020,01,27
236,Fantastic ,"We arrived late due to a late flight but we had informed the hotel about this.
We were checked in swiftly and given our room keys.
When entering the room we realised we had been upgraded and was pleasantly surprised.
The room was fantastic and very clean.

There was a party going on in the downstairs lobby and we were worried that we would hear the news in our room.
We couldn’t hear a thing and was very pleased with this.

The breakfast is amazing with a great selection of fruit, cereal, pastries and bread.
Service is very quick and the full Irish breakfast is gorgeous. I especially liked the white pudding.

On our departure day we asked if we could leave our cases after we had checked out and the staff accommodated very swiftly with the concierge taking our cases into safe storage.

We have loved staying in this hotel and will definitely return when we come back to Dublin.",5,2020,01,26
236,Location and Staff,"The location of this hotel is amazing. Many attractions and amazing pubs and restaurants at your fingertips. On top of that, I’d like to give a big shoutout to Conor and the rest of the staff who went above and beyond in helping us with issues we had with baggage arrival from our airline which was obviously not the fault or responsibility of the hotel. The hospitality was second to none!",5,2020,01,22
236,Great Place To Stay,Perfect location. Overnight parking directly across street. Comfortable bar and lounge properly staffed. Efficient Reception. Did not dine here.Excellent local restaurants nearby in walking minutes. Noise level perfect.,4,2020,01,19
236,Great location,"I recommend it, great location, friendly staff.
The  goose pillows are great! 
Unfortunately I’ve stayed in the first floor, probably above some boiler, as it made constant noise. The breakfast is good , shame they do not make omeletes too. Overall a very good weekend!",4,2020,01,13
236,Lovely place ,"We booked in for a few nights for the Christmas days, it was magical the rooms were lovely, everything was just great so relaxing the manager was a wonderful man attentive to all the guests at such a special time of year, Christmas dinner was fabulous and service excellent, been a small hotel the staff are so considerate and have time for customers, as we love fish breakfast was great with great choice of  fresh fish. The pianist made the lounge very relaxing. Overall after always spending Christmas in various hotels this was a lovely experience thanks to the atmosphere and staff.
 ",5,2020,01,07
236,Excellent location,"Stayed for one night. The room was comfortable, well organised, and very attractive.  Mints on my pillow when I returned late at night was a welcome treat, thanks! I've already recommended your hotel to family and friends.",5,2019,12,21
236,Dr,"Fab hotel, brilliant for it's central Dublin location & serene cosy vibe. Excellent personable service, room comfy although the hot/cold stream from the shower was a bit erratic & altered slightly without me adjusting the controls it didn't put me off the hotel such was the overall level of service. Breakfast was way above good, just the simple things like quality of food and lovely surprising flavours - try the porridge, both hot and cold - the standard here reminds me of Kelly's Hotel Rosslare.  The Concierge Conor is the best example of Customer Service I have seen in a hotel, he remembers guests' names & is always on standby to be friendly & helpful, he's worth his weight in gold. All the Reception are lovely too.",5,2019,12,19
236,I don’t know how I could improve it.,"I stayed here for a work Christmas Party and it was perfect. 
Normally the food at these parties is thrown at you and is also substandard. But this was the opposite. Check in was fast and efficient, the bar had a great atmosphere and the service was quick, the room was spotless, well kept and had everything I needed, breakfast next morning was the best I have had in a long time. The location is perfect if you don’t know Dublin, it’s 3 minutes from Grafton Street and the main shopping area. 
Any negatives??
Rooms are not cheap, drink is also not cheap, but you get what you pay for. 
Well worth trying.",5,2019,12,16
236,"Nice place downtonwn Dublin, good starting point for a city tour","Stayed there on a short business trip in the city. The place is comfortable, staff is friendly. My room was a bit noisy, with poor noise insulation from outside (the window did not shut so well), but overall OK. Maybe a buffet breakfast would be faster for the business people. Overall very good, though.",4,2019,12,05
236,Has everything I look for in a hotel like,"letting me have an early check-in, exceedingly helpful people on the front desk, a very comfortable spotless room, wonderful breakfast, and excellent location.  No problems with scheduling a ridiculously early taxi for me and providing a take away breakfast.  Wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy this nice hotel.",5,2019,12,01
236,Really very good for the price,Lovely room— a bit small but very comfortable for 1 person. Bed and pillows extremely comfortable. Friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location. Breakfast was a bit less well done—rubbery eggs and no jam with the toast but I had it my room and it might have been better in the dining room. ,4,2019,11,26
236,A friendly hotel in a central area.,"We had an excellent stay. The staff were very friendly & helpful & the hotel is well situated to Grafton Street, Powerscourt & St Stephens Shopping centers.
The rooms are nicely furnished & comfortable. However one main complaint for such a good hotel is that they still have plastic shower curtains on the bath/shower. If they wish to retain baths surely they could have rooms with baths & other rooms with walk in showers,which are more user friendly.",4,2019,11,20
236,Special Weekend in Dublin,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Brooks Hotel this October.  
It was a special weekend in Dublin to celebrate my mums 70th Birthday 
Nothing i asked for was an issue and mam was so surprised and delighted with the beautiful 'Happy Birthday' plate and balloons that were brought to the room to her. 
The atmosphere, dining and accomodation was just fantastic and we'll definitely be back again to stay.",4,2019,11,19
236,Great Centrally Located Hotel,"I’m happy I decided on the Brooks based on a friend’s suggestion, it is located on a quiet street within easy access to many great restaurants, pubs, and attractions.  I was welcomed promptly by the friendly and professional staff at the front desk.  As I arrived before 9AM I was able to check in and leave my bags until later.   In the meantime I had access to the lounge area, restaurant, etc.   The front desk equipped me with a map and suggestions for the morning.  

My room was clean and spacious, great bathroom, shower, and comfortable bed.  No issues.  The art in the room was interesting as was the stylish and classy décor.  

The concierge was helpful with pubs and transportation to the airport upon my departure.  

Restaurant was good with many breakfast options.  

Bottom line I’m happy I stayed at the Brooks and it will definitely be my first choice when I return.  ",5,2019,11,16
236,Wonderful start of our honeymoon!,We could not have had a better visit. The staff were overly helpful and friendly. The room was immaculately clean. And they surprised us on our first night after dinner with Rose petals on the bed! We had breakfast included on our trip and it was a full breakfast.,5,2019,11,15
236,Super hôtel in the style of yesterday !!,"We spent 2 nights here last week.  We were treated like royalty, but at the same time the service was made with a smile, grace and pride.  It was our first trip to Dublin, but we will certainly return !!",5,2019,11,12
236,"Very nice hotel, well locate, great breakfast","The room are well-equipped, free bottle of water, chocolate in the evening, great breakfast (continental and Irish), great staff (some speak French).
Location ideal to visit Dublin, we walked all the time ! 
Airlink 747 a bit far (taking the tram is necessary after dropping at Bachelor's Walk).",5,2019,11,12
236,Great Hotel,"Our Saturday night stay was extremely pleasant. Our room was to the front of the building but street noise wasn’t an issue.
The room was well furnished and the bed was massive. The usual furnishings could be found here. Hairdryer, ironing board, safe, complimentary toiletries etc. 
The room was very clean too. 
Breakfast comprises of a self service continental style or a cooked to order cooked breakfast. The coffee was good and there was also an abundance of breads jams and preserves. 
Staffing levels were high. Plenty of staff in reception and in the restaurant. 
The location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping or exploring Dublin’s nightlife. Would highly recommend.",4,2019,11,10
236,Love the Brooks,"We have stayed here multiple times and it has always been great. It’s centrally located, clean, and has everything you need (and things you didn’t know you did). Rooms are spacious and beds comfortable. Thank you to Monica in reception for making this one of our best stays. She went over and above, thank you so much!",5,2019,11,09
236,"Excellent Location, Wonderful Staff, Superior Hotel","I chose the Brooks Hotel based on the comments of others and am so happy that I did. First, let's talk about the location. Dublin is a pedestrian city so you walk everywhere. And Brooks Hotel is close to everything yet noise and traffic are not an issue. It is a in a perfectly safe area. Next is the hotel itself. The staff is lovely, especially the deputy general manager, Mr. Matti Reuter, and Hilary, the night supervisor. My flight from the US arrived early in the morning and I was at the hotel before 9:00am. It was too early to check-in especially since the hotel had been sold out the night before. I checked my bags at the front desk and went out to begin my exploration of Dublin. Jet lag eventually took over and I returned to the hotel several hours later with the hope that a room might be ready so I could check-in. A few hours later, around 1:30p, my room was ready and I could not have been more delighted. It was clean, comfortable and quiet. And what I didn't know was that they had upgraded me! For the next three days, this was my home away from home. 

My experience was so positive that I have planned a return trip to Dublin in 2020 and will once again be staying at 
the Brooks Hotel. If you are looking for a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin, I offer my highest recommendation to the Brooks Hotel.",5,2019,11,09
236,"excellent hotel, well located","The hotel has excellent service, the room is large and well appointed and the breakfast has everything to offer and is good to eat. Service at the desk and in the restaurant is great. have stayed there three times in the last two years.",5,2019,11,07
236,Great Hotel - Perfect Location,"Within minutes walking distance from Trinity College, Temple District and main resturant area, this hotel offers top notch service, large, nicely appointed rooms and an excellent resturant and bar. Breakfast can be busy with larger groups overwhelming the staff, but the food, menu options and more formal table service make the wait worthwhile. The Hotel is really good value for money as we felt we got 5 star accomidation for a 3 or 4 star price.",5,2019,11,02
236,A nice boutique hotel for a brief three day stay.,This small but stylish hotel was ideally located for touring Dublin as a visitor. Breakfasts were very good and the staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoy staying in boutique hotels when visiting European cities and the Brooks measures up nicely to others where we have lodged.,4,2019,10,29
236,Great Hotel,"We spent 4 night at the Brooks.  Our room was beautiful and the breakfast great.
The staff was friendly and very helpful.   Its a good location.  Walking distance to lots of fun streets.  

We would definitely book here again.",5,2019,10,26
236,Great Location,"Brooks Hotel has been a regular overnight stay for me during Dublin trips travelling for both leisure and business. Location is great, very easy to get to Grafton Street, Temple Bar if that is your thing and to venues like the Gaiety Theatre and The Olympia.
Parking across from the hotel is handy but tricky to access unless you are very familiar with the route to Drury Street. Lots of  narrow and one way streets. Staff are pleasant and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and a pillow menu. Great breakfast choice but the bar menu is dated and needs refreshing. No views from the hotel apart from the ugly car park but that is a minor quibble. Not a cheap option but good Dublin hotel accommodation is expensive in this area.Public transport bus and Luas trams nearby.",5,2019,10,21
236,"Comfortable, friendly and well situated ","Stayed three nights at the start of our driving holiday in Ireland. 
The room was compact, but nevertheless comfortable, and had everything one needed including full bathroom with bath and shower. It overlooked Drury Street with a picture view of the handsome red brick edifice of the Fade Street shopping arcade (see pic), but there was no issue with street noise. 
It would be difficult to better the situation with most places one would wish to visit in the city centre within comfortable walking distance. 
Staff were unfailingly courteous and friendly and we enjoyed an informative chat with the concierge, Connell, who is able to give lots of useful local pointers. 
Breakfasts are good. Would recommend reserving a table in the outer room with natural light through the street-side windows. ",5,2019,10,20
236,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"The Brooks Hotel is located a few blocks off the main shopping area of Grafton Street, and thus close to dozens of restaurants and pubs as well as many tourist attractions. It is a short walk to the Temple Bar area or Trinity College. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts were all you could want. We stayed two nights at the end of our visit to Dublin and would happily stay there again.",5,2019,10,19
236,"Location, Location, Location","A fine 4 star perfectly located. A nice sized room, but a little rough around the edges. The sink taps were loose; poor water pressure in shower, a broken hook on the back of the bathroom door - all little things that a good walk through by a rooms manager should have identified before the room was available for check in. A little bit too focused on tour groups with a sloppy front desk. When we asked for an extra umbrella to walk through the Dublin  ""mist"" the front desk told us we we were only allowed one per room which precipitated an unwanted purchase and this comment on Trip Advisor - kinda stupid and doesn't make one feel ""the customer comes first"". I would also note that the maid service parks their trolley in one place along the corridor and yes it happened to be in front of our room, which made it very inconvenient to come and go during our five day stay.  I would also note that terrific breakfasts can be had in two cafes just behind the hotel so no reason to suffer a breakie banquet. All in all a perfectly pleasant experience with the location offsetting sloppy management. It's fine, the staff was lovely but a little more effort and training by management to focus on the guest experience would have made it so much better.",4,2019,10,18
236,"GOOD HOTEL, GOOD LOCATION","The Brooks Hotel is an excellent boutique hotel in central Dublin. We stayed there for five nights recently and were very happy with our choice. It is within walking distance of virtually everything a visitor will want to see or do, including historical sites, museums, restaurants, and pubs. The rooms are comfortable and well-furnished. The staff are very helpful. The in-house restaurant and bar are fine, though there are lots of other restaurants nearby. Get the bed-and-breakfast package; the breakfast is quite good. Parking is available directly across the street.",5,2019,10,09
236,Really excellent experience,"I feel bad that I was only here for one night!  The location of the hotel is excellent, check-in was quick and easy, and the room was quiet and comfortable.  The rooms have HVAC which does not seem to be totally common in the area.  The restaurant downstairs is really wonderful for dinner and the breakfast was nice too.  The Concierge was very helpful and knowledgeable and helped me be ready to take the bus to the airport in the morning.",5,2019,10,07
236,60th birthday,"What can I say about the Brooks Hotel? First off, location, location, location. We were in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere. We now know Dublin like the palm of our hand. Great shopping, food, entertainment within walking distance, as well as, history and culture at every turn. The Brooks has excellent staff, food, ambiance, service. GREAT choice as a home base. Still dreaming of the treacle brown bread we ate everyday on the varied breakfast buffet with fresh Irish butter!  

The Irish coffee was superb. Hanging in the lounge after a day of walking around Dublin was so relaxing. GREAT choice as a home base.   Comfy pillows, turn down service with chocolate every night....you guys rocked it! 

May I say to all the folks who work at the Brooks Hotel, don’t ever think of it as a job. You all are so professional, kind, and hospitable. You are helping people to make wonderful everlasting memories! 

Go raibh maith agat ó bhun mo chroí in other words......thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 
",4,2019,10,04
236,Perfect hotel in Dublin! ,"We booked our trip through Costco Travel and this was one of their recommended hotels. From check-in to check out, we were treated wonderfully. The staff was so helpful upon check in. We arrived around 11am and check in is at 4pm. They were able to have our room ready in an hour. This gave us time to walk around and grab lunch while they stored our bags and transferred them to the room when it was ready.  They were also able to provide us with an extension cord for my wife’s CPAP machine. They do offer plug adapters if you need one. There are also many stores steps away if you need anything else. The front desk was also able to reserve cab rides for us as we planned our daily travels. 

The front desk also provides currency exchange for from USD to Euro as well as city maps and recommendations. The restaurant was very good also and I got to try my first Traditional Irish Breakfast which was great. We enjoyed our stay so much that we can’t wait to return! The hotel is in the perfect location where you can explore the multitude of shops, restaurants, and other attractions. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,09,25
236,Loved the Brooks Hotel!,"We recently stayed at Brooks Hotel for 5 nights. It was awesome! The rooms were very comfortable, the bathroom had plenty of room too. The service was top notch. The front desk was so helpful on giving directions and suggesting restaurants. The wait staff was excellent also, they were very attentive and friendly. The breakfast served was excellent, the food served in the evening was also excellent. I really can’t say enough about how lovely this hotel is, I’d love to go back again tomorrow!",5,2019,09,25
236,Great hotel and staff,"We just completed our second stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it. It’s a great location, within walking distance to Trinity College, Grafton Street, St Stephen’s Square and many other places of interest. It’s also right in the middle of tons of restaurants and bars for great places to try while in Dublin. 

The rooms are beautiful and so comfortable. Down to a chocolate delivered to our door in the evenings. The bar and restaurant are also very good, with live piano music playing in the evenings.  We had a delicious dinner one night, and breakfast in the mornings, and all the food and staff were wonderful.  The staff in the bar (Ryan) helped us find a particular type of whiskey we were looking to bring back home from a local whiskey shop. Much appreciated. 

Stay here. You won’t be disappointed.",5,2019,09,24
236,"Yep, still a great place to stay!!","Its been about 8 years, but this is still a great place to stay!  Walking distance to everything, warm staff, super clean, and a great ""haven"" in a bustling town.  The breakfasts are ample...either the buffet or a full on breakfast will fill you all day.",5,2019,09,22
236,Hmmm,"Stayed one night. Staff is friendly, professional. But that seems to be par for the course in Ireland. Great location, yes, you can fall out of bed and roll past six restaurants. It’s pricey though. And that’s the big negative. The rooms are tiny, you must squeeze by just about everything to get to anything. And for the tariff, you gotta do better than plastic shower curtains. The halls are dark, almost gloomy and rather than antique, it just feels old. Elevators are a cozy 30 degrees Celsius.

All in all needs more than a coat of paint to bring it up to well...  more than just passable.",2,2019,09,21
236,"Classy, comfortable, well situated hotel","I loved this hotel. It was our starting and ending hotel for a recent 8 day tour that took us west , south, and back up to Dublin again.

We were welcomed right from the beginning by the concierge, Connor, Colin ? I hope one of those is right! He was so effusive and so enthusiastic about wanting us to get out there and enjoy the many sights of Dublin. Sadly we had just flown on an overnight from the states and all we wanted was to sleep a few hours before meeting up with our tour group. The Brooks was so accommodating. They allowed us to check in early and get that much needed sleep. The only recommendation we were able to take the concierge up on was a visit to St Stephen's Green. And it was well worth seeing. 

Our room was very comforable. The bed was great. The pillows were fabulous as was the ability to select what type of pillow you wanted. 

There were usb ports for our phones and kindles to charge without having to plug in an adapter. There was also a great hair dryer!! Couldn't bring my own without a converter.

Only down side to the room was the bathroom. The tub is a little tough to climb into  and you had to climb in to use the shower. The rim is just a little too high. Also didn't love that the door for the bathroom had to be kept open with a door stop that kept sliding  out from under. But these are minor annoyances.

Breakfast in the hotel was very good. Nice buffet in addition to a nice menu.

The hotel is in a great location to get out and explore the major sites by foot or by the hop on hop bus tours that the concierge told us about.

Finally I loved the fact that when we checked back in after the week we were touring there was a ""welcome back"" note in our room along with a plate of cookies.

Top notch! Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,09,10
236,Amazing place to stay,"I loved staying here. The staff was so wonderful.  I did not encounter a single staff member that was not friendly & helpful. Our rooms were spacious & comfortable. The location is perfect, it’s so close to so many things. I’d definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,09,10
236,Brooks Hotel was Amazing,Fantastic hotel situated in the heart of Dublin's Social and Shopping District ! All Dublins trendy bars and restaurants are on your doorstep ! The hotel itself is stylish and chic and very peaceful for a city location ! The staff were amazing extremely friendly and also willing to help out to make your stay that extra special . Highly recommend,5,2019,09,09
236,Great Staff Made our Stay Memorable,"This staff went over and above to help us in our first days on a trip to Ireland at the Brooks hotel. We arrived from a long overnight flight and were ready to eat a bite of breakfast and check our bags and wander the streets like zombies but they worked to get us in our room before we finished our meal and even comped us the breakfast!  I was blown away.  For sure  I’ve never had such star treatment in the USA .  This was just a preview of how helpful and accommodating the whole staff was during our stay.  They even sent a piece of cake up to my room for my birthday.  
Great location and super comfortable bed also.  I fell in love with a pillow from their pillow menu and they helped me locate where to buy one.",5,2019,09,08
236,Great for business,While in Dublin we chose this hotel as we were having a business meeting and wasnt sure where to go. I chose this hotel as it has a private residents lounge which we asked if we could use. It was ideal and very useful.We had an executive bedroom booked but we were upgraded to a lovely suite. It was very spacious with a large comfy bed. Location was good and easy to get around.,5,2019,09,02
236,Great off main drag easy parking,We arrived midday on a Sunday.  I wondered what Monday would bring.  But our room was on the street side little noise and parking across the street was reasonable.  Staff was very helpful in our choice of sights.  City prices on the food which was better than very good. The beds were comfortable the room temperature was satisfying.  Good selection of charging stations.  The only thing was the shower water temperature was a little erratic.  It is a very quiet hotel for being located so close to the city center. I can't say anything about price because we were in a self driving tour so I don't know exactly the price we were charged.  But it did include the breakfast which was much more then adequate and well prepared.,4,2019,09,02
236,Great Location and Staff,"The hotel location within Dublin was fantastic for walking throughout the city and to several of the main attractions, but it was fairly overpriced for the extremely small room and unsavory view I had.  Staff was terrific... Extremely helpful, kind, and accommodating!!",4,2019,08,31
236,Overpriced,"This hotel is in a great location, but is overpriced for the quality of the rooms. We stayed in a classic double room, and while it was clean, it needed renovation to bring it up to ‘luxury’ hotel standard. The bathroom was very old fashioned, with a shower curtain and wall-mounted hairdryer which was at least 20 years old. There was an additional hairdryer supplied, but this was very poor quality and was in the process of breaking down. The iron was unusable due to years of burnt on clothes stuck to the bottom, and the carpet was frayed badly at the door to the bathroom. All of these things are forgivable in a budget hotel, but at nearly £250 per night excluding breakfast, I feel disappointed. The staff were great however, especially the bar staff in the Jasmine Bar. ",3,2019,08,26
236,Didn't live up to reviews,"When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded (yay!!) however when I saw the room I thought it resembled a standard room in any hotel. The bed was bigger.Room small.Bathroom fine. Shower only. Suited us. The view from the window was 'Keep the curtains closed' Imposing rears of other buildings that matched all six floors of us. Visible grimey brickwork and bins. So if your view matters check if you're at the back because the sky will be all you'll have to look forward to.
Getting ready for bed. I spilled cream on the carpet. But I carry baby wipes. No biggie! You'd think?
As I swirled the wipe it started gathering long dark hairs. I'm blonde. Husband shaved head. It wasn't a place a vacuum cleaner could miss. We had to request iron. None in this upgrade or slippers (a first) but you can request them. Why not have them available alongside the robes that were thankfully present??
Breakfast next morning was faultless and gorgeous and staff efficient and friendly. 
Our room was not worth the 300+ we paid. But! for it's proximity to all the best shops, restaurants and pubs Dublin has to offer. Grafton Street a stone's throw. Then it is worth it. This hotel was probably in its prime 15+ years ago. The stained but cleaned but still stained carpet and those hairs are just not on at that price for 4 star in 2019. Parking is available just across the street in front of the hotel. It is a multi-storey lot so there is plenty of spaces. We paid 12.50 for our one night stay (once the hotel validated our ticket checking out)",3,2019,08,25
236,Outstanding Hotel,"Great Rooms - made us feel at home in another country. Staff was outstanding. 
Service was 100 % - Never wanted for anything. Breakfast was fantistic and very filling.
i will be going back and i will stay at the Brooks Hotel for sure.",5,2019,08,25
236,Great hotel great location,"Having stayed at many hotels over the years The Brooks Hotel in Dublin was a great surprise. Very economical, clean and very friendly staff and one of the best hotel breakfasts we have ever had. Highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,08,21
236,Social trip this time,"I have travelled to Dublin many times for work but have not stayed longer than a night to enjoy the City. We decided to spend 3 nights exploring and chose Brooks Hotel for its location. We were not disappointed, this is a great hotel to enjoy the local nightlife and visit the tourist spots during the day.  Rooms were spacious and well equipped, we even saw Nigel Havers and his wife at breakfast, which was also very good, that's the breakfast not spotting Nigel.",5,2019,08,18
236,Brilliant staff !!!,"Walking distance to most things , quiet, clean, great breakfast..But what sets Brooks apart is customer service...I felt like I was in a bed and breakfast...The staff from Ashley to Helena to Rosa to Genevieve  made us feel like we were visiting long lost friends. Sincere, caring,  funny, attentive....everyone of them is the best!!  And this reflects how good management is to train people to this level of excellence. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2019,08,16
236,Great Hotel and Super Location,Great hotel and it's location is perfect for exploring Dublin.  You can walk pretty much anywhere in the main part of the city from here.  It was quiet at night though.  Many good restaurants and bars in the area.  The hotel bar was also good for a drink.,5,2019,08,13
236,A Lovely Family Break,"We stayed for a few nights last week in two very comfy rooms, which were quiet, well appointed and spacious. We had breakfast each day and had dinner in the bar once, the quality of the food is quite excellent, lovely chips and a terrific club sandwich. Very attentive and polite and friendly service. This hotel is an absolute gem and is well run with seemingly happy staff. We will return for Christmas.",5,2019,08,12
236,Just a bit too much €,"Very nice hotel, high quality accommodations, but, well, I spent over $1,000 for two rooms for two nights (travelled with 21 year old daughter) with breakfast and I have stayed at better SLH hotels for less. I understand Dublin is expensive and the location is definitely a plus, but for example, the climate control was loud and struggled to lower the room temp by five degrees all night. We transferred to the Superior room the second night and got maybe an extra two feet of room length and a very slightly larger bathroom. After the second night, I just couldn’t see paying for two more so we left and got a cheaper hotel. So, on the plus: location and a great bed, I didn’t feel the room size and bathroom size and amenities put this in the value for money category, especially when the ala carte price for the full breakfast was €21.00 for without anything fancier than a traditional full Irish breakfast and no Prosecco or sparkling wine.",3,2019,08,11
236,Ideal with professional Service,"Ideal for a city trip and to discover Dublin. A city-parking is just next door (it does not belong to the hotel). Nice clean rooms, a good bar and a very good restaurant that should be visited more by the guests of the hotel.
The professional employees go out of their way to satisfy an always more demanding clientele.
What we did not like at all, but this has less to do with the hotel, is the dis-respectfulness and rudeness of some American tourists that were very loud and that went to buy coffee next door to drink it in the restaurant of the hotel for breakfast.",4,2019,08,09
236,Fabulous Brooks Hotel,From the minute you walk into Brooks hotel you are spoiled.  The staff are amazing and the hotel is fabulous with a perfect location.  The lounge is perfect if you want a quiet drink away from the chaos of town but you are still in the heart of the city,5,2019,08,07
236,In the heart of the city ❤️,"Having stayed at brooks hotel on a number of occasions it feels like home from home.
Small bedrooms and bathrooms with the best quality fittings, fixtures. Lots of thick luxurious towels, a pillow menu and the comfiest bed,  
Great sleep 
Great breakfast 
Kind and courteous staff 
Can’t wait for my next visit",4,2019,08,06
236,Three days in Dublin,"Very comfortable hotel in the center of Dublin, superb location. Excellent continental breakfast, good snacks at the Jasmine bar. Clean rooms with very large and comfortable beds. I woud suggest this hotel for a visit to Dublin.",5,2019,08,03
236,Great Hotel,We stayed at the Brooks hotel for three nights. It was a great experience and I would highly recommend. The rooms were comfortable and clean but what made the hotel so nice was the friendly and helpful staff.,5,2019,07,30
236,Love this hotel,"I have stayed here twice in the last year and will be back later this year.  Brooks Hotel is becomg my home away from home when I am in Dublin for business.  The location is fabulous, their selection of gins in the bar is perfect for a hotel of this size.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Looking forward to my return visit.",5,2019,07,29
236,top notch boutique hotel,"location , while at first appearance seemed nondescript, turned out to be great. especially for someone like me who has difficulty walking. Hotel is a far cry from your
standard cookie cutter hotel. Breakfast was good, not great. Staff goes out of their way to please and correct any deficiency no matter how minor.",5,2019,07,26
236,More coukd be done ,I had an enjoyable stay. Rooms were clean and well presented. Lots of rubbish - bottles etc. laying around the corridors which gave it an unkempt look. Breafast was only average with the cooked items overdone and hard. Staff were excellent. On the surface it looks good but needs to perfect the product  to merit the 4 star rating it suggests. ,2,2019,07,23
236,Great hotel for wedding party,"We stayed in Brooks Hotel for three nights in April as we were getting married in the city centre. The staff were excellent to deal with; Claire in reservations was so helpful in the lead up to the wedding, and Conor was so friendly, in accommodating our 20 or so guests. There was no request too small and everything was dealt with the utmost professionalism! The suite was a perfect size for the wedding prep and we got upgraded for another night which was a lovely touch. The location couldn't be better, so we could walk to our venue. Thanks to the hotel for making this such a fantastic experience for us!",5,2019,07,21
236,"Great location, lovely hotel","This was a perfect location to explore Dublin on foot. Its a very nice 4 star hotel. Breakfast was excellent, rooms lovely. Staff very helpful and welcoming.  Arranged trip to Wicklow for us through a tour agency. Short walk to my favourite spot in Dublin, St. Stephen's Green. Try Fade street social just around the corner on Fade street- best meal we had in Dublin.",5,2019,07,20
236,"Great spot, great team","From Conor the world’s greatest concierge to the rest of the team we felt welcomed from the time we arrived until we checked out.

A short walk from St Stephens Green, plenty of shops and easy access to attractions, the Brooks was a great choice for a short stay in Dublin. A couple of great pubs on the same block and the opportunity to enjoy a pint, a meal and live music most nights are what you expect in this great city, and even better once you leave there is very little noise carry from any venue to the hotel.

Our room was great with comfortable bed, extensive pillow menu, and a really good bathroom with a separate shower. There is also plenty of storage and hanging space.

Only had breakfast one day but a good menu, decent buffet and not too big.

A really good option in a great spot.",5,2019,07,19
236,Great hotel in a great location,"I stayed at Brooks Hotel in Dublin four four nights. I couldn't imagine a better hotel for the price in this location. It was clean, the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, and the service is friendly and responsive. It is close to great restaurants and venues for tourists, making it easy to pop back to your hotel midday for a nap break or a clothing change. There is very little street noise considering the location.  Rooms that face the back ( not Drury Street) are the most quiet.  I got a good night's sleep consistently. I've stayed in other only modestly less expensive hotels in Dublin that were, not to put too fine a point on it, fleabags, and far less convenient.  Brooks is a great value. Highly recommend.",5,2019,07,17
236,"Great location, helpful service","We were happy to arrive at the Brooks Hotel after many hours of travel. The hotel is in a very central location with plenty of attractions within a short distance, although not directly in the Temple Bar area. We immediately made ourselves comfortable at the pub down the street and found a nice spot, among many options, for dinner. There is a bar a street over for which we could hear the background noise of revelry in the evenings. It was a summer weekend and the Gay Pride parade, so things were particularly festive. The noise really didn't bother us, but helped us know what time it was and reminded us how early we went to bed. The hotel staff was great, particularly Conor, the concierge, who when we were stood up by a tour we booked, he contacted a cab driver he knows to give us an impromptu tour of several smaller towns, mountains and coast near Dublin. He saved the day for us. Overall, we were very pleased and would stay there again. ",5,2019,07,15
236,"Well run, central and great staff",Booked months ago and wasn't disappointed. Great and accommodating staff. The breakfast was lovely and freshly prepared.  The location couldn't have been better. The only reason for the four stars was the rooms were a bit cramped and we could have used a second luggage rack. And the creamer with the coffee maker in the room had expired and curdled.  Small issues. One amenity that was very nice was the complementary use of a phone set up in the docking station in our room. It was enabled for local calls and up to 5 International calls free of charge. I would return.,4,2019,07,14
236,Wonderful!,"This special boutique hotel is conveniently located to everything in Dublin.  The rooms are lovely and the beds super comfy.  On our second visit we received two gourmet cookies and a personal note thanking us for returning, a jester that was not necessary yet much appreciated.   The staff were all very friendly and eager to please. I would highly recommend this hotel if you will be staying in Dublin. ",5,2019,07,14
236,"Great spot, great food and great rooms",This hotel is in the right place. You can walk to anywhere and the service is fantastic. The staff clearly enjoy their work. A couple of minor irritations being a loudly squeaking bathroom door and a sound of continuously running water all night. I assumed that this was an overflowing cistern somewhere in the hotel but there was also a noticeably musty smell in the bathroom. This disappeared when the room was used a few times. All in all the location makes up for the minor issues that in no significant way detracted from our stay.,5,2019,07,13
236,Great Location!!!,"Down the street from Temple Bar District it is the best place to stay if you want a true downtown experience. We stayed here for our Honeymoon and everyone around is SUPER friendly (even a little drunk). It's across from a parking structure and an abandoned cafe that attracts homeless but our 4+ experiences were nothing but delightful (Coming from southern California it's a BIG difference). Smaller room as expected in Europe but a TV setup that allows inputs. The breakfast is a little lack-luster with either the ""buffet"" (Oatmeal, Cereal, basic pastries, etc) or the ""Irish Breakfast"" which included a fried tomato and mushroom, sausage, grilled ham (US interpretation), an egg,  and two rice cakes. It was all OK from an american standpoint. What had me taken-aback was that a glass of milk is unheard of (Found this is across Europe) but you can enjoy the luke-warm juice they have to choose from if you are over 30 minutes late to breakfast. I would recommend eating out for breakfast BUT WAIT! Their Francesca's restaurant is UNBELIEVABLE! We loved it so much we ordered room service a few days later with the same order (Club Sandwich Deliciousness). 4/5 Only because of breakfast spread. Staff was awesome!!!!",4,2019,07,12
236,Wonderful hotel!,My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Brooks Hotel in May 2019. The hotel was lovely and the room was quite large. The staff were always very friendly. The hotel restaurant made a tasty beef & Guinness stew and the breakfast had a good selection. We also appreciated the little extras like the pillow menu and mini foot spa. The location could not be beat; perfect for sightseeing in Dublin. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future!,5,2019,07,11
236,Great experience!,"We would definitely recommend this hotel! All of the staff were consistently friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The lobby, restaurant, and room were beautiful, clean, polished and modern. I was thrilled to even have a little, live plant in our room near the window. What a nice and unique touch! They offer a complimentary pillow menu, which was nice. The breakfast food was wonderful, and they provided several gluten-free options, including toast. Location was great. Our only complaint would be that the gym consisted of 2 pieces of cardio equipment and some weights; all squeezed into a small room without any windows. Everything else was great!",5,2019,07,09
236,I’ll be back!,"I booked Brooks very last minute as I was traveling with a friend but I have to say from the minute we checked in, it was so pleasant! The receptionist was warm and friendly, the room was perfect! Absolutely loved the decor! It’s in the perfect city centre location and the staff were so helpful for directions and suggestions! Breakfast the next morning was so lovely! Large selection of fresh fruits and breads on the buffet and the full Irish from the kitchen.. Devine! Couldn’t recommend it more! I’ll be back!",5,2019,07,09
236,Relax,We chose to stay in this hotel for the consistent service we receive every time we visit . Nothing is too much trouble for the staff . So convenient for shopping sights that this city has to offer . Excellent room service and especially love the bar area to just chill and catch up on the daily newspapers . ,5,2019,07,09
236,Lovely hotel,"We stayed 3 nights at the Brooks hotel. The location was superb. The hotel room was spacious and  the bed was so comfortable. The shower was also the best one I had in my 2 weeks in Europe. Conor the concierge was extremely helpful!!!!
The girls at the front desk were also so helpful to all our needs. ",5,2019,07,09
236,Great Location for Temple Bar area,"The room was very comfortable and clean, not large but very adequate.
It is a great location for restaurants, pubs and bars in the Temple Bar area.

the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful with eating suggestions.  The hotel restaurant is also good quality food.",5,2019,07,08
236,Conveniently located,"This is a hotel with a great location. We stayed there for 5 nights at the beginning of our trip and 1 night at the end. The rooms are on the smallish side. I am tall and had to high step into the bathtub so if you are short or have problems with mobility- good luck. Bathroom amenities were great. Our first room on the second floor seemed to have more plugs than our second room, and again on the second floor. 

It could be me, but I had a hard time getting consistently warm water in the shower. It was either too hot or too cold. 

The breakfasts are phenomenal with a huge assortment of foods sure to please the most discerning guests. The hotel itself is clean. 

The staff was attentive and helpful. 

I would recommend this hotel. ",4,2019,07,08
236,Good Hotel,"We had a cosy double room which was plenty big enough, although the double bed was 4'6 which was fine for us but some may prefer king size beds. The room and the hotel was very clean. Breakfast is very good, a plentiful buffet with lots of choice. Good selection  of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, three types of bread, cheese, pastries, etc and a good choice of cooked breakfast. All served by friendly staff. The bar is a nice relaxing area, with a good bar food menu. Food in the bar is very good, we did not try the restaurant, but no doubt the food would have again been of good quality and well cooked. I would have liked the bar menu to have specials on each day as being vegetarian choice was a little limited. Bar staff were very helpful and friendly. Reception staff were not very friendly, on arriving or leaving. When we came to pay our bill we were not asked about our stay just asked to check the bill was ok and payment taken. However the gentleman that helped us with our cases did ask if we had a good stay. I recommend this Hotel, it is very central and the prices are very reasonable for what is provided. We will definitely return.",4,2019,07,05
236,First Night in Dublin,"Our hotels were all booked through Costco Travel.  The Brooks Hotel was our first stop.
We arrived mid-afternoon and our room was readily available.  Staff is friendly, check-in and out both went smoothly.  Nice location - short walk to the Temple Bar area.  Breakfast was included.  Overall value - very good.",4,2019,07,04
236,Great Place to Stay,Great staff.  Very comfortable rooms.  Marvelous location in the middle of downtown.  Get the B&B option to reduce the cost of breakfast.  Most of the sites are within a 30 minute walk.  Pubs and restaurants are too numerous to count.,5,2019,07,01
236,Fell way short of ringing reviews,"We arrived at the Brooks hotel having changed our reservation from another hotel only to pay $50 euros more a night for a disappointing experience.  Yes, we paid more for location which was fabulous but the breakfast staff were atrocious - we waited one hour from the moment we sat down to when our hot eggs from the kitchen arrived one morning. So much for an early start to our day!  Both mornings we waited 10-15 minutes for our first cup of coffee /tea (which you cannot serve yourself) - perhaps it was harder because of jet lag but also delivered with no friendliness. 

Rooms were clean and functional; Collin at concierge desk was fabulous.   Think again before you book here.",3,2019,06,28
236,Wonderful stay for our family,We stayed here for two nights with my parents (70s) and it was just great.  Beds comfortable - breakfast was lovely -  the location is superb.  You are close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar but far enough away from the noise and traffic. My folks left their passports in the room safe and the hotel kept them safely for us until we could return and retrieve them.  We are so grateful for that! You should have no concerns about staying here whatsoever.,5,2019,06,28
236,Great property in the best location,"My family and I stayed at Brooks Hotel in May and absolutely loved our time there. With younger children, it was incredibly handy to be so central to everything to avoid too much walking. The rooms were very clean and well equipped and the breakfast each morning was fantastic. Would absolutely stay again.",5,2019,06,27
236,Central location for after dinner drinks.,"Haven't stayed at this hotel but have called in for drinks a number of times. The lobby/drinks area is smart, with a great whisky selection on the menu. Central Dublin location and a talented pianist last time we visited!",4,2019,06,22
236,Wonderful hotel!,This is a great hotel located close to Grafton Street. It is very easy to walk to most tourist sites from this location. Nicely appointed with comfortable beds. The staff was very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,06,22
236,Highly recommend for any visitor to Dublin ,"Would highly recommend Brooks Hotel to any traveller to Dublin. We stayed with our 8 month old baby - great location to explore the town with everything being convenient to return to the hotel when needed, without being in the thick of the noisy pubs and bars. 

The baby cot provided was clean and in good condition - and The Hairy Lemon next door was great for a pub meal with a little one. Turn turn service in the evening was a nice touch. 

Also recommend Sprout at the end of the street for the most delicious salads 

Parking is across the road in the public carpark - discounted rates for staying at the hotel. 

Special mention to Connor who really made our stay there! 

Would recommend to any family and friends travelling to Dublin. ",5,2019,06,19
236,Good location but what a shower,Superb location for all things to do in Dublin. Nice rooms although air con made noises but not a lot of cooling. Nice comfy bed so all in all very good. Biggest problem was the shower. It was never more than a dribble. Other than that you’ll do no worse than book here.,3,2019,06,15
236,In the heart of Dublin,"Great hotel. Stayed here a few times - right in the heart of all the (nice) bars, restaurants and shops, walking distance to all the sites. We had the standard double, it's not huge, but it's fine for a quick trip. It's worth the money for the breakfast alone but a few things to make it better - better tea/coffee facilities in the rooms, maybe dressing gowns too please!",4,2019,06,14
236,Wonderful stay...,"We stayed here with a small tour group.  Location is great.  Not downtown but close enough.  Outstanding service, the staff just seemed to adopt us, offering all kinds of helpful advice.  Meals in the hotel were excellent as was the service from the bar.

If I was coming back, I would stay here.",5,2019,06,13
236,Enjoyed it.,"Very nice public areas and room; great location in walking distance to everything. Room perhaps a little small and a little over priced, but for a very nice hotel in the center of a European city, not bad. Our room overlooked the parking garage across the street, so not ideal.",5,2019,06,13
236,Awesome Hotel,"The Brooks was one of the 8 hotels we stayed at around the country, when we visited this summer. It was top in our list of favorites. Comfortable, clean, accommodating, and a wonderful staff. Of all the things we did in two weeks, my 8 yr old’s favorite part the entire trip was “Connor”. Our greeter at Brooks who helped us with bags, information, and settle in to the hotel. That says a lot that he made such an impression! Great experience.",5,2019,06,12
236,Great location.,Located right in the middle of downtown Dublin. Walking distance of shops and restaurants and bars near the popular temple street.  Breakfast was good which was included.  Rooms were clean.  We had 2 rooms.,5,2019,06,09
236,Liked it a lot!,Wonderful central location for sightseeing in Dublin.  This is an old world style hotel that has upgraded and very well appointed rooms. The staff are very friendly and helpful with recommendations.  An excellent full breakfast was included.  The pub next door (the Hairy Lemon) has super food and often great music as well.,5,2019,06,08
236,The best of Irish hospitality in a great location!,"We tried to book this property several months in advance and it was booked solid.  Our travel agent, Lois Farley, kept in touch with the hotel by phone and and managed to get us a reservation for four nights.  From the moment we checked in we started to sing Lois' praises for her persistence, and, now home, we continue.  Because of the difficulty booking, first mornng we set out to look at other hotels thinking on our next trip Lois might not be able to work the same magic and a back up would be prudent.  We looked at less expensive hotels, hotels in the same price range, and two very expensive ones and decided nothing was anywhere near as good as the Brooks.  Rather than fitting a hotel to our air reservations, next time we'll simply book the Brooks whenever we can and then find flights to match.  

As you'll have guessed, we loved the Brooks.  It was class without being stuffy, the room was large, excellent bedding and towels, wonderful room attendants, shirt laundry so perfect I wish I could send my shirts there from here, and a breakfast that made it worthwhile manditory to get out of bed in the morning  ----  and for me there is no tougher test than being lured off my pillow, much less eagerly up and heading for breakfast.  

On top of this the staff was, without exception,  ..... well, exceptional.   For example, when we checked in we were shown to our room by Michael.  I noted, in jest the room was great except my computer cord wasn't long enough to reach the socket and still allow me to lie abed doing email.  Bingo!  Minutes later he was up, to my everlasting joy, with an extension cord so I could lie abed (I think I mentioned my love of my pillow) and email home.  And, Michael wasn't the first.  Before we arrived, via email, Concierge Marvin Omolon helped us find the Gaiety Theatre, just steps away, where we saw a wonderful play our second night.  I wish I remembered the names of the helpful people on the desk, the staff who remembered, right from the first morning, how we liked our eggs and the lovely ladies who looked after our room.  They were all excellent.  

We'll be heading back to Ireland first chance we get.  The month isn't a big deal.  Having the Brooks to stay at in Dublin is!",5,2019,06,05
236,Great Experience in Dublin,"We thought this hotel was an excellent value.  The room was quiet and very comfortable .  Our only issue was the shower which was inside a tub with very high sides.  If you have issues with mobility it will be an issue. 
The breakfast, which was included, was excellent with a buffet as well as a menu of specially cooked-to-order items including a full Irish breakfast.  The hotel is centrally located and an easy walk to Temple Bar etc.
Our favorite part of our stay was arranging for a special tasting of five Irish whiskies at the hotel bar one evening.  The bartender was fantastic and we learned a lot. The whiskies were great too!😃",4,2019,06,05
236,Small but good,"We chose a deluxe room at Brooks and, although the room was on the small size, being somewhat cramped by the inclusion of 2 armchairs and a table in the bay window and fairly dark, we were quite comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the ample space available to store our clothes.
Situated on the edge of the Temple Bar area of the city, pubs and restaurants are within easy reach, but we ate snacks in the bar of the hotel on 2 occasions. These were relatively inexpensive and very tasty. Of note, they were served by excellent staff, which marked the hotel.",4,2019,06,05
236,Great Location - Excellent staff,Very nice hotel in the center of everything. Let us check in early after just getting off the plane from the US. Could walk to almost any site we wanted to see. The restaurant is good with selection for vegetarians as well as non- vegetarians. The staff was professional. The rooms were comfortable and clean.,5,2019,06,05
236,"Disorganized and inconsistent information, but overall good location","The Brooks Hotel is in a great location. Overall the quality of service for this hotel is mediocre at best. From the time of check-in, nobody seemed to be extremely helpful. I would expect this at another hotel that's cheaper, but this hotel is not cheap. I had to ask about parking and breakfast. I got up to the room and tried to call room service, housekeeping, or the front desk by pushing the pre-defined buttons on the phone and got no answer. I then had to go down to the front desk and ask them for some ice, I was told to go to the bar. I reiterated that I wanted a bucket of ice in our room and they said room service would bring it up and I could call them from our room. I let them know I tried that and the phone doesn't work and they called the room and my husband answered, when I explained that it was the pre-defined buttons that clearly weren't programmed, she told me that I could just dial 0 to reach the front desk and I should read the guest guide that's in the room. Side Note: I happened to glance at the guest guide and it's about 57 pages long. I am not going to read the guest guide to figure out how to call down to the front desk, to top it off, on the phone itself, there is a sign that says push 2+ Guest room #, and Dial 0 for emergencies. Dial 0 for emergencies would not = call the front desk, but sure enough I went back up to the room to find the phone instructions and found instructions that said dial 0 to reach front desk and dial 0 to reach reception. Someone should clearly update the phones and signs on them to indicate accurate information. I have never had to work so hard for a bucket of ice. When they guy showed up at the door, he had a beer glass full of ice. I explained that I wanted a bucket, and he said he wasn't sure if they had any. My husband and I just said forget it and went out to a pub.
Overall the room was clean, the bathroom had great amenities and the bell hop was very helpful and polite, but the breakfast was not that great, the continental selection was poor, the water glasses only held about 4oz and I never received the toast I ordered.
Great parking location, it's directly across the street. Just don't try to come to the hotel during rush hour 5 o'clock traffic. It takes forever!",3,2019,06,04
236,Nice hotel with a great location,"Stay two nights while in Dublin. Overall, very good experience. Rooms are clean and well appointed. The staff was accommodating and pleasant.  The bar is definitely worth a stop and the breakfast is first-rate. We had dinner at the restaurant our first night and it was a mediocre experience. The food and the service were fair, not the highlight of our stay.  Recommend exploring the city as there are some amazing restaurants for lunch and dinner and of course lots of pubs with traditional Irish music.    ",4,2019,05,30
236,perfect location,"A sweet spot located in the best part of town. You will not be able to visit all the places just steps away. Staff here is friendly and helpful. I had a room at the back of the hotel, so it was very quiet. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2019,05,29
236,disorganized check out and meh room service,"this hotel is on the higher end and smack in the middle of Dublin near Gafton Street so I expected top notch service.  I got it when I checked in as I was able to get to my room early which was nice.  The room was nice and clean but the room service was lack luster.  Some of the food was really good, like the soup, but the rest of it was blase`.

Check out on the other hand was a disaster.  The lady at the counter kept insisting that I stayed in a different room number and she was so insistent that I almost said ""sure that was my room"" but in fear that that person had a nicer/more expensive room than me I stuck to my word --even though the meter was running on the cab outside (as they had called me one when I first started the check out process).  

She finally found the paper work on the room she had checked me into and the room service bill --which I thought had already been charged to the room---so now, I had to give my credit card again and wait for that to process because their credit card machine was slow but that's not their fault.  

She was also the same person who checked me in and I realize they deal with a LOT of people but I've stayed at hotels before where they remembered me from check in.  Anyway I would have given a higher score if the check out process hadn't been a clusterF

Also, this hotel doesn't have a lot of extremely distinguishable land marks around it and Dublin streets are notoriously gnarly so when you leave get a good look around to make your way back.  I used the building with the red roof as a bit of a guide back to the hotel.  It's within short walking distance of Molly Malone statue and Trinity College so for proximity sake it's a good spot.  
Just--don't be in a hurry to check out.",3,2019,05,27
236,Loved this hotel!,"We loved this hotel! The location was terrific, in the center of town but on a small street, so it was quieter then being on a Main Street. The people were incredibly nice and so helpful. We had special dietary needs and the chef and his staff took very good care of us. One waitress was exceptionally welcoming and brought us some special food from the store, everyday! The people at the front desk were wonderful, very friendly and gave us great advice for the city and for touring around the country. The room was very comfortable. We would absolutely stay here again., the service was incredible!",5,2019,05,26
236,Great day at Hen party,Lovely day here for low key hen party. I don't think they would do wild parties. Very nice hotel with lovely staff .Prosecco and finger food was lovely. Private cinema a great idea. Had 3 course set menu in restaurant delicious.A very nice visit.The only downside was where we gathered for the prosecco the tables were too small and people did not mix.,4,2019,05,23
236,Top of the lot!,"To begin, a HUGE thank you to the unbelievable management team at the Brooks.  Starting with Ashley who greeted us at 5AM upon arrival to Helene who helped organize our departure, the Brooks has assembled a delightful staff.
Like many, we arrived very early and unfortunately had to wait a bit for our rooms.  However, there is a very comfortable Lounge available where we could refresh and even nap.
We were booked into Evecutive Rooms of which there are only two (adding to our wait on checking).  It was lovely-very large bedroom with a balcony and a bathroom with double sinks and plenty of room for toiletries and makeup. My only recommendation is the need for more drawer space or an additional luggage rack.  Amenities are top notch and plentiful.  There is nightly turndown service with chocolate and fresh water. A mobile phone is even provided free of charge for use during our stay. The bed was comfy.....really no complaints!
I poked my head into a standard room and thought the size of the room was quite good...almost similar to a standard room in a US hotel.  The standard bathroom was smaller, of course, with a single sink and less counter space but not “teeny”.  Amenities and decor was equally nice.
Location is outstanding if you want to be in the center of town.  It gets noisy in the neighborhood on the weekends so if you need to be in a perfectly silent space for sleep...do not take a room in the front of the hotel.....there is noise until the wee hours.  But it is not terrible compared to other places I have stayed and our room may have been less soundproof because we had a balcony. (The trade off was worth it for us!)
We did not book hotel breakfast but instead paid for the continental buffet breakfast in the hotel on a daily basis..the buffet is only 6.5 euros for hotel guests as opposed to the hot breakfast at 12.5. Both were excellent so it depends on your preference and this provided us a choice. By the way, breakfast in the local spots will cost more.
Although the exterior of the hotel and the lobby  is somewhat nondescript and lacks the elegance of say, the Shelburne, the quality of the hotel, the service and the accommodations are anything BUT nondescript and are equally top notch. I was thrilled with our choice and with our experience at the Brooks.

",5,2019,05,20
236,1st Night in Ireland,"We stayed at the Brooks our first night in Ireland.  Very nice hotel.  Comfortable beds with pillow menu, super clean and very helpful, friendly staff.  Central location, nice atmosphere.  
We would definitely stay again.",5,2019,05,19
236,Super location for a short stay,"Only had the one night here, but would say for a short stay it's a very nice hotel and that the location is perfectly central and gives you access to all Dublin has to offer.

The rooms are lovely (although the bed is very high up for some reason) and the staff very engaging, welcoming and happy to give you some good tips (as one did giving us the Little Museum of Dublin).

Breakfast was included and certainly very nice. Solid full Irish offering and a nice continental buffet. Didn't otherwise eat or use any of the facilities available so can't comment, but as a place to stay it was perfect for what we needed. Location is the key to this hotel. Easy walk to Temple Bar, St Stephen's Green and a vast amount of really nice restaurants and bars within 5 minutes (too many to cover in a month, let alone a weekend!).

If you're driving, the parking is across the road and an overnight will cost you 12 Euros.

Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,05,17
236,Very nice hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed here for the night. We enjoyed our experience very well. We were worried the location might be a little out of the way, but it was not. We found it was in a fantastic area, and it is within walking distance of many attractions. Guinness and Jameson tours are less than 20 minutes away. There are stores in the area if you need/ forget anything, as well as a great selection of restaurants within 5 minutes walking distance. We wanted something just outside of the temple bar, which is about a 5 minute walk away, along with trinity college, so it was perfect. The breakfast was good and the bar/lounge is great for a relaxing drink in the afternoon and a night cap after a day of site seeing. The accommodations in the room exceeded our expectations. Overall, it was a great experience.",5,2019,05,16
236,Great Hotel,This is on of the best Hotels in Dublin city .Great service very  friendly staff  and always ready to help . Wonderful atmosphere in the hotel lounge best collection of whiskeys and gin. Brooks is perfect for shopping close bye to all the shops in Dublin ,5,2019,05,10
236,Life saver,"Very nice place.  Definite value.  Centrally located; nicely-appointed rooms.  Concierge was a life-saver.  Tooth broke (crown fell out), and concierge found a nearby dentist who was competent, fast and affordable.  Later the same day.",5,2019,05,09
236,First visit to Ireland,"Check-in was fast and a pleasant experience.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful.  The Manager Ann made a special effort to introduce herself and chat with us, making us feel at home.  We did have an issue with the hot water in our room, which was investigated immediately.  Ann offered to move us to another room, as the problem appeared isolated.  Unfortunately, we returned to the room fairly late in the evening, so decided to stay put.  We were pleased however at the kind gesture.  The hotel has nice clean rooms, comfortable bed, nice bar/lounge area, and is well situated in the heart of downtown.  We had a very pleasant stay.",4,2019,05,08
236,Family celebration,"Fantastic. Very nice room, very good staff. Excellent food and very good attention to detail. We were attending a family celebration which included a private viewing in the hotel cinema, which includes extremely comfortable seating and popcorn",5,2019,05,07
236,A hidden gem in the centre of Dublin,"We stayed for a family celebration (four of us)  the hotel is just of the main shopping area of Grafton street, a short stroll to restaurants, pubs and the buzz of the city . You feel pampered in Brooks, it obviously has return custom (as we were) from the greeting staff gave people. Reception and the concierge are so helpful with any questions you may have. Rooms are very comfortable and I had a great sleep.",5,2019,05,07
236,Close to shopping and restaurants,"The hotel is located on a small, busy side street. Although we were to early for check in, the staff was eager to keep our luggage, so that we could go out and explore!  It is within walking distance of Temple Bar, and shopping.  Service was efficient and friendly, and rooms were clean.  Excellent breakfast! ",4,2019,05,07
236,Location,This is a really good hotel with great location.  Right in the heart of it all with very nice clean rooms.  Everything is up to date and you'll be very comfortable in this hotel.  We use this for a lot of golf guests playing in the Dublin area.,4,2019,05,06
236,Cant wait to visit again,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks hotel in April 2019. The hotel is a short walk from where the bus drops you off about 5 mins walk. The hotel is right in the middle of everything, loads of restaurants and bars in any direction you turn. The room was clean and comfortable, check in was a breeze. The ladies at the front desk were always super friendly and helpful. The restaurant is to die for, we had some amazing food there. Also the staff is very friendly and efficient. The chef even stopped by one evening to have a chat with us.I will definitely be returning to the Brooks on my next visit.",5,2019,05,06
236,Died and gone to Guinness!,"Brooks hotel has it all! Location is the best! Walk out the door to the right , 2 blocks and shop gafton st. To the left Christ church, castle, shopping and bars. Round the corner and down 3-4 blocks and your in temple bar scene- more bars! This city is like Greenwich village in NYC on steroids! Area is totally awesome. The Hotel staff is out of this world helpful and now right nice. Room is beautiful and eat off the floor clean. I want to come back again, soon!!!",5,2019,05,05
236,Comfortable ,"Well placed for business or tourist visitors. Clean, comfortable, well maintained rooms. Friendly, helpful, efficient staff. Adequate food and breakfast. 

BUT the loud piped music in the public areas is outdone by the pensioners’ favourites plonked out by a pianist on weekend evenings. The city excels in live music. Surely they could do better than this.  ",3,2019,05,04
236,"Great Location, beautiful hotel!",We recently stayed for four nights at the Brookes Hotel.  We were made very welcome by all the staff and had an amazing stay.  We had a problem with our shower and when the issue couldn't be rectified there was no hesitation in upgrading us to another room. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a central location and and a comfortable stay.,5,2019,05,04
236,Great place to stay,"Really handy location with a great feel in the streets surrounding.  We were right at the front and had no issue with noise.  The room was well presented and nice touches with services provided such as a turndown service, availability of different pillows to aid sleep. 

I left my wallet in the safe and was contacted once this was discovered as I hadn't even realised myself because of travelling; the staff contacted me and after filling out a form to allow payment for postage it was sent to me. 

I can't thank the staff enough for forwarding it on #lifesaver.  The only down point was the cooked breakfast, I've had better in cheaper hotels but it was ok but just ok.

The staff are a credit to this hotel!! There is really handy car parking right out the front, just double check which one you book as there are two!",5,2019,05,01
236,Confortable and well located,"To explore Dublin we chose a well located hotel: Brooks Hotel, at Drury St., just one step from major attractions. We've explored on foot St Stephen’s Green, The Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and many others top points of interests. After a day of walking tour our Classic Room offered all we needed. Confortable bed, many kinds of pillows, clean bathroom with bathtub and toiletries. Although the street is very calm, there was a small noise through the window, and I couldn’t understand why, considering it has double glass seal… Something got all my attention: the hotel offered a free cellphone with internet for guests hold during their stay. We appreciated very much because we didn’t have a local SIM card.",5,2019,04,28
236,Disappointed ,"Purely choose this hotel for location as we were viewing the Uni for my daughter and attending a concert at 3arena.   Most of the reviews said it was on a quiet street which it was.  It was rather a basic hotel, in need of a good refurb but easy to walk everywhere, 10 minutes to Christchurch Uni, 5 minutes to Grafton Street and 35 minutes walk to 3Arena.   Bathroom was extremely disappointing there was no heat source in it, no underfloor heating or heated towel rail and it was freezing.   So as a result when you had hot shower the mirrors steamed up and remained like that for a few hours.   As a result of no heat we had no choice but to get new towels every day instead of reusing as we normally would do as nowhere to dry them.   Not very environmentally friendly I would have thought.   The shower was over the bath and if you are tall (I’m 5ft 11) then you cannot stand under the shower you have to bend your knees in order to get the shampoo off your hair.  On a plus side the bathroom had white company products.   The rooms were clean, beds very comfy and there was a pillow menu.   We were given an upgrade on check but the view was of an air conditioning duct at rear of hotel.     As I mentioned hotel in quiet location so no noise from noisy bars it was a shame though that our whole 3 day stay was disturbed by a baby crying in nearby room morning noon and night so didn’t particularly like the fact of being wakened at midnight then again at 5am and when we did doze off to sleep again were wakened on the three mornings by the maid at 8am who insisted on parking her cart right outside our room even when cleaning rooms further along the corridor.   She’d walk back and forwards rustling bags and bottles on her cart.   Every day she did this I mean how simple would it have been to move the cart to the room she was working in?!    Breakfast was included in our room rate we tried it the first morning and it was such a terrible disaster didn’t bother going back.   On the morning we did go it was full of an American tour group all shouting at each other about their plans for the day.  The waiting staff were so busy with them that I had to ask 3 times for my daughter’s pancakes, as they forgot.    Not being a big breakfast fan I usually opt for coffee and pastry.   The croissants  and banana loaf were brick hard and unedible, have no idea how long they had been lying out uncovered.   The coffee was bitter and no milk was given for the coffee despite asking numerous times.   I ended up trying to just get some milk from semi skimmed milk jug at the cereal station but it was empty and again despite asking for the jug to be filled it wasn’t until 9 minutes later.   not a good experience and didn’t bother with breakfast again.    Lots of independent coffee shops in the street which serve delicious coffee and soft pastries even if Starbucks your thing there is one right next door to hotel.   Would I go back to this hotel - probably not.",2,2019,04,23
236,Ireland trip,"I enjoyed this hotel on our Ireland trip, the food was good, the rooms were fine.  The elevator was quite small, but it worked fine.  The rooms were nice and comfortable.  The staff was fine as well.  The location was excellent and provided us the opportunity to walk to a variety of entertainment.  I would easily recommend this hotel for someone staying in Dublin.",4,2019,04,23
236,Better than expected.,The hotel was situated right down town and across the street from a very convenient car park. Wonderful accommodations. Overshadowed only by the excellent staff and friendly service. Highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Dublin.,5,2019,04,22
236,Perfect location,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights for our first trip to Dublin. The location was absolutely perfect, minutes from Grafton Street, St Patrick's Cathedral and plenty of bars and restaurants. Bus stops are close by and within a short walking distance and the staff were so welcoming and friendly. The staff kept our bags for us when we arrived early in the morning so we would not have to take them around all day before check in and kept them until 5pm on the day we left after check out. Plenty of choice for breakfast and such friendly staff. We will definitely be recommending this hotel to all of our family and friends.",5,2019,04,16
236,Ideal venue for large group meal,"We recently gathered for a reunion lunch at Brooks.  As some of us had not met in person for many decades we needed a relatively quiet area which allowed some freedom of movement, and a menu that was reasonably priced but with options, as some were travelling to attend at considerable expense.  From my first enquiry (online), Fiona was extremely helpful, even to arranging a particular main course for one person who required a non-dairy, vegetarian meal.  Responses to my emails were prompt.  On the day, we were given the dining area to ourselves for 4 hours.  Reception and catering staff were friendly and helpful. Service was efficient but not intrusive.  All of our group would be happy to return.",4,2019,04,15
236,Great boutique hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our vacation. We loved it. The rooms are clean, comfortable and the hotel staff helpful and courteous. The hotel is conveniently located close to many tourist sites. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,04,13
236,Exquisite - A Perfect Stay in Every Way,"So welcoming and relaxing — even had a choice of five different pillows to suit any particular need.  The room was gorgeous and there was no skimping on the amenities.  The hotel itself was very well situated in the “cool” part of down, although it didn’t trade comfort for cool — it stood on tradition like every fine hotel should, making us feel special in every way (and not overplay its cool card).  The rooms were very quiet and comfortable and the housekeeping was top notch.  Would highly recommend.  ",5,2019,04,13
236,Amazing Service,"My friend and started our vacation in Dublin.  After flying all night we were greeted by friendly staff and made to feel at home, we were able to freshen up and they even allowed us to check into the room 4 hours before the time. The breakfast were wonderful, the rooms were loveland the staff were very friendly.   Conor was very personable and the day that a hotel says the the concierge is not important is the day people stop coming.  We greatly appreciated all of his helpful advice and services that he provided.  After coming coming to the USA, I discovered that I had left a favorite sweater and they were able to locate and mail it to me.  I am so grateful they were able to send it back to me.   Since I have gotten back, I can't stop talking about the wonderful time that we had and we are definitely returning and would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. The location is ideal because it is close to everything.",5,2019,04,06
236,Great hotel,"Myself and my husband stayed here for one night, lovely hotel, staff very friendly, brilliant location. Would highly recommend staying here as it is within walking distance of grafton street and Stephens Green. ",4,2019,04,03
236,All round greatness,"Not stopped south of the river before and I'm saddened i haven't sooner!  

The hotel is surrounded by independent food, coffee and shopping vendors, and this adds to the experience.  

Very welcoming on arrival, super friendly staff.  

Room is spacious, clean and contemporary with all the mod cons.  

This might just have to be my go to hotel when i'm next in Dublin!",5,2019,04,03
236,Great Hotel,"This was our first visit to Dublin, and could not have been better served. 
The accommodation exceeded our expectations and the attentive staff provided well above the extra mile often spoken about. 
The location is in easy walking distance of all the major sites, attractions and nightlife and yet no issues with noise at any time. 
I cannot say any single staff member stood out because they were all wonderful. 
Our room was large, modern and well equipped. Even a tea pot was provided in the room without question or hesitation on request. 
On this experience I would not ever consider booking anywhere else when in Dublin. ",5,2019,03,30
236,Comfortable and welcoming ,"Booked through the airline and selected by TA reviews, we were not disappointed in anything.  First impressions at check in the staff is friendly and professional, we were surprised to be able to check in early from our US flight. 

The room is spacious, comfortable, modern and clean. Can’t say enough about the USB ports available to charge devices, no need for adapters 👍.  The thoughtfulness of everything to make anyone’s visit carefree.

The hotel is very well situated to all attractions, shopping, pubs and good restaurants; but far enough from the tourist traffic.

My only critique would be for the breakfast, wish they had a few more options for the hot breakfast, maybe pancakes or an omelet (suggestion)

Many thanks to Victoria who always took care of our needs, and Marvin for his helpful hints of Dublin. 

Looking forward to our next visit to Dublin and we will most certainly stay at the BROOKS HOTEL !

236,Great Location .. Boutique Hotel,"Location in the center of Dublin , walking distance to the Green , Shopping center , 
Graftin street , major museums .  Boutique Irish Hotel , Very hospitable staff .. Clean rooms , Check in check out in seconds , social barman ,  great  helpfull bell boy .",5,2019,03,18
236,Disappointed ,"First impression was the very strong carpet deodorant in the lift, then upon entering our deluxe room I was hit by another strong smell of disinfectant!
We couldn’t believe that we were faced with a shower curtain over an extremely narrow bath, naturally the curtain slapped against us & water went all over the floor!
The staff was very helpful & polite & bed comfortable.
Centrally located to good shopping and food.",3,2019,03,11
236,Great hotel in a fabulous location,"We stayed here, for the first time, in February and could not have picked a better hotel or a better location. They have a special residents rate for the multi-storey car park, located directly opposite the hotel, which made bringing the car a realistic option, particularly as we had some visiting to do on the Sunday.

The staff could not be any more helpful, accommodating our baggage early and arranging for it to be put in our room, as we spent some time in Dublin city itself. We dined out every night, but, upon our return, we saw some very inviting meals being presented. Additionally, I can confirm that the bar is well worth a visit, with much debate as to which whiskey makes the best Irish Coffee (no conclusion to date and we will return for round two). The Concierge gave us some very good leads for dinner and all proved to be excellent recommendations. An excellent hotel - a real find - and we will return.",5,2019,03,11
236,Fantastic Hotel,"Just spent a great weekend in Brooks. Our first time but certainly not our last. Everything about this Hotel is sooo Good. Staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble and they invented the Saying ""Going the extra Mile"".
Breakfast is the best we have ever had, relaxed and calm with staff catering to your every whim. Cooked breakfast made to order was fantastic along with the array of cakes, breads, cereals and cheeses.
We had a slight glick with our shower and the Manager was so prompt in dealing with it and keeping us informed of situation. Even greeting us on our departure to apologise for the inconvenience. This was then followed up with an email on our return home, that is customer care.

We will definitely be back. Thanks to all the lovely staff in Brooks.",5,2019,03,08
236,Central Dublin Hotel,"Brooks Hotel is right in the middle of Dublin, very close to loads of bars, restaurants and within pottering distance of Grafton Street, St Stephen's Green etc. It is a small hotel but with a nice bar, great selection of whiskeys and very friendly and helpful staff. Great rooms and even a small room with gym equipment if you are feeling energetic.",5,2019,03,05
236,Great location and friendly hotel,"Just stayed at The Brooks Hotel for four nights. My room looked like it had recently been refurbished very clean and I really liked that you could choose your pillows and receive a chocolate mint on a night time. The cleaning staff on floor 6 were all very friendly and my room was cleaned everyday to a great standard. Joe and Connor were both very friendly and great at their jobs. They are both a credit to the hotel. The continental breakfast was good but the Irish full breakfast could be improved by using good quality sausages, instead of a potato cake have fried potatoes or a homemade cheese and potato croquette. The menu during the day was okay but prices are high maybe if lowered more residents and other customers would buy maybe even add a afternoon tea. Same for the evening three course menu it’s to a certain taste. If the menu had homemade Irish dishes and carvary (these are just ideas) at a good price more residents and other customers would buy. The rooms do not have great views but the location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to many museums, temple bar, hop on hop off busted the dart. I would also recommend buying the hop on hop off bus ticket at the airport I got a 48 hour ticket for 18 euro.",4,2019,03,04
236,Private Cinema at Brooks,"A 13th party where the birthday girl wants old primary and new secondary school pals, as well as aunts & uncles? The private cinema (seats 26) at Brooks and a viewing of Bohemian Rhapsody (which we’d missed in the cinema) pleased everyone, and the welcome we received at this gem of a hotel was the icing on the cake. 
When we did the maths on what cinema tickets and refreshments would cost anyway, without the comfort of being in our own company alone, the cost remained competitive. 
Bring your own preferred Blu-ray or DVD, and you’re away. And in this case, the birthday girl gets to keep the movie as her gift at the end of the celebrations :) Thank you Brooks!",5,2019,03,03
236,Excellent stay,The location is perfect for everything you want to do. The staff were very courteous and polite. The bed was sooooo comfy and the pillow menu was a great inclusion. The cocktails in the bar were lovely too. All round great stay!,5,2019,03,03
236,The place to stay if you want to shop,"I spent the first night of a trip to Dublin here and it was my first time staying in Brooks Hotel. The location is fantastic, it is very near Grafton Street which is a big plus for anyone you want to hit the shops. There is a free upgrade included in the booking which was nice and the room was pretty big for the two of us. Had some dinner in the lounge - good selection of food at reasonable prices, and then a few drinks later in the bar. We found the staff very engaging with us and other guests, checking to see if everything was alright and there was a nice vibe around the hotel. This is a nice place and I look forward to staying in it again.",4,2019,03,01
236,Retirement Trip,"Great!!!   Only way I can express our experience.  Connor O'Connell was our first contact.  Always referred to us by our first names.  Roger in the lounge was so much fun.  The breakfast staff was always so gracious.  Learned that we enjoyed hot tea upon arrival.  It was always there without asking.   A fantastic perk was the cell phone  available for us to help navigate around the city.  Room staff was timely and very friendly and professional.   Connor knew we wanted to explore Dublin.  Was so helpful in making recommendations.  Cannot thank him enough for introducing us to Hairy Lemon and Peter's Pub.  Annette is great at the Hairy Lemon. 

Thank you Brooks.  Your care made our trip very special.",5,2019,03,01
236,A great weekend in Dublin,"Brooks high standard ensure a great room and fine hospitality, providing for a great weekend in Dublin. accommodation of a high standard and food just great.
Brooks central location is ideal for fitting in theatre and sport weekend.",5,2019,02,25
236,Average,Location is this hotel's selling point as it is so adjacent to Grafton Street.  We were there for morning coffee.  The Jasmine Lounge was most disappointing; tired and worn; definitely in great need of a face lift.  There was absolutely nothing inviting about the place.  The service was slow.  We placed our order twice with two different members of staff.  They were short staffed.  So much more could be done with this central hotel with generous space.  Such a different experience for me from their sister hotel the Connemara Coast.,3,2019,02,20
236,Amazing food with friendly and personal service!,"We visited Brooks Hotel to eat at Francesca’s restaurant as a friend had recommended it to us.
For starters we had the scallops and the terrine. Main course was Braised Feather Blade Beef and Silverhill Duck with Artichokes. For dessert we had the Steamed Pudding and Chocolate Delice. The food was to die for and head chef Patrick McLarnon came over to talk to us after our meal. What a lovely and genuine guy and so passionate about the food that he and his team create. It’s personal touches such as these that will make us regular visitors and we know where we will be staying when we visit Dublin from now on.
A big mention also goes to the Reception staff who were also absolutely excellent and so friendly and full of good humour.
It was a joy to spend time here.
",5,2019,02,20
236,Great Central Stay in Dublin,"Great location with everything on the south side of Dublin a short walk away. Comfy rooms and great staff that were very friendly and helpful. A great selection of breakfast items with a comfy and bright atmosphere in the mornings. 
The Bar staff did seem a bit under pressure at times and the showers are not ideal for the tallest patrons but other than that a thoroughly enjoyable stay.",4,2019,02,15
236,"Small, centraland personal"," A nice slightly old fashioned hotel with impeccable service.
 Attentive staff and central location make this a good choice for a short break in Dublin. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but comfortable. Breakfast is varied, but can be  crowded - so come early or late. Would stay there again as the location makes it an excellent choice for sight seeing and shopping. Not so sure it is the right place for families with small children - more of a grown-up place.",4,2019,02,12
236,Not as good as they think they are,"Booked 3 rooms here over 2 months ago for a special family occasion and was very disappointed on arrival to be shown to rooms that stunk of paint. While the freshly painted rooms seemed well- appointed, the duty manager was unsure of how to respond to the problem. 
Be warned when booking that according to management they do refurbishments in January so make sure to check what type of room you're getting before you book. Also, there's a big difference between the standard and deluxe double rooms and the unrenovated and renovated rooms. The bathrooms are all very small and have a high bath which you need to step over, making it difficult for older or less mobile people.
Also, for overseas travellers who are unaware of the pre-authorisation procedure in Irish hotels, you should make sure you have a credit card (not debit) to cover the amount required. If you then pay your bill with a different card it can take up to 3 weeks to receive the pre-authorisation amount back. 
Finally, the breakfast buffet was relatively limited and the hot food was ok but nothing more. I was surprised to receive an undercooked boiled egg in a butter dish with stale soldiers. 
Overall, our experience did not live up to our expectations and although Marvin (the bellman) and Conor (concierge) were helpful there were many others who could benefit from further training.
If you're simply looking for a hotel that's well located in Dublin, this is a good option but pricey. ",3,2019,01,27
236,Top class,Perfect location - staff were so friendly and attentive to every guest. Food was great breakfast had great choice. Rooms were clean and very comfortable. Discounted parking. Overall a lovely hotel experience. Only fault was wifi kept dropping.,5,2019,01,25
236,No sure why people are so excited,"Stayed here for one night. Good news, center of town.

Hotel has old fashioned look and feel, definitely needs a renovation. Rooms have small shower, separate bath, good king size bed, tv, terrible chairs. My shower was hard to control the temperature, but probably just bad luck.

Internet free, worked ok.

Breakfast only from 7, which I think is a bit late, but they offered to make some breakfast to go.

Will look for other options next time...",2,2019,01,24
236,Hotel with issues,"SUMMARY

Location and service excellent - room, facilities, upkeeping and breakfast below par. I would recommend to loom for another place as this is not a cheap place even though it has several issues. Value for money not there!

LOCATION

4 / 5 for location - because of the noisy neighbourhood and garage on the opposite side 

The Brooks is well located just a few hundred metres from the major town centre sights & shopping. Even though it is not on the main thoroughfares there are plenty of popular pubs in the neighbourhood - the ones close by are unfortunately quite noisy. There is also a parking garage in the opposite side of the street. This garage has 4 or 5 floors and blocks the views. If a car alarm goes off half of Brooks guests are bound to be woken up.

LOBBY AND COMMON AREAS

3 / 5 for the plainness.

The lobby is what one would expect in a 3 star locale. It’s fairly plain with some seating - there’s also restaurant and bar on the ground floor. There is nothing special in the lobby. Service is excellent in the reception, bar and restaurant.

ROOM

2 / 5 noisy air con, small shower cubicle, old fittings

My room on the 4th floor has been partially refurbished. The bed was fairly new but other bits and bobs left untouched. TV was old Philips LCD 32” which did not work properly. Nothing had been done in the bathroom for at least a decade. The major drawback was the noise: noise from the bars and street below, noise from the garage opposite to the hotel and most importantly extremely loud air con. Heating was only through air con and it was like having a jet engine on next to you. Because of the noise I did not use the air con resulting to waking up in the room that was freezing cold. Desk chair was too low and lumpy.

BREAKFAST

1 / 5 - poor and spoiled food

Breakfast is the worst integer in Brooks equation. Only cold cuts and fruits available in buffet - warm dishes have to be ordered from the kitchen. Instead of tea they brought me coffee, instead of earl grey tea I got black tea, orange juice was spoiled (it could really have poisoned someone), also ham smelled bad, bread was a few days old. If you chose to stay in this place there is Hairy Lemon pub around the corner with Irish breakfast which is much better than what they have at Brooks. There’s also Starbucks in the building next to Brooks.",2,2019,01,19
236,Great hotel in central location ,This is my second visit to the hotel and service is always great. It’s a central location so really close to the main tourist attractions. My room was large and clean with great facilities. Even had an iron and trouser press. There was a welcome cookie and a chocolate on the pillow. The bathroom had both bath and separate shower with complementary soaps etc. After a hunt I found he tea/coffee making facilities in the cupboard. Had a lovely nights sleep followed by a great Irish cooked breakfast. There was also a cold buffet and pastries. Recommended,5,2019,01,17
236,Good place to stay in Dublin,"The staff was polite, although not always speedy during check-in and at the bar and restaurant.
The room was nice, although it felt quite crowded. 
There was audible street noise at night.
The location provided easy walking access to many parts of Dublin.",4,2019,01,15
236,Brit traveller overnight in the Temple bar area 🇬🇧,"Flight into Dublin on a business/work colleague trip, needed a hotel in the heart of the tourist area, this Hotel fitted our requirements nicely. 
I wouldn’t have given the rooms 4 stars but the rest of the hotel certainly easily 4 stars, great bar part of the hotel & a complimentary half of Guinness on arrival, nice welcoming touch, receptionist on our arrival & departures excellent. 
Can’t comment on parking but taxi from airport to door was about €25 for 6 people.

236,Great Hotel in great location,"Had a lovely stay in Brooks hotel.  From check in to check out everything was perfect.  Location is perfect.  Room was lovely and comfortable, and not overheated.  Beds were comfy, shower was great and breakfast cooked to order.  Will definitely return!",5,2019,01,14
236,Relaxing hotel right in the heart of Dublin,"Great location in the city centre close to all attractions, car park across road. Warm welcome at reception and check in with ease with friendly staff, given a free room upgrade which was very nice. Room excellent with very comfortable bed, everything you could ask for, shower, separate bath, clean and comfortable room, even supplied with mobile phone to use while enjoying stay. Breakfast excellent with great choice of food in a relaxed atmosphere. In all, fabulous boutique hotel with great staff, will definitely stay again.",5,2019,01,14
236,Neat little hotel in a great location.,"Came to the Brooks Dublin the week before xmas 2018.  I cant say enough nice things about all the staff.  Especially Marvin (concierge) and Jacek, Shane, and Harry in the bar.  Jacek took the time and effort to share a little piece of his deep knowledge of Irish Whiskey.  We learned a ton and had some amazing whiskeys.  The morning breakfast every day was great.  You’re in a great part of town close to Temple Bar and St Stephan’s Green.  About a 15 minute walk to Dublinia-super cool if you like history.I’d go again in a minute!!",4,2019,01,12
236,Too low chairs,Lovely hotel with very nice bar staff. Complements to Dalia on the excellent service. A bit dissapointed about very low chairs. Would be great to have some high bar chairs where I could seat comfortably as I have disability.,4,2019,01,10
236,"Thoughtful staff, knockout breakfast","The hotel is in a nicely located, fairly quiet street in Dublin. The rooms are very well decorated and the beds very comfortable. Without exception, I found the staff friendly and courteous. The breakfasts are traditional and include some of the best pork sausages I have ever tasted. Close to the main hub of Dublin (ten mins walk from Trinity College and the Castle, for example), there are coffee shops and places to eat good food nearby. A special treat I found was the old converted market. Dublin in in the main a walking city and Brooks is a good starting place for on-foot exploration of the south side of Dublin.",5,2019,01,09
236,Small hotel in good location,I had read many good reviews of Brooks but sadly it left us a little underwhelmed.  We stayed on Saturday 5 January 2019 in a standard double room.  I know it is  a city centre hotel but the room was on the small side and the bathroom especially so.  The narrow bath and shower were almost too small to enjoy.  One of the things that attracted us to Brooks was the mention of the Whiskey Bar but it is just the normal bar with a slightly better than average selection of whiskeys.  Also this bar is lacking in any charm or character at all. On the plus side it is near all the amenities of the Grafton Street area of Dublin with bars and restaurant and shops all nearby.  We did not dine in the hotel so can say nothing about the food on offer.,3,2019,01,09
236,A Gem,"The Brooks Hotel is such a warm and friendly place - It's a venue whose lobby I had used for numerous business meetings over the years (without realising) because of its central location. All that there is to see, and many great restaurants and bars, are but a short walk away.
This was the first time I had stayed there - we made the booking as it is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of The World - and it was fabulous. Our only quibble was that the cocktails & wines available at the bar were not of the standard we would have expected.
The rooms were spacious, quiet, clean and extremely well appointed and the freshly cooked (always a plus) breakfasts were exceptional.
A big thank you to all the staff who helped put (and keep) a smile on our faces",4,2019,01,07
236,Wonderful Stay,"We had a great trip to Ireland, which was made better by having such a comfortable hotel in which to return each evening. Beds were exceptionally comfortable. We didn’t need to use the pillow menu, but it’s available if needed. I called for a supplemental blanket and about 5 minutes later was brought a lovely, heavy-weight wool blanket. 
The location is perfect. Close to everything without all the chaos and noise of Temple Bar. They have thick windows which blocked the little road outside. We stayed in room 304 and found it was quiet in terms of elevator noise. The room was spacious enough to not feel cramped, even with it being a historic hotel. 
I cannot speak to the quality of the food in the restaurant, except for breakfast. We purchased the ‘bed and breakfast’ option and ate in the restaurant each morning and it was delicious. We would have ordered room service a couple nights but could not find the menu despite being told it is in their guidebook. Maybe it could be made more obvious?
All of the staff were incredibly helpful. Specifically I would like to mention Conner, the concierge. He greeted us kindly upon arrival, gave us a tour of our room, and assisted us with baggage. He also had great recommendations on places of interest in Ireland. 
",5,2019,01,05
236,Lovely friendly hotel,"Have stayed here with friends twice now - lovely hotel - classy rooms - and the staff are very conscientious. Special mention to Connor the concierge just lovely. If you want a well situated good hotel this is your place.
",5,2018,12,29
236,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"We stayed here for our honeymoon as our first stop in Ireland from the US. We had an early morning flight into Dublin and check in wasn't until the afternoon, but the hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage and show us the lounge area to change clothes and relax for a minute. The concierge was also wonderful and sat down with us and a map of Dublin and gave recommendations on where to do, what to do, dinner places, etc. Hotel was in a great location for walking around the city. Room was very clean and comfortable.",5,2018,12,29
236,Christmas day disaster,"Checked in on Christmas day expecting something Christmassy the service was awful and the food was average, grannys food was raw .

The attitude from the manager Not to was so unprofessional and actually very patranising .",1,2018,12,25
236,"Traditional, comfortable, welcoming","Brooks is a delightful, traditional and very comfortable hotel in an ideal location in the centre of Dublin.  The tradition begins with a warm welcome from reception staff and from the knowledgeable and helpful concierge, Connor. Our double room was perhaps on the small side but beautifully furnished with all necessary amenities.  Breakfast (part buffet but cooked dishes to order) is outstanding with one of us particularly enjoying the beautifully cooked plaice fillet each morning. The recipe for their delicious, healthy in-house brown bread is worth taking away.  There's also a Brooks Hotel Newsletter with further recipes, as well as tips and hints about the city.  The Jasmine bar provides a warm and comfortable sanctuary after busy days in the city.  All the staff were helpful and efficient and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay in this excellent hotel again.",5,2018,12,23
236,Amazing service ,A lovely place to relax with fantastic service with a smile thanks to jacek Aline Bruna and kitty. The food was of a very high standard I would recommend the chicken ceasar salad. The location is perfect so central only a stroll from all the main attraction that Dublin has to offer. ,5,2018,12,18
236,Mixed Feelings,"Stayed here for 4 nights, this hotel is in a great location for shopping, restaurants and sights. This is not a cheap hotel and we did have high expectations!
We arrived early (prior to check-in at 1500) and despite e-mailing ahead we did not get access to our room but Conor the concierge secured our luggage in a safe area to enable us to roam the city.
We stayed in a classic double room, the hanger in the wardrobe fell down and our sink did not drain efficiently. Despite alerting the front desk nothing was done about it. My husband fiddled around with the sink and got it to drain better but in the absence of a drill we couldn't fix the rail! The bed was very comfortable and we felt well rested after a busy day! The shower is fixed but did have good water pressure.
I suffer from dairy intolerance and when we booked we informed the hotel of this fact. At the breakfast buffet I saw whole and skimmed milk choices but nothing else. I asked Ting our waitress who informed me that were my choices, nothing else. Her attitude was terrible and really rude. My husband went to reception and did not get any more satisfaction from Will who clearly had no idea how to resolve the problem. Then Conor appeared and volunteered  to go and buy me some! Dietary intolerances are not unusual, even budget hotels manage soya and almond milks at breakfast time. The Asian waiter was pleasant and efficient but the rest of the breakfast serving team were surly and unfriendly with a I don't give a damn attitude.
We enjoyed drinks in the bar Irish gin and lovely cocktails.
On a positive note the room was kept clean to a high standard and a cleaning supervisor would come and check that we were satisfied. A turn down service and a chocolate on your pillow which is a nice touch was done each night.
Conor the head concierge is an asset to this hotel offering helpful sightseeing advice and has excellent people skills. Thanks very much for the soya milk too!",3,2018,12,18
236,Pillow Menu & Ask for Meghan and O’Connor,"We stayed here for two days and was our highlight for our trip to Dublin. Both made good suggestions and helped with our planning while on the city.

Another amazing perk was the pillow menu. I really hoped they have had a body pillow but I ordered every type of pillow and slept on clouds. ",5,2018,12,17
236,Gem of a hotel,"Simply put a gem of a hotel in the perfect location.
Right in the city center - only 2 mins walk from the stores, restaurants, bars.
We stayed for 5 nights and loved returning each night to the comfy bed.
House staff were amazing - so polite.  I left a daily tip and received a lovely thank you message.  Evening turn down service.

We arrived super early from Boston and did not expect to be roomed straight away, but to our surprise we were.  (Note - I did email prior to ask for this as per the website).

Do no hesitate - book!",5,2018,12,17
236,Customer service is outstanding,"We stayed at Brooks on Friday night to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. There were a couple of negatives but the positives outweighed them by far and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.

The service from staff was second to none and when we got to our room there was a beautiful dessert plate and note waiting for us to wish us well on our special occasion as we mentioned when booking that it was to celebrate an anniversary.

The bed in our room (206) was beautiful to sleep on, the linens were very high standard and we both had an amazing nights sleep. 

The shower in the bathroom was great for pressure however the temperature did fluctuate a little between slightly too hot and lukewarm every minute or so, which was a little frustrating. 

There were also a few cosmetic letdowns to the room - a loose, unclean air vent and some damp stains on the ceiling by the bathroom door... didn't affect our stay but I think when you pay over €200 a night for a room the decor really should be to a high standard.

Breakfast in the morning was great - selection of breads and pastries, meats and cheeses, cereals, juice on the buffet - but the chef overcooked the scrambled eggs and the bacon wasn't very crispy... everything else was spot on and delicious.

Location of the hotel is fabulous, the area it's located in has loads of quirky little shops, cafe's, drinking spots and restaurants all within walking distance. 24 hours parking is available across the road for discounted price of €12.50, just show your ticket to reception upon checkout.",5,2018,12,16
236,Christmas treat,First time to stay in this lovely city centre hotel. Beautiful bedroom. Lovely bar atmosphere and in a great location a few steps from Grafton st. Highly recommended for a christmas city treat. There's even a pillow menu!,5,2018,12,10
236,Excellent location and Exquisite Staff,"First - thanks to Connor, Shane (concierge) and Monica (front desk).  These people and others were always looking out for us and assisting in a myriad of ways.  The location of this hotel could not be better, and all the amenities of a luxury hotel were available.  The only slight disappointment was the small size of the room - although we reserved the ""Deluxe"" room category which was described as ""spacious"", the size was really quite small and almost cramped.  However, we were often out seeing Dublin, and when we returned sleep beaconed and the the bed and pillows were a dream, no pun intended!  ",4,2018,12,02
236,"Good Service, clean rooms","We stayed at the Brooks hotel twice during our stay.  First for two nights when we arrived in Dublin and one night at the end (after visiting Norther Ireland).  Although the rooms were rated the same, the rooms we had during the first two nights were well done, a large bed and the service was great.  Our room on our last night at the end of the trips tiny and needed some renovations.  Service on the last day was not as good.  We had an early flight (left the hotel at 6am).  They were supposed to have take away breakfast for just but it was not available when we left.

Overall, a good hotel and worth the stay.  It is located in the heart of Dublin.",4,2018,12,01
236,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed at the Brooks for a weekend break and had a very enjoyable stay.  The room was of a very high standard and very spacious.  The staff were particularly welcoming and helpful.  The hotel was within easy reach of the main parts of the city and surrounded by many good restaurants and cafes.  One down side was at Breakfast on both days we were largely ignored as we were on the periphery of the restaurant and although there were plenty of waiting staff it took several prompts to get coffee, toast etc.  There didn't seem to be any one person in charge so the waiting staff were 'doing their own thing'. For an expensive hotel this should not happen. ",4,2018,11,26
236,Luxury within reason,"The service at this hotel was friendly, efficient and a lovely welcome to Ireland. The room was well appointed and breakfast was delicious. Easy walking distance to the sites of Dublin and restaurants.",4,2018,11,24
236,"Very nice, reasonably priced hotel","This is a very nice hotel in a great location in the City centre. My room was a good size and attractively decorated. The bed was very comfortable and the pillow menu was a nice touch.

The bathroom was a little bit small, but it was very clean with a bath and a powerful shower, and White Company products.

I only ate breakfast in the hotel, which was tasty.

All in all, this is a very nice hotel and perfect as a base to explore the City.",4,2018,11,14
236,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"You can't go wrong staying at this hotel when you travel to Dublin! Everything from the friendly hotel staff, the central location to explore the city, and the very comfortable bed and stylish decor of our room, made our first-time, six night stay such a perfect experience.",4,2018,11,13
236,Dublin Honeymoon,The Brooks Hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Dublins city center and its art and design scene. Comfortable rooms and attentive staff makes the Brooks ideally suited as your base of operations to experience all the nightlife of Dublins city center.  All of what Dublin has to offer just minutes walk from your doorstep.,4,2018,11,11
236,Best hotel bed ever!,"We booked the hotel well in advance as we were attending a concert. The hotel was pricier than I would usually go for, but it was the most reasonable for the nights we wanted (due to events in Dublin).
The room was beautiful, impeccably clean, well stocked, complementary mobile/cell phone for use during stay (didn’t use this, but would really benefit someone staying from abroad).
Best thing for me was the bed, hands down! It was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever had in any hotel I’ve been in. I had the best sleep on both nights, I need a bed just like this. 
We never ate in the hotel, but the staff were very friendly and courteous and could not be faulted.
I’d stay again as the location, and hotel,  is fantastic. ",5,2018,11,10
236,Service,"Visiting Dublin? Then by all means consider this hotel. 

Service in general in Ireland is typically very good, while a stay at this hotel will illustrate what truly great service is. From the front staff, the concierge, breakfast servers, etc, all demonstrating the care to insure your stay is pleasurable.

And, if you prefer to walk to many of the sites downtown but want to avoid staying in a hectic surrounding, this hotel has a good location.",4,2018,11,07
236,Perfect Location ,"I ended up staying at the Brooks Hotel three times this fall and each time was a pleasure. The staff is first rate and very friendly with Irish charm. The service is exemplary while still being personal. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Although it is in a busy section of Dublin, it is very quiet. It sits next to a famous landmark “The Hairy Lemon”   Which is a lot of fun. I will definitely stay a fourth time at this hotel!",5,2018,11,06
236,Book Now! ,"I recommend you stop reading this review and just book the Brooks Hotel, but if you need more convincing, read below!

My husband I stayed here for our honeymoon and had an amazing stay. The Brooks Hotel was easy to get to from the Airport; we simply payed for the 3-day bus pass since we were in Dublin for three days and took the airport shuttle. Bus stops are within a reasonable walking distance of the hotel and once we arrived we were greeted by the Head Concierge, Conor who was AMAZING. He gave us some places to see and tips and tricks to stay safe and get to the places we needed. 

Our room was upgraded and when we got in there, they placed a congrats card for our marriage and left desserts for us, which was awesome. 

We ate and drank in the hotel which I’ll write separate reviews on but was great! The Brooks Hotel also has an amazing location. Temple Bar district is within walking distance and there are a ton of other bars, restaurants and stores nearby. 

If you need more convincing, I’d read all the other reviews for this hotels. It’s truly wonderful. Clean, cozy, amazing staff... just loved it here! ",5,2018,11,05
236,"Location , location . in the heart of Dublin .","Boutique hotel , stayed for business , excellent service from all staff without exception . 
The Concierge was the best , followed by the barman , the reception, and the housekeeping . Garage parking in front of the hotel , excellent restaurants around the hotel . Clean rooms .",5,2018,11,04
236,Great stay at Brooks!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Brooks hotel! The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome. Our room (211) was clean, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had a shower, no bath, was very clean and had all the amenities needed. The view of the room was disappointing as we looked at next door's air conditioners , so we kept our curtains closed.

We enjoyed a lovely, fresh breakfast. Overall great service and very centrally located! I would recommend this hotel.

",4,2018,11,04
236,Good location,"We stayed here as didn't want to stay in the noisy Temple bar area, we were right to as it was just far enough out to avoid all the noise that our friends were experiencing. Clean rooms overall a great hotel choice",5,2018,10,29
236,Very good hotel in central location,"Our favorite thing about the room was the pillow menu.  We just wished we could have taken the pillows with us for the remainder of our vacation!  Our view was not good, but the room was quiet and clean.",4,2018,10,25
236,Noisy renovation work - staff very unhelpful,"We stayed here for our anniversary as others said it was a good location yet quiet. Yes the location is reasonable but it was very very noisy - it was like being on a building site from 9am to past 5pm. 
For instance on our second day, the noise went on for several hours of very very loud drilling from the room above getting renovated. There was no warning that this was going on and really spoiled our quiet enjoyment of the hotel. 

What was just as bad was the hotels response. We had to complain twice before a manager spoke to us, each time being told that it would be finished soon and then it just kept on going so we ended up not being able to use the room all day.
 The manager didn't seem to care and said they hadn't realised it would be so noisy - yet you could hear it 5 floors down in the lobby so there's no way they didn't realise! We asked for compensation and she said she would call us which she never did. 
Overall we really weren't impressed. We wanted a quiet hotel where we could relax in our room if we wanted to between seeing the city but this just wasn't possible.

To make matters worse, the staff were so unhelpful and didn't seem to care. We asked to change rooms and were told no even though the hotel didn't seem full. 

The room we stayed in also needed renovating - it was quite old fashioned and in need of modernising even though we had paid for an upgrade.

Overall we definitely won't be staying here again and it really ruined our stay to this wonderful city as it was just so stressful and not what you would expect from a luxury hotel. 
",1,2018,10,25
236,Nice hotel near city center,This is a very nice hotel! Staff was so friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included for us so we ate there each morning. It was very good. There is also a restaurant at night but we never ate there. The bar at night is nice and relaxing. Bar tender was friendly. Room was small but fine for the two of us. Stocked well. Lots of amenities and even extra pillows. Very close to city center. Walking distance to many points of interest. About ten minutes from Trinity College area. Near many pubs. I would stay here again!,5,2018,10,23
236,"A modern, boutique hotel in central Dublin","What's not to like? The Brooks Hotel is on a quiet street just steps away from the city's busier thoroughfares. The rooms are comfortable and have two mod cons I'd never encountered before: a free smart phone for the duration of one's visit, and electrical outlets that take a variety of international plugs. The staff are friendly and helpful. We had to leave early on Sunday morning, before the dining room opened, and the man on duty cheerfully volunteered a continental breakfast---tea and coffee, orange juice and a plateful of croissants. Quite a contrast to  the Inverlochy Castle in Scotland, at four times the cost, that refused similar service!",5,2018,10,23
236,Great location in Dublin city center,"This is a lovely, solid hotel is tucked away on a quiet street, but close to all city center sites including St. Patrick's cathedral, Grafton Street, Stephen's Green, Trinity College.  We set at The Hairy Lemon, a fun pub, which was next doo.  Breakfast was delicious.",5,2018,10,21
236,Wish we stayed longer,"This hotel is ideal for a visit to Dublin!  Located near Temple Bar but not close enough to all the noise.  Near great restaurants, walking distance to St. Stephen's Green and the Ha' Penny bridge and most sights in Dublin.  Everyone was super nice but a special shout out to Connor who assisted with our bags and gave us invaluable information.  He even walked us down to the Hairy Lemon Pub for a late lunch and introduced us to the owner, telling him, ""Take good care of my friends here!""  The room was super quiet, super comfortable with a ton of amenities. We were especially intrigued by the complimentary use of what appeared to be an iPhone to help navigate the city.  The only small issue we had was our bathroom door would not stay open and the rubber door stopper provided did nothing to keep the heavy door from closing.  This will be the place that I return to on my next visit to Dublin!  Breakfast is a good size buffet with an order of a hot entree.  It appears to be frequented by business men and women during our stay. A lovely stay at a lovely hotel.",5,2018,10,21
236,Bernar Murphy ,"What a lovely stay me and my wife had. All the staff are great and always smiling and they can't do enough for you. Food in the restaurant was top notch and drink prices at the bar were very reasonable and again the staff there were brilliant. The hotel is very clean and also in a great location, would definitely stay there again. Congratulations to the management and all staff on running a very fine hotel..",5,2018,10,21
236,Wedding Weekend,Just spent 2 days in Brooks Hotel following our Wedding in Fallon and Byrne and we were completely blown away by the staff and the welcome we received during our stay. Nothing was a hassle from check in to check out. The breakfast was fantastic with a massive selection to choose from. I should give a special mention to the reception staff who are a credit to the hotel. Thank you so much for making our stay so memorable.,5,2018,10,16
236,Best Location in Dublin,"We only had one night in Dublin, and therefore - we knew we wanted to be able to walk to as much as possible.  We selected the Brooks Hotel because it seemed to be in the middle of everything in the heart of the city - we were right!  It was great to be able to walk right out the front door and be only a couple steps away from great restaurants, pubs, shops, etc.  It was a little bit of a splurge for us as it's not a cheap hotel by any means, but the proximity to everything was worth it to us.  We only used a taxi to get to and from the airport, otherwise we walked everywhere.  Our room was nice (Deluxe), the bed was a superking and very comfortable.  They have a pillow menu - which was an awesome surprise.  There is a small refrigerator in the room, a water-boiling kettle to make tea (provided) as well, and a couple bottles of water.  As we only had one night, our room was just perfect and we slept great.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and they even had a taxi waiting for us to get to the airport in the morning as we had requested one when we had checked in. We would definitely stay here again if we make it back to Dublin.",5,2018,10,16
236,Comfortable,"Celebrating my wife’s birthday with friends in Dublin. 
We stayed at Brooks for 3 nights. Hotel was nice, clean and rooms very comfortable. Front desk and staff in general very friendly, concierge Connor was exceptionally good at his job. 
The hotel is well situated allowing for walking distance access to most of the Dublin historical and cultural sites. 
Surrounded by good restaurants and pubs.",5,2018,10,16
236,Very good hotel,"The Brooks lived up to our expectations but like all of Dublin was on the pricey side.  The room was relatively roomy but the bathroom was a bit dated.  Very comfortable, large bed.  We found the location to be very central - we walked to just about everything.  Good restaurants nearby, including an excellent one, Fade Street Social, right across the street.  We grabbed our light breakfast at the Starbucks next door - very convenient.  We took the bus to Galway and rolled our bags the few blocks to the terminal.  Recommended.",5,2018,10,15
236,Perfect for our short stay,"We chose the Brooks Hotel for our two night stay while in Dublin.  We were not disappointed!  From its central location to many points of interest, restaurants and shopping which allowed us to safely walk around the city. With pleasant, helpful front desk staff.  Small but clean rooms with actually nice size bathrooms. And a pillow menu which is quite unique added to our stay!   We definitely recommend this boutique hotel and would return! ",4,2018,10,13
236,Great location and staff but a little pricey,Our flight got in at 1am.  Shane still let us have a few drinks at 3am at the bar and told us about the area and sights to see.  He was very nice.  The location was great.  Walking distance to a lot of attractions.  Breakfast was very nice.  I ended up leaving a few things in my room and Sarah at the front desk was able to ship them to me.  The only downside was the hotel was a little pricey.,5,2018,10,12
236,Great hotel central to most of the sites,Very comfortable bed. Clean room.  Breakfasts were great...very fresh fruit.  One morning I asked one of the desk staff where a candy shop was.  A young man mentioned a couple he thought maybe nearby. While I was having breakfast he came to me and reported he had ran to both places to see if they still existed and they don’t.  He didn’t want me to walk to them for nothing.   Very nice.   Great staff.,5,2018,10,12
236,EXCELLENT STAY AT THIS CHARMING HOTEL,"I have stayed at the Brooks on past business trips to Dublin but have not as yet put pen to paper to review. The Hotel and staff are excellent and it is great value for money and very central. 
With many other Hotels in Dublin charging ' Outrageous' prices while the good times last I do feel that the Brooks has got the balance right. 
Well done to the Team",4,2018,10,12
236,great location,"This hotel is in a great location, close to Grafton Street shopping areas, trinity college and a number of tourist destinations. 

We chose this hotel based on location mostly, Also because it wasn't the most expensive we could find, but far from the least.

They had a ""pillow menu"" which we have seen at other hotels but unfortunately they didn't seem to have the pillows we wanted.

The room and bathroom was comfortable enough, the breakfast very good(we never ate at the restaurant).  

Overall very good, and no regrets staying there, but for the price maybe I expected a little better.",4,2018,10,10
236,Perfect stay,Wonderful(quick) trip to Dublin. Ashley at reception greeted us with a huge smile when we arrived at 5 a.m. and it just got better from there. Perfect location for walking to all of the sights. Plentiful pubs and restaurants. Filling cooked to order breakfast. They have a smartphone for your use while in town that was a huge added bonus for us. We used Google Maps and were able to research while we were out and about. We don't like to turn on our phones as it is $10 per day when coming from the US.,5,2018,10,09
236,Stay at Brooks,"Very comfortable, staff very professional, attentive and accommodating. One of the loveliest hotels we stayed in Ireland. Our early arrival was not an issue, hotel has a lovely lounge to rest after a overnight flight. Buffet for breakfast was outstanding. Ashley from reception went above and beyond to assist me in opening my locked suitcase and gave us all sorts of tips for our stay in Dublin. Thank you much for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,10,07
236,Lovely ,"Aside from Connor, the overbearing concierge, we loved the room and the food in the bar. Service was cordial and the neighborhood was easy to walk in though a trifle loud late at night. I’d still come back here and recommend it to my friends and family. 
",4,2018,10,07
236,Nice boutique hotel,We stayed at Brooks hotel just for a one night. Very clean and cozy place. The best feature is location. Everything is in a walking distance:best restaurants or any place of attraction. No regrets of choosing this hotel.,4,2018,10,07
236,excelent choice,"A really good choice for a short trip to Dublin.  the hotel is situated in just the right place to enjoy all that Dublin has to offer without being so close that it is invading your sleep at 3am 

A 8 minute walk from Temple bar, right in the heart of the restraint and shopping district.

the staff are friendly and efficient and were able to make our room available from 10.30AM after and early flight from London.  Our room had no view other than the adjacent office block but the interior was spacious and bright with plenty of wardrobe space and hangers.

We had booked a superior twin room which was one double and one generous single.  the bathroom was also spacious with a shower with good water presure and the usuial selection of toiletries.

The beds were extremely comfortable with lots of different types of pillows and a further pillow menu should you need it.  My only slight criterium would be that the duvets were a little on the heavy side.

We did not eat at the Hotel but the food looked good and people appeared to be enjoying it.

This will definately be my go to hotel for trips to Dublin in the future.",5,2018,10,05

236,Great location,City center close to great shopping and pubs.  Decent bathroom with shower and tub.  Hard to figure out room lights-have to leave room key in slot at all times for light to be on.  Toilet did not flush easily.  Front desk staff lent me scissors and room maids from Lithuania and did not speak much English so had to find other hotel staff to help get extra pillows and towels for room.,4,2018,09,30

236,Perfect location and wonderful service,"We spent three nights at the Brooks Hotel and loved it.  The staff totally gets excellent and Ritz-Carlton-like customer service.  When one of my travel companions lost her credit card, Marvin went to the restaurant and picked it up for us. He also recommended great out of the way sites and restaurants that were perfect for us.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  Love the beds and toiletries.  And what incredible breakfasts!  Home made breads, fresh fruit and an abundance of locally-sourced choices from the menu. If you are flying from the US and the rooms are not ready, the hotel has a beautiful, quiet lounge for guests downstairs. We would all return here in a New York second.  To the managers of this hotel, please keep doing what you are doing ---- you are creating ""raving fans!""",5,2018,09,21
236,Very nice stay,All staff at the Brooks were exceptionally lovely and helpful. Central location is very convenient to restaurants and sites. Excellent for walking everywhere. Room was comfortable but could use a bit of an update as could the hallways. Nice breakfast and attractive common areas.,4,2018,09,19
236,Great Location,"We spent four nights at the Brooks Hotel. The location cannot be beat. We walked to all the major sites within 15 minutes, yet the hotel itself was in a fairly quiet area. The room overall was a good size with plenty of clothing storage, and the bath was updated. The only issue we had with the room was the size of the stall  shower, which was literally the size of a phone booth. The common areas were well decorated with the exception of the hallways, which with different light fixtures and a lighter paint color could look more inviting. We loved Dublin and if we return we would stay at the Brooks again mainly because of its location as well as the competitive nightly rate.",4,2018,09,19
236,Excellent location!,"Beautiful, air conditioned rooms. Well appointed bathroom, terrific personnel and amazing breakfast. One block from Grafton St. Near museums, galleries, the Stag's Head pub and lots of dining, the Hairy Lemon is practically next door. Beautiful!",5,2018,09,18
236,Best in Dublin,"We had stayed at the Brooks Hotel when we were in Dublin 11 years ago and then again this year. We stayed 2 nights at the beginning of our vacation and 2 nights at the end. It is a very convenient location which allowed us to walk to most things we wanted to see. But why we recommend it is the people and service. Everyone is attentive and helpful but also want to make you happy. Connor, the concierge is a gem. He is efficient and engaging and fun to talk to. We had an early flight the last day and the people at the desk delivered our coffee and pastries to our room since the breakfast didn’t start that soon. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed.",5,2018,09,16
236,Love This Hotel!,"Loved staying at this hotel and will definitely stay again when I return to Dublin. It's a relatively small hotel so it was quiet and calm.  My room was lovely and the bed comfortable.  I asked for a quiet room and I didn't hear a thing at night.  I ordered room service for dinner twice and the meals were delicious!  All the staff were helpful and personable.  The location is on a quiet side street very close to St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, and the Chester Beatty Library, and Trinity College.   Easy to catch a cab from here to the DART station if you wish to travel outside of Dublin.   Enjoy!",5,2018,09,15
236,group travel,Very good location for getting around Dublin without a car. Staff was very attentive&helpful. Rooms were good. Breakfast was very good. Was nice to start day off without having to search for restaurant. Was able to use guest lounge when we arrived early&stored our luggage so we could start our vacation.,5,2018,09,14
236,"Great location, Quiet  at night, Nice room","Great location within walking distance to Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Trinity College.  Room was very nice with king size bed, in room safe, and fridge.  Room was very quiet.  We heard no noise at night.  An employee came by each night passing out chocolates and seeing if we needed anything.  A very nice touch.  I especially liked the 'Handy' left in the room for personal use.  The 'Handy' was a cell phone free to use, left plugged in our room, if we wanted to use it.  Since I do not have unlimited data on my I-phone, we used it every day to plot our walks to all the nearby locations, and to drive out to Kilhmainham Gaol.  This came in very handy :) and really added an extra touch to our Dublin experience.   I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2018,09,14
236,"Good location, Great service","As soon as our taxi pulled up, the staff appeared and handled our luggage. The man and lady at the front desk were helpful with directions and suggestions. Hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to Molly Malone statue and surrounding pubs. We had to checkout before breakfast buffet opened, so the hotel offered a free brown bag breakfast for each of us. Good room and great customer service.",5,2018,09,09
236,Welcome to Dublin,"We arrived early and were so pleased with the good news our rooms were ready. We were able to go to bed about 7 am to get on Dublin time. The room was so quiet. 
The bed was very well appointed with excellent linens. The Americano coffee was the best, ask for it specifically. Breakfast selections were excellent as well as delicious. The  bar is an excellent place for an Irish whiskey tasting. The bartender is charming and very knowledgable. 
This was a lovely welcome to Ireland.",5,2018,09,07
236,Great B&B with USB Ports,"Extremely friendly desk.  The whole staff is ready to please - just the way to start a trip.

We found out the the hotels do not like golf bags to go to the rooms.  Our rental clubs were stored separately from others at the beginning, and Connor was more than wiling to show ours to us, just to verify.  He went overboard helping our driver with the luggage on the busy street.

The breakfast buffet was typical.   Don’t order two scrambled eggs, though, as each is the size of an unmelted snow cone, and a little drier than I prefer.  The bacon (ham) was done my way - a little crispy on the outside.  

One low point was when we were having cocktails in the evening.  There was an amorous young couple on a padded bench who couldn’t keep their hands off each other, and the staff either didn’t see it or let it proceed.  

I don’t have a feel for all of Dublin but we were able to do lots of sightseeing for our three days there.

 The walls have many USB port built in so I didn’t have to break out my electrical converter.

I’d do it again, and recommend it.",5,2018,09,07
236,Seems expensive ,"Clean enough and staff was very attentive.

Room was on the smallish side as there was only space for one piece of luggage. We had to clear the top of the dresser/TV cabinet to place our other piece of luggage.

The walls are thick enough as we never heard a sound from the rooms on either side of us. But, they might have been empty.

The hot breakfast was nicely plated and cooked. There were lots of cold choices buffet style.

We stayed here as part of our package tour so I don’t know what we paid. However their web site price for tonight was over $300. For that, I would have expected a little more luxurious furniture and decor.

",4,2018,09,02
236,Great location - wonderful hotel,"We made arrangements in advance to stay in the Brooks Hotel for a few days starting when we arrived in Ireland early in the morning. The room was ready for us when we arrived after our long flight and the staff was very welcoming and helpful. My wife and booked a slightly larger room (it had a small sitting area included) for a few days so we could see Dublin before venturing off to tour the southern parts of Ireland for a week. The hotel is relatively small which makes it quite homey and friendly and not at all noisy or busy. The room was very well appointed and comfortable – particularly the bed. Staff members were incredibly helpful in suggesting places to see and how to get there. The location is really ideal being on a narrow, relatively quiet street close to many shops and restaurants/pubs as well as Trinity College (Book of Kels), beautiful parks and the Guinness brewery. The breakfasts that were included were fantastic too – plenty of choices and plenty to eat. We did not eat dinners in the restaurant in the hotel  The hotel was somewhat expensive but no more than other major classy hotels in other major cities.  We would stay there again and highly recommend it.",5,2018,09,01
236,Last night in Ireland,"We spent one night at the Brooks Hotel on our last night in Ireland. The hotel is convenient to restaurants, shops and tourist attractions. We had stayed at the Westbury in the same area at the beginning of our Ireland adventure, but it was hot and noisy, overlooking construction. The rooms at the Brooks were spacious and clean. and thankfully, cool and quiet. Unfortunately we had an early flight out in the morning so we didn't get breakfast.",5,2018,08,30
236,"Loved this place, and the staff","We were only a week in Ireland and stayed two nights at the Brooks Hotel, at the beginning and end of our visit. It's a relatively small place, but very classy and centrally located to all the tourist stops in Dublin. The main shopping street is also just round the corner. The staff are very friendly, helpful, personable. The rooms are clean and well appointed - We got upgraded to a suites both nights so that was wonderful! The breakfast in the morning is just delightful. When traveling, we always do the 'breakfast included' rate as it is so much easier when you want to get up and go see the city! I would highly recommend the Brooks Hotel. Oh - and the parking is just across the street if you are renting a car and driving around Ireland. There is a special rate for those staying at the hotel.",5,2018,08,25
236,excellent personal service,"This is a classy hotel, with very clean and well appointed rooms, and friendly, professional staff who remember your name. It is in a great urban/central location. You will be well cared for here, with personalized services, such as a pillow menu.",5,2018,08,24
236,Perfect Location and Nice Hotel,"So glad we elected to stay here after originally being booked in Temple Bar area.  Such a short walk to Temple Bar, Book of Kells, Saint Patricks and less than a mile to Guinness.  Parking garage directly across the street was only 12.50 per day.  Great breakfast was inlcuded with our stay.  At $270 per night it was still a good value.",5,2018,08,21
236,Perfection,"I loved this hotel. It was in a great location, near tons of restaurants, pubs and shopping, less than 10 minutes from Trinity College and bus stops. Check in was very fast, our room was available early as I had requested. The room was large and comfortable, the toiletries were great. The shower was hot and and had decent water pressure. We had plenty of towels. A iron and hair dryer were in-room. Bottled water was also available in our room, a nice touch. Breakfast was excellent, there are both a buffet and cooked to order options (we had both). The Hairy Lemon is right next door, a fun pub to get dinner. I will certainly come back.",5,2018,08,20
236,Luxurious and Great Location!!,"This hotel is in a perfect quiet location that is close to all the cafes and pubs. There is a craft beer pub around the corner which we could of stayed in all day!!
Rooms were spotless and staff were friendly. I would definitely come back and recommend this hotel if you have the money of course!",5,2018,08,18
236,Great Location and Staff!,"This boutique hotel boasts approximately 100 rooms and is nicely situated on Drury street located close to all shopping, pubs, cafes and most tourist attractions.

Were were certainly very please with the warm welcome we received from the staff upon arrival. We checked in seemlessly and immediately impressed with the efficiency of the porter and concierge.

Once we checked into our room, we place our things down and surveyed the room as we usually do. We found the room to be spotlessly cleaned, stocked with water and fairly good bathroom essentials stocked up as well.

The Air Conditioning in this room was also quite good .

We did notice that the windows were thing and as such let in the evening noise of the hustle and bustle of the nearby pubs was evident with the windows not open. I find that this is common in all of the UK and Ireland.

Our stay was lovely and the staff was quite attentive whenever we needed something. I will say though that the bar/lounge area could use some attention after 8pm or so with possibly dimming the lighting and created a bit more of an ambience with some music in the background. This would encourage guests to stay for a few drinks in the lounge/bar.

The breakfast here is delicious, the cooked breakfast option that goes with the continental is lovely and don't be fooled by the menu, the chef will whip up whatever you'd like (within reason) if what you fancy is not on the menu. - Try the poached eggs and smoked salmon and make sure you try their brown bread.  NOTE: The bananbread and lemonbread are tasty however are a bit dry but I suppose this is how they're made in Ireland...

Last but not least, everything in Dublin is small in comparison to Canada and as such, I found the stand up shower to be extremely small. I am 6'1"" and 225 lbs and could not even move around in it so be prepared to bang your elbows against the glass of the shower.

This is an excellent hotel to stay at although slightly expensive, you get everything you need and then some from being a guest at Brooks Hotel.",5,2018,08,17
236,Great Location - Excellent Stay!,"Great location - short walk to Saint Stephen’s Green, shopping, Trinity College and Temple Bar, with many restaurants and pubs steps away. Quick and friendly check in with Sarah. Very comfortable, clean and quiet room with air conditioning - bedding was great. Had our best sleeps here. Delicious breakfast - worth including. Shane and Oisin were extremely helpful at the concierge desk arranging tours, providing directions, making suggestions and again, super friendly. Can’t say enough about all the staff. We had a very lovely stay and will be back next time we’re in Dublin. Thank you to The Brooks.",5,2018,08,15
236,"Wonderful hotel, clean, quiet, luxurious- great way to start our trip to Ireland!","We booked our rooms at Brooks last minute after cancelling our reservations at Russell Court Hotel, the loudest hotel in the world. Brooks manager price matched Hilton, where my dad is an honors member. Staff were all extremely friendly. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. We ate dinner and breakfast on the property and were very happy with both. I can’t say enough good things about this hotel- it’s wonderful!!!",5,2018,08,15
236,Great Location,"We loved our stay at the Brooks Hotel.  Wonderful location near Trinity, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Grafton Street for shopping, Guinness brewery. Also of note, the hotel is air conditioned!  It seems that often hotels in Europe have no AC but Dublin was having a bit of a heat wave so a hotel with AC was very welcome.  Finally, staff was very pleasant and accommodating",5,2018,08,13
236,Where does the amazement end?,We stayed 5 nights at The Brooks Hotel and from the second we were impressed. I barely got out of the taxi and Conor already had our bags inside. Both Conor and Shane were so helpful in welcoming us to Dublin and wanted to help us get settled. The rooms are comfortable. They provide a local smartphone to use!!  How many hotels can say that?! There is a beautiful reading room in the bottom floor and a great dining area and very well stocked bar with some of the best bartenders I’ve met. Even on our last day I was just as amazed as the first. This is by far one of the BEST hotels I’ve ever stayed at and will only stay there on future visits. ,5,2018,08,12
236,Absolutely fabulous,"What a fantastic hotel!  My daughter and I travelled to Dublin for a shopping trip and stayed in The Brooks Hotel for a night. It was located perfectly for our shopping expedition. 5 minutes from Grafton St,so no need for taxis,buses etc. The staff were so nice,very friendly and helpful..Our room was spotlessly clean and so comfortable. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel and both were delicious. Would highly recommend the fish and chips on the menu. Breakfast was also lovely ,we had a cooked breakfast each and there was also a plentiful supply of croissants,cereals,breads,fruit and juices. This hotel is well worth a stay, great value for money.",5,2018,08,09
236,Really nice hotel in a fantastic area!,"I stayed here for business and chose this hotel because of the location. From the moment I walked in, I was pleased to see this modern hotel that I was about to stay in. The lobby is nice and modern and the bedroom was spacious and clean. The staff at the front desk and the restaurant were all really nice and helpful. 
You are walking distance from a plethora of bars and restaurants which was great. The area is buzzing and is a trendy part of town. There is a Starbucks right next door for those that need their fix.
The breakfast was good and service was quick. 
The shower was powerful and relaxing. The amenities in the bathroom were of good quality and was happy with that.
The bed was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep.
Free wifi too.
I would stay here again for sure!",4,2018,08,09
236,Superb Location. ,"My family and I stayed here for 2 nights on a busy weekend and the location was superb.

I had asked for an early check in which they were able to provide for both rooms.  Reservation staff and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. 

Rooms were nicely appointed but bathrooms were small with little space to place two peoples  toiletry products. The showers are in the bathtub which I think is very outdated.

Bed linen was very good quality and a pillow menu was available.

Breakfast was good but was understaffed.   There is a buffet of fruits/ yogurts / pastries etc and main plates are A La Carte. 

I would recommend this hotel if you are planning a short stay in Dublin.  ",4,2018,08,07
236,Outstanding hotel and customer service ,My husband and I are visiting Ireland for the first time. The Brooks hotel was a great experience from the views to the customer service. Sarah at the front desk was amazing. She gave us outstanding service and was insightful about all of the places we wanted to visit. She even had a cab ready for us when it was our time to go. We will definitely be back! ,5,2018,08,07
236,Nice accommodations in the best location,"My husband and I stayed in a ""Classic Room"" for 2 nights upon arrival in Dublin and had a very nice stay. The concierge, Conor, provided us with excellent suggestions for sight-seeing, dining out, and making the most of our short stay. The room itself was quiet and well appointed. The hotel's location is another a big plus: an easy walk to the Temple Bar neighborhood, Trinity College, and other must-see sights. We would happily stay there again.",5,2018,08,06
236,Wonderful Hotel,We only got to stay for one night. We arrived early in the morning the hotel stored our luggage so we could go right out and explore Dublin. Our room was clean and beautifully decorated! All of the personal were so friendly and helpful. Very close to all things in Dublin!,4,2018,08,06
236,Old Time Personal Attention,"What a wonderful experience!!!!!!! From the moment we arrived to our departure, we could not have been treated any better. Every member of the staff had kind words on their lips and a smile to accompany them. It was a throw back to the days where genteel politeness was the standard rather than the exception. Conner at the front door, Fiona and Lorraine at the front desk and Anne in management all made our woefully short visit to Dublin a memorable one. When, not if, we return to Dublin we will look forward to a visit with our friends at The Brooks!!!",5,2018,08,06
236,Great Hotel,This hotel was very nice and in a great location!  We were upgraded to a suite and it had a good view with a little balcony.  The people were very nice and helpful and booked dinner reservations within walking distance.,4,2018,08,04
236,A Great Hotel in a Fantastic Location,"From the minute we walked in after our 21 hour flight, we were welcomed by a friendly warm smile and helpful staff. We have stayed in many hotels in our travels and little things annoy you when you're on the road and tired. Well I can honestly say there isn't much I do not like about this hotel. It has everything and more. It delivers at this price point. Breakfast is great; the service is great. The rooms are fresh and well ventilated. I will be staying at this hotel when we return to Dublin. Highly recommend this place. Thank you to everyone who made our stay both enjoyable and memorable.",5,2018,08,03
236,Super staff and nice stay,"My husband and I jumped over from Glasgow to Dublin for a day and stayed. They upgraded our room, the room came with a complimentary smart phone to use during your stay. The rooms were nice and clean, the hotel is centrally located but quiet.",5,2018,08,01
236,"Location, Location, Location","We spent 2 nights at Brooks last week.  It is in an area where there are a lot of restaurants, shops, pubs so there is always something to do.  It's also close to hop on bus stops.  We had no issues with noise in this busy location; we were on the third floor.  There is a nice lounge for drinks and light meals in the evening.  Also, the air conditioning was good by American standards, which is not guaranteed in Ireland. 

On the slightly negative side,  breakfast was included in our rate but was only adequate.  The eggs were oddly prepared and one time my husband's coffee was full of grounds. Our room and bathroom were very small, which some may not like.",4,2018,07,29
236,Great location and lovely hotel,"Lovely service, very nice 4 Star hotel in a perfect location.  All rooms slightly different.  Great residents lounge for guests only, a small cinema for occasional movies and private events, small fitness center, whiskey bar.
Views in many rooms not great.",5,2018,07,28
236,"Central, comfortable, and welcoming","OK, so I've now stayed here a handful of times.  Took me a minute to get acquainted with the location, which is quite central.  Grafton Street, the Green, plenty of restaurants and shopping a stone's throw away.  Starbucks is next door, if you need that fix.  And the Brooks maintains a small city hotel vibe - not the mammoth, trafficked lobby. And there's a car park right across the street.

My only issue was on one stay which went through late week into a weekend and my room faced the street - even though the chaos of Temple Bar is a few blocks away, you can hear (drunken) revelers and bottles on Thurs/Fri/Sat nights.  The hotel can't do anything about this (and I didn't see the literal mayhem one might witness, say, near the Weston), but just be aware of you might be a light sleeper or just arriving with some serious jet lag.

The front desk staff and bellman/concierge are friendly and efficient. Check in and check out are quick.

For guests, there's the slightly ""hidden"" library in the basement.  And there's also a screening room which can be booked, downstairs from the well-stocked (whiskey!) bar. There has been some upgrading going on, which is noticeable and welcome.

The rooms are quaint - without the in vogue pseudo-modern decor flashing up everywhere; it maintains a sense of tradition and comfort. As usual, I like to point out deep tubs - into which one must step to shower (so be careful and hold that rail, please). They are fitted with the right number of outlets, too, for all those devices people carry these days.  The WiFi is a bit tricky, as there are many different connecting points, but the speed is OK. Some of the wood and paneling is a bit nicked up from guests' luggage.

The breakfast layout is nice, with the usual cold buffet supplemented by a menu card with hot items, eggs, porridge (it's great!), etc.

I like the Brooks, especially its smaller size, and look forward to continuing my visits. It's a pleasant home away from home in Dublin, and a respite from the crowd.",4,2018,07,27
236,Good with some bad.,"We stayed here for 1 night in September as we toured around Ireland. We stayed here mainly because we had a rental car and they had a garage right across the street, making it easy to get in and out as well as bringing luggage to and from the car. We were greeted at the front and a bell hop took our luggage. Always a big fan of a hotel that gets your luggage right way....makes my life a lot easier. Attractive front lobby with well dressed and attentive staff. Our room was on the first floor and was pretty big for city standards. Plenty of room with all the amenities you need. Everything was very clean and smelled great. Rooms were pretty classic in their design, nothing exceptional about the rooms but nothing bad either. It’s a nice mid-range hotel, didn’t look cheap but didn’t wow me either. If you’re looking for that wow factor in your trip you might want to look elsewhere. However, being close and central to everything was key for us since we had around 24hrs to visit and see as much as we could. The hotel is close to pretty much everything so you can’t go wrong. 

The bad:
Air conditioning. It was on, but it didn’t go below 72, so not optimal for sleeping. My wife was pregnant at the time so having air conditioning that kept the room cold was key. Unfortunately they were full and told us everything was working fine and it doesn’t go any lower. Next up we tried opening the windows to see if cooler air was outside and maybe we’d get a draft. No such luck. It did make the room manageable, but unfortunately wasn’t the best for sleeping. 

Noise: 
Since we had the windows open (because we had no choice) the street noise was loud. The hotel is near a lot so there are people out until all hours of the night. Yelling etc. You know Dublin and it’s pubs. After the bars closed it got quiet for a couple of hours until the noise of traffic, street sweepers, garbage trucks etc. Needless to say we didn’t get much sleep that night.

So if you need your room to be cool then this is not the place for you. I don’t know if they fixed the air conditioning since then, but us Americans like our A/C. If you want a quiet room my guess is get a room not facing the street. 

Would I stay here again? Sure if they fixed the A/C and I had a non street facing room.",3,2018,07,26
236,Ideal Location for visiting Dublin,"The Brooks Hotel is in a PERFECT location to wander about and see Dublin.  Lots of nearby restaurants, virtually a 10 minute walk from just about anywhere. The staff was welcoming and made you feel at ease.  After checking in, we were met by Conor, who reserved our suitcases until we get into our room.  He made our stay one of our best. He is a musical conneiseur and we fun to hear his experiences and testing his knowledge!  The Irish people we met were very welcoming and Conor is a stellar example.  And the hotel had one of the comfortable beds ever.  Nespresso machine for early morning espresso and nice breakfast.  An elegant, traditional European experience.  Great place to start our 2 week adventure.",5,2018,07,25
236,Great stay in Dublin,"We stayed at the Brooks twice on our trip and we loved it both times!  It is in a great location on a quiet street near many restaurants, pubs and shopping, very close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  The breakfast was very good, with a buffet and made to order hot dishes and the bar was a great place to stop in the evening for a drink.  The staff were very sweet and helpful too.  My daughter left her ring on a nightstand and we realized this once we were at the airport!  I called the front desk and they mailed it to us.  Also, my parents were uncomfortable in their room, which was very warm during this summer's heat wave, and they were promptly moved to a cooler room.  In addition, my parents' electrical converter was not working, so they gave them one to use in Ireland.  We were all so grateful for their generosity!  We would stay again!",5,2018,07,25
236,Good place,"I was in Brooks hotel for three nights. Rooms are nice- not really big - clean and no noice from the street was getting in; hence, one could have a good sleep. By the way „good sleep“: they‘ve a nice pillow service. People are friendly; breakfast okay so all in all a good hotel, I can really recommend to go there. it’s „another good one amongst a lot of others“, but what again differentiats the brooks from others...? I didn‘t found out. ",4,2018,07,22
236,Elegant hotel in good location,"Everything about the hotel was top-notch.  The room was large and well-appointed, the staff were extremely helpful, and the public areas were beautiful.  A nice comfortable bar was a good place to relax.  Well-located with respect to restaurants and historic areas.",5,2018,07,21
236,Excellent service!,"Good location, polite and welcoming staff, clean and cosy rooms!

The iron machine from my room was not working; I asked for another one, which was promptly brought up to me but it was also broken : after plugging it, smoke came out from it and had to stop. Please check your electronics!

Otherwise, it was an excellent stay! I will definitely recommend this hotel!
Front desk: always smiling and prompt

There were 2 gentlemens in the lobby that were always helping us, asking us how we are, answering to our questions: good job!!!
Keep up the good work!!!",4,2018,07,21
236,"perfect location, helpful staff","Coming from overseas, we were operating on a jet lagged schedule, and early arrival time. The front desk staff was helpful; keeping our bags and suggesting nearby restaurants and shopping. The overnight staff was great at providing specific room service requests as we had some late nights. The location is amazing, we were able to walk to many of our destinations. I would certainly stay again if returning to Dublin.",5,2018,07,21
236,Ideal locality for restaurants and attractions,"Boutique hotel with attractive  decor and welcoming staff.  We had a comfortable  quiet room of good size and with good amenities and enjoyed excellent breakfast buffet with hot food cooked to order.   We were able to walk to all attractions which we had planned to visit and and also close to many restaurants, cafes and bars.   We will definitely stay here when next in Dublin.",5,2018,07,21
236,"Location, Location and Service to Boot","My wife and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel July 8-10. We were greeted with a friendy smile and a can-do attitude after a long flight from the states and the anxiety of drivng on the left side of the road from the airport. The front clerk was able to get us into a room within 30 minutes. Our room was clean, efficient and fitted our needs as was the property in general. We did eat breakfast one morning but otherwise was out walking the city every day. The location was within 5 minutes of Trinity, Temple Bar, and St Stephen Green. Parking was deeply discounted across the street from the hotel. We would recommend the Brooks to anyone, and we would return to it in the future.",5,2018,07,20
236,Great Stay,"Really enjoyed 2 night stay at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin. Staff so helpful, very keen to assist with directions and recommendations. Arranged reduced parking at nearby car park.

Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. ",4,2018,07,19
236,Fantastic!,"My family and I are just back after staying in Brooks Hotel and what a wonderful time we had. The hotel is in a great city centre location.

236,Traditional welcoming Hotel,"Very friendly, nothing too much trouble, very comfortable public areas, lovely well thought out rooms, clean and have everything that you need. Good old fashioned customer service. Would we stay there again? Definitely",4,2018,07,15
236,"Central, quiet, great service","We had a really nice stay at the Brooks. They have a tapas menu which worked great at dinner after a day of walking the city. We had a problem with the TV in the room which they handled very quickly. Room was cleaned daily and the evening turn down was a nice touch. All in all, we were quite satisfied with our stay.",5,2018,07,14
236,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at Brooks Hotel in Dublin for two nights. The staff were fantastic. Friendly and accommodating in every way. Special mention and sincere thanks to Fiona V and her manager Anne M. who made our stay exceptional. Good sized room and very clean, with wonderful toiletries. We ate breakfast all three mornings at Brooks and were very impressed with the quality and variety of the food.  We have stayed at many hotels in Europe and this hotel has been the best  yet. Centrally located and easy walking distance to numerous attractions, including Trinity College, St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Ha'Penny Bridge and so much more. Will definitely return. ",5,2018,07,13
236,Great hotel,"Can't say enough about Brooks. The staff were very helpful and our room was extremely comfortable - the bed was exactly to our liking. The breakfast were great, with lots of choice and large servings (you could probably skip lunch). Our room was on the first floor and yet it was still very quiet. Double thumbs up for the Brooks",5,2018,07,10
236,Great Location!,"We were very pleased with the location, our comfortable room and the wonderful staff of the Brooks Hotel. We stayed in Dublin for two days, following a 12 day cruise of Ireland and couldn't have picked a better hotel to launch all of our walking tours of Dublin. The majority of the things we wanted to see were within walking distance and we only had to take the taxi twice for longer distance sightseeing. The staff was so helpful. One of the ladies at the desk even quickly maneuvered my international electrical converter into the right configuration, with a smile. Sean at the consigliere's desk went above and beyond in helping me locate the home and church of my great grandparents, on his electronic map. I can't say enough about the friendliness and willingness to help, of all the staff members we encountered. Our room was very clean and comfortable and we enjoyed the breakfast served, which all contributed to the enjoyment of our stay.",5,2018,07,09
236,Pretty quiet and a wonderful location in Dublin with a reasonable rate...for Dublin,"Our group of 8 somewhat senior golfers from the US spent 4 nights at the Brooks Hotel.  We'd do it again, in a minute.  After two weeks in B&Bs in small towns (wonderful) we came to the big city.  First...Dublin is a happening place, and everyone downtown seems 25 and on their cell.  But, Dublin has gotten quite expensive.  The Brooks was certainly not cheap, but reasonable and has a wonderful location...tons of pubs and restaurants around the corner, and just far enough from Temple Bar (couple of blocks) to be reasonably quiet. A large shopping center is a block away, St Stephens Green two blocks and Trinity College about three.  The rooms were mid-sized and beds were great.  The entire hotel staff was SUPERB, friendly, helpful and accommodating.  We only ate one breakfast there and it was very good and pretty reasonable.  One evening we spent in the lounge listening to the piano.  From the Brooks, we traveled to four golf courses around Dublin.  It was helpful to have a coach and driver, otherwise getting out of the downtown, especially at rush hour, would be a challenge.  I don't know about parking if you are driving.  This is my fourth trip to Dublin and I've stayed at much more expensive places, but I've not enjoyed any more than the Brooks.",5,2018,07,09
236,Wonderful Dinner,"Hi a group of 4 friends went for drinks and then dinner at Brooks Hotel. Every member of staff in the bar was friendly, chatty and courteous. 

We had an amazing dinner - tapas to start. Sea Bass and Chicken Caesar Salad. We had a delicious cheese board with grapes and sliced apple.

Pat McLarnon is the Head Chef and he visited our table and is a dedicated master of culinary delights.

This was an amazing food night.",5,2018,07,08
236,Best holiday I've ever been on in my life,"Absolutely beautiful hotel inside and outside, amazingly friendly staff who helps take of your every need, comfortable beds, absolutely delicious and a beautiful variety of food , absolutely highly recommended",5,2018,07,07
236,Great location; excellent experience,"The location of this hotel was great and the staff could not have been more accommodating.   Conner was the ""mayor"" of the hotel, who helped arrange for car service, pointed out sights on the city map, advised on what pubs to frequent and even helped bring up the luggage to the room!   Enjoyable experience and I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Brooks Hotel on future trips to Dublin.",5,2018,07,06
236,Perfect location,"This hotel was very nice with a staff that was friendly and informative. The hotel was within walking distance to most everything we wanted to see. The breakfast was good with plenty of options. The hotel was trialing a ""handy"" phone that was free to use while staying. The ""handy"" phone was handy indeed in helping us navigate to the areas we wanted to go. Great experience for our family!",5,2018,07,05
236,Overall Perfection,"This hotel combines the best of everything you would want out of a trip: excellent staff, better location, and boutique charm to top it off. The hotel was within walking distance (5-10 minutes) of pretty much everything you would want to see in Dublin. It is on a pretty quite street, but with the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar and local pubs only steps away. It is not a chain hotel, which is a blessing or a curse depending on what you like. With that, it blends a historical and traditional hotel feeling with modern interior design and luxuries, including pillow choice and turn down service. Parking is only 12 euros a night directly across the straight, which is rare and a steal in Europe. To top it all off, the staff are amazing! The front desk staff were very polite, professional, and very knowledgeable about Dublin. The concierge, Conner, immediately learned our names and provided that extra touch you would expect from a boutique hotel. 

Overall, perfection. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone going to Dublin",5,2018,07,05
236,Great,"Staff at reception were efficient, informative and acknowledged my SLH membership.  We were generously offered a very comfortable deluxe room with a welcome plate of fruit.  Staff and management were also quite attentive, calling us not long after settling-in to ensure everything was ok and promptly attending to a minor electrical issue. 
 Made use of the small gym downstairs that had an adjoining sauna (and where one can find towels to use in the gym). A pity the hotel's cinema didn't have any screenings during our 5 night stay. Breakfast was good with a decent selection.  Brooks has a very convenient location; close to shops, restaurants, pubs and a short walk to St Stephens Green, Luas stop and Temple Bar.  ",5,2018,07,04
236,Perfect spot,Lovely hotel central to everything.  Very helpful staff and the best  check in I’ve experienced.  Great breakfast with plenty of options.  Loved the extra touch of staff being decked up for Bloomsday and the themed scavenger hunt.,5,2018,07,02
236,Wow,"Stayed both of our Dublin's days here at the Brooks hotel.   Remarkable stay here - everything could not have been better.  Unbelievably quiet given its location; service second to none and room was so pleasant.  Many walkable places from here including our hop-on, hop-off tour.  We loved this smaller, boutique hotel and would definitely stay here again if we come back.",5,2018,07,01
236,Most amazing staff ever,"The Brooks hotel is fantastic, the rooms are great and the staff are excellent. Fiona on reception was really helpful and Shane the concierge is probably one of the funniest guys ever!! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,01
236,Wonderful Hotel & Location,"This hotel is conveniently located near many restaurants, pubs and shops and is in within walking distance to just about any place you would like to go. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable.  It had all of the amenities that you could want and was cheerfully decorated.  Breakfast in the restaurant was wonderful and very filling. Really liked the ability to get around from the hotel easily.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,06,27
236,Perfect spot from which to explore Dublin!,"We stayed 4 nights and were there for Bloomsday.  Service was great, very helpful with cabs. Great location, close to Trinity College, O'Connell bridge, Temple Bar, and window shopping.  Room very comfortable.  We were happy to have AC as it was very warm!",5,2018,06,26
236,Great Stay!,"We spent four nights at the Brooks and had a fabulous time.  The hotel is well situated which makes it easy to walk to most attractions, shops and restaurants.  It is also just a short walk from the Airport bus.   While It is an older hotel, our room was spacious and extremely comfortable. The breakfast was great - especially the scones!  We also had dinner at their restaurant.  The food was wonderful and I would highly recommend the berry cheesecake.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful!  They even arranged a driver to the cruise port.   Overall, staying at the Brooks really enhanced our first visit to Dublin.  Highly recommend!  We will be back!",5,2018,06,26
236,Excellent,"A very cosy, friendly hotel, right in the heart of Temple Bar (and priced accordingly!). No distance to a multitude of eateries and attractions.
Courteous staff. 
Nice spacious, comfortable rooms, though no views to speak of.
Great breakfast, with waiter service.
Bar area/ lounge pleasantly comfortable, uncrowded and not noisy, with no distracting television. 
Recommended for a special occasion.",5,2018,06,26
236,Enjoyed our stay!,"Stayed 2 nights here recently & i would highly recommend!  After arriving from the US, the staff was wonderful helping us get our bearings, find somewhere to eat & get us into our rooms.  Breakfast was good.  Our room was much bigger than we expected.  Very good location for pubs, shops & short walk to Trinity College.",5,2018,06,25
236,Favorite place to Stay in Dublin,"This was our second stay at the Brooks and it was as good as the first.  The location of the hotel is excellent and provides a great base for the many wonderful attractions in Dublin.  The rooms have a classic charm.  They are well appointed and very quiet. The very nice rooms are a compliment to the great staff at this hotel. From the room attendants, to reception, to the wait staff in the restaurant, they are all outstanding.  I would also recommend including breakfast in your reservation, a great way to start your day.",5,2018,06,23
236,Great Stay at Brooks Hotel!,"We stayed here for 6 nights in May.  Absolutely loved this hotel. We stayed in a Classic room with breakfast included in our rate.  The room was clean, comfortable bed, with ample amount of storage.  Also, the air conditioning worked very well(lucked out with warm sunny weather).   It was so quiet-we didn’t hear any noise in the hallway or from the street.  Hard to believe considering this fantastic location! Breakfast was worth getting.  There are a selection of buffet items including: cheeses, meats, cereals, yogurts etc among other things.  The in house made sourdough bread was so good. Also had great coffee.  The rest of the items are made to order such as scrambled eggs etc.  My husband loved the traditional Irish breakfast and oatmeal with whiskey.  I also liked the crepes with orange sauce.  

This hotel is in the heart of everything, yet is tucked in away on a quiet side street. Staff is friendly and very helpful.  Connor is also a real asset to the team—he will help you plan your trip with many suggestions for things to do, restaurants etc.  There are so many restaurants and shops around Brooks Hotel.  Liked the lunch specials we found at The Market Bar and Metro cafe.  The Hairy Lemon next door is fantastic!

When we return to Ireland, this is where we will definitely stay!",5,2018,06,20
236,Great Centrally Located Hotel,"After arriving at the hotel at 8:00 a.m. after a flight from the U.S., we were pleasantly surprised that they had a room available for us.  The doorman was gracious and informative. He gave us suggestions where to go and to watch our purse and wallet when walking around Dublin, especially the Temple Bar district.  Breakfast was very good with an excellent suggestion.  I would definitely stay there again. Yes, it was a pricey place to stay, but all of Dublin is expensive stay in.",5,2018,06,19
236,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,"The staff, the waiters and the reception could not have been nicer. We arrived too early for registration but they had our room ready. I couldn’t believe it. The room was large and nicely decorated and the bathroom was gorgeous. The location was perfect. Could not have been more convenient. We loved our stay here.",5,2018,06,19
236,DUBLIN,Loved the hotel. Modern and tastefully decorated. Rooms good size. Terrific location. Right in the middle of all the activity.  Staff wonderfully helpful and pleasant. Great Irish hospitality. Would certainly stay again. ,5,2018,06,19
236,Okay... ,"Alright, so let’s start by saying that apparently, hotels in Dublin are very expensive. I am glad to know that, it will tone down my review a bit. We paid 350 euros a night on a weekend, which I find very overpriced for a 4 star hotel, but apparently it’s common here. So, our room was big, extremely clean, so was the bathroom, which although not modern was not outdated either. Everything was functional in the room. Good breakfast. The staff at the reception desk and room service was kind. 
Downsides: no functioning WiFi in our room (4th floor), noisy air conditioning system outside right below our windows. We asked for a room change, and we never heard back... they apologized for that at the end of the trip, but it was too late obviously. 
Not sure we will be back though. I do find it overpriced for the value... ",3,2018,06,17
236,Ireland Vacation ,"Great central location to all tourist sights. The staff are attentive and friendly. We stayed at two separate occasions and the first time we stayed we had a quirky tiny bathroom, the second time a much nicer updated room, with a good bathroom. The bed is comfortable and they have a pillow menu which is a great perk! They provide a in-room instant teapot but no coffee maker. We did not care for the hot breakfast items, which are included in the price. The items on the buffet are decent but we opted to go out for breakfast instead. I would recommend this hotel despite the breakfast as the location, staff and rooms are quite nice. Just as for an updated room. Good value for the price.",4,2018,06,12
236,Great hotel in a great location,"We stayed 4 nights at this wonderful hotel.  The rooms were spacious.  The staff was very helpful and very professional.  The breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is located near St. Stephen’s Greene, Graphton Street, The Liffey and the pubs!  The hotel provided you with a smartphone for your use in and out of the hotel.  It was very helpful with navigating our way around this great city.  Hope to return!",5,2018,06,11
236,"Great stay, great location ","Stayed for two nights, great from start to finish. 
Check in was efficient and our rooms were ready early (13.00). 

Spacious, very comfortable room.  Clean and modern decor, lovely bathroom with great lighting. Good a/c and a seriously big tv!  
The bed was really comfy and pillow menu is always a nice touch. 

A great choice of hot and cold food at breakfast and good service.  Service all over the hotel was fabulous. 

The location just couldn’t be better.  

I’ll definitely stay again if in Dublin and would highly recommend ",5,2018,06,10
236,Absolutely wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights on the last leg of our Ireland tour. It was a wonderful place to end our trip. It's in a great area of Dublin where you can easily walk to many attractions. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Our room was quite comfortable and clean. There are many fine touches such excellent wifi, computer and printer use and a pillow menu. The breakfast dining area is lovely with a large selection of delicious breakfast items. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin. Wonderful comfortable place to stay.",5,2018,06,09
236,What a wonderful & friendly hotel,"My husband booked us a 3 day break in Dublin staying at Brooks Hotel . It was to celebrate my 50th birthday. When we arrived early on the Friday morning we were checked in early & they offered to keep our cases till our room was ready . When we did check in our cases were already in our room & a lovely surprise was awaiting me , a lovely birthday cake , thank you . The staff were all very friendly & nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious with a great variety to choose from. The room was very comfortable & clean with some nice little touches. We had a fabulous time in Dublin helped by a very comfortable stay at Brooks hotel. Thank you for helping to make my birthday treat so special. 
",5,2018,06,06
236,Wonderful facility in the centre of a wonderful city,"This is in the middle of everything but quiet enough to feel relaxed in a vibrant city, a luxury feel hotel, with warm and welcoming staff who give the extra atttention to detail to ensure your every requirement is catered for, very clean and tidy including the commununial areas and corridors which get over looked in other hotels, if i go back to dublin i will book the Brook's Hotel directly without a doubt",5,2018,06,05
236,This Hotel checks all the boxes,"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying at this hotel.  Initially booked a 4-night stay, and then extended it to 9 nights.  The staff was very kind and professional.    Great location to the highlights of Dublin, yet far enough away from the noise of the Temple Bar area.  My first choice for accommodations if I choose to return some day, which I hope to do.  Ireland is lovely.",5,2018,06,04
236,Not as good as you might expect,This hotel is well placed in the center of Dublin which means it is in the middle of a lot of tall buildings and parking garages - do not expect a view from your window.  We had problems with the plumbing and the rooms are not very large.  Staff were pleasant but we certainly experienced much better elsewhere on our trip.  If you need a taxi allow a lot of extra time - we ordered the day before but inevitably had to wait for upwards of 30 minutes after the due time for the taxi to arrive. Bar ok. Restaurant ok.,3,2018,06,04
236," ","Loved this hotel. Easy to walk around the city, but far enough to avoid the craziness of temple bar area.  There is a laundromat around the corner which was very convenient.  Breakfast was very good. Would stay here again! ",5,2018,06,01
236,Exceeded Expectations!,"This hotel was great! Right away, the staff was extremely friendly, and got us checked in early so we could rest after our long flight! The bed was very comfortable and the rooms were nice. We had a rental car for the remainder of our trip around Ireland, but this location was nice and central so we were able to walk anywhere we needed to go during our stay in Dublin. Breakfast was great as well!",5,2018,06,01
236,Great small hotel in the center of the city,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel with my mother and 2 teenagers. We drove in from the West and were able to park directly across the street before returning the car. The hotel is in Drury Street and conveniently located to everything! We walked to St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, Trinity Bar, The National Museum of Archeology and loads of restaurants and shops. I wish we had more time in Dublin to experience the great neighborhood we were in. The rooms are very well appointed, the bar is one of the best whiskey bars in the city and the service is wonderful. The restaurant was only open on weekends and breakfast is 12 euro per person. We decided to grab some breakfast at one of the coffee shops nearby. There are several Starbucks and a few local roasters like Kaaf. One of the best part was having a pillow menu upon check-in...very nice touch. I can't wait to stay here again soon.",5,2018,05,30
236,Very nice hotel in a perfect location,"Comfortable room, excellent bed. Staff were excellent, location is perfect. No parking of their own, but their guest rate at the garage right across the street was very reasonable (1/3rd the normal 24 hr rate).",5,2018,05,28
236,Great!,"Great location! Great staff, that were always ready to assist and answer any questions. The food was great. The rooms were a great size and everything was very clean. It’s not far from several great locations in Dublin! ",5,2018,05,28
236,Great central hotel,Stayed here with my family - ranging in age between 17 and 77. It was great for everyone. Easy access to restaurants and pubs and a short walk to Trinity College. Breakfast was good and we ate a great meal in the lounge one night waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Front desk staff were very helpful. Parking may be the only issue - but not an issue we dealt with. No reservations recommending this hotel. ,5,2018,05,28
236,Walk to everything fun,"The Brooks is a great venue for walking to major feasting, drinking, & people watching. It is walking distance to theaters & bus tour stops as well. 
The staff we met at check in, the restaurant for breakfast & at check were very accommodating. 
Our room was not large but the bed & the toiletries/ towels were ample. They even offered 3 pillow selection styles from which to choose.  The turn down service leaves a tasty mint on your pillow. 
They really go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. 
We did not rent a car but I noticed a parking garage across the street if needed. 
There is no need to rent a car in Dublin. Busses are as prolific as rabbits & are easy to catch. The front desk can order a taxi if needed. 
Two thumbs up! ",5,2018,05,27
236,Loved this hotel,"I loved the time that we spent in this hotel. Staff were great . The room was very comfortable and I loved the toiletries  that were supplied.  Breakfast was most enjoyable.
The only negative thing that I have to say is that I thought the prices of coffees and sandwiches were very expensive.",4,2018,05,26
236,"Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, extensive breakfast","Staff were very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay.  The room was very well presented with a good selection of toiletries.  There is a very small fridge (no freezer) but bar staff are happy to provide ice in a bucket on request.  There are not many power points in the room and you cannot use the lamp outlet beside the bed (special round pins).  Reception provided a power board which was useful but doesn’t stretch far enough for power beside the bed.  The handy phone included with the room is excellent if you don’t have your own mobile data.  Beware of the 2 light switches by the bathroom door if you don’t want to accidentally turn all the room lights on at night when you only want the bathroom.

Housekeeping visit each evening to ensure all is well and bring chocolate!

The breakfast buffet has an excellent variety of foods, including a gluten free section, with hot food cooked to order.  I found the banana bread to be dry and tasteless which is good as there was so much else to tempt me!

The fitness room is very small with only one treadmill.  There is water available but no towels.  The official open time is 7am but we were told it might be open earlier.",5,2018,05,24
236,Brooks Hotel,"Beautiful hotel on a cozy one way street with Chinese lanterns overhead. Very central to things to see and do. Great shopping Mall at the end of the street. Room was wonderful and very clean, beds super comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was great, lots to choose from. Nice staff",5,2018,05,23
236,Welcome return after 15 years,"We stayed at this hotel 15 years ago and promised to return. Didn't mean to leave so long. Hotel location is ideal base to see Dublin, just off Grafton St and a 5 min walk from St Stephens Green. The standard of hotel is excellent. Staff are friendly and helpful. If you need guidance on what to do or restaurant recommendations then make sure you see Conor. We will return hopefully before 15 years!",5,2018,05,23
236,"Nice hotel, very centrally located, we had a great time in Dublin!","We spent 5 nights at the Brooks Hotel, breakfast was included in our rate.  The hotel is well located and it's an easy walk to many of the sites and parks in Dublin.  And the Hairy Lemon Pub, which is a great Irish Pub, is right up the street.  There are also many other restaurants in the area.  Overall, service at the Brooks is good; the staff at the front reception desk are especially helpful and friendly, every one of them.  

Our room was a fairly typical hotel room (very clean) with a king bed, 2 side chairs with a table in the middle, a decent sized bathroom with a tub/shower combination and good bath amenities.  There is an elevator in the hotel.  There's also the breakfast room area which doubles as the restaurant area for dinner.  This is a little odd as it's next to the reception area; during dinner time (but not breakfast) it feels a little like you're dining in an extension of the lobby.  There is a bar area just beyond this room, which has quite a bit of seating, as well as an actual bar.

Breakfast is very good.  There are lots of options at the buffet, the breads are great, as are the scones.  They didn't have cream out for the scones, but if you ask, they will bring you some cream.  There is also a hot breakfast that you can order from the menu.  There are quite a few choices, all of which were very good.

We did have dinner here once, in Francesca's Restaurant, at the aforementioned breakfast and dinner area.  I had the Sunshine Pasta which I thought was just delicious!  I even made it once we returned home.  It wasn't quite the same but it was still pretty good.  My husband had a burger which he said was good.

The first night we were at the Brooks, we had drinks at the bar.  The bartender was a young man who was very pleasant and friendly.  I don't have his name but the receipt indicated a Night Te...I have no idea if that was his name.  My husband forgot his jacket at the bar and the young man called us, then brought the jacket up to our room.  That was a really kind thing to do.  We never saw this young man at the bar area again, but no one else bartending, while we were at the Brooks, was particularly pleasant.  

We enjoyed our stay at the Brooks Hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to Dublin.",4,2018,05,21
236,Stay was wonderful from the first person to greet us.,"The wife and I were lucky enough to stay at the Brooks earlier this month.  From the first person to greet us which was Conner the door man everyone was more that helpful.  They always had a smile.  
Check in was a breeze.  We had gotten there pretty early and they had no rooms available but took our luggage and stored it.  After some touring we returned to the Brooks and it was brought to the room.
In the evening we went to the bar and the bartender, and I will try to spell his name, Yatzik was very helpful with tasting some wonderful whiskey.  And they have a great selection I might add.
The room was very clean and in good repair.  Everything was very comfortable.  The pillow selection was excellent.  The toiletries were very nice.
The location was perfect.  Plenty of places to eat and drink and visit.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go.
Breakfast was quick and plentiful.  Lots of choices.
If we return to Dublin the Brooks will be our first choice for hotels.  Thanks everyone",5,2018,05,21
236,Drury St. is closer than you think,"Guests were just starting to eat breakfast when we checked in at 7;15 AM.  Our room was ready as we always reserve and pay for the previous night's stay since we arrive in Europe so early.  This makes our room available for a shower and breakfast and a great start to our holiday. We found the breakfast offerings to be vast and quite wonderful

This was our first stay at the Brooks and found the accommodations, food, and staff to be  first class.",5,2018,05,16
236,"Great hotel, fantastic staff","Room was very comfortable, with some issues....the bath tap handle was loose (not even attached actually) do any bathing was via shower. Also the extractor didn't work and the shaving mirror was alarmingly loose (we chemotherapeutic because it wasnt that important to us (room 107)). Despite that, the room was comfortable and obvious care was used when the cleaners came in daily. The staff were lovely, the breakfasts were delicious, we had a great stay.",5,2018,05,13
236,"Very nice, good splurge","We stayed for the first two nights of our trip. The hotel is located on a quiet street in  between everything we wanted to see and close to bus stops. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was delicious. The buffet was substantial and cooked to order items looked great too. For a splurge, we are solid 3 diamond BW types, we got our money’s worth.",5,2018,05,11
236,Excellent Stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 8-night stay at the Brooks Hotel. We used Dublin as our home base from which we explored this great city and took day trips further afield. For this, the Brooks Hotel is extremely well located. We found that, while it is very close to most attractions, it wasn't on a mainstream tourist route, so that was nice.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the room more than adequate. We really liked using the smart phone that the hotel makes available to its guests! We used it extensively for google maps and it certainly assisted us in getting around. 
The morning breakfast was a great start to each of our days. For early morning risers like us, breakfast starts at 7 am on weekdays and at 7:30 am on weekends. We opted to have our breakfast included and this allows you to choose from both the buffet and the made to order menu. We found the service at breakfast to be exemplary. We found the choice of breakfast items met our needs quite well.  
Every member of the hotel staff that we met was friendly and extremely helpful. They were all about trying to meet their guests needs.
We would definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2018,05,10
236,A great boutique hotel right in the center of the town!,"The hotel sits on a small street off of the main areas. The staff were very friendly and helpful in getting us tours and taxis and in offering advice on eating and shopping.
The rooms are quite small as is the bathroom but they are well appointed. The location is absolutely perfect for walking to most everything including Grafton Street, Stephens Green and the Dublin Castle. We were also able to pick up our tour buses within a short walk. I would stay here again especially because of the location and friendly staff.",4,2018,05,08
236,Private cinema surprise ,"We visited the brooks hotel yesterday to use there private cinema. It was perfect from start to finish . The staff were so helpful and even got us a last minute bottle of prosecco that we had forgot to exclude in our booking . Definitely recommend this private cinema for birthdays, stag hen party’s , even viewing your wedding videos. You can bring your own dvd , we watched old family movies for our dads 60th birthday surprise. Can’t that the staff at brooks enough for a great experience and we will definitely be back .

236,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel while in Dublin and it was a great hotel right in the center of everything. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel was clean and lovely. Our first room we got upgraded to a deluxe room on the 4th floor. It was spacious with a queen and another smaller bed (single maybe?). There wasn't a view but we didn't care. The bathroom was nice as well. Our second room (we went to Galway in the middle of the week) was a standard room but did include a king sized bed which was nice. The bathroom was smaller but did include a tub unlike the first. This room was on the 4th floor on front of the hotel, so still no view but it was noisier, although this did not bother us. Both rooms were nicely furnished and beds were comfortable. They also provide a wide range of pillows to choose from during your stay. Bonus: they provide full sized hair dryers in each room (they're hiding in the desk drawer). The only downside to this hotel is the expensive breakfast. It's not included unless you pay more and if you don't it's 12,50 euros per person. It's a buffet or limited menu to order from. My advise, there's a place right around the corner (Taste Company?) that offers a great breakfast menu that has great prices. Other than the breakfast, everything at the Brooks Hotel was great.",4,2018,05,07
236,It’s only a 4-star if it’s out of 10,"Very disappointing stay - everyone likes the location, which is central, but that’s it for the positives.   The staff, like the hotel promise a lot but don’t deliver.  The web site says direct booking may check in early at noon - this didn’t happen, in spite of an email notice a week early.   The web site says all rooms have King beds - also not true.   The tub/shower arrangement is old, unsafe and allows water to ruin the wooden sides of the tub (who thought of that!) and flow onto the floor.  Toilets don’t all work.  Web site promises turn down service — most nights it doesn’t happen.  

Find another centrally located hotel!",2,2018,05,07
236,perfect boutique city hotel,"Clean modern boutique hotel situated a few steps from the center of the (quiet end of) Temple Bar.  Dining, bar, and common space flows from the front desk, which captures the hospitality of Ireland.  The rooms were clean and well appointed.  We would stay no where else in Dublin.",5,2018,05,06
236,Brilliant Brooks,"I was very impressed with my recent stay in Brooks Hotel.  Not within my normal price range but I needed somewhere close to Dublin Castle - and for this it was great.  It was also excellently located for shops and eating too.  My room was tremendously comfortable and well furnished. Great sleep, and I was permitted to choose from four different pillow types! Immaculately  clean in room and bathroom.  My breakfast was stunning.  It was not just the range but the quality of food provided. Their home-made sourdough bread - wow.  I also ate dinner in their lounge/bar.  Again excellent and well priced.  Staff were all very nice.  I only deducted one star as the room is very expensive and the TV reception in the room was poor (though not too important).   I would like to stay there again, so will keep an eye out for deals.  ",4,2018,05,03
236,Very Nice Centrally located ,"Verry attentive staff. Within easy walking distance of many sites in Dublin. Good bar 
and close to many restaurants and pubs. Rooms are comfortable, great breakfast I would highly recomend this hotel.",5,2018,05,03
236,great surprise,"I have been coming through Dublin for years on my way to Kilkenny, but have just discovered Brooks Hotel and what a lovely surprise. Firstly its a great location, very central, but tucked away and discreet. Just round the corner from the Gaiety Theatre showing The Plough and Stars which is a fantastic production and just transferred from the Lyric in London. On the edge of Stephens Green and close to all attractions. The food was of a high standard and well priced. The staff are great and must thank Dermot for making all the arrangements. If you are looking for a friendly hotel with high standards and no pretentions then Brooks is for you and now a firm favourite of mine",5,2018,04,30
236,Wonderful hotel,"Great location, great service, great people! Connor, the concierge was so welcoming and helpful. Most sites, shopping, restaurants, etc. within easy walking distance. We would definitely recommend and return.",5,2018,04,27
236,"Uh-Oh, What Have I Done?","Arrival is a bit scary as one is likely to think I have made a terrible mistake to book at this establishment. The hotel sits on a narrow street directly opposite an unattractive parking garage. The ground-level exterior and interior of the hotel is in desperate need of paint and fix. The modest exterior entry door is chipped and scarred. The interior is not dated so much as really old looking shabby. The reception desk and the very visible equipment rooms behind it percent a disheartening ‘welcome’. Ground-level bar is a real downer – think hinterland 1950. Doorman not in attendance most of the time. Hot water cycles through hot to cold to hot every 25 seconds, a real bummer. The pluses are: lovely staff, clean spacious rooms, terrific location with many restaurants within a few hundred feet and major sites within walking distance. This place needs a new owner with €500,000 and a good designer would rocket this hotel into a top four-star facility. Recommend the Hairy Lemon pub/restaurant just around the corner. See my review.",3,2018,04,26
236,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Location","Chose this hotel to stay in Dublin but also for a trip to Punchestown Races. The location is just perfect, central but away from Temple Bar. Everything is within easy reach. It was my birthday whilst we were here and although it wasn't mentioned to any of the staff, on seeing my birthday cards we arrived back to the room later that day to find a birthday note and a lovely cupcake on the table.
The staff at the hotel are all lovely, Conner went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. 
The room was very spacious and clean, bed very comfortable and there is even a pillow menu.
Lots to choose from for breakfast, all in all we wouldn't hesitate to come here again or recommend to others",5,2018,04,25
236,Irish Hospitality,"We stayed here for several nights last month.  Centrally located, we were able to walk to most of the sights we wanted to visit.  Excellent complimentary breakfast each morning. Loved the evening turn down service complete with chocolates on the pillow and chocolate chip cookies!  The staff knew our names by the end of the first day!  The service was just the best. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful.  Special shout out to Shane Donnelley who went above and beyond to help us track down a place to break a 500 euro note!   We would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others!",5,2018,04,24
236,"Elegant, understated lodging","You are only a ten minute walk away from everything interesting in Dublin at the Brooks. Smallish rooms, exquisitely furnished. In-room and restaurant dining options. Very nice public area. Great concierge service. Excellent proximity to restaurants. Stayed there twice on this trip.",5,2018,04,23
236,Great Location in Dublin,"This small hotel in Dublin has a great location, yet its still just off the beaten path. You are  within just a few minutes walking of some of the most popular attractions and pubs in Dublin, as well as the Hop On Hop Off Bus tours. The hotel is very clean, has a great breakfast and the staff is the most friendly and helpful you will find. We will definitely staff here again.",5,2018,04,23
236,A Gem in a great location,"This hotel is really in the center of everything and it's lovely to boot.  Great staff and nicely appointed rooms.  We stayed here for two nights and enjoyed it.  We added breakfast and thought that it was worth the money.  We had flown in from the US and arrived early before the rooms were ready.  They had a lounge on the lower level that had a number of couches and chairs where we could relax until our room was ready.  

Most of the hotels that we stayed at, with one exception, had coffee in the room composed of an electric kettle and instant coffee.  The Brooks provided an in-room safe for valuables and numerous pillows and bathrobes and nice bathroom products.  You can't go wrong here.",5,2018,04,21
236,Location Location Location!!!,"Perfectly situated off Grafton Street. Safe. Most everything is a walkable distance. Staff knows you the very first day! Each time I stay in Dublin this is my first, best and only choice. Breakfast.....incredible!!! Room.... clean, comfortable and luxurious! Staff is superb! 
I ran into a couple of issues and the Staff was super helpful. 
It’s like going home.",5,2018,04,20
236,Loved this hotel!!,"We just got back from a trip to Ireland and stayed 2 nights at the Brooks Hotel. Great location, central to everything, and the staff was amazing. I would recommend staying here, and if we go back we will be staying there. 

Our luggage didn't make it on the plane with us but the hotel staff was so helpful in the mean time. They also sent us to the Hairy Lemon Pub around the corner and it turned out to be our favorite from the whole trip.",5,2018,04,18
236,Best place in Central Dublin ,"We are starting a three week tour of Ireland with friends and have spent a couple of days on our own in Dublin. The Brooks hotel is near Trinity College and about a fifteen minute walk to the Temple Bar area on the Liffy River. It is centrally located within walking distance to all the major sites in central Dublin. 
The hotel is a GEM. The staff are friendly, extremely attentive and completely competent. Their suggestions have been spot on about sites to see and places to eat, almost like having your own tour guide. The concierge, Conner, is the perfect host. Great sense of humor and purpose. He has made our stay here exceptional. I am sad to say goodbye. 
The rooms are attractive, well appointed and clean. There is a nice restaurant just off the lobby and the breakfast is wonderful, with choices of either a Continental breakfast buffet or s cooked to order Irish breakfast. 
I highly recommend the Brooks Hotel and would definitely stay here on any future trips to  Dublin. ",5,2018,04,18
236,Excellent accommodation in great location at moderate cost,"Brooks is very well situated, close to Grafton, Temple Bar, Trinity and St. Patrick's.  Easy walking to restaurants and attractions.  Rooms are very nice, service was excellent and breakfast was tops.  Price was moderate.  Great place to stay.  ",5,2018,04,16
236,Excellent customer service,"The hotel was wonderful. Very up to date, comfortable beds in lovely rooms. Excellent breakfast. The thing that really set this hotel apart was the customer service. In addition to allowing us to have breakfast the morning we arrived after an overnight flight (we were leaving too early the next am to have breakfast), the hotel staff handled a mistake we made that could have ruined the trip beautifully. We inadvertently left our passports locked in the safe in our room on the morning we departed and didn't realize it until we had left Dublin. We frantically called the hotel, and the man who was working at the desk reassured me that he would handle everything. He got the passports out of the safe, got the name of the hotel we would be at a few days down the line in a different city, put the passports into guaranteed mail, called the other hotel to make sure they would be expecting the package coming in the mail. And although they did not have to do it, they called me back to reassure me that it had all been taken care pf, and then sent me an email with the tracking number of the package so that I would know they arrived. They truly saved the vacation and I appreciated it greatly. ",5,2018,04,14
236,Very nice hotel,"Very nice comfortable hotel in a great location. Bed extremely comfortable. It has a small gym which is a big plus. Nice buffet breakfast. My only quibble was that I asked for some mushrooms and grilled tomatoes as I did not want a full vegetarian breakfast- I was brought literally half a mushroom and half a tomato! This looked very lonely in the middle of a large plate. I wasn't paying but I hope this did not cost 19.95€. Apart from this disappointment, very happy.",4,2018,04,13
236,Wonderful visit,"Great location within walking distance to almost everywhere!  From the minute you walk into the hotel you are heartily welcomed.  Conor is the best concierge ever who has been there like 40 years!  Rooms a little on the small side, but so what?  They were impeccably clean and well-serviced.  Hotel provides complimentary ""Handy Phones"" in all rooms. You can make up to 5 international complimentary phone calls and use the handy phone like your own cell phone.  I signed up for Small Luxury Hotel awards program, and when you do this, breakfast is included daily.  Very hospitable staff.  I'm a travel agent and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or refer the Brooks Hotel to my clients if looking for a nice 4 star property!",5,2018,04,11
236,Good service but breakfast not included,"Fine room and good service.
Breakfast first included then not. No control of hou eat breakfast.
WiFi not good.
Location very good.
old hotel. need renovation soon.
Dublin is a nice town.
No more to say.",4,2018,04,11
236,A Pleasure!,"Loved this hotel. Nice location, lively, but not crazy. Staff was friendly, professional. Kind of an old world elegance to the place, but the accomodations are quite up to par. The bar/restaurant was good. We had drinks after sightseeing, and breakfast there. The only downside, a minor one,  was the TV,  the lack of any interesting channels. Returning to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, though, was like a coming home to a comfy place.  I recommend this hotel highly. I would love to go back.",5,2018,04,10
236,Lovely hotel,Stayed here the weekend with my Fiancé. Location was excellent with some great restaurants and bars nearby. Staff were very friendly and helpful and we recieved a complementary room upgrade. The room itself was well finished and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent and i really enjoyed it. Setting us up for the day.  I will be back,5,2018,04,03
236,"Centrally located, exquisitely friendly and helpful staff, with beautiful rooms","You can’t do better than Brooks hotel when in Dublin. Perfect location just steps away from many sights. Parking lot across the street. Exquisite breakfast. Piano player in the bar in the evenings was such a delight as was the food. We intended to go out to dinner, heard the music and went no further. So thrilled we chose this hotel.",5,2018,04,03
236,Stunning quite professional performance,"From the first to the last staff everything is discrete, present and caring - starting from entering the Hotel, at the reception, during breakfirst and dining, in the bar at night and when we early left: this is a Hotel of the uppermost class of Quality. We loved to be there. We felt taken care of. We felt like being at home. It was a wonderful experience. Thank you, Brooks!",5,2018,04,02
236,Excellent hotel for a vacation base.,"If Brooks is in your price range I highly recommend it.   My wife and I have stayed here twice now on different vacations.  This is a fine hotel, very comfortable with a friendly staff that makes for an easy and restful stay after long flights and is not too far from the airport or train station.  My wife and I really love that the hotel is central in Dublin and makes walking to the tourist sights, pubs and restaurants very easy and safe.   

Our favorite restaurant this trip and last is the Red Hen, one block to the North.  Friendly and talkative staff with excellent Irish local food.  Great Lamb, beef and seafood.  We enjoy sitting at the bar and talking with the people. 

Another helpful hint.  If you are a sports fan, check out hurling!!   We had the opportunity to attend Gaelic FB and Hurling at Croke park.  This was a highlight of the trip and we are now big fans.  

We'll be back!",5,2018,04,02
236,Stylish and pleasant,We were there this last summer to visit Dublín and we got satisfied with the hotel and the service. Excellent breakfasts and superb location in a cozy area plenty of little shops restaurants and  behind the Temple Bar area,5,2018,04,02
236,"Great location, fabulous hotel","This was not our first visit to Dublin and we booked into the Brooks Hotel due to its very central location as we knew we would be out and about around the city during our time there.  What a find!   From the minute we arrived when the wonderful concierge (Conor O'Connell) welcomed us into the foyer and the friendly reception staff checked us in, we were made to feel special and at home.
The hotel itself is beautiful, very well maintained and our room was large with every amenity one could wish for.   The standard of housekeeping during our four night stay was excellent and the turn down service each evening was another welcome addition to the experience. 
Breakfast was either continental (plenty of choice, cold meats, cheese, eggs and a lovely array of breads, pastries etc) or full Irish (the sausages were wonderful!).
We would be more than happy to stay again at this lovely hotel, just a few minutes walk to the hustle and bustle of the City (but no noise!)   Big plus points - exemplary customer service, lovely rooms, great location.  Try it when you visit Dublin!",5,2018,03,31
236,Perfect St Patrick's Day Weekend,"I arrived at the Brook's Hotel the day before St. Patrick's Day, so the city was buzzing and the hotel was busy. The staff were quick to check us in and the concierge was amazingly friendly and helpful. Our room was a good size considering the hotel is in the heart of the city. Speaking of - you cannot beat the location. Everything Dublin has to offer is at your finger tips from this hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, so I cannot attest to the quality of the food. I would recommend for anyone looking for a really solid place to stay in the heart of Dublin.",5,2018,03,30
236,Great Place,"Centralized location, very friendly staff.  The room was comfortable.  I really liked how friendly everyone was.  If you’re looking for a place that allows you to be within walking distance of almost everything, here is the place you want to stay ",5,2018,03,28
236,Lovely ,"My mother, sister, and I stayed at this hotel for three nights. Upon arrival, we felt very welcomed and comfortable. There is a lounge downstairs where you can rest and bathrooms close by to freshen up after a flight and journey. We didn't realize we booked a double room and the staff was able to accommodate us with a triple room which was very generous of them! The rooms are clean, pillow service is a nice touch, and the overall vibe of the hotel is very cozy and intimate. The breakfast is fairly cheap and the hot menu is very decent. We also ate at the restaurant downstairs and the food was very satisfying. There is a restaurant across the street called fade street social which was also delicious. The hotel is located in an extremely convenient location and we walked everywhere! The area is not too loud or too quiet. I would definitely stay at this hotel again - lovely people and overall lovely hotel. ",5,2018,03,27
236,Fantastic place,"Can’t recommend it high enough. The concierge, both Connor and Marvin, went out of their way to make every accommodation for us. The front desk was thoughtful and competent. 
I’d definitely stay again and recommend it. 
Thanks a million!",5,2018,03,27
236,One of the Best We’ve Stayed in,"We booked this hotel as a part of our Costco package trip and the hotel was the gem of the week. It’s perfectly located and has everything you need in Dublin. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, but a special thank you goes out to a Shane and Jack. Shane encouraged us to take a day trip to the Cliffs of Moher and got us information to book it. It was the highlight of the trip. Jack was our bartender who poured us pints, recommended whiskeys, and generally made us feel right at home. We loved our stay here and were sad to leave the comforts of the Brooks Hotel. ",5,2018,03,24
236,What amazing staff you have!,"I've stayed in hotels all over the place but I have never met staff like this, they go out of their way to make sure you're looked after.

Small quibbles with our room, the air conditioning was noisy, we were so tired it wasn't a huge problem, we phoned to ask for something to be done, around 11pm, the woman who answered said she would turn it off from the central control. At breakfast the next morning she approached us to ask how we slept! (when does she sleep?!) This is it, this is what people really want, personal attention, being remembered, so few places seem able to do this these days but Brooks did. I was impressed and I'm quite hard to please.

The room was small but very clean and the beds were comfortable, breakfast was lovely and I would stay here again.",5,2018,03,21
236,Perfect Location!  Close to almost everything!,"Thank you so much to Rachel, Ashley, Connor and Shane...for making our trip to Ireland so memorable.  Your kindness and help made our first time there so enjoyable and comfortable!  The hotel is such a great place to stay!  Almost everyone there was so personable and patient with strangers from another country!  Their breakfast was excellent and we were lucky enough to have dinner the last night which was one of the best meals we had there.  Comfortable beds and very clean rooms!  Thanks again and hopefully we will visit again one day!!",4,2018,03,19
236,"Incredible location, nice experience","My wife and I stayed here for three nights during the days around St Patty's day and we had a nice stay. The main customer service employee, Connor, was extremely nice and makes you feel like a friend. After unpacking our backs, he immediately sat down with us to give advice about what we should do during our time in Dublin and mapped it out for us (literally). The hotel itself is nice, with a lobby bar/lounge, eating area, etc. The gym is small and lacking, but enough to get a quick sweat in. For some reason our bathroom sink water only had one temperature (freezing), but that wasn't a problem for the shower, so not a big deal. The key selling point of this hotel is the location. It does not get better than this spot. You are literally a two minute walk from the top attractions (Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Patricks Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Grafton Street, etc.) and a fifteen minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse. This is the ideal location if you're looking to be fully immersed in Dublin and surrounded by the best restaurants, pubs, and sights in the city. It was great to be able to sightsee throughout the day and occasionally stop in our room to use the bathroom or drop things off, since the hotel was almost always just a few minute walk away. Overall, had a nice time and would stay there again.",4,2018,03,19
236,Unhappy With Trying to Check-in Early,"Basically this is the story, I use an an app called HotelTonight for 90% of my brom ookings & because I had spent so much with it I was given a 'Concierge' functionality by it. 

I travel a lot & 7 times out of ten arrive in hotels late, but this time I was arriving in Dublin ( a great city by the way) early. As I was sitting waiting to take off from London, up pops this 'concierge' person on my app 'Could she help me with any onward travel plans etc & she assured me she was real person. Anyway, I type could she request an early check-in at Brooks Hotel ? When my flight landed up she pops 'I have informed staff at the hotel of your request & they will try their best to accommodate. I get a taxi into town & to celebrate my touch down in one of my favorite cities have a quick half of Guinness . I decide to call the hotel to ask could i check in early, thinking I would be told they had already been informed etc etc 

Alas no, reception said they had not been informed & then start to engage in 'Doublespeak' no straight answer to a straight question! 'Can i check in early?', reply 'Sorry we cant guarantee that' , me 'Is that a yes or a no?' 

Anyway I turn up at the hotel around 11am or something and the doublespeak is in full flow ' Were not in a position to guarantee check in until 3pm etc etc' When can I have a room ? We don't guarantee rooms until 3 pm etc etc 

Highly evasive & discourteous. However, when I offered to pay for early check-in a room was suddenly found (60 euro more), this however pushed the price of the modest 4 star Brooks to be more expensive than the very smart 5 star Wesbury next door & when I called the Westbury they said if i booked a room there I would be checked in immediately. Nobody, would argue that Brooks is better than the Westbury , its full of fragrant flowers and wonderful bars and eating places. 

So, this is my conclusion - giving Brooks the benefit of the doubt its much less grand than the Westbury with fewer rooms, the chances of an early check in therefore is much less as they have fewer room to begin with, when you combine that with their desire to charge for check in before 3pm it's probably going to work out cheaper to stay at the Westbury if you want room before early evening. 

END",1,2018,03,18
236,"Perfect location, great stay","My family and I really enjoyed our stay at Brooks. We arrived early in the morning after a a red eye flight and we were allowed to rest in the hotel's visitors lounge, which had couches - this was great as we were exhausted and couldn't check in yet and was much better than waiting in the lobby area. The rooms are clean - the only complaint I have is that the water temperature would fluctuate (water pressure was fine though). The complimentary water daily was nice. We had dinner in the restaurant - options are limited but what we had was good (not the best but about average) - we were too tired to leave the hotel for dinner and having the option to have dinner at the hotel was nice. The location is perfect - as it's within walking distance of all the main attractions. Would definitely stay again!",5,2018,03,17
236,Good location great staff,"Myself and two friends were over for the rugby and this hotel meant a bit of luxury and a good location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were a little on the small side but they had everything and had an excellent shower!
Breakfast was cooked to order and was first rate with a little style as well. Not cheap but fairly good value for an international week-end. ",5,2018,03,05
236,Wonderful stay,Chose this as our first night’s rest in Ireland based on Forum recommendations and they couldn’t have been more spot on. Really great hotel in the perfect location that is worth more than they charge for the evening. Didn’t get to try the bar/restaurant but they looked very nice as well. Offers discounted rate in the parking garage across the street which was very convenient as we learned what’s what in the city. Friendly staff and very nice rooms.,5,2018,03,04
236,4th visit,"And will be returning in 2020 for our 5th visit (for Wales v Ireland in the 6 Nations).

And we can't imagine choosing an alternative Dublin city centre hotel.

Friendly staff, nice rooms, great location, excellent breakfast.  What else would you want?

We've noticed a rise in prices over the past few years but Dublin generally isn't cheap.  Even losing at the rugby didn't spoil our visit (too much!)",4,2018,02,28
236,Refreshing luxury,"My second time visiting a Small Luxury Hotel, and Brooks in Dublin lived up to my high expectations.

Room upgrade was greatly appreciated, our room was on the 5th floor and fitted out to a high standard. Little touches like a pillow menu etc were nice.

Breakfast was great, loads of choice and the continental section was plentiful. The bar has a great whiskey selection and is residents only after 11pm so good for a nightcap.

Walkable to all the major touristy stuff and with lots of bars / restaurants on your doorstep. A fabulous overnight stay.",5,2018,02,25
236,Overnight stay,"This hotel is a gem for stopping in Dublin always very friendly and attentive staff who cannot do enough for you.
The location is right in the heart of the city yet quiet always a good nights sleep here cannot recommend highly enough",5,2018,02,25
236,Great Location,"We bookended our stay in Ireland and Scotland at this hotel. The location is tremendous as it allows you to walk to almost every major tourist attraction. We were able to walk to the Guinness factory, Temple Bar, Trinity College and some other attractions. The staff are very friendly and ""Uncle Conor"" has some great food and bar recommendations. The rooms are not super fancy, but the bathrooms are clean and the shower has extremely strong pressure! It's a great spot for a great price!",4,2018,02,19
236,City Break & Shopping,"Brooks Hotel is a fantastic Hotel in the heart of the city.  Just off Grafton Street.  Its our place to stay whenever we go to Dublin.  Its close to shops, bars and restaurants and a great base for any sightseeing.  The Hotel itself if vey stylish, modern and has a lovely cosy feel to it.  The staff are very friendly and make you feel very welcome.  Breakfast is fantastic.  Breakfast is to order. There are lots of options to choose from.  I would highly recommend Brooks Hotel for your stay.  You wont be disappointed.",5,2018,02,19
236,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights.  The hotel is in a great location , the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Great breakfast choice including quorn sausages.
The staff are fabulous, friendly and warm.  Love the pillow menu and turndown service , also the handy device with free wi fi and calls was brilliant.
Francesca restaurant not great for vegetarians at evening meal .
Will definitely be back !",4,2018,02,16
236,"Great location, tired rooms","We stayed here one night as we were passing through town. The staff was great, the room was okay, and the bathroom was in dire need of updating. The tub caulking was in very poor shape, there was a rusty nail sticking out of the tub facade, the bathroom door had to be propped open with a rubber stopper (watch your toes!), there was a terribly old hairdryer on the wall with a label maker sign indicating a different hair dryer in a drawer of the room, and there was a persistent hum all night. Not sure if we were near a machine room or if it was due to an old heating system or what. We could hear it in our room but not find the source, and then we heard it near the front door of the hotel as we stepped out for dinner. 

If you stay here, go across the street to Fade St for dinner. Yum! The hotel is in a very central location, close to many things, so that part was great. But it's time for the rooms to be updated.",3,2018,02,12
236,Ok but not great,"Hotel is very centrally located.  Rooms comfortable and well-appointed, although I would have liked a bath and only got a shower.  Food leaves much to be desired.  Breakfast and coffee were actually pretty awful.  Supper was OK but not much choice.  Most staff can't speak English very well, which can be frustrating.  I booked there partly because it had a gym, but there are so many rules before you can actually use it that I didn't even bother.  All in all, a disappointment.  Room was hot and windows could open, but it was noisy.",3,2018,02,07
236,Great service at boutique hotel in Fublin,"Visited Brooks in Dublin for a business trip and  it was a fantastic experience. Great location close to temple bar, good amenities and exceptional service from staff. From Ashley at reception who helped with 6 am early breakfast to battle jet lag  to the valet staff and restaurant service.  Great place. Not a “ room w a view “ hotel but does not matter As you’re within 5 to 10 minutes walking distance from everything  downtown Dublin",5,2018,02,05
236,"Classy, comfortable and warm staff","Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.  Hotel has a boutique feel,  is very clean and fresh, nice bedding and decor, and super helpful and friendly staff.  Great location in the city center but not on a noisy street. Completely recommend it.  Will be sure to return next time in Dublin.",5,2018,02,04
236,Little gem,"An unexpected pleasure. Comfortable rooms, great beds, excellent shower. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very nice breakfast and inviting cocktail bar. Near everything without being pricey. I highly recommend it.",5,2018,02,04
236,Highly recommended!,"booked this hotel for two reasons: its location and its high ratings online. It turned out to be a great choice. It was an easy walk to Trinity College, to Merrion Square, to many good restaurants, to the Hop on Hop Off busline etc. The staff was always helpful and friendly, and the room was beautiful and spacious. A few tiny quibbles with the otherwise lovely bathroom : 1) a magnifying mirror hung five feet up the wall and not adjustable in any way - my 6 foot husband doesn’t need a magnifier to shave but I’d like one for makeup and even on tiptoe, I couldn’t see anything but the top of my head; (2) a pedal operated trash bin that just fell over when one used the pedal. Small complaints, and I’d definitely stay here again, but a place this good should get the details right! Breakfasts were superb too: wonderful pastries, excellent buffet or cooked dishes.",5,2018,02,04
236,Fantastic Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"This hotel was wonderful!! The staff was amazing. Also they give you a pillow menu upon check in in case you’d like a hypo allergenic pillow or one that more suits your taste. One of the best parts is the “Handy” phone they give you to use during your stay. It give you access to data, google maps and the ability to make calls as well. This was perfect as we didn’t have data on our cell phones to use while exploring the city. Hope to stay here again!! ",5,2018,02,03
236,Ideally situated for exploring Dublin,"We visited Dublin for New Year and found Brooks to be ideally situated for getting around the city.  We got the bus in from the airport and then it was an easy 5 minute walk to the airport. This was a cheap and convenient way of getting to the hotel. The hotel offers so much but is let down by a few things. The rooms are spacious but could do with a bit of updating.  Breakfast was lovely and so much to choose from but some of the staff spoke poor English and struggled to understand what we were asking for.  They were also really busy during the peak times and then the service suffered.  The bar area wasn’t very inviting and with so many bars to chose from in Dublin, they really should try and sort this out.  We liked Brooks and it suited us on this occasion but would probably stay somewhere else for our next stay in Dublin.",4,2018,02,03
236,Magical time,"Stayed in Brooks Hotel for two nights for my daughter's wedding, staying there added to a fantastic experience. Staff were excellent, nothing was a problem, very helpful. The doorman was a mine if information I can  only imagine how helpful he would be to an overseas visitor. ",5,2018,02,01
236,Ideal location ,"I stayed in Brooks hotel on 27/1/18. The staff were very efficient,friendly and welcoming. Our room was immaculate and even had a menu for various pillow types. The location is perfect for city visit. Will look forward to a return visit to Brooks Hotel.",5,2018,02,01
236,"NIce Hotel, very convenient location","Overall hotel was nice, service was good, room was nice.  

Checkin - swift and easy; however, the first room I was given had recently been painted and the smell was very strong.   After a few minutes in the room, I decided to ask MGMT if I could get a new one.  They eventually gave me a new paint free room.  I am happy they were able to find me another room, but worry a bit that they thought it was ok to rent the first room. 

Room - Clean and good sized, overall pretty good, some complaints about the location of outlets next to the bed - or lack thereof, but nothing big. 

Location - Very centrally located, convenient to everything I needed.

Staff - very friendly and helpful.

Overall a good stay.",4,2018,01,26
236,Highly recommend - amazing service,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a package deal (booked through Costco) for our first two nights and then again on our last night in Ireland  (between the two stays we visited Killarney and Galway).  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough based on their staff.  Connor clearly makes an effort to learn everyone's name and you feel as though you are staying in a very personalized location.  Breakfast, as others have said, is very good.  Order the porridge!!

On our last night we went next door to the Hairy Lemon.  Watched some American football and got to talking with a group from Spain.  Completely got caught up and ended up leaving my entire wallet there.  Realized it was missing the next morning as we were to drive back to the airport.  When we told Connor what had happened, he advised he would check next door when they opened.  Sure enough, they had my wallet.  Hotel even offered to drive it to the airport for me (but we had already taken our first flight and were in London - waiting to fly back to California.)  Hotel expressed mailed it back to me (via DHL) and I literally had my entire wallet with all my cash, cards, and driver's license within two days of landing home.",5,2018,01,25
236,As I would imagine Sir Terry's . . .,"Understated, comfortable, elegant, and authentically Irish. I would imagine the late, great Sir Terry's home to be the same.  The welcome was warm and friendly and every staff member was pleasant and helpful. Service and breakfast were excellent, with plenty Irish specialities and killer Soda Bread (as in, I would kill for more) . As others have said, the hotel is located close to lots of wonderful shopping including Grafton St.  Many other Dublin essentials are an easy distance by foot.",5,2018,01,24
236,Excellent Hotel in a convenient location,"This is an excellent hotel - we were getting married in January at a venue close by and organised for a large group to stay at the hotel.

The front of house staff really were excellent and were very helpful - pulling out all of the stops to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Everyone was very attentive.

The hotel is in a good location and offers excellent value compared to other similarly priced options close at hand. The breakfasts were also excellent each morning.

This review would have been 5 stars. It falls short on one star as dealing with the reservations team for a group booking was a painful experience from start to finish (culminating in a call from reception on the second morning of a three night stay asking us to vacate the presidential suite as they incorrectly were told that we were checking out then). 

That being said, the professionalism and friendliness of the actual front of house staff made up for this.",4,2018,01,23
236,"Brooks best treasure is Marvin, Concierge!","Everything about Brooks was nice.  We arrived very early in the morning and our room was not available.  Marvin took our luggage and we slept for a bit in the guest lounge.  Took the desks advice on an eatery nearby, The Hairy Lemon, and it was just what we needed.  Great breakfast!  Marvin helped out in many ways.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,01,22
236,Fabulous Find,"I visited Brooks hotel for my partners 30th and it did not disappoint. It is in a great location and from the moment we entered we were greeted by the friendly staff and doorman. The room was tidy, clean and very cute. As soon as we switched the power on, an old fashioned wireless played classical music. A delightful touch! Breakfast was delicious and perfectly presented. The full Irish was tasty and well worth the every penny. The hotel also arranged a little birthday memento which was nice! Would definitely recommend and will be back!",4,2018,01,22
236,Warm Welcome in bleak January,"Went to Brook's on friend's recommendation and was not disappointed. It is terrific, centrally placed, surrounded by restaurants and yet quiet at night. great deal on the breakfast which made it good value. The staff were friendly and Conor, the commissionaire, takes pride in getting to know your name and will remember it. Discreet place. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. Room well appointed.",5,2018,01,19
236,Brilliant,"The location is brilliant with only a short walk to Temple Bar, Grafton Street ect..  

Our room was very clean and the bed very comfy.  The only thing that let the hotel down for me was the breakfast, we thought it was not very good compare to the quality of the hotel. Also there could have been more choice on the hot food, but saying that the cold buffet was very good with lot of choice but the bread was a let down.

Staff could not go enough and were very helpful with directions ect.  Also in the room there is a free tablet you can take with you, which has lots of information about Dublin on and also handy maps.  It could also be used to make local and some international calls free this was very good and a brilliant idea.

We use this hotel again in the future",5,2018,01,18
236,Week in Dublin,Great boutique hotel!  Great restaurant and amenities. Very friendly front desk - Connor was best concierge we met during our 3 week vacation in Ireland. Easy walk to highlights of Dublin!  Highly recommend!,5,2018,01,13

The location of this hotel was our favorite part of our stay. Walking distance from nightlight and great restaurants without the hassle of it being noisy. Our room was also comfortable and the staff was great. Could not recommend enough.",4,2018,01,07
236,Overnight stay with breakfast.,"Our family stayed overnight  at Brooks Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We wanted to to go to Rapunzel at the Gaiety and as Brooks is around the corner from the Gaiety it was an ideal choice for the night. We were upgraded to a beautiful room linked to the children's ( equally beautiful ) room, which was great peace of mind for us.The rooms were spotless and very nicely decorated. The beds were comfortable and there was even a pillow menu in case the pillows weren't to our taste. We were very happy with the pillows so didn't need to change but it was a lovely idea all the same. The room had a kettle, ironing board and hairdryer. The hotel is just around the corner from Grafton Street and after a very tasty breakfast we spent the next day browsing around the city. We parked in Drury Street car park directly across from the hotel and got a special car parking rate because we had stayed in the hotel. I had booked the hotel and panto tickets as a Christmas present for my family and it was well worth it.Thanks so much to all the staff for making this a very enjoyable stay for all of us.",5,2018,01,07

236,Relaxing spot for a coffee or a drink in the city centre,"Have dropped in here a few times recently. Its very good day and night for a coffee and a scone in the afternoon or a drink in the evening. Lovely friendly staff, great Irish coffees, lovely comfy seats and a relaxed atmosphere",4,2018,01,03
236,Very nice hotel in a convenient location,"The Brooks is very centrally located, close to many restaurants, sights, and of course pubs!

St Stephens Green is an easy walk as is the university. 
Breakfast at the Brooks was lovely and the staff, a little inexperienced but try hard. ",4,2017,12,29
236,Dublin Visits August and December 2017,"Brooks Hotel has it all. Convenient location, courteous and efficient staff, clean and nicely appointed rooms, restaurant and bar service on premises, easy access and more.  This was our second visit to The Brooks Hotel in 4 months. Both of our visits were exceptional, thus our return. There are lots of hotel choices in Dublin, our first choice will consistently be The Brooks Hotel. Our stay in December was planned for 2 days, when it became necessary to extend our stay The Brooks Hotel staff worked diligently to accommodate us. We were even able to keep the same room. That is First Class Service in anyone's book. Not only do we know many of the staff by their first names they know and recognize us by name as well.   A Great Choice by any Standard",5,2017,12,26
236,Great Hotel,"Loved everything about the hotel except the view. Reviewers said to request street view which we did not and our view was of the back alley and into another building. We didn't spend much daylight time in the room so it didn't matter to us and it was a very quiet room. Great location, walking distance to everything i Dublin.",5,2017,12,20
236,Great location in Dublin!,"Lovely hotel, superbly located, rooms fine size with nice big bed, bathroom nice size too. Staff on reception very friendly and helpful. One thing, no hot water in morning for shower! This was disappointing- mentioned to manager and got small amount discounted - left us a bit disappointed. Breakfast buffet FAB - cooked breakfast not at the same level. Summary - I’ll be back but I’ll want a hot shower next time!!!",4,2017,12,18
236,Perfect hotel,"Nothing about this hotel you won't love.  The location is ideal, walking distance to pretty much any place, bar or restaurant you want to go.  Perfect staff, can answer any question and resolve any issues.  Perfect room, spacious and comfortable with a nice bath.  As you can tell, I liked it.",5,2017,12,17
236,Great Hotel!,"Loved everything about it! We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our trip to Ireland. Very central location, lovely rooms, very comfy beds, a wide variety of breakfast and other dinner items available and lovely front desk service. They have a great free smart phone service-get a smart phone for your use while there with tourist friendly apps and the ability to download your google account for use while there.  Unlimited local calling and 5 international calls (to most other countries, but not all) that one is able to use. You erase all your history and data when you leave!  Very nice and useful!  Would definitely return here.

236,"Ideal location, caring staff","A very pleasant and clean hotel, in the best of Dublin locations with a slightly old-fashioned feeling about it. Great variety at breakfast and nice selections for dinner at the Brasserie. Above all, following a temporary indisposition, the manager and the staff proved extremely kind and helpful by calling an ambulance and making me feel as comfortable as possible. I am grateful.",4,2017,12,11
236,The dreaded ‘breakfast coffee’! ,"2nd Review I have given to this hotel. 
4 star hotel in excellent city centre location. Expensive and not what I would consider to be value for money. The staff are friendly and efficient. The parking directly across the street from the hotel is ideal. I requested a higher floor room and they was given to us, on the 6th floor. The room was in the ‘deluxe’ category and we included breakfast in our rate. We were there for 4 nights. 
The room was small with very little wardrobe space. The bathroom needs updating I think as it is tired looking and with a small narrow bath in the corner with shower over bath, it seems to me to be a waste of precious space. Having said that, everything, except the sink stopper, worked. The bed was very comfortable. 
My personal complaint and a source of annoyance to me is the increasing number of hotels, this one included, where there is no socket near the bed, I need a socket because I use a cpap machine every night so in Brooks it necessitated the requesting of an extension lead which was duly supplied. Why are hotels not installing sockets near the bed? It shows a level of contempt for the client who is already paying enough to stay. The most disconcerting thing however about the room was the ‘dummy/mannequin’ in the corner of the room(see pic) it’s purpose baffled us! 
Breakfast was ok, nothing special but at least the fresh fruit was actually fresh, the bread selection was limited and the hot breakfast options were boring. Coffee - we decided to order Americano after tasting the ‘breakfast coffee’ What is it with hotels at breakfast that they cannot get this basic right! We were paying enough to get a decent coffee at breakfast. We sat under a large abstract painting one morning and the frame was filthy and the spatters of grease on the wall were not cleaned - not acceptable. Also we noticed 2 blown light bulbs in the dining room, now not replacing them is either sloppiness or laziness or both. The negatives I have highlighted are not of themselves hugely important but together they are an irritation. With a little extra effort in the detail this could be a great hotel. 
I like Brooks, it had very nice people working there and I will most likely stay again. ",4,2017,12,07
236,A gem of a hotel,"I found brooks hotel online and it very reviews so I booked a room for my holiday in Dublin this week.  When I arrived I knew I was in the perfect place!  I arrived around 6pm after flying from Phoenix to London and connecting to Dublin.  The staff treated me extremely well and made me feel special.  Fiona Lynch handled my checkin and she was brilliant, professional and friendly.  In the morning I met Connor, the concierge, and he was friendly and extremely helpful.  My deluxe double room a good size and the bathroom was large too.  The hot water was wonderful and worked my entire visit.

This hotel is hotel is in a great neighborhood.  Everything is in enjoyable walking distance.  Wonderful restaurants within 1 to 2 streets.

Brooks Hotel more than met my expectations.  This my first visit to Ireland and when I return, I will definitely book this hotel again.",5,2017,12,05
236,Family visit,"Brooks hotel is perfectly located to shopping on Grafton street, Temple Bar, dozens of restaurants as well as neighborhood pubs.  From the moment we arrived, we had excellent treatment.  We arrived early from our flight..around 8:30am and were greeted by Marvin who had some suggestions of places to grab a bite to eat until our room was available.  The staff checking us in stated that at least one of our three rooms was avail, so they took all of our luggage to that room and said they would make every effort to have our other two rooms ready by the time we returned and they did, which was nice since we had been up for 24 hours traveling. 
Our rooms were spacious and clean.  The staff was friendly and attentive to everything we requested on our five day stay.  Conner, our concierge for the weekend was also extremely helpful and recommended some things to do.
We frequented the bar for happy hour and we did eat dinner one night in the bar area after returning late from Belfast for the day.  Our meals were very good.  The bar area  was very busy almost every night we were there.  I felt bad for the bartender since he seemed to be the only bartender there each time.  Because of this, the service was a bit slow, but seeing as he was only person there, we didn't get too irritated.  However, a suggestion to the manager that an additional bartender on the weekends may be helpful.
If I had to say anything negative about our experience, it would be about the breakfast.  A tad overpriced for the food selections.  We are not huge breakfast people, but our only options were to pay 19.95 for the buffet which was basically, cereal, meats and cheeses, yogurt and pastries or 9.95 for pastries and coffee/juice.  It would be nice to have an al a carte option for people who aren't big eaters. I did get eggs one morning off the regular menu and they were very spongy and couldn't eat them.  They were also 19.95.  But my kids had the crepes several mornings and said they were delicious.  
Again, the hotel is perfectly located and two places to mention that are steps from the hotel are Fade Street Social, which I would recommend for dinner and The Hairy Lemon which is a pub at the end of the street.  We didn't eat at The Hairy Lemon, but they do serve food and it was always packed.  It's a fun place to have drinks and on Sunday nights they have live Traditional Irish music.",4,2017,11,28
236,Friends get-together ,"We stayed here recently while meeting friends in Dublin. This hotel is so central to everywhere. Perfect location for city centre. The reception was bright and welcoming. Our receptionist was knowledgeable and very helpful. We had a triple room which was spotlessly clean, bright and fresh. Beds are comfortable and clean. Reception staff were so helpful. Taxis were booked and arrived within minutes. When we went for breakfast we obviously went at a very busy time as we had a wait to be seated. There is a cold food buffet and hot food tea, coffee and toast is ordered from the waiting staff. We ordered tea and coffee and had another long wait until our hot food order was taken. There was another long delay until our food was brought out. Coffee but no tea or toast. There seemed to be a delay on everything at breakfast. There seemed to be plenty of staff but service was dreadfully slow and out of sequence. The buffet had cereals, lovely fruit options with yoghurt and granola. There was tasty breads and pastries on offer. Our breakfast was tasty and hot. I just couldn't see why service was so slow despite the level of staff on duty. All in all this hotel is perfectly located. Brilliant for a shopping trip, 5 minute walk to Grafton St. I would definitely return here. ",5,2017,11,26
236,No hot water ,"I have just returned from a weekend. Brooks is a fab hotel with many many positives but I was let down badly today. It's is spotlesly clean, lovely staff, lovely breakfast but no.hot water. I mentioned it Saturday morning at reception and was told it would be rectified after a luke warm shower. On Sunday Morning, it was ice cold. Myself and my sister literally washed as quick.as we could and tried to warm up with the hair dryer. I went to reception before breakfast to explain that I would like someone to go and experience the water as I didn't want them to think i was making it up. I returned for check out , paid and questioned the water to which I was told "" sorry about that, if you come and stay again, we will make sure it doesn't happen next time ""!!!! Over 400 euro.for 2 nights and both mornings cold water . I had already given them the opportunity to sort it Saturday!!! I told the girl that I would have expected a manager to have met me or spoke to me before I left. I was told they were very busy!!! Sorry, a very very poor response for a 4 star hotel. She assured me someone would make contact.  Today as the day to do that , before I left your hotel. I had booked to stay again in February but I shall def reconsider. I left feeling totally insignificant after spending a considerable amount of money. I also noted where the receptionist wrote my room number down, 308 that there were a few other room numbers with no hot water written beside it and ice cold written beside mind. I have checked reviews and it's seems an on going problem. It's very unfair to.do this to any guest and then to hide behind a simple "" sorry "". Not good enough Brooks!!",1,2017,11,26
236,Disappointing ,"Have stayed here many times and it used to be my favourite place to stay in Dublin. While the location is excellent and the hotel is reasonably good, service has been getting progressively worse. Breakfasts have become a poorly organised shambles. Nobody seems to be in charge. Items missing from the table, adjacent tables left uncleared, orders needing to be repeated ( 3 times on this occasion), no attention to detail. Overall impression of a lack of management. I have put up with a few minor issues in the past but with increasing prices this hotel no longer offers value for money. There is better value for money elsewhere. ",3,2017,11,26
236,Best location ,"Best location in Dublin, close to excellent restaurant and shops and a temple Bar area. Don’t miss out on the best fish shop around the corner from the hotel. In Drury street you’ll find lovely shops a chocolatier and small arcade. 
",5,2017,11,26
236,Favorite in Dublin. Hands down.,"I love Dublin and have stayed in several top notch hotels in this wonderful city. Brooks Hotel is without question my fave. 

The location is perfect. Why? It's steps from the midst of all the Dublin fun without being right on top of a noisy Temple Bar pub or a crowded street filled with late-night carousers.  
Within a block of all directions, you'll find terrific shopping, dining and drinking.

The hotel itself is both classy and charming. Intimate. And extremely friendly, from porter to reception, restaurant servers to housekeeping. 

The rooms are well-appointed, from the most basic to the Master Suite, all extremely comfortable and upscale without ever feeling the least bit stuffy or staid. 

Though there is no valet parking service, parking is inexpensive and a breeze, with the structure located right across the tiny one way street.

Breakfast is superb.

I will never NOT stay in the Brooks, unless there is sadly no room available. As wonderful as it is, there are many times when this jewel is sold out, and I've been left to find another place to lay my head. Many trips later, I've stayed in some lovely Dublin hotels, but none as perfect as the Brooks Hotel.",5,2017,11,25
236,Great hotel near the castle,The hotel was a few minutes walk south of the river not far from the castle. There are lots of bars and restaurants nearby if you don’t want to eat at the hotel. The room was lovely lovely and spacious with lots of facilities. Really comfortable bed and a good size TV. Didn’t notice any outside noise. Breakfast was great with both a buffet selection and cooked to order. I had the traditional Irish breakfast which was great. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful ,5,2017,11,24
236,Great location!,"This hotel is within walking distance of several attractions, restaurants, and pubs. The breakfast was delicious, the service is great, the rooms are clean. We enjoyed our stay and have no complaints!",5,2017,11,22
236,Great Location & Cozy,"If you are looking for a nice place to stay in the heart of the action in Dublin, this is your place!  The Brooks is tucked away but close to everything.  Easy access to hop on hop off buses, shopping and restaurants. This is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed at. I would have given it an excellent rating but the rooms are a little worn and the shower is very, very small.  The staff is great, the rooms are clean!  Great experience.",4,2017,11,21
236,Perfect for our stay!,"This hotel is a great value and very well located - were able to walk nearly anywhere we wanted to go, and once you're back at the hotel in the evening, there are loads of great restaurants/pubs/bars within a few minutes walk. We had a classic room which was nicely designed and very cozy without feeling cramped. We faced Drury Street which gets quite raucous late at night on the weekends, but happily the hotel has installed double windows which were really effective blocking out the noise. I'm just pointing this out because if you want to sleep with the windows open, ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. I'd absolutely stay here on future trips.",5,2017,11,20
236,My Home away from Home in Dublin,I had such a wonderful experience at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin.  This was our first hotel on our trip and our last prior to leaving and will be where I stay when visiting Dublin in the future.  The staff was amazing and Connor always went above and beyond for us.  I recommend this hotel whilst in Dublin.  The breakfast in the morning is also very delicious.,5,2017,11,18
236,Excellent and yet...Staff needs better training,"The Brooks has a lot going for it. Excellent location, an arrangement with the car park right next to it (but suggest picking up a car after your stay), really lovely common rooms (downstairs lounge, breakfast room, bar are all both true to Ireland and very stylish). some rooms are really nice. 
However - this hotel is currently (Fall 2017) in the process of upgrading rooms. We spent two nights in a room that in no way (room, en suite, bedding) deserves to be marketed & charged at “boutique hotel” classification.
Let’s just say it had seen better days and was quite a disappointment. 
We mentioned our issues to management and to their credit for our third night they upgraded us to a true boutique hotel room, clearly refreshed, with more style, better furnishings, and a Lavazza coffee machine (in contrast to a plug-in kettle & coffee/tea packets).
The manager expressed her genuine concern for our comfort, an apologized for arrival snafus with reception.
 Knowing what we know now, would definitely stay here again with the assurance that all their rooms will soon be truly worthy of boutique hotel classification: you really cannot beat the location. 
Suggest getting the B&B option: breakfast is a combination of cooked to order and a generous buffet.",4,2017,11,18
236,"Very nice hotel, well situated.","We recently had a 3 night stay at the Brooks which we enjoyed very much. Good size room and bathroom fitted to a very good standard. It is well situated for exploring Dublin and has a number of good pubs and restaurants close by.
",4,2017,11,10
236,2 day visit to Dublin,We stayed in the Brooks hotel for 2 nights in early Nov 2017. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel was classic in looks and we found the reception/concierge helpful and friendly. Loved the classic look and feel of the hotel and bar area. Also happy with the location. Highly recommend. ,5,2017,11,10
236,A Gem in the Heart of Dublin,"This was my first stay at the Brooks Hotel, but it won't be my last.  I really enjoyed my stay there and hope to return.  The public spaces of the hotel are pleasant and traditional, with a cozy lobby and a very pleasant restaurant and bar area (more on that in a moment).  The hotel is on a quiet street just outside of the popular Temple Bar area.

I was upgraded to a ""deluxe"" room, but can't comment on how that differs from others.  The room was of adequate size for a European hotel, with a small desk/dresser and a table with a couple of chairs.  The room was quiet, but at the back of the hotel had no view.  The bed was very comfortable, and the room had modern amenities, such as power and USB outlets at each bedside.  The WiFi was free and fast.  The bathroom (tub) was adequately-sized, very clean, and fully functional.

The breakfast buffet was included in my room rate, and I almost wish I had been hungrier in the mornings, as there was a full cooked Irish breakfast and a large buffet with both Irish and continental delicacies.  What I had was delicious.

I also partook of the whiskey bar in the evenings, which is open to residents after the pub closing times, and offers 140 different whiskeys, many of them Irish.  I sampled only a few, but the bartender was friendly and informative and the overall ambience very calm.

Overall, this was an excellent example of what a luxury boutique hotel can be, and for my trip, at a very reasonable price.",5,2017,11,10
236,The Absolute Best Hotel in Dublin,We just stayed at the Brooks Hotel on 10/29 and 10/30/17 and it was absolutely the best hotel that we booked in Ireland. The location was perfect and the staff was extremely helpful. Thank you Connor-for all of your great suggestions! We got in at 8am and our room was ready so they let us in! We were expecting to roam around until check in time. That was great after flying all night. I would gladly go back to this hotel again. It was a small boutique hotel in the heart of everything. The place was spotless and the beds were comfortable what more can you ask for.,5,2017,11,07
236,Wonderful boutique hotel,We loved our 2 nights stay here. We arrived from the States around 10 in the morning expecting to just drop off our luggage and have to leave until check in time.  They had our room ready as soon as we arrived.  We were exhausted and were able to rest up before touring the city.  Our room was very nice.  The breakfast was very good and the hotel staff were friendly and attentive.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,11,05
236,"Very nice boutique hotel, comfortable rooms, welcoming staff, super location.","We stayed at Brooks for 2 nice as part of a southern Ireland tour.  This was a comfortable start to our journey.  The staff was always kind and helpful.  The lobby area warm and inviting.  The rooms clean, comfortable, and spacious (more like US hotels than europe).  You must have their breakfast at least one morning; amazing selection of excellent food.  The location is fantastic, near some markets, restaurants, pubs, antique shops.",5,2017,11,01
236,The start of our Irish adventure - Great Location,"The Brooks Hotel, was a great place to start out adventure for my 50th birthday.  We were greater by the BEST concierge, who was witty and delightful!  Our room was small but cozy, which a very comfy bed.  The hotel is in a great location for everything, the hop on and off bus, a little market to buy some water and pop/booze. The breakfast was very nice and filling.  Will come back to visit.",4,2017,11,01
236,A Gem.,"We were only booked here for 2 days and then had to move on.  We loved the room as it had 2 comfortable sitting chairs.  The Irish Breakfast which was included in our package was excellent as was the other choices on the breakfast menu.  The restaurant was relaxed and comfortable and the wait staff friendly.  The front desk employees were very nice and friendly and so helpful in showing a map to help us find where we needed to go.  The location is convenient to shopping, restaurants, Trinity College and other popular attractions.  You can't go wrong if you book this hotel.",5,2017,10,29
236,Classy hotel with fantastic location,"I stayed here several nights both at the start and end of a recent trip to Ireland.  Both my rooms were spacious, elegant and modern. The dressmakers dummy/mannequin in one of by rooms was a “unique” decorating touch (startled me a few times in the middle of the night!) but I really liked the decor overall. I took advantage of the pillow menu, but didn’t notice a huge difference in the ones I tried. 

Food and drink in the bar were excellent, especially the chowder. I like the classy vibe of the bar and lobby, wIth soothing piano music and comfy chairs. The real selling point of this hotel though, is the excellent location. Steps away from the action, but still tucked away enough that it was not noisy. Felt very safe walking around by myself, too. 

I’ll definitely look to stay here again on future trips! ",5,2017,10,27
236,Great location for a weekend away!,"We stayed here for two nights from Friday to Sunday. I would definitely recommend Brooks Hotel, we stayed in the Deluxe Double Room with Breakfast Included. The room was very spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's about €25 - €40 for a taxi to the airport depending on time of day and traffic. The location is brilliant.. It's walking distance to Temple Bar, St Stephen's Green and great if you want to go for a nice meal on South Great George's Street. If you're looking for a nice hotel in a good location.. Brooks Hotel is definitely worth considering!",4,2017,10,27
236,Great location.  Easy to walk to Temple Bar area.  The room was wonderful .,"We spent 2 nights here.  The location was great.  The cooked breakfast was complimented by a buffet of pastery , fruit juice, meats, cheeses etc.  The bar had a wonderful selection of Irish and Scottish whiskeys.  There was a book describing the taste of each one and where it was from.  We spent a nice evening there. The also have a beautiful guest lounge  for some peace and quiet!",5,2017,10,23
236,First trip to Ireland,"In September we toured Ireland and the UK for our 10th Anniversary.  We began our amazing holiday with several days at the Brooks Hotel.  It was a beautiful hotel, we loved everything about it.  The lobby and restaurant and bar are well appointed and most evenings a wonderful pianist entertains (Killian!).  The food and service are excellent.  If you do check in early and your room is not available, there is a large and beautiful living area downstairs filled with books and comfortable sofas and even a tray of reading glasses.  The location is superb, within walking distance to everything this beautiful city has to offer.
Special thanks to Katie, Frank, Fiona, O'Shain, Roger - and Melissa.  Melissa told us her sister works at the Radisson Blue in Belfast where we'd be staying so the connection was warm and welcoming in both hotels.
Highly recommended.

236,Fantastic short stay experience,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. It is well situated and central to many of the key attractions. We booked a deluxe room but were very kindly upgraded to a suite by the staff on arrival. The room was clean and well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were polite and helpful with a particularly charismatic character called Connor who learned our names and took care to welcome us at breakfast each day. The food was excellent and the breakfast deserves special mention (the porridge with cream, brown sugar and Irish whiskey was divine). The bar and restaurant served a good range of dishes which were reasonably priced. We loved our stay and would definitely stay there again without hesitation.",5,2017,10,20
236,Disappointing,"For the price we paid for this room it was disappointing, even though we had an upgrade. The room was quite small and very dark, the decor was boring and it looked out onto a back street which was really ugly. We could only open the window a fraction but when we did we could hear a lot of noise from the airconditioning units across the road. The room was hot and we could not get our air conditioning to work but we couldn't open the window either! However, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom and shower were good. The hotel is in a good position in the centre of the restaurants and bars but rooms at the back do not have good views. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.",3,2017,10,18
236,Just a great place on every level,"Exactly what they promise with their website and ""Great Small Hotels of the World"" fluff, basically. Rooms are big (I'm not sure if I accidentally got a sweet - two rooms, sofa, desk, yada yada), comfy, well equipped. Communal areas light, airy, comfy - tragically never got round to checking out the private residents' whisky lounge, but it looked nice on the pics - and you can have a drink and a (decent) meal without hyperventilating as you hand over your credit card like you have to in most decent hotels in European capitals.

Location is perfect, walking distance to most of Dublin (admittedly Dublin is the size of a village, but this place is right by the village hall and community centre).

Staff very friendly, and even leave comedy notes to guard your pint on the bar when you go out for a cigarette. The craic, innit.

Can't comment on price as it was a business trip, but recommended.",5,2017,10,18
236,great stay at the Brooks Hotel,"We stayed here on our last night in Dublin in a Deluxe King room. The room was small, but good for 2 people. What i liked was the prime location and we had a outdoor balcony off the room. Top floor. It was a beautiful day in Dublin and it was nice to sit outside on the balcony...",5,2017,10,17
236,Busy end of town,"Dublin was absolutely packed so didn’t stay in the 2-3 business hotels I normally stay for my month trip over. Located in a very lively area of town it is well positioned for the Grafton St area of shops, bars and restaurants off St Stephen’s Green. Location is a major plus. At €300 per night plus breakfast for an Exec Room it is undoubtedly expensive. Well maintained but probably in need of modernisation in the not too distant future. Just on right side of line but it will age quickly. Service was very good.",5,2017,10,15
236,Wonderful!  Caters to up-scale crowd,"Spent 3 nights here in early October. I had read previous reviews so I knew to request a room facing the street, and a king size bed. Got everything we wanted! Room was immaculate, air conditioner worked fine, windows opened, bed was sublime.  Everything worked. In the bathroom is one of those tiny corner showers that you can hardly turn around in. No worries unless you are on the larger side, which may be a problem.
 The service was excellent, friendly and courteous, the breakfasts were absolutely the best we had in Ireland on our 10 day trip. Cooked to order, plus a great buffet selection included.  
 Since our room faced the street, there was considerable noise coming from a nearby pub which made sleeping tough. But it did subside, finally.
 This hotel is NOT a family hotel.....it caters to an older, well-heeled crowd, well past child-rearing age. There is no pool. I did not see even 1 child at this hotel nor did I see any high chairs, etc. Very peaceful place.
 One caveat, though: our flight arrived very early in the morning , around 5 a.m.  Wish we had booked an extra night so we could have checked in upon arrival. Instead, we hung around in the downstairs lounge until our room was ready, about 2:30. Very tired and a waste of most of the day.",5,2017,10,14
236,Lovely hotel in brilliant location ,"Pretty hotel , with nice room and bathroom , spacious and cosy! Service good , definitely will stay again. Area around hotel is amazing full of brilliant restaurants and bars! Food in a hotel great too! ",5,2017,10,13
236,My fault for choosing this hotel.,Great location.  Friendly staff at check in.  Rooms are tiny for the price you pay.  Television didnt work (only 2 channels that were clear).  All others very fuzzy.  WIFI was not working.  Dated.  You would expect more for the money you pay but guessing the price was a standard in the area.  Just need to do your homework by researching and asking questions.  I would not stay at this hotel again.,1,2017,10,13
236,Best of three,"The Brooks Hotel is within easy walking distance of shopping areas, the Dublin Castle, and the Temple Bar area, for example.  Our huge room was very clean, cheerfully decorated, and inviting.  The bathroom was well stocked with linens and shower gel, shampoo, and lotion, for example.

Our rate included a full Irish breakfast, but the continental breakfast buffet was more than adequate.  The front desk personnel, the concierge, and the breakfast staff were pleasant, helpful, and accommodating.  

We were disappointed that morning arrivals were allowed to spread out on the sofas in the residents lounge, leaving no seating for others.  Despite this, we would stay at the Brooks Hotel if we visit Dublin again in the future.",5,2017,10,12
236,"Small Rooms, Very Good Service","The rooms were tiny for the price. If you are sharing a room with someone it is terribly cramped. The rooms were clean, though, and the service was very good. The location of the hotel is great for access to local attractions.",4,2017,10,11
236,Quick stay,Rooms were clean. The location was pretty convenient . The breakfast was horrible...at least the hot breakfast. They did have a nice variety of pastries to choose from. The staff did not interact with us very much so I can not comment on their service. It was a decent place to stay for the night.,4,2017,10,11
236,Highly Disappointing ....Despite the good location.,"The location is excellent for Trinity College, shopping and sightseeing. And the hotel was quiet, unlike Fleet Street or Temple bar Hotels.
We had booked through the Hotel website and got a good rate, but were expecting warmer service, based on earlier reviews and on our other experiences in Ireland.

Although we had requested a bathtub, we were given a room with only a shower, clearly a disability room as the shower was a roll-in withhandles for security. Water got all over the floor despite the shower curtain. The bathroom was grubby at best.

As well, the room was tiny, with a view out to the back alley and noisy garbage collection in the morning. There was gum and a ground in chocolate on the dark carpet by the bed.

Worst of all was the cool reception when we checked in. The manager gave priority to a gentleman who had arrived after we did. We were not told that the room did not have a bathtub. I did not feel the hotel was full, but if this room was the last they could offer we should have been told that they could not meet our requests.
The bar service was far less than adequate, with one harried bartender who ignored us for a time.
The next morning, almost laughably, when we asked at the front desk for the best route to the airport to return our rental car we were told to take a cab!

I didn't reveal my business address when booking, which would have let the hotel know that we were notinconsequential people, because this was not a business trip. Were we treated the way we were because we were two women of a certain age?
I certainly got better service at lesser hotels, as well as at prestige hotels such as Ashford Castle.
I expect a SLH hotel such as brooks Hotel to treat everyone equally well, whether they know their status or not, and I found this experience very disappointing.
Family circumstances will bring my friend back to Dublin three or four times a year and she was looking for a hotel that she could use as a base. 
Brooks Hotel will not be it.",1,2017,10,08
236,4th visit and still great.,"Located perfectly for walking to most of the historic and cultural sites. Surrounded by many restaurants, pubs, wine bars and nice cafes etc.

Friendly helpful staff, great breakfast and decent lunch menu. Had dinner elsewhere which is better.

Rooms are spacious, nicely appointed and quiet.
Huge range of whiskeys but terrible wine list. Go to Olesya's wine bar just round the corner instead.

Multi-storey car park is straight across the street. 
Best to avoid driving in Dublin though; bad traffic and tiny streets. Pick up the hire car when finished in Dublin to head elsewhere rather than hiring at the airport on the way in.

Would stay again.",5,2017,10,07
236,Excellent stay,"This is the second time I've stayed here and the staff, as usual, make superior hospitality look effortless.  A relaxing environment within walking distance to many fine shops, sights, restaurants and attractions.  A lovely boutique hotel, it is not cheap but I'd say you do get more than you pay for.  I can't wait until my next stay!",5,2017,10,04
236,"Fine hotel, excellent location","The Brooks is clean and comfortable, within walking distance of many restaurants, Trinity College (Book of Kells), and the National Museum of Ireland. Fine breakfast included. Staff are friendly and helpful.",4,2017,10,04
236,"Nice hotel, great location","The Brooks is a wonderful hotel from the standpoint of price, luxury and location. It's perfectly situated within walking distance of just about everything in Dublin's City Center from Grafton Street to St. Stephen's Green, Lower Baggot Street, Temple Bar, South George's Street and north of the River Liffey. This puts you close to a number of sightseeing spots, shopping, restaurants and pubs. 

The hotel staff is beyond polite, and was quite helpful with anything we needed. The Jasmine Bar offers an outstanding whiskey selection and Guiness on tap. The bartenders are knowledgable, and the scene is laid back and comfortable. The hotel has a small workout room downstairs with a limited amount of equipment, but a living room and work center that feels like a luxury suite that is open to all hotel guests. It's a nice place to work, catch up on reading or have afternoon tea.

The rooms weren't that big, but were cozy and comfortable with a flat screen TV, mini-fridge, safe and closet space. The bathroom had a shower/tub with excellent hot and cold water pressure. When my wife and I go back to Dublin, we'd stay at the Brooks all over again.",5,2017,10,03
236,Very friendly great place to stay.,"Stayed here for four nights. Very clean and friendly. Connor the concierge was amazing remembering our names from the start and full of good advice of things to do. He would appear at breakfast each morning with a quick general knowledge question. Lovely staff, great food A+",5,2017,10,03
236,Friendly hotel,"This was our 5th visit to Brooks hotel Dublin always get a friendly welcome back Connor the head porter a true gentleman and always eager to give advice, the rooms are clean and perfectly fine breakfast is good as is the hotel restaurant called franchesca, the best part of this hotel is that its in the centre of Dublin walking distance to the main shopping area in Graften Street, going back again next year.",4,2017,10,03
236,A smaller hotel with all the classic touches,We were booked as a group of 40. Rooms were comfortable and well appointed. The included continental breakfast offered many choices and was well prepared. Touches like morning papers were welcomed. Concierge very helpful.,5,2017,10,02
236,Central,"Brooks Hotel Dublin very central great location Drury St, just a short walk to O Connell St Henry St Grafton St shopping areas   and all of the tourist attractions great front of house staff friendly and helpful lovely bar for brunch snacks drinks etc lovely room nice decor very clean comfy bed and pillows busy Hotel  expensive due to location would stay here again",4,2017,10,01
236,3 days short stay,The hotel facilities were fine but just a warning when staying to be extra careful when leaving any laundry. I had a quite expensive 'coatigan' left in a clearly marked laundry bag apparently disappear!,3,2017,09,27
236,Excellent location in the centre of Dublin,The perfect place to locate yourself so you can walk to many of the tourist attractions in the inner city. Very helpful staff at the front desk suggested directions to Trinity College and a pleasant pub with music. Comfortable bed. No power points near the bed meant an extension cord across the room. Hot water. Clean and pleasant rooms. Room staff found left behind things in family members room before we left hotel. Bonus points for this.,4,2017,09,26
236,5 nights at the Brooks,"The Brooks Hotel is very well situated in the heart of Dublin's center city. It was an easy walk to all the sites, the river Liffey, shopping, the pubs, the parks, the museums. 
  Service was very friendly, courteous, accurate, prompt throughout the entire team from check-in, cleaning service, concierge, dining room, and bar. It didn't seem to matter whom was on duty.  The service was impeccable. 
  Room accommodations: the two of us had a room with one queen size bed. It was of smallish size typical old big city hotels. The bed and sheeting were comfortable and I was brought alternatives to the ubiquitous duvet which I find too hot!  All was in working order and amenities ample. 
   The room has a safe which I find important.  Wifi is not password protected per user which I found unnerving and throughout hotels in Ireland. I guess the Irish are more trustworthy than me (USA). My APPLE system also didn't like their network and found it insecure. It was a minor problem as I just would turn wifi on and off as needed. I also had a purchased a data plan from my carrier.  But just saying so you know. 
   The Brooks has a work out room which is small but well appointed. I used it and was satisfied.  And the hotel's restaurant serves very good food at dinner as well as breakfast and throughout the day.",5,2017,09,25
236,Amazing atmosphere.,What a beautoful place to visit. It was an on the spot decision to stay here. And what a delight it was. Staff were morw than friendly. Expecially the gentleman who first accomodated us. Quick and efficient service and all were more than happy to help. Thanks again. ,5,2017,09,24
236,Safe space retreat,Very cordial hotel with great service and luxurious beds with great showers.  Breakfast was great    Very homey and comfortable.   Location is to die for. Close to shopping and reasonable priced eating.  Good place to explore this great city,4,2017,09,23
236,Fabulous location,"Big, clean rooms, great bathrooms with plenty of space, and a helpful staff. Close/walk-to everything. One concierge went out of his way to print out online tickets to see Book of Kells in Trinity College Library (amazing).This enabled us to walk right in when the tickets purchase line had 100+ people in it! We liked that there were so many choices for food, pubs, and sights - any budget/any taste- right nearby but you are one street off the busy tourist areas. Would not hesitate to recommend Brooks Hotel to friends and family.",5,2017,09,23
236,Nice central location,"Dublin has a lot of walking this hotel was central located which helped a lot. Rooms we nice and roomy very comfortable. Enjoyed the continental breakfast a lot to choose from.
Staff was extremely helpful & friendly",4,2017,09,22
236,Well located hotel,"The hotel's location is excellent being walking distance from Grafton Street, O'Connell Street, St Stephen's Green and Trinity College. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent and we ate in both the bar and restaurant. Both were good and rather quiet but that may be due to the number of other places to eat in the area nearby. Highly recommended.",5,2017,09,18
236,Cool Boutique Hotel!,"I know Dublin very well, but never saw this hotel before even though it was probably right in front of me many times. Very quiet, but fantastic location in the heart of city centre. It's small and likely needs a revamp at some point in the future, but I will definitely make a point of staying here again. 

The problem with the American flights is that they all land at like 06:00, while none of the hotels have availability until 3 pm since guests haven't checked out yet. I was with a conference group that booked into this hotel and they were able to make last minute arrangements transferring me from my original hotel to this one on short notice. 

I walked into a classical music ambience playing from a old-style radio (cute), with a like velour mannequin in the room for hanging suit jackets / etc. They offer a pillow choice service which I have never seen ever before. These are little things, but the perfect boutiquey things that bring a smile to your face. 

Breakfast is very nice. The staff are kind of overwhelmed when it gets busy and it took several asks to get some toast, but it's just one of those things.

Will definitely look to book here again!",5,2017,09,17
236,"Simply, Outstanding!","Perfect location. Dublin being a walking city, we found ourselves on a quite street, centrally located, within a short distance of great sights, shopping, food, and of course, drinks.

Attentive and helpful staff. Very friendly and willing to help.

Internet was strong throughout the building. Our only minor negative would be that the shower temperature would waver by a few degrees. My guess that due to peek use times by guests.",5,2017,09,17
236,UNEXPECTED SURPRISE,"I was expecting a small luxury hotel and found a out-dated small, no service hotel. no help with the bags, it was a do it your self to the room which was just large enough for two adults and two bags, and view of the service alley. restaurant was not crowded and the service was pretty good, probably because the menu was so limited. We did order off the bar menu, which had a better selection the the dinner menu. Decor in the room and corridors were out-dated and old.",2,2017,09,12
236,Front desk people were inexperienced.,"When we got there, my husband needed some over the counter medicine from a pharmacy.  I asked at the front desk if there was a pharmacy nearby.  She said possibly a department store might have what I needed, but there wasn't a pharmacy nearby.  We later found one a block away.  We asked for a cab to the Shelbourne hotel where we were supposed to catch a shuttle.  She called one for us and said it would be there in 5 minutes.  After 15 minutes, I asked where it was.  She told me that it often took 30 minutes - we didn't have 30 minutes - especially after we had wasted 15 minutes waiting - so we walked.  She didn't know where that hotel was - so we asked people on the street.  The location was fine, and the hotel room itself was fine - just need more experienced people at the front desk.  It was possibly just the person who was on duty as the next day I overheard people thanking the concierge for tickets he had found for them and saying how helpful he was - but we didn't receive that kind of help.",3,2017,09,12
236,return trip to Dublin,"Stayed here about 6 years ago but on our return nothing seems to have changed. Last time it was a business trip and it was ok. This time a holiday with friends but the hotel has a ""corporate ""feel to it. Bathrooms clean but in need of upgrading. Shower over bath tub with a dingy unappealing shower curtain. Central for most things in Dublin and fairly quiet but did not use the restaurant so cannot comment on the food. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.",3,2017,09,11
236,Perfect central Dublin location!,"Couldn't have asked for a better location for our first visit to Dublin! Walking distance to Trinity College, St Stephens Green (which is having lots of work done now), the free National Gallery of Art, famous 1916 Easter uprising Post Office, with scores of shops, pubs and cafes along the way!  Plus the area evolves into a vibrant social and music locale at night.

If you have just one night, have dinner directly across the street at Chef Dylan McGrath's Fade Street Social. Creative and fresh dishes, served by friendly well trained and knowledgeable staff.  For coffee, also go directly across the  street next to the car park entrance for delicious coffees, teas and freshly baked goodies. The friendly Owner/operators are a husband and wife team who graciously helped orient us to Dublin during our first hour there !

The hotel beds and pillows were very comfortable, and our beds had 'pillow menus' to ensure we had the perfect pillow for our taste. The windows actually opened fairly widely which was a bonus because there was no AC. Our weather was perfect, so no temp complaints. With the windows open, however, the loud waste disposal trucks dumping of the area bars Friday evening beer and wine bottles was a bit startling. 

The hotel staff were the best! Plentiful, gracious, and accommodating ... made all the better because of their collective Irish accents, which I love to hear🍀  will absolutely return to the Brooks!",5,2017,09,11
236,Hotel & Breakfast ,"Great location walked to shopping & restaurants, & local sights we wanted to see, concierge very  helpful  with directions and information on the area. 
Traditional European Hotel. For the price, location and wonderful breakfast we had included rate it 5 star. ",5,2017,09,08
236,Wonderful Central Dublin Hotel,"Strongly recommend the Brooks Hotel.  A great value, perfect location for touring.  Lovely well appointed rooms, and a wonderful staff.  A family run hotel that 'fits the bill' perfectly for a few days in Dublin",5,2017,09,05
236,Great location,"The hotel is perfect.   The rooms are large and well equipped, except for the ancient hairdryer in the bathroom.   The location is excellent and having a drink in the bar area after a day sightseeing was great.  We would certainly stay at the hotel again.",4,2017,09,04
236,A Convient Location,"Our travel agent booked us at the Brooks Hotel and it was an enjoyable stay, we'd go back.  We arrived very early in the morning, too early for our rooms to be ready.  There's a lounge area and restroom on the lower level where we were able to relax a bit, freshen up and grab a quick nap before heading out to explore the area until our rooms were ready.  Our rooms were a nice size to include the bathrooms.  Service within the hotel was great, Connor the doorman remembered everyone's name, such a gentleman!  We found it easy to walk to the area by Trinity College for our Hop on Hop Off bus tour as well as the Temple Bar area.  If you're into macaroons as we are, there's a Laduree within walking distance as well.  The breakfast was nice and we enjoyed the bar as well.",5,2017,09,04
236,Perfect place to stay,"We spend 2 nights in Dublin and stayed at the Brooks hotel. This hotel is part of the Small luxury hotel (SLH). The location was just great, near the main shopping area, 10 min walk to the Temple bar area where you can find real Irish pubs and restaurant. 

The hotel was very nice, room very clean and cozy but the most important was the service. From my reservation with Fiona who was just so amazing to the check-in staff and the concierge who was just outstanding
 Let's not forget the breakfast team. The breakfast good was really good, you need to have their Irish breakfast. 

I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2017,09,02
236,First time in Ireland,"The hotel is very nice, our room was extra large and clean and bright, as in every where we visited in Ireland the hotel staff was quite nice. and friendly, and it was located  in an excellent area. Cannot wait to return",5,2017,08,30
236,A Nice Property,"A really nice hotel in a great location. Modern, interesting design and the rooms were not pint sized at all. The doorman was really helpful when we needed to park our car and he found a spot on the street since we were there for one night at the back end of a trip.",4,2017,08,29
236,Nice boutique hotel in a good location,"For the US traveler, the Brooks reminded me a bit of a Kimpton.  Nice place, small rooms.  What made it a lifesaver for us is the guest lounge where you can hang out in the morning before checking in for those who arrive super early.",4,2017,08,29
236,Location great....room quality lacking,"The location is terrific. The staff are pleasant. But after that, it's downhill. The rooms are reminiscent of any mid-market business hotel (Holiday Inn) and the bathrooms (rusted tub, leaky taps) are not nice at all. Our king-size room faced a courtyard with food smells wafting up the whole day. The front desk staff was ill-informed about some very basic items. For example, we needed a pharmacy after 600 pm and the clerk informed us that it was ""not possible"" to find one. And yet, we had just identified one (via google) not 5 minutes from the hotel and we wanted her to confirm that it was open. Reluctantly, she phoned and (surprise!) it was open until 900 pm, as the website indicated. I suggested to the clerk that she ""file that information away"" because other guests might want to know about it, and she responded that this was ""news to her"" and she couldn't believe we (foreigners, visitors) found out about it. My google is her google, so this just seems like laziness or poor staff training.",3,2017,08,28
236,Brilliant hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I can't rave enough about how good my stay at the Brooks Hotel was - it absolutely made my trip!

Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a balcony room and wow, it was impressive! The room was huge, with a comfortable king-sized bed, huge, dual-sink bathroom and bath/shower, as well as a small balcony with tables and chairs. A pillow menu was also available, but I was more than happy with the selection provided. Complimentary still and sparkling water was also provided each day, which was excellent!

The location is perfect - 5 minutes walk to Stephen's Green / Grafton St and also 5 minutes in the other direction to College Green. About a 10 minute walk to the heart of Temple Bar. The area is busy, but the rooms are quiet. I always felt safe, even when  having to meet a tour on College Green at 6:30am. Many pubs and restaurants are within a short walk.

The hotel breakfast was good, with items able to be ordered from a menu, or self-selected from the buffet. I also ate in the hotel restaurant one night and it was delicious and competitively priced.

The hotel has a guest lounge in the basement, which is set up like a living room, with chess and books to read. A great option for groups travelling together to meet or a place to relax other than your room.

Staff were nothing but friendly, helpful and professional and more than willing to assist with things like wake-up calls and booking taxis.

I would not consider staying anywhere else next time I am in Dublin - I will definitely be back at the Brooks Hotel!

236,Two excellent stays,"Brooks is a luxury hotel that is very well located in Dublin's city centre. We stayed three nights before our tour and one night after, and our room both times was quiet, spacious and spotlessly clean. The private residents' lounge on the hotel's lower level includes comfortable seating, books, and a computer/printer to check in for your flight online and print your boarding pass. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant one night, and it was excellent. Highly recommended!",5,2017,08,27
236,Perfect location.,Staff  are excellent a special thank you to the breakfast team and ioleska for making our stay so special. I would also like to thank Fiona in the reception. Perfect location for seeing Dublin and the best deals seem to be on the website,4,2017,08,27
236,Excellent service and location,"The Brooks Hotel was in a great location to explore Dublin, and close to good pubs and restaurants as well as shopping and sightseeing highlights.  Our room was extremely comfortable and spacious, and the hotel staff made sure every detail was perfect.",5,2017,08,25
236,A great Place to stay,This was my first trip to Ireland and the first & last place we stayed at. The rooms were comfortable and clean and tidy. The staff were in the main very friendly and helpful. On returning to the hotel after visiting Kerry we received a complimentary upgrade.,4,2017,08,25
236,"Friendly, comfortable, great location!","Stayed two nights in a very comfortable room with king size bed and a choice of pillows! The room was clean, quiet and the staff was lovely. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was perfect and the server, Sofia, was so pleasant and helpful. Lovely hotel in a great location.",5,2017,08,25
236,Inadequate financial systems,"I stayed at this hotel for one night and the hotel itself was good. Plus points was good and friendly service and a nice residents lounge - possibly overall 4 stars. 

My poor rating reflects the problems that I have had in payment of my bill and the stress that has caused me.

When I arrived I made a prepayment on a credit card. When I left I settled the actual bill. Four days later the prepayment was still on my account and I rang my credit card supplier who said that they would alert the hotel and that the payment would be removed in 24 hours. It is still there.

I rang the hotel to speak to the manager but they were not available. I was passed onto reservations who were unable to help but offered to pass me on to accounts. At this stage I gave up.

I am unclear what to do next and the resulting stress has made it unlikely that I will use hotels in this group again.",1,2017,08,25
236,The Best in Many Ways,"Dublin was the first leg of our 14 days in Ireland and the Brooks Hotel proved to be the best choice for this city, particularly after   a flight of more than 6 hours and a time difference of 5 hours making up the jet lag.

We asked for an early check-in, but knew that could never be guaranteed unless they were prepared to get rid of the current guests and hide the bodies if necessary... but it wasn't a problem since the hotel had a beautiful lounge area in the basement to allow us to relax while we waited for our room to be ready. We also had a snack in the bar area just off the lobby and even got a visit from the concierge who was able to make reservations for dinner that night at a great restaurant within walking distance of the hotel.

What makes this the best hotel in many ways? We were staying three nights and had booked directly a Deluxe Suite with Breakfast included, but much to our amazement landed up with an upgrade to the Presidential Suite. What a treat! Secondly, the concierge was proactive in suggesting restaurants and some places to see and making the reservations for us. In addition, this hotel is so well located in proximity to incredible restaurants, the Grafton Street shopping area, pubs, the Temple Bar area, Trinity College, the GPO and many other historical sites. There is a parking garage directly across the street from the hotel, but we have no idea how much it costs for parking since we were using a private chauffeur service while in Ireland.

As with any hotel, it is only bricks and mortar... you've got to have the very best staff to make it truly stand out from the rest.  The Brooks Hotel does exactly that!

",5,2017,08,24
236,A great centrally located hotel!,"We were a 3 generation (21-76) family group of 10 beginning our 10 day trip to Ireland, starting in Dublin.  We chose Brooks Hotel for its central location, which allowed us in 2 jam-packed days to, on our own (no tours), use the Hop On-Hop Off bus in addition to walking, and saw everything on our list.  Hotel staff were efficient and friendly, and our 5 rooms were spacious and clean.  The included breakfast buffet was varied and delicious.  We highly recommend it!",5,2017,08,24
236,Lovely place to stay in a great location!,"The staff was absolutely wonderful at this this lovely hotel nestled in the best location in Dublin. Before I even arrived Ellie from registration was so helpful in arranging our rooms. Once there, someone in our party did not like their room because it was too noisy so they changed they room. The rooms are nicely appointed with nice bathrooms and good wifi. The front desk staff is extremely helpful and recommended our wonderful tour guide Robbie who took us to Wicklow Mountains and other great sites. All in all a great stay at the Brooks in wonderful Dublin!",5,2017,08,21
236,Comfortable room in a great location,Central hotel to all the major tourist attractions in Dublin. The room was clean and comfortable and the front reception was extremely helpful. The breakfast in general was great but the toast was scarcely better than warm bread.,5,2017,08,20
236,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Beautiful accommodations in the Dublin City Centre.  The hotel has a beautiful bar with live piano music in the evenings. (There is also a restaurant but didn't eat there.)  Everyone from the Connor (the wonderful doorman dressed in morning coat!) to the wait staff was helpful and wanted to ensure that your needs were met.  Great location - easy walking access to Trinity College, shopping, Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle and more.  If I'm lucky enough to find myself in Dublin again, I would be hard pressed to go anywhere else.",5,2017,08,20
236,Great Dublin location and hotel!,"Lovely home base from which to explore Dublin.  Great breakfast at restaurant, steps from everything and great service at hotel.  Concierge ""Uncle Colin"" was in particular our favorite host!  Loved the stay",5,2017,08,17
236,SOMETIMES LOCATION ISN'T EVERYTHING,"This was my 3rd trip to Ireland.  Decided to give the Brooks a go after hearing good things.  On the positive side, if location is what you desire, it's perfect.  If old time Ireland is the look you  prefer, it's perfect.  However, if you're a little bit of a hotel snob ( and I am guilty) then perhaps this is not your place.

We were running late from our return from Prague, so we arrived at approximately 8PM Reception was courteous, friendly and swift upon checking us in.  We were assigned room 111.  It was a small room with a king size bed and mediocre bathroom (shower stall only)   The hallways are narrow and the rooms are outdated.

The odd number rooms face the alley behind the hotel.  Our room happen to  be exactly across the alley from the hotel kitchen.  Exhaust fan roaring, workers in the courtyard smoking, garbage being rolled into bins.  I immediately went to reception and asked to switch our rooms and was denied and informed that the kitchen closes at 930pm and it would be quiet.  Not quite the case.  Upon returning from dinner around 1030, the gate to the kitchen was still up and it was noisy.  Opening up the window for fresh air is not an option due to kitchen smells(both good and bad) and noise.  For this reason I say, location is not everything, I much prefer to walk a bit further then not be able to open my blinds and window since we were almost eye level to the kitchen and more importantly this room cost 350.00 for a one night stay, as opposed to the Morgan which is equal in every way in my opinion for location and ammenities ( which there were none) and cost 146.00 a night.   The Brooks charges almost 20 Euro for breakfast, where the Morgan 10.  
Do yourself a favor and don't eat at either, go to the Queen of Tarts for a proper quaint Irish Breakfast.  There are 3 I belive within Dublin.  It's a tiny little cafe that won't disappoint.
3.5 - 4 stars at best for the Brooks",3,2017,08,17
236,Wonderful Stay,"My husband booked our hotel for 1 night to celebrate my birthday before we headed home from England but let them know we'd be arriving early. When we got to the hotel, our room wasn't ready but they were more than happy to store our luggage while we were sightseeing because we had 12pm tickets for the Trinity College Library. The hotel staff couldn't have been any nicer! The hotel is close to everything! Within a quick walk to Temple Bar area and the pub next door is great for food/drinks. I wouldn't recommend their room service food because there are so many restaurants around the area. After the library and castle visit we came back at 2pm to find our luggage waiting in our room and they left a cupcake for my birthday which was amazing and made in their kitchen. During our 2 week trip, Dublin is where we found the nicest people! We'll be returning to the Brooks next time in Dublin! ",5,2017,08,16
236,"Excellent location, helpful and kind people at the reception desk, nice room","We spent 4 nights.  The location is great and quiet at the same time, close to everything. Some blocks away, in Temple Bar, it gets really noisy in the night. Here you have restaurants, etc, in the same block, but you may sleep well! :) The room was nice, and the staff was kind and helpful. The wifi sometimes didn't work that well in the room, but then we called and they restarted it and it went well.",4,2017,08,16
236,Perfect Location,"We stayed 4 nights here at the beginning of our two week vacation. We had flown all night and arrived early AM.  They were able to put us in our room early in the day so we could relax, settle in and freshen up.  Everyone was very kind and helpful.  The room was perfect, comfortable and very clean. Plus this was a very quiet hotel so sleeping was easy. We had a room that included breakfast everyone day and the food on the buffet was plentiful and the hot food was delicious. The location is perfect in city center to walk to everything we wanted to see. Great way to start our visit to Ireland!",5,2017,08,16
236,Quaint,"Was greeted immediately by staff upon check-in.  Rooms were tiny.  Halls were tiny.  Elevators were tiny.  Beds were less comfortable than others during our holiday.
The lobby is small and can become overwhelmed quickly with people especially with tour groups.  Location is close to numerous venues and restaurants.  Overall quaint equated to tiny and cramped.",3,2017,08,16
236,Great location,"We stayed here for just one night in August 2017.  Nice comfortable room, quiet despite the busy street outside.  Service was excellent, very helpful and pleasant staff. I would stay this hotel again. Great central location close to shopping areas.  Within walking distance of many places, like Stephen's Green.  Safe convenient car parking.",5,2017,08,16
236,Fabulous once again!,"There is nothing negative to say about this hotel. The service from every member of staff is exceptional. When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly reception staff who went out of their way to get the room we required.(we needed a double and one single bed for our young boy). This was organised within minutes.
The rooms are spotless, comfortable and have everything that one would require. The food and breakfast was really good.
Being so centrally located, the Brooks offers everything that a guest would want.
This hotel (and we have stayed in the top 5 star hotels in Dublin) is our number one choice. It gets a 5star for service, accommodation, friendliness, cleanliness, food, location from us. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2017,08,15
236,Outstanding Luxury Hotel,"To begin, this was the first hotel I have been in that was classified as ""luxury"". There are only 96 world-wide, which makes this review important. 
I had just deplaned from a 7 hour, overseas flight, originating in NYC and ending in Dublin, Ireland. The flight was packed, I didn't sleep, and I had lost a full day!
The room was not ready when we arrived, (I was traveling in a small, family group, there were 4 of us). However, we were sent to the lounge, which was more like a living room, complete with fireplace and books. It eased the waiting greatly. 
When the rooms were ready, we were invited up, and what a surprise. The room was gorgeous with a tremendous view of Dublin streets and cathedrals in the distance. Our entire stay was for four (4) days, and I wouldn't have minded staying longer.
The room was equipped with everything from plush bathrobes to an electric teapot, complete with service for two (2). The bathroom was generously proportioned (European standards), and had plenty of vanity space for two (2) women traveling together. 
The hotel had a full restaurant with bar service, and a separate breakfast dining area. The food was wonderful! There was a complete, full Irish breakfast every morning, along with items available from a separate menu. Lunch and dinner offerings were numerous and wonderfully presented. 
The hotel staff were completely and utterly accommodating. I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Everyone from the housekeeping staff, to the desk clerks were always friendly and ready to fulfill every request. The concierge and maître d', went above and beyond their normal duties.
The only thing I have to say, is if you ever get an opportunity to stay at one of these luxury hotels, grab it! You will NOT be disappointed.",5,2017,08,13
236,Perfection ,A beautiful hotel in a perfect location.  Everything is easily accessible from the Brooks. The service was phenomenal.  Very friendly staff. Easy access parking if you have a car. Great relaxing lounge in the lower floor.,5,2017,08,11
236,Great location,"The hotel is in a good location and is very convenient to shopping, the Temple Bar area and local restaurants and bars. 
The room was very comfortable; a good size with good beds and bathroom. The hallways are a little dark and stuffy.",4,2017,08,11
236,Excellent service and a wonderful location!,"My fiancé and I spent two nights at the Brooks on our way to a wedding in Waterford and could not have been happier with our stay. Every staff member who assisted us went above and beyond to be helpful and make us feel welcome. We had initially planned to stay only one night, but had such a great experience that we extended our stay.

The hotel is conveniently located in Dublin and serves as a great central location for exploring anything you want to see in the city. The restaurant and bar in the hotel were wonderful and  there are also plenty of bars and great restaurants nearby.

I look forward to staying at the Brooks again the next time I'm in Dublin and have recommended it to everyone who is heading there!",5,2017,08,11
236,"Perfect location, wonderful staff","My wife and I stayed at the Brooks during the third week of May, and we feel like we made the perfect choice.  It is just a few blocks up from Grafton Street, near many public transport stops, and just a really nice hotel.

The staff were phenomenal when it came to recommendations for places to eat and things to do.  It's been three-months since our stay, but I still remember fondly how the doorman Conor remembered my wife's and my name every time we ran into him during our stay.  I'm sure he sees 200 guests per day, and remembers all of their names.  Very impressive.  The bar area is very nice, and we really enjoyed our conversations with the young lady bartender from Wexford (or was it Wicklow, hmmm?), as she gave us some great ideas on how to spend our time in various parts of Ireland.  Last, but certainly not least, the Hotel Manager (I didn't catch his name) was a lifesaver.  I went to the front desk asking if I could get a plastic bag to make an ice pack to help with my arthritic back, and he did me one better; he gave me a box of six ice packs that I used as needed over the next two-weeks traipsing around the country.

If we are ever back in Dublin we intend to stay at the Brooks.  What a great experience!",5,2017,08,10
236,Great service and location ,We recently traveled to Ireland for a two week stay and spent 3 nights in the Brooks Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms were a nice size for a city hotel with space for toiletries and luggage. All staff were pleasant and helpful especially helping us with information and timing for leaving for the airport for our departure back to the states. They were even able to tell us how US customs worked at the Dublin airport which was different than my previous trips to the U.K. And Europe. The breakfasts were I lovely - great variety and quality. I would return. ,5,2017,08,08
236,"Central location, lovely hotel, yummy breakfast","Stayed here for a few days B&B. Lovely restaurant and bar, perfect for a relaxing night cap following an exhausting day of sightseeing..
Excellent location for exploring by foot historical places of interest around Dublin. Friendly staff and very clean. Would definitely return and would highly recommend. 
Didn't get around to using their gym and hot tub!!
",5,2017,08,08
236,"Great location, good value, a few minor flaws","We loved the location of this hotel, just a few minutes' walk from Temple Bar and Trinity College, and the hop on / hop off tour buses. The staff are VERY friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is tasty, and there's a lovely resident's lounge downstairs with cozy sofas and a fireplace. The bed was comfortable, and there is even a menu offering different types of pillows! We enjoyed the Hairy Lemon pub and Super Miss Sue (awesome fish and chips) - both of which are literally around the corner from the hotel.

My (admittedly minor) quibbles:
1. The website photos are misleading. The lobby was darker and had just a couple of armchairs - no sofas. The ""classic"" room was MUCH smaller than it appears in the photo - we could barely walk around the bed.
2. Showers were less fun because the shower curtain was hung less than 20 inches from the wall. A curved shower curtain rod would transform the whole experience.
3. The shower was in a deep bathtub, and there was no grab bar on the wall. My in-laws had difficulty stepping in and out of the tub. They tried holding onto the towel rod, but found it was already disconnected from the wall (apparently previous guests had the same problem and pulled too hard on the towel bar).

This hotel gets the major things right and is a good value. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and to stay here again on our next visit to Dublin.",4,2017,08,08
236,Professional Front Desk,"We have stayed at the Brooks Hotel twice so far and feel that it is one of the best places to stay while in Dublin. The rooms  (we stayed in a Deluxe) are decent sized for a European hotel.  They are also spotless and comfortable. The bathroom had a nice tub but I would have preferred  a better hair dryer. Ours was of cheap tube kind attached to the wall.  It is close to George's Arcade which was interesting.  The Gaiety Theatre is a 3  minute walk away.  In case you feel the need for an extra layer, there is also a good Patagonia Outlet shop nearby. Within walking is Grafton, ST. Stephen's Green, and a 3mobile store (good deal on visitor sims to use in your unlocked phone). I made a birthday video for a friend and asked many people to say happy birthday to my friend stuck in the States.  The front desk staff played along and were delightful. The chocolate brownie in the bar is worth a stop also.",5,2017,08,07
236,Great experience,"Wonderful hotel in a quiet neighborhood yet within walking distance of most attractions.  Great food, friendly servers and very accommodating hosts.  Would definitely stay there again.  Has good-sized rooms, plus 2 lifts.",5,2017,08,06
236,A must to stay in Dublin,"From the moment we entered the hotel we were welcomed by professional and friendly staff.
The hotel itself is situated in a great central location walking distance to bars and restuarants.
The food in the restuarant for evening meal was gorgeous and breakfast was moreish!! 
We will be back.......",5,2017,08,06
236,Great location but disappointing staff,"I think we were spoilt by staying at Casa Camper Barcelona before visiting this hotel. All that wonderful bench space in the bathroom was non existent here. There was not even a powerpoint in the bathroom. This is a very basic/standard room. It was clean but the bathroom was small. The Location is the best part about it. We walked all over Dublin from here. 
The front of staff disappointed a few times - we asked for an extra umbrella and was told only one per room and we asked if it was possible for a late checkout and were met with a range of additional costs. They never greeted you on entering/exiting the hotel. Customer service was lacking. There was one young gentleman who worked on the main floor who was helpful with sorting out our powerpoint issues. He was lovely.
Not sure if I would stay here again.",3,2017,08,06
236,Great location and good value.,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at the Brooks hotel in late June. I would say this is one of the best locations in Dublin for sightseeing without a need for a car. On one side of the hotel was a Starbucks and the other side was a typical Irish pub with great food and friendly staff. We walked to most of the sights, although several days is needed to see everything. The weather was cool and wet but the room was very spacious, nicely decorated and comfortable, with A/C and a pillow menu. It is close to Temple Bar but far enough away to avoid the noise.
We met Barry, the manager, who was very friendly and helpful, as were all the staff. On any future trips to Dublin I would certainly stay here again.",5,2017,08,02
236,Great Hotel,"Good location. Friendly staff. Wonderful breakfast! We stayed here for two nights. I left my sunglasses behind and they helped mail them to me at my home in the
 states. Thank you! They arrived today in perfect condition. ",5,2017,08,01
236,Wonderful experience!,I have just returned from a two night stay at your wonderful hotel where nothing was a problem to resolve! I must mention in particular Anne Kinsella who looked after us so well and Marvin who very kindly walked us to the Gaiety in case we got lost. The restaurant staff were excellent and all our requests were met. I look forward to returning and will be recommending it to all my friends in Cork and elsewhere. Thanks again. Kay.,5,2017,08,01
236,Super friendly staff and location,"We arrived at the Brooks Hotel after a 6 hour flight from the states absolutely exhausted, and a nice young man at the desk greeted us and informed us of places to visit on the map he gave us. He also said there was a lounge downstairs for guests who wanted to take a nap before their room was ready or just to relax. My dad wanted some coffee, so he asked at the front desk and they brought it down to him on a platter. WHAT!? Amazing service. We were able to get in around 2pm (as the young man had put us as a top priority) and the room was fantastic and clean. The room staff was super friendly and the head maid actually checked on us to make sure we made it to our room okay. Breakfast was the only part of this trip that could use some work, simply because the head of the separate restaurant where breakfast is served is quite stuck up. However, the restaurant as I said it separate from the hotel, so does not take away anything from the hotel. Great staff who are friendly and always on hand. Would absolutely stay again. We were absolutely spoiled in great hospitality and the rest of our hotels for the rest of our trip in Europe had high bars to reach to come close to the Brooks Hotel.",5,2017,07,31
236,Perfect location to explore Dublin,"We stayed at the Brooks for two nights while touring Ireland. It is centrally located, just steps away from St. George's market, lots of coffee houses and restaurants as well as attractions like Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College. The rooms and beds are very comfortable and breakfast includes a cold buffet or you can order hot items. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend this hotel and am looking forward to coming back for our last night in Dublin. ",5,2017,07,29
236,"Great location, modern hotel","The Brooks is an excellent hotel-4 star. Nice sized room, comfortable bed. All the expected amenities.  It has  a great location. We were able to walk to almost anything we wanted to see and do, and there were numerous restaurants and pubs right in the area. (Recommend the Hairy Lemon, on the corner.) One other big plus: we arrived about 8 am, maybe even earlier. Of course our room wasn’t ready, but the Brooks has a lovely residents’ lounge, separate from the reception area, where we were able to just relax and recover from the flight. If you arrive on an overnight flight, this small amenity, plus the location, make the Brooks are real winner. Breakfast was excellent as well.",5,2017,07,28
236,Friendly and informative staff!,"The best part of our 3 night stay at Brooks was the staff.  Rory, who helped us with our bags, helped us with booking a dinner reservation and was just about the most positive person we met during our 2 week stay in Ireland!  The ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and accommodated our requests.  The folks who cleaned our room and provided us with extra pillows were so very kind.  The breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and the location of Brooks is perfect for sight seeing.",5,2017,07,27
236,Centrally located and very accomodating,We arrived in Dublin at 7 in the morning and the hotel staff was very accommodating.  They provided a place for us to freshen up and stored our luggage until our room was ready.  We hit the sightseeing trail and the front desk texted me when our room was ready.  We returned after lunch and they had put our luggage in our room.  Throughout of three night stay the staff was very interested in our trip and provided very suggestions and directions.  The location is convenient to everything and the Full Irish Breakfast prepared us to take on the day.,5,2017,07,24
236,Excellent location and service,"We stayed here for one night for a long layover in Dublin. The hotel is pricey but the location and service can't be beat. The hotel is within walking distance to almost all the major sites in Dublin. The rooms are beautiful and clean. Shower pressure is amazing. The reception and wait staff are so very welcoming and helpful--quick to offer recommendations for restaurants, provide maps and orientation to the area, make change, etc. No request was too big or small for them, and all were accommodated with a smile. I would absolutely return!",5,2017,07,22
236,Centrally located and fantastic staff but a bit over priced,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks hotel immediately upon arriving in Ireland. The hotel was a great welcoming to the beautiful country. First and foremost the staff was wonderful and very friendly. It was also centrally located to all the main attractions which we loved being able to walk every where. One down side to our experience is that our hotel overlooked a roof with a generator so not really what we were hoping for but we didn't spend much time in the hotel anyways. The only thing holding me back from rating 5 stars is that this hotel was a bit overpriced. In total, my husband and I were in Ireland for 2 and a half weeks and this hotel was the most expensive one we stayed in, however not the nicest. The price may be in large part due to it being in Dublin however there were far fancier hotels we stayed in across the country at a better value. Overall, great staff and wonderful location!",4,2017,07,21
236,Regular haunt ,"I am in this hotel on business at least once a month. I don't always stay, but usually conduct meetings in the bar area. Staff are absolutely outstanding, and let's face it, that's what makes a place great. They love to see regular clientele and always make me feel welcome to be back at brooks. Excellent coffee and a varied lunch menu. The rooms are super clean. They are small but well equipped. This is an excellent location for a hotel. About a 3 minute walk from Grafton Street. I look forward to my next visit! ",5,2017,07,20
236,Amazing hotel in Dublin,"This is an amazing hotel with wonderful and friendly staff. It is walking distance to the Temple Bar and other attractions. The hop on Hop off buses are about a 10 minute walk with many bars, restaurants and food stores only 5 minutes away. The free breakfast is amazing and the restaurant and bars are very comfortable. The bedrooms are very homely with comfortable beds and really quiet for a good nights sleep. I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back again one day.",5,2017,07,18
236,Fabulous location ,Brooks location is centrally located with a lovely breakfast ( included) and a great bar too.  Staff is helpful but was a bit surprised that they weren't friendlier since our trip was filled with so many lovely and friendly people.  This is a must stay if convenience is important. Starbucks and a yoga studio and hair salon next door !,4,2017,07,17
236,Base for 3 days in Dublin,"Travel party of 3 (my 3rd time in Ireland, my wife's second and my 19 year old son's first) really enjoyed Brooks. We drove but found the hotel and car park with only a little difficulty. Front desk and valets were friendly and helpful. Room was clean. We had a queen bed with a twin bed and had plenty of room for the 3 of us. Bathroom and its amenities were great. Only complaint was the shower curtain liked to join you as you cleaned yourself. Included breakfast of buffet and hot breakfast was very good with great selections. The hotel is right in the middle of Dublin and makes sightseeing very easy. We did a Hop-on Hop-off with the green bus team and it worked out very well. Only caution is that while all the stops are visitable you need to buy tickets in advance (maybe a day or more) for Kilmainham Gaol. Easy walking distance from multiple pubs, SSG, Temple Bar, Trinity, Dublin Castle, etc. We would stay here again.",4,2017,07,16
236,Excellent.,"Excellent hotel in an excellent central location in Dublin. Professional polite and welcoming staff both on reception and in the dining area. Very clean room, comfortable bed and high standard furnishings. Probably the best breakfast I have enjoyed in a hotel. The full Irish breakfast was hearty and set me up for the day. ",5,2017,07,14
236,Excellent Hotel and well situated,"Brooks for the quality of hotel is good value. We were checked in speedily and the room was a good size and we were asked whether we wanted a quiet room. This we did certainly get. The room was very classical and well furnished. The breakfast was excellent served by attentive and experienced staff. In fact many of the staff were with  long time service and knew their subject. The concierge was full of good ideas and routes, the restaurant staff at breakfast were always smiling. The front desk were helpful but a little remote and spoke to you as children. All other staff were excellent. We used the residents lounge for our drinks and it was like a week, designed library in a private club and very roomy and comfortable. There is a cinema but we never found it except for the picture in the lift. When we wanted a taxi the hotel always called friendly and knowledgable drivers. We hired a car for our stay in Ireland but quickly realised that taxis are better and cheaper. The car park across the road was well situated and there is a waive of fee for the hotel, but we could never find anyone on duty in the car park. The car park is not run by the hotel. 
We would certainly stay at Brooks again. All the attractions are very close by. ",5,2017,07,13
236,Base of Operations,"Great location! Within walking distance to shops, restaurants, Trinity College, tourist sites, Temple Bar. Comfortable rooms,  though the view of the parking garage isn't great. Service is very good. Lounge on ground floor is a great place to relax. In house is restaurant and bar is more than adequate for a quick bite or drink.",4,2017,07,12
236,"Nice hotel, good location, good wifi, but no hot water","Nice hotel, quiet and peaceful with good location. Breakfast wasn't that good, but for the coffee you have Starbucks next to the hotel. Wifi worked nicely and you could rely on that during working hours.",4,2017,07,11
236,Good intro to ireland for us. ,"We flew into Dublin. We only got to stay one night, everything was perfect.  Didn't get to eat dinner, but the breakfast was amazing. Far from the normal hotel fare. Even fresh squeezed orange juice to go with the buffet and made to order breakfast.  ",5,2017,07,10
236,Comfortable Hotel - Ideal Location!,"The location of Brooks Hotel couldn't be better for a Dublin City break. It is just off Grafton Street and shops, restaurants, theatres and attractions are just a short walk away.
 From check-in to check-out this hotel was outstanding, especially in terms of service. The staff throughout the hotel, without exception, were friendly, efficient and helpful during our two day stay. 
We were upgraded to a delux room and it was beautifully appointed and just that bit different to the usual hotel room. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows and bed linen were all of good quality. The bathroom had plenty of good quality towels and products. The only issue here was the shower curtain - it really should be replaced with a glass screen! 
Everything throughout the hotel is well maintained and spotless.
The breakfast is excellent. The buffet section may have a smaller selection than you might expect, but it is apparent that the emphasis is on the quality and freshness of the produce, from the juice through to the fruit, cheese, meats, breads and pastries. The cooked to order breakfast menu is one of the best I have encountered! The quality of the full Irish breakfast is second to none! The smoked salmon and scrambled eggs were equally good. 
We also had a lovely family dinner on one of the nights in Francesca's Restaurant. 
I will definitely be returning to Brooks when in Dublin and highly recommend it for a city visit.",5,2017,07,10
236,"Nice hotel, central location","We stayed one night at the Brooks and were quite satisfied with the room and location. It was not perfect (small room, bathroom door would not close, a bit of street noise) but nice.  Loved having a drink in the bar with live piano music. Great location for sightseeing.",4,2017,07,02
236,Always a great stay and prime location!,"This is our 3rd year going to Ireland and always return to the Brooks Hotel.  It's prime location and excellent staff makes this hotel so great.  If you're looking for some shopping a stroll in the park, or the bars, it's all within a 5 minute walk!  I can't say enough about the staff, especially Connor, Melissa and Marvin, to name a few.  They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  My husband and I wanted to see the Riverdance while in Dublin but Ticketmaster in the States did not offer the international shows.  I couldn't buy them through Ticketmaster.IE because they required a credit card with a valid ""country"" code.  Anyway, I emailed the hotel, and they were more than happy to purchase them for us and settled the bill when we arrived.  I'm definitely returning next year as it seems it has now become tradition.  Love Ireland and the people!",5,2017,07,02
236,Convenient Functional Hotel,"Our first visit and pleasantly surprised to be given an upgrade to their master suite. Normally this would have resulted in a higher ranking than 3 but we did have few misgivings about the place. The biggest issue was a restaurant kitchen fan outside the room which was one of the noisiest I've ever experienced in my days of travelling. We were offered an alternative but took a gamble that it would be turned off before we went to bed but unfortunately it wasn't so we resorted to earplugs! If you are a light sleeper then I suggest you avoid the back of the hotel. The hotel itself is functional looking – good quality décor, furnishings and accessories but no wow factor. Service was a bit mixed – some very friendly staff but no automatic welcome as you came through the door and surprisingly no turn down service, nor did anyone ask about our stay on check out. They did however pick up it was my wife's birthday and left a cake in our room which was a nice touch. The bar, restaurant and lobby areas were again very functional looking – no specific complaints but lacking a bit of class. Breakfast was served in the lobby – good quality and reasonable choice. Suggest you sit in the restaurant area as the lobby tables are quite low and small Overall the hotel was ok, is well located for the south side but there nothing to make us want to return.",3,2017,07,02
236,First night in Ireland,"We traveled to Ireland and were seriously jet lagged when we got here. Check in is at 3. We arrived at 12:30, we were too early so they asked us to get lunch and check back in in a couple of hours. We came back at 2:15 with our room available. The staff is friendly and very accommodating. We had breakfast the next day in the hotel restaurant where the assortment was spectacular. Brooks hotel is well within walking distance to anywhere you want to go.  

There is a parking garage, or in Ireland a car park directly across the street.",4,2017,06,29
236,"Location, location, location","This is a wonderful hotel.  The location is the best.  We were able to walk to almost everything.  It's a nice, quiet hotel.  We totally enjoyed staying here.  We were there for six nights and would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,06,27
236,"A+ location, A breakfast, B+ room","This hotel with very friendly, helpful staff was located perfectly between so many of Dublin's interesting attractions. We were able to walk everywhere except Killemain Gaol, about 2 miles away. The room only gets a B+ because it doesn't have an exhaust mechanism. When you shower, you have to leave the door slightly ajar or you end up in a steam room. Excellent breakfast definitely was worth it. Didn't have to stop for lunch. If you are arriving mid-morning we recommend you look into a free tour of the north side. If you are arriving mid-afternoon, the a free tour of the south side the next morning provide great orientation. Don't miss the Literary Pub tour and the Irish Music Pub tour, both so much fun. ",5,2017,06,27
236,Best hotel,"Great hotel, in quiet neighborhood but close to everything 
Room #503 was fantastic, staff over the top especially Marvin and Connor
Breakfast terrific great cappuccino wonderful food 
Recommend highly!!",5,2017,06,24
236,"Location, location, location ","Within walking distance of pretty much everything you want to see and do in Dublin, great breakfast, super friendly and helpful staff.  All the bells and whistles: good, free wifi, air conditioning.  Only minor complaint was the narrow tub/shower with shower curtain .  The tub itself is fine but a curved shower curtain rod would allow you to turn around without touching the curtain.  ",4,2017,06,19
236,Staying for Robbie Williams concert,"Brooks Hotel was simply outstanding.From the minute you walk in the front door you are warmly greeted by there receiption staff.Niamh was so friendly helpful and took care of us from the start.Conor was so accomadating and was such a gentleman.The room was first class,im so glad i booked here and if anyone thinking of coming to Dublin i would reccomend you stay here.If i came back i definately would.The Brooks Hotel first class.",5,2017,06,18
236,Great Location with Good Service,"A group of 6 of us visited Dublin recently and stayed at the Brooks Hotel. Clearly, the location is outstanding if you want to be close to the action in Temple Bar. Most of the best attractions are within walking distance of the Brooks Hotel. The service at the hotel was good, not great, with a mixture of wonderful employees (mostly in the dining room and bar) and very average employees, all to be expected in a larger hotel. I was pleased that they had an exercise room, but it was nothing special and from what I could tell, seldom used.  Their food was good with a nice breakfast buffet, but nothing special. Of the 6 hotels/inns we visited during this golf trip, I would probably rate the Brooks Hotel lowest, but it was also the largest.  On balance, I would go back there for the location alone.",4,2017,06,17
236,Perfect place to stay in Dublin,"Lovely room with all usual amenities; but the location of the hotel is the winner.  Tucked away from all the hustle and bustle but minutes away from the best there is in Dublin; parks, shopping, restaurants and bars.  The public area are really nice and there is a great atmosphere in this fab hotel...., and the staff - well this is Dublin so of course they are funny, helpful and welcoming.",5,2017,06,16
236,Perfect Location!,"Stayed for one night. Perfect location to explore the city. Hotel was clean & modern, staff were helpful & friendly. Room was lovely & offered a menu to help choose your perfect pillow. We would stay again. ",4,2017,06,16
236,Fantastic stay,"This hotel in a perfect location for those looking to explore Dublin. Its close to great shopping, pubs, restaurants and all the sites! The hotel is small but perfectly formed with everything you could need or want. Rooms also are compact but quirky and comfortable. I thought the lavender pillow spray was a lovely touch. Highlight of the stay was the fantastic breakfast, brilliant selection, wonderful buffet and lovely staff especially Iowaska (sure that's spelt wrong)  who count do enough to see we were looked after. Well definitely be back!",5,2017,06,14
236,Brilliant Location!,"We researched many hotels in Dublin and selected the Brooks for both its location and quality rating and were not disappointed. It is located centrally located to all major attractions in Dublin. By booking directly with the Brooks, we were able to get a deluxe king room on the upper floor complete with our personal selection of pillows. Our full breakfast include both the breakfast buffet and a prepared meal of our choice.",5,2017,06,14
236,Great stay in the heart of Dublin,"We were treated like VIPs as soon as we walked in the door, and this attention to friendly and engaging customer service continued throughout our stay. Our room was spacious and attractive, with very comfortable beds. The self-serve part of the breakfast buffet was very generous in scope and variety, with a highlight being the house-baked loaves of several varieties of bread. In addition to all this, one could also order the full Irish cooked breakfast, or any part thereof. 

The Brooks is in a perfect location to walk to all the major sights in downtown Dublin, and is surrounded by restaurants and pubs. We also enjoyed a dinner at the hotel’s own restaurant. We understand there is a fitness suite/spa but did not have time to explore this.",5,2017,06,13
236,Olde Worlde,"Definately a modern hotel with an olde worlde welcome.  All the amenities are available and the staff are incredibly accomodating, well mannered and friendly. Servce was only an 'ask' away. The location is just a short walk from many places of interest as well as some of the best shopping in Dublin (but perhaps 'best' also means expensive.). Many, many restaurants in the neighborhood to choose from and many pubs but our room had almost no noise from outside.",4,2017,06,13
236,Very nice - location not for us,We picked The Brooks over hotels with lots of tour buses and the facilities and service were excellent. It was just not the right place for us. In evenings (Friday and Saturday) streets were packed with drinkers in bars and it was a bit of a challenge walking home from dinner. The hotel is an oasis in a loud party. I certainly wouldn't stay here with small children - too many other options.,4,2017,06,11
236,Central location in the city of Dublin,"We stayed there just for three nights to attend the graduation ceremony. It was in the centre of the city which were all few minutes walk to all the attraction like Temple Bar , Dublin Castle and Trinity College Dublin. The room was big and clean. The staffs were very helpful . It took us €28 for taxi ride from airport to the hotel.A good choice for just few days stay in Dublin.",4,2017,06,11
236,"Great location, small room for the price","We stayed here for only 1 night in early May, arrived from the airport at 6:30am after overnight flight and were very pleasantly surprised the Brooks had our room ready for us at that hour!  Perfect, since we needed to crash and rest for a couple of hours before heading out to explore Dublin.  We had room 602, very small room but adequate for a 1-night stay, and room was well appointed and had nice view over Dublin skyline.  Hotel location is excellent, short walks to all major sights and close to many restaurants and pubs.  Dublin hotels are expensive, especially nice ones like the Brooks, but we did feel it was overpriced for the size of room we received,",4,2017,06,10
236,Excellent restaurant and service,"Booked Francescas restaurant in Brooks for a family meal to celebrate my PhD graduation.  In total there were about 25 people, ranging from small children up to 80-year-olds.  Met with the Duty Manager a couple of times beforehand, in addition to lots of emails, and he couldn't have been more helpful - reserving an area for us for pre-dinner drinks, menu and wine options specifically to suit us, etc.  The evening itself was excellent - great food, really good atmosphere, and the staff were excellent.  Thanks for everything.",5,2017,06,09
236,Super nice hotel with the best location,"This 4* hotel is located in a narrow street a few minutes' walk from great shopping and lots of nice restaurants, pubs and bars, We got a nice, clean and quiet room and were pleased to be able to park our car opposite the hotel. Friendly and attentive staff. Highly priced hotel but good value for money. Will be back!",5,2017,06,09
236,Went to see a concert in the Olympia,"Very nice hotel, expensive for one night, with no breakfast included,  excellent central location. Staff were very friendly, a €50 deposit for the mini bar even doh nothing in it?? You got it back put didn't see the point of this, ",5,2017,06,07
236,Friendly staff,Great three night stay--would definitely return.  Good location for walking to all neighborhoods and sites.  Room was very clean with comfortable bedding of high quality.  Breakfast was delicious with many cold and hot choices.  The staff was helpful and very friendly.  Loved the air conditioning that kept out the street noises.  ,5,2017,06,03
236,First class hotel in one of the best locations,"I was taken back by this hotel, when I booked a room for my wife and I it seemed that the staff though we were leprechauns.
Unfortunately I look like I ate a leprechaun. The room was pretty and well appointed but we didn't fit in it. I had to be in the corridor when my suit case was open. This wouldn't do. I approached the front desk to see if they could change my room so I could fit in it, but they said they where completely booked. I told them I'd be leaving in the morning to look for reasonable accommodations. Less than five minutes went by when the general manager called the room and apologized for the inconvenience and managed to move me into a larger room at no additional cost. I travel allot and this was old time hotel hospitality, something that seem to be missing. I had a wonderful stay, breakfast is great and the staff go out of there way to accommodate you. Well done.",5,2017,06,02
236,Wonderful experience,"Our first trip to Dublin and Brooks Hotel was a great place to stay.  Right in the middle of Dublin, Brooks offers a personal touch to the big city.  Great rooms and very friendly staff.  Breakfast is quite enjoyable.  Don't miss their porridge!  The rooms are quiet, spacious, and very clean.  The staff is knowledgeable of the local areas, shops, and tourist attractions as well as local attractions.",5,2017,05,30
236,Wonderful stay,"This is a first class hotel.  The rooms have everything you need, lots of storage, bathrobes, all amenities and AIR conditioned!  The service was excellent.  Easy check in and attentive concierge.  Delicious breakfast.  The only weird thing were the rates.  I added a night onto my original 2 night booking and it was $189 including breakfast.  The next two nights were $395 per night without breakfast. The range is too much - it was the same room. Felt a bit taken advantage of.  Call hotel directly to book.",4,2017,05,30
236,Extremely Perfect,"The place is tucked away just down the side street from Lemon's Cafe in Dublin.  The Staff is friendly and willing to do all they can to make your stay in there country awesome.   The Breakfast service is top notch, Cleaning staff excellent and welcoming almost like you where going to nana's  house for a visit.  The two night attendants at the hotel bar are awesome and have lot's to share about the area and interests that you might want to know whats around.  There is a theater down stairs.  Cool looking but really no one uses it.  They should of made it into a hot tub area with a sauna and steam room.   Our balcony room had a great view of the streets of Dublin.  It's close to everything and I will return to this hotel in the future.  We loved it.",5,2017,05,30
236,Well-situated for walking about Dublin,"The staff at this classic hotel did an outstanding job of greeting us and making us feel welcome.  They exceeded expectations with regard finding our way around town, locating eateries, Hop-on & Hop-off sites and so on.  We arrived early, so our bags were taken to a special lounge, then to our rooms while we were out for the afternoon.  The morning breakfast was outstanding!",4,2017,05,29
236,"Great hotel, staff, and location","Stayed for 5 nights -- booked an executive bedroom but was upgraded to a two room suite at check in which was a very nice gesture. We arrived mid- morning and our room wasn't ready but they have a great library and restrooms downstairs which was very relaxing and private. They had the room ready early for us. They take the time to understand that you might have just traveled a long way and are tired. The room was very clean and comfortable.
They have great in room amenities and this is a GREAT LOCATION-- quiet and central for walking or any local transportation. The staff is very helpful and polite without being intrusive. The food in the restaurant was great-- we had the breakfast included which I would highly recommend.
We had a great stay!!!",5,2017,05,29
236,Great hotel.,"Great hotel in fantastic location, close to shops and bars, whilst remaining calm and quiet.
The staff are attentive and friendly, and the breakfast is good.
For the price, I think this hotel offers slightly above average standard for the area.
Just a couple of issues with the room was it's size (very small) and the bathroom (I hate shower curtains - and not in a 4*.) However these issues were minor and did not affect our stay.
We used the car park opposite, which the hotel offers discounted parking for also.
Would recommend. ",4,2017,05,27
236,"Great hotel, perfect location","We were here three nights. We had two rooms for for people. Very comfortable rooms. Very nicely decorated. There was a pillow menu so special pillows could be sent to your room. I tried a V-shaped one for my neck and shoulders. It was great treat.
We went to the bar after an evening out. It was a nice end to the evening. Pleasant atmosphere.
Dinner  and breakfast buffet were very good too. Great service in dining room.
We especially liked the very relaxing, well appointed hotel guest lounge in the basement. 
I'd recommend this hotel to any one.",5,2017,05,25
236,Ok,"Good location, friendly helpful staff, excellent breakfast. Rooms adequate but a bit eclectic not necessarily by design.
The hotel competes well in that location and price range, would stay there again.",4,2017,05,24
236,Fantastic & Great Breakfast,"Stayed here for 3 days on a work trip to Dublin.

The staff were simply exceptional and could not have been more helpful. Whether it was giving you advice or looking after luggage when you checked out. I actually left some clothes in the room when l checked out and they phoned me to let me know - what incredible service 

The rooms were lovely and spacious but the best parts about the hotel is the breakfast and location. Close to everything as it's very central 

Would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin for a few days ",5,2017,05,24
236,"good hotel, very medium food and bad restaurant service","My room was very nice as well as staff at reception. The breakfast was medium with unfresh cooked pastries (probably the chef dont like to get up early but it is the price to pay to have the best crispy croissants and pastries).
For lunch it wasn't a buffet and the staff was always invisible : to take the order, to get the check and to pay, you have to run after them. 
Also i said to the waitress i wanted only the lemon tart if cooked today and after speaking with the kitchen , she yes it was cooked today. 
but i asked it, it's because i can recognize a tart cooked the day before : the crust isn't crispy and is soft because it absorbed the lemon cream all night. So obviously it's not so good and so tasty. And you are expecting the best when you are going in a luxery hotel.
Some body lied : the waitress or the cook when they can answer : we recommend the ice cream today.... as i can take another dessert
so a bad souvenir and a place where i will never come back",3,2017,05,23
236,Ideal location in Dublin,"We spent two nights at the Brooks Hotel at the end of a hiking trip around the island.  After 9 nights in a variety of B&B's it was wonderful to finish our trip here.  The staff was very attentive, the breakfast bountiful and the beds and pillows were luxurious.  Connor, the resident historian/storyteller/consierge was an added bonus and helped to make our stay memorable.  We were able to walk to most of the places on our ""must see"" list and found coming back to the hotel a prefect end to very full days of sightseeing.  If/when we are back in Dublin we would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,05,19
236,"Great Location, Pleasant Rooms, Delicious Breakfast","We stayed here recently prior to a driving trip of Ireland.   What a pleasure to be able to check into our room before noon time.  And, what a further pleasure to find that it was of ample size  - we had booked a deluxe - warm, cozy, sunny and thoughtfully equipped with robes, electric kettle and nice amenities.  Breakfast was bountiful with a choice of cold or hot cooked to order.  The hotel is very nicely located to Trinity and the Museum area.  There are several wonderful pubs nearby and we ate dinner at the nearby Hairy Lemon both nights we were in town.  The front desk gave us very good service.  Visit the guest lounge downstairs in the hotel.  It is a charming book filled space with comfortable reading chairs and couches.  Great price as well.  Do NOT hesitate to stay at the Brooks!",5,2017,05,16
236,Great location,"On my first trip to Ireland/Dublin the Brooks Hotel was perfect.  Close enough to many sites so that we could walk.  The hotel itself was very nice.  Well maintained.  Clean and comfortable.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast that came with the room was more than adequate and food was good.  The hotel has a very nice ""resident"" lounge on the lower level where we could relax prior to our room being ready since we had arrived around 9 am after an overnight flight.",5,2017,05,15
236,Loved this hotel!,"Wife and I stayed here for 2 days/nights.  The staff are very friendly and helpful & the location was great.

236,First time in Dublin ,"If you need a centralized location to visit most of the important attractions, then this is the best place for you. It's in lively section of city centre.  Also, make sure you visit Sasha House Petite. They have outstanding coffee, pastries and breakfast. ",4,2017,05,14
236,"Great hotel, great location","The Brooks location is outstanding, walk to everything.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was spacious and the window faced the alley in the rear, however it was not noisy.  It's a bit more expensive than many Dublin hotels, but given the service and location, I would stay there again.",5,2017,05,11
236,Great location,"This hotel is great. We were welcomed upon arrival by the witty concierge, Connor, who sat us down with a map and gave suggestions. It was a very nice personal touch. Each time we saw him over the next few days he always remembered our names. The location is perfect. It's a nice, clean, quiet neighborhood with good restaurants and pubs. Our room was a little small, but that can be expected in an older, urban hotel. The awesome staff and the excellent location far outweigh the size of the room. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,10
236,Great Stay at The Brooks Hotel,"If you are looking for a hotel in Dublin that is extremely central to the city, has an excellent restaurant and tremendous accommodations, look no further than the Brooks Hotel.

236,Great Hotel,"The hotel Staff made feel very comfortable, especially Aiden and Michelle were wonderful.

236,Great location and great service ,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin for 2 nights at the front end and 1 night on the back end of our family tour of Ireland.

We had 10 people in 5 rooms and no complaints. Would stay again.
",5,2017,05,04
236,Trip to Ireland ,"The Brooks Hotel was clean and efficient 
And in walking distance to all of downtown Dublin area ...remember a double room means in Ireland means 2 people not double beds make sure you state 2 beds if that is want you need ",5,2017,05,02
236,"Good location, good hotel but strange credit card policy","I stayed in the hotel for two nights. Two room nights were prepaid. Still staff insisted on charging €400 on my card for 'incidentals' which is very strange because there is no mini bar in the room. At checkout I requested it to be reversed but 4 days but 5 days on still not reversed.
Nice hotel but please check your card before you leave.",3,2017,05,02
236,"Great Location, Clean Rooms, Great Breakfast","We stayed here during the week of St. Patrick's Day. This hotel has a great location. You can walk to all the main attractions to Dublin in 10-15 minutes. T

The rooms are clean, and the bed was especially comfortable. I also loved having a bath tub in addition to a shower.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The free breakfast was expansive with many, many options!",5,2017,04,30
236,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for three nights in April. We booked it a good few months in advance and doing so, managed to get a good price. The hotel is lovely and we had a super large comfortable bed. There is a pillow menu but we didn't take advantage of it as the pillows supplied were great! The hotel is in a great location with everything to hand and Connor the concierge who is an asset to this hotel greeted us on arrival and gave us tips on where to go. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food, however, you get a lovely breakfast around the corner in ""Busy Feet"" (I feel another review coming on)! Hope to come back to Dublin soon and I would definitely stay here again, if the price was right :)",5,2017,04,30

I'd stay there again",5,2017,04,27

236,Recommend the Brooks Hotel,"We are at the Brooks Hotel now, as part of a 2-night research visit for my ""The Traveling Professor"" small group tours.  First of all, the Brooks is in a central location within walking distance to all.  We walked to Grafton Street, Guinness Storehouse, Teelings Distillery, Jameson Distillery, Trinity Church.  Great dining options nearby and the hotel has a very good restaurants.   Rooms are clean, quiet, and roomy.  They are pleasantly decorated and elegant.  There are plenty of places to relax in the spacious lobby of the hotel which has a wonderful bar.   The best part of the Brooks Hotel is the professional and courteous staff.  They are knowledgeable and helpful.  I visit a lot of hotels and the staff can make all the difference in the world and the staff at the Brooks Hotel made this an absolutely remarkable stay.  Thank you!",5,2017,04,18
236,"Lovely, tranquil hotel with delicious breakfast and dinner! Great location!","We arrived directly from the states very early from an overnight flight and were totally jet lagged.  We were warmly received by the front desk who provided us with breakfast recommendations in the neighborhood. In addition, we were given a key to the lounge in the hotel where were we able to relax and even take a short nap on the comfortable couches until our rooms were ready.  The staff was always friendly and welcoming.  The rooms are well appointed and a generous size for a boutique urban hotel.  The decor is peaceful and tasteful. Overall I found the hotel to be particularly calming after a day touring around Dublin.  The location is perfect walking distance to many museums and Trinity college and is in a great neighborhood.  The breakfast at the hotel is fantastic, our favorite throughout our journey through Ireland.  Our  kids loved the special hot chocolate offered to them every morning.  We ate dinner one night at Francesca's in the hotel and were very pleased by the prix fixe menu; our entrees included a gnocchi special, smoked trout fish cakes, Waldorf salad, all of which were delicious and thoughtfully prepared.  The waitstaff was excellent. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,17
236,Another Great Stay at my Favorite Hotel,"I travel to Dublin every year and the Brooks is my hotel. Located right in the Creative Quarter, the location is just about perfect for the visitor to Dublin. I have come to know the staff over the years and you will not find a more welcoming and professional group. Every time I walk in after a year or so, I am greeted immediately by name with a hearty welcome back. My home away from home.",5,2017,04,17
236,Lovely hotel and great location!,"I loved Dublin, but it felt a bit hectic to me after long drives through the Irish countryside.  The Brooks Hotel was an oasis of calm right in the heart of things.

We were greeted warmly, and all the staff we encountered were cheerful and professional and helpful.  Our room was large and quiet with a comfortable king bed and tastefully decorated (#307 on the backside of the hotel).  

We didn't end up eating at the hotel, opting instead to forage for scones and coffee in the mornings and accepting Marvin's restaurant recommendations.  We did enjoy sampling a few whiskeys in the bar on our last evening.  (We loved Fade St. Social just across from the hotel!)  The hotel is just a short walk from Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and Trinity College, numerous restaurants and cafes.

On our final morning there was a transit strike, and Marvin took extra care to ensure we had secured a cab to the airport.

All-in-all, the Brooks Hotel was the perfect choice for us.  We will definitely visit again.",5,2017,04,16
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin,"Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room, on the 6th floor, was clean but had obvious water issues. The carpet in front of the bathroom was stained as was the sill area around the window. Water problem in bathroom confirmed after using shower. The water leaked onto floor either at the far end of the tub, or the area nearest the faucet. Adjusting the shower did no good. 
Had some cocktails in the evening - bartenders were friendly and awesome! Breakfast food next morning was good, but I felt rushed by the waiter. 
Great location - close to many attractions.",3,2017,04,15
236,Reasonable. Useful. ,"Hotel clean and pleasant. Front desk seemed quite overwhelmed at times and not as service oriented as we are accustomed to. 

Neat but plain rooms. 

Good location with many easy walks. 

Ok for a short stay. ",3,2017,04,15
236,Perfect Dublin Stay,"We spent 7 days in Ireland and stayed at the Brooks Hotel our 1st night and last night.  We could not have not asked for anything more.  We arrived very early on Sunday around 6:30 am and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready and coffee was offered and served right away (which was really appreciated).  We were on the 2nd floor and our room was just perfect.  The staff was welcoming and very helpful.  Breakfast was included with our reservation and was a great start to the day.  The wait staff was wonderful and service was very quick.  The location was perfect and we walked all around Dublin.  The Harry Lemon next store was great place, we had dinner one night and drinks the other night.  We also loved Fade Social for dinner which was right across the street.  We truly couldn't have asked for a better start and finish to our Ireland Holiday!!",5,2017,04,12
236,In the center of everything,"What a pleasure. From the bellman to the housekeeping staff every aspect is delightful and inviting. Stayed for two nights on a weekend and loved every minute. Ideally located near literally everything you could want over a weekend and with walking distance. Room view as not great, but it was very quiet and room well appointed. I would stay again and recommend.",5,2017,04,11
236,Excellent stay,"My colleague and I spent five nights at the hotel while participating in a conference. We had a lovely stay. The hotel staff was very helpful and always positive. The location is simply excellent, with walking distance to literally everything we wanted to see. I highly recommend it!",5,2017,04,10
236,A lovely hotel in the heart of the city ,"Brooks is a delight. A cool and quiet boutique hotel. Modern, spacious and comfortable rooms. Lovely service and it's location 5 mins from Grafton Street and the Powerscourt Mall is perfect for a weekend in Dublin. ",4,2017,04,09
236,Amazing location with equally top service,"You cannot beat this location - close to Temple Bar & Grafton Street & right in its own little thick of it.  The service here was excellent.  Everyone was willing to spend time with us, answer our questions, address our needs...  This place was a no-brainer for me. The rooms were small but had character and were fully functional - that, paired with the service and the location... I know my friends and I will be back!  I'd recommend this hotel heartily to anyone.  (Note:  We didn't do the breakfast add-on - the breakfast looked awesome, but we wanted to get out and about.  What I appreciated is that the team at the front desk had recommendations of great places near by.)

Oh, and go to the Hairy Lemon when you're there.  Awesome.",5,2017,04,07
236,Good hotel if a bit expensive!,"I had a lovely spacious room with super king size bed. Lovely toiletries - the white company. Tea & coffee available in room, a biscuit would have made it ... the room was €230 euros! I'm told this is normal for Dublin! 
Unfortunately I didn't have time for breakfast but it did look good ....",3,2017,04,06
236,Excellent Choice!,"We spent the last 3 nights of our Ireland vacation at Brooks Hotel.  We planned to finish off our trip with an extra nice hotel, and we were not disappointed.  Our room was not huge, but it had all the amenities we needed, a very comfy bed and a large modern bathroom with lots of mirrors and shelves.  
The location was excellent and definitely in a busy area.  We were worried it might be noisy, but we found it fairly quiet (except for the midnight garbage trucks) and that didn't last long.
We did not require the services of the concierge and needed little from the front desk staff.  They were friendly though.  

We had a drink in the lounge each evening.  It was nice to have a quiet, safe place to finish off the day.  Drinks were expensive and the bartenders did not seem to be the most experienced.  But we were there Mon to Wed nights.  Our bartender apologized that she didn't know how to pour a gin and tonic. What???
Of course we enjoyed the Hairy Lemon next door and it's a great location if you intend to see a show at the Gaiety Theatre.  Highly recommend booking a show.
Would definitely recommend this classy hotel!",5,2017,04,05
236,Couples weekend,"My husband scheduled a birthday weekend in Dublin and found the Brooks Hotel. It's location is ideal. It's an easy walk from the College Green stop of the Airlink bus. It's also within walking distance to many Dublin highlights (Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Temple Bar district, Ha'Penny Bridge).

The staff is phenomenal! We were instantly greeted and welcomed into the hotel. They were very accommodating. For example, when our electric plug converted wouldn't work, the front desk staff quickly offered ones that they have on hand. Everyone we encountered offered us help, provided directions, and made us feel like special, honored guests.

We only had breakfast in the hotel one morning on our trip, but that was not due to the quality of the breakfast. It was very delicious, and again, the staff was so attentive and welcoming. The food was delicious and there was a large variety of choices.

My only complaint (and it is definitely NOT a big complaint) is the hairdryer in the bathroom. It needs to be updated. Apart from that, we had a phenomenal stay and wouldn't hesitate to go back.",5,2017,04,04
236,Very friendly and helpful,"Great location for touring Dublin on foot or by hop-on, hop-off bus. Comfortable rooms (best water pressure in a hotel ever), but the standout was the helpfulness of the staff in arranging cabs, having take-away breakfast ready if you have an early tour, or recommending a whiskey (from among dozens) at the lounge. Vet happy our agent recommended this place.",5,2017,04,03
236,Superb customer service,"The front desk staff are excellent,friendly,efficient and polished.

The beds are the best I have slept in at a hotel and I travel a lot.

Wonderful shower

Brilliant central location where you are within walking distance of historic Dublin,great shopping and fantastic restaurants.

At the Brooks Hotel you will meet a wonderful gentleman called Marvin who is the concierge.
He is very informative,professional and friendly.I would advise you to make contact when you arrive as he will help you with planning your tours etc

Next time I am in Dublin I will certainly stay here again as the staff are brilliant,the beds are very comfortable and the rooms quiet.

Thank you to Brooks Hotel
Especially thanks to the very nice Spanish chap on reception who helped us a lot with all our queries,a lovely girl with dark hair who has endless patience then Marvin who is a gem.
",5,2017,04,01
236,Place to stay in Dublin,"Small comfortable, well appointed room on a quiet street in an otherwise noisy city,. Close to everything with very attentive staff. My wife was sick when we arrived after a long flight and Conner the doorman personally walked us around the corner to the pharmacy to get her assistance. We loved their breakfast and would welcome a repeat stay if again in Dublin.",5,2017,03,31
236,All was well except...😕,"The hotel team were all friendly and helpful.  The location is tops! 

We had a quick lunch while waiting for our room to be ready.  The clam chowder was very good.

The double room was roomy. The used amenities were renewed everyday. The next day we used the tub.  When  noticed that evening that the tub was only 'wiped' around but the 'soap residue' on the bottom of the tub was still there.  😤.  So obviously it was quicker to wipe around to make it look 'as if' it was cleaned.  So i called for the Housekeeping Supervisor.  She confirmed it! After the tub was clean and shiny. And EVERYDAY after ALSO SMELLED the cleaning agent used.  Now bravo! 

The restaurant for breakfast was good. no omelets though 😣.  

Dinner was very good there too. The steak, chicken and duck were...yummy. we ate 2 times here.  Thank you...Frank!
",4,2017,03,29
236,"great location, super accommodating and friendly staff!","the thing that set this hotel apart from the rest for us was the customer service. it's in a great location, the rooms have everything necessary, but when we asked for a quieter room, the staff was incredibly accommodating and made sure the rest of our stay was enjoyable. we will definitely be using this hotel again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2017,03,28
236,First stop in Ireland trip,"Great boutique hotel. Staff is fantastic, so kind and helpful. Comfy rooms.  Location off main street but close to walking to all sites and to pick up the hop on hop off bus. The bar is nice and has really yummy food. Next door to this hotel is the Hairy lemon, another great bar. ",4,2017,03,28
236,Great last night in Ireland,"We picked the Brooks hotel for my birthday and our last night in Ireland. It was walkable to most things, and the bed and room were comfortable. We had a delicious breakfast included in our B&B rate. There was a pillow menu and you could ask for a foot bath to be brought to the room. We drove in and were able to park across the street - got a bit of a discount from their regular rates. I wish we had been able to stay longer.",5,2017,03,26
236,Very Nice Hotel,"The hotel is very centrally located to most of the attractions in Dublin.  It is a very nice hotel with friendly staff.  The room was nice and was clean.  The breakfast was tasty and cooked appropriately.  While we liked the hotel and would recommend it...there are a few downsides.  The bed was a bit hard for our tastes.  The TV kept coming up with a black screen.  The staff showed up immediately upon notification and took care of the problem.  We then had issues with the thermostat.  It was cold in the room.  This time, the night manager showed up quickly.  He messed with it but, quite honestly, I don't think he did anything.  It was late..there was no chance of getting any repairs done anyway.  Ultimately, the heater came on later that night?  I think?  The temp in the room stopped dropping sooooo....They did offer a portable heater if we needed it.  We ended up doing without.  Finally, the hotel is downtown so you do get a lot of outside traffic and pedestrian noise.  Not uncommon for any hotel the center of a large city.",4,2017,03,25
236,"Great location, lovely hotel","Very central location where you can easily walk almost anywhere from the Temple Bar area to shopping, museums, etc.  There are also lots of cafes, pubs and restaurants around.  It's a quiet street so you can also shut everything out when you want some quiet.  The staff is great, friendly and very helpful with everything.  The room was a nice size, comfy bed, very clean.  At night, they have a piano player and the bar area is comfortable with a fireplace.  Late night, we enjoyed coming back and having a nightcap with Erminio, a very kind man from Portgual and the rest of the night staff.  We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food but I would quite happily stay there again.",4,2017,03,25
236,Excellent hotel ,"My husband and I visited this hotel for St Patrick's weekend. The hotel is beautiful, location is excellent and the staff are so lovely and welcoming! Breakfast was excellent and actually quite nice being able to order your hot breakfast rather than a buffet style hot breakfast! We wouldn't hesitate in staying here again! Thank you for your lovely hospitality:)",5,2017,03,23
236,Excellent Hotel,"We arrived at the Hotel to be greeted by the friendliest staff and a bowl of green marshmallows to celebrate St Patricks, which were amazing by the way! ( i had a fair few). Our room was on the 3rd floor and was immaculate and very homely. The beds were so comfortable, just what we needed after a long day celebrating in the City. Breakfast, cant fault it, in fact i would say one of the best I've had, open until 11am, which is always a good thing. Fantastic waiting staff, always a smile. And of course, i cant not mention Conor, the concierge, what an absolute gentleman, he gave us very good advice on where to go to watch the Rugby! An asset to an already great Hotel, we wouldn't hesitate in coming back.
We were celebrating my friends birthday, and on booking i had mentioned this, when we returned to our room, there was a birthday cupcake for her. Very nice touch.
Excellent location, 10 mins from Temple Bar, just around the corner is Grafton Street and St Stephens Green.
All in all, a wonderful weekend.",5,2017,03,21
236,Wonderful Location,"The Brooks Hotel is a 4 star hotel located right in the city centre. You are also located across a large car park across the road so very handy if you have a car rental. The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly. The room was very cosy, comfy bed, nicely furnished. The included breakfast is a little basic but you can always order extras. Lovely hotel in the city centre!",4,2017,03,21
236,2nd visit,"fantastic hotel excellent location very bohemium area.
room lovely booked an upgrade
food breakfast lovely
staff lovely [ remember the staff last time I was there shows it must be nice place to work as staff staying]
will go back
no views from room if thats what you want",5,2017,03,20
236,Fabulous hotel. Excellent location ,"We stayed here for one night over st. Patrick's weekend.  We were greeted by Melissa who couldn't have been more friendly and professional.  
The reception area is beautiful and our room didn't disappoint either. Very spacious room- which even had a dressing room!
Fabulous smells of flowers and scented ornaments  waft throughout the hotel which I thought was a lovely touch.
We ate in the bar on Saturday and the service and food was brilliant and girly priced for a city centre location.  
We'll certainly stay again ",5,2017,03,19
236,feels like home - a quiet gem in the heart of the city,"My second time to Brooks and I will make it my regular stay when i'm in Dublin. The staff are extremely attentive and efficient, but with an affectionate, friendly informality that is so much a part of Irish culture. It shines through at Brooks. Given this is St Patrick's weekend and one with the 6 Nations rugby involved too, the peace, relaxation and calm elegance that you experience here, just around the corner from Grafton Street, is a real treat. I had a room on the 6th floor - a classic room - perfect size, good storage space, lovely bath, everything I could want in the room. Cleaned spotlessly and promptly. 
Nothing is too much trouble - and the nicest thing of all about the hotel - you are welcomed like an old friend from the minute you arrive, with staff remembering the details of every conversation with you. 
Can't wait to come back again.",5,2017,03,19
236,"Fantastic Hotel, Great location","We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year, April & November 2016. The service is top of the line.  Clean and in a quiet area. Perfect location with an easy short walking distance to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, St. Patrick's etc.  Excellent buffet breakfast, worth every penny.  I will continue to only stay at the Brook's Hotel when I visit Dublin.",5,2017,03,15
236,Nice hotel between Temple Bar and St. Stephen's Green,"A very nice, upscale hotel with excellent service and location.  The staff members are all
very friendly.   It can be very pricy in the spring and summer. The doorman, Conor, is a hoot! He can provide very advice.",4,2017,03,13
236,Excellent hotel in excellent location,"Spent 5 nights in Dublin and the Brooks make our stay wonderful!  The location is perfect, as it is walking distance from most of central Dublin's attractions.  Lots of food options available in the neighborhood.  

The service was very friendly.  Probably some of the nicest hotel staff I have met.  The room was nice, very clean. Bed was quite comfortable. Bathroom is small, but we didn't mind that much.   They do turn-down service every night, which is a nice bonus.  

We had the traditional Irish breakfast every morning, which they made vegan for us be offering plant based breakfast sausage instead of meat.  They also have a various fresh baked breads with spreads.  

When we took a day trip that required us to leave very early in the morning, the hotel provided our breakfast to go.  

Highly recommend.  Would stay here again.",5,2017,03,13
236,Another Wonderful Stay,"My wife and stayed in Brooks hotel for one night to celebrate her 40th birthday, this was our 5th visit. 

Again the hotel and staff where wonderful, so helpful and could not be faulted - especially Michelle on reception who helped me with organising the birthday balloons. 

I could not recommend this hotel highly enough - its wonderful!!",5,2017,03,13
236,Visiting nearby National archives,"We had a wonderful stay. The staff were courteous  and attentive. We ate in the restaurant and the food in the restaurant was amazing. A lovely freshly cooked breakfast with lots of cereals and breakfast juices to choose from, lots of lovely freshly baked breads. Its position is  close to Grafton street. The hotel was perfect and we will definitely be back.",5,2017,03,11
236,Perfect!,"Good value! Location top ! Personnel TOP! Great Breakfast when included in price of room, continental breakfast and hot food menu included in rate. The staff very present for tea/coffee refills ( coffee was good), extra toast etc.  Homemade crepes with nutella for the kids! Try the full Irish breakfast and skip lunch!!!(only negative point maybe, no baked beans in Irish breakfast!!!!!!Shocking LOL)
Have been twice and will definetly be back!",5,2017,03,07
236,Perfect spot for a short stay in Dublin,"Stayed here for a two night weekend mini break with a girlfriend. The hotel is clean and smart and in the perfect location for exploring Dublin on foot. The beds were v comfortable and the pillow menu was a nice touch! I'm a light sleeper but found the hotel v quiet considering it being quite in the thick of bars and restaurants. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel as there was a Starbucks right next door! Best thing about the hotel is the friendly, helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a warm smile. Would definitely stay here again",5,2017,03,06
236,Comfortable Stay,"A good hotel on the whole. Very friendly and efficient staff.
Quite expensive room rate not to have breakfast included.
The bathroom was quite dated but clean. Bed was very comfortable with a choice of pillows.
Excellent location for pubs and restaurants. Can get a little street noise but normal for a busy city hotel. On the whole a decent comfortable stay. I would use again. But will try others out at the same rate for comparison.",4,2017,03,05
236,"Superb Hotel, friendly staff and great suite","The Hotel is in an odd location, opposite a car park, but don't let that put you off.  Once inside there is an air of style and smartness that isn't oppressive but enhances the experience.  We went through Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) and we were given an upgrade to a Balcony Suite (Room 511).  Sadly the Balcony overlooked the aircon units and a college so not exactly inviting but the room was superb.  Big space, dressing room and a faux open fire.

Breakfast was good, with lots of choice and cooked if you wanted, the bar was friendly and the staff made it a nice experience all round.  Fully recommend the whisky!  

All in all a good experience for the Elbow gig at the Olympia and watching the rugby!",5,2017,03,02
236,Great location,"Stayed for one night - great location walking distance from most central attractions. 

All the staff I met were friendly and welcoming.

Rooms are spotless and comfy.

Only disappointment was breakfast - @ 20 euro I would expect more than over cooked rubber scrambled egg and luke warm bacon.",4,2017,02,28
236,Staff very friendly!,"I stayed 4 days with my uncle for the rugby match in Brooks hotel. 
The location of the hotel is great: very close to temple bar and all the interesting points to see in dublin but in a quiet street so perfect for a good rest. The hotel is nice and clean, rooms are cosy and beds VERY confortable. 
But what i will remember from my stay in Brooks is the staff: they all were very nice and welcoming with us, always trying to make our stay better. 
And i have a special thanks for Michelle at the reception: she was so kind and nice with us all over our stay, giving us all the tips we had to know about dublin, helping me to manage our visits in town (my uncle is 88 and i had to organise), she made my uncle a lovely cake for his 88th birthday. I already loved Irland, but Michelle rise my love for Irland and Irish people! Thank you!",5,2017,02,28
236,Grab a bigger room if it's a long stay,Good location for walking Dublin or taking the big red bus around town. Close to a multitude of bars and restaurants as well as major shopping streets. Service from bar staff was a bit lax this time around and not much interaction from any staff apart from Colinwho helped us find the perfect room . We stayed for 5 nights and no one apart from Colin addressed us by name or acknowledged our stay by even asking how we were enjoying our time. If you don't mind some small niggles I would still recommend .,4,2017,02,26
236,Top Hotel,"Yet again we have stayed at the fabulous Brooks Hotel in Dublin. The hotel is very comfortable with lovely rooms and a real intimate feel. So close to everything the city has to offer but nicely quiet for a city centre hotel.

The full Irish breakfast is not to be missed and is the best I have had. The breakfast selection in amazing.

The staff are great and can't do enough for their guests.

Has a lovely family feel to it. Well worth the money
",5,2017,02,26
236,Could not fault,"Husband,  son and I stayed two nights, we had two rooms.  Both  were spacious ,clean and modern. Staff were very helpful and went the extra mile. Breakfast was excellent.   Would certainly recommend this hotel plus perfect location.",5,2017,02,25
236,Most helpful staff in Dublin!,"If you want to meet the nicest people in Dublin, visit the Brooks Hotel!  They pointed us in the direction of the best restaurants that we ate at on our 10 day tour of Ireland and helped us get from tourist stop to tourist stop as well.  And don't forget to say ""hello"" to Conor the concierge who will make you feel like the most important person in all of Ireland!",5,2017,02,23
236,I will never book here again,"I'm travelling quite a lot to Ireland and stay in Dublin perhaps twice a month. I generally book thru Booking.com and did so this time as well. This time I had booked this hotel for the 2nd time since the location is good and somewhat nice rooms. I planned to stay Wednesday -Thursday and arrived Tuesday to Ireland.

 As soon as I touched ground at dublin airport I got message from my brother that our Father had passed away that morning. Luckily SAS let my fly back on the same plane to Sweden. 

Once back on the ground in Sweden I had to take credit of bookings and other things.. no problem anywhere to cancel without charge not even the hotel for Tuesday night but Brooks Hotel couldn't change their policy since I need to cancel 2 days before arriving... 

I can pay no problem but I think it is disrespectful and very bad approach to customer care.
Therefore I will never set foot at Brooks Hotel again. They will get payment but not my business anymore.",1,2017,02,22
236,Highly Recommend,"Had a two night stay at Brooks recently and really enjoyed it. The location is absolutely perfect- it's nestled right in the thick of things, beside all central restaurants, nightlife, sights etc. We stayed in a double room and, while it was quite compact, the bed was very large and comfortable, shower pressure was great, there was a safe in the room, the television had a good variety of channels etc. Breakfast was delicious both mornings and served by a really lovely girl, I think she may have been Spanish, she was defintely the standout staff member - extremely friendly and helpful and very efficient. We had an evening meal included which was also delicious. Each evening a staff member knocked on our door to check everything was okay and offer us a chocolate which was a really lovely touch. Overall we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Will most definitely return.",4,2017,02,21
236,Best hotel I've ever stayed at!,"My friend and I had the best time in Dublin. We went there as a first girls holiday, and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly- especially Melissa, Aidan, Ashley, Connor and Arnold. Melissa told us all the best bars and clubs to go to, Aidan made us some very strong but nice drinks, Arnold and Ashley put up with me and my friend when we came in at 3am and Connor was very lovely looking after us. Overall they made us feel at home!  

The breakfast was delicious with lots of options, and the room was perfect. Very comfortable beds and lots of space in the bathroom for all our makeup and to get ready in. I really couldn't recommend this hotel enough! 
",5,2017,02,21
236,Good location but rooms are so so,"The location is probably this hotel's best feature. It's right in the middle of where you want to be...near restaurants, shops (Grafton street) and walking distance to Trinity College, Dublin castle among the few. Guinness Storehouse the the Jail were still a bit far and we took a taxi from the hotel which costed about 10 euro. Not too bad. The airport bus stop is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel...with your luggage...may take about 10 only because the streets are narrow in that area of town.

Rooms wise, a decent size but definitely a little on the older side. I was particularly annoyed with the bathroom door which closed automatically and had to be opened up with an old wooden doorstop every time we wanted to keep the bathroom opened because of the steam in there. By the way, there were no air vents which didn't help. In general, the rooms are old and a bit too dark (lights were too dim)...we couldn't read sitting in bed because it was so dark.

Service was average. Concierge was helpful but the front desk people were not very enthusiastic.

Overall, an average hotel but a good location. Perhaps it might be good enough in Dublin but by big city standards, definitely a 3 star.

",3,2017,02,18
236,Right in the heart of Dublin ,"Fantastic hotel right in the heart of Dublin within walking distance of all you need to see and do Temple bar , Grafton St & St Stephens green 5 min walk ,great room queen size bed which was very comfortable and extra pillows if wanted from the pillow menu ,lovely bright bathroom & spotlessly clean 
Breakfast was very nice so much to choose from , fruit , cereals, toast , pastrys to a full cooked Irish , bar area nice and relaxing we will definitely be coming back and recommending to all our friends and family ",5,2017,02,14
236,Service with a genuine smile,"We were a party of 9 making afar too brief trip over to Ireland for family matters. We were due to get in around 7:00pm and enjoy a few drinks in the bar before dinner in the hotel restaurant. AerLingus and their customary disregard for punctuality put a stop to that with a two hour delay from London. Couple that with the renown traffic chaos of the city centre meant we arrived nearly three hours late tired, stressed and hungry. Our arrival was greeted with the most genuine of welcomes and we were told they had kept the kitchen open and our table booked for supper. After a quick drink in the bar we were seated together and despite some quirky orders from us, everyone was served their food, piping hot, freshly cooked and topped up with more drinks. Despite well past the restaurants closing, we weren't hassled to leave, in fact actively encouraged to relax with a constant drinks service at the table. Nothing was too much trouble here. The front desk were superb, the bar and restaurant staff equally so and breakfast in the morning was splendid. Our stay was barely 12 hours, but in that time, they made everyone feel very much at home. We'll be back when next in Dublin.",5,2017,02,13
236,Nice rooms and very comfortable bed ,"The hotel is a great location just off Grafton Street with many good restaurants and bars in the area. Stayed for 1 night over a weekend and enjoyed a good nights sleep as the beds are comfortable, the bathroom was clean and a shower had good water pressure. The breakfast is not bad but the service a little slow. ",4,2017,02,08
236,Took a chance...,"Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. However, the hallway of the first floor smelled funky. The room was average size, as well as the bathroom. Room 114 faces a busy road and the windows are NOT sound proof - not even a bit. The bed was firm, but comfy. Bar was perfect. And, the pub at the corner with yellow awning (Hairy Lemon ?) great food & kind service staff. ",4,2017,02,04
236,Good but pricier than it deserves,"The good stuff.....good location, great cleanliness, wonderfully friendly staff, good size room, comfortable bed and pillows. 

The nit so good stuff......they are undergoing refurbishment and it is annoying to read signs saying so (close, get it done and then open again).....so things will improve but decor tired, carpets in rooms worn and faded, grouting discoloured, I hate shower curtains (they don't let you shower properly and constantly 'blow' in when you're showering), some tiles cracked. 

So.....would I stay again......probably but would expect a refurbished room and modernised communal areas. ",4,2017,02,04
236,Excellent hotel in great location,"Stayed at the hotel for a weekend as we wanted something comfortable and close to all attractions. Beds were very good, with good pillows. Breakfast was great with good selection of food. Staff very friendly and helpful with good tips for the city. In the evening the hotel bar had a pianist which made the atmosphere very relaxing and enjoyable. I would stay there again.",5,2017,02,04
236,Terrific Hotel...Terrific Staff,"The Brooks hotel is a outstanding Hotel. The room was comfortable and extremely clean. The breakfast was cooked to order and wonderful! All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location. The Airport lost our bags and sent them to the Hotel after we left. The hotel staff was quick to forward them to our new location. In doing this, they also had found a jacket we forgot in our room and sent that to us also. THEY WERE AWESOME!!!",5,2017,02,02
236,"Friendly, stylish, comfortable, well-located","I slept well.  Nice classic yet updated style. Breakfast was terrific - an important consideration for a vegetarian in Dublin. Bathrobes were provided - always a plus in my book. They had a pillow menu!  I wish there was a bathroom outlet for the hair dryer and not just shavers. Hair dryer was in a bedroom drawer. I would like more outlets, but we managed. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. In fact, since I had to leave before breakfast service started, they bagged up some take-away breakfast items. Much appreciated. We could walk to interesting places. I will consider for future visits. ",5,2017,01,29
236,Brooks,"This is a very good hotel centrally located.Staff are very friendly and helpful.The bedroom we had was small but very comfortable,can not remember when I had better hotels night sleep,and the bathroom was first class except for the chipped enamel in the bath,which was not a huge problem but unexpected in a hotel such as this.The breakfast was tasty but there was nobody up at 5am baking the scones on offer and I have had better breakfasts at lesser rated hotels. Overall we had a pleasant experience and they have a number of nice touches to enhance ones stay .",4,2017,01,27
236,Outstanding hotel,"Our first stay at Brooks hotel and from the time we were greeted by the very excellent concierge Conor to the time we left we  found this to be an outstanding Hotel. The room was comfortable, bright and extremely clean.  The breakfast was first class and cooked to order (why cannot other hotels do the same instead than the precooked stuff they dish up).All staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is ideally situated for shopping being very central.  We will certainly return.",5,2017,01,23
236,"Warm Welcome, Comfy Stay","The staff could not have been nicer at this hotel, and the room was spacious and very comfortable. The location is perfect... in a neighborhood full of restaurants, bars and shops but a bit quieter than Temple Bar (still only a 5 minute walk from there though!). I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I would skip the hotel breakfast though. It's not very special and there are so many places to eat nearby (including a Starbucks next door if you just want a quick coffee or tea and a muffin!).",5,2017,01,17
236,Fabulous hotel close to all attractions,"Visited for one night only  but wish we could have stayed longer excellent service  rooms are clean and spacious breakfast was great , would definitely return and recommend 
We used the hop on hop off busses to get to local attractions but central enough to walk to most ",5,2017,01,16
236,Wonderful stay,"Our stay was perfect. We arrived at around 2pm and were greeted by a very friendly receptionist who checked us in. When we got up to our room we were blown away by the effort that has gone in to making the bedroom cosy and stylish. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant and the food was nothing short of excellent. The friendly staff made it even more enjoyable. After a very early flight and long day, we decided to go back to the room and watch a film. We noticed a DVD player in the room so asked at reception if the hotel had any DVD's. The manager came over and told us he had a large selection and would call up to our room to tell us what they had to offer. When we decided, he brought it up to our room personally which was a nice touch. After a comfortable nights sleep, we came down to breakfast to see a huge selection of delicious hot and cold food. We then went back to our room to pack our bags and check out. Before leaving we asked the very friendly concierge, Connor, if he had any recommendations of what to do with our remaining time in Dublin. He went to great lengths to tell us the best things to do and couldn't have been more informative and friendly. We were so sad to leave and had a wonderful stay.",5,2017,01,15
236,Lovely staff and perfect location,"Brooks Hotel is centrally located near shopping, important sights, and the Temple Bar district.  The staff was fantastic at the front desk and in the restaurant and bar.  I especially would like to acknowledge the concierge and bellman, Marvin, for his friendliness and helpfulness.  Our room was tiny and a bit awkward.  I would definitely stay at the Brooks again and upgrade to a larger room.  We also had a bit of a problem warming up the room.  The bed was great as was the shower.  The breakfast was perfect in a lovely setting.",4,2017,01,14
236,Just Perfect,"Despite arriving at 1100, our room was ready.  Michelle very helpful in earlier email correspondence.  Flowers as described were in the room (309).  Bed was extremely comfortable and having radio on for our arrival added that little extra.  Chocolate dessert brought to room approx. 1800 with letter from Manager congratulating us on our anniversary (again, nice touch).  Extremely great location for the bars and numerous restaurants within a few minutes walk.  All told, a first class stay in a first class restaurant.",5,2017,01,13
236,Great location ,"This is a boutique Hotel in a great location, just 5 mins walk from Grafton street. Rooms are smallish but beds are very comfortable look out for the pillow menu ! Breakfast was very good and cooked to order (so much better than a buffet) with an excellent choice and quality. Parking is a short walk away and reasonably priced for city centre location(€12.50 per night). We will definitely be back, recommended. ",4,2017,01,08
236,Perfect Early Morning Arrival,"After an overnight flight, we were able to check in early to the Brooks Hotel. The Front Desk staff was exceedingly helpful and the room was perfect.  Comfortable bed and all the necessary amenities.  It will definitely be my hotel every time we return to Dublin.  Centrally located close to shopping and the Temple Bar area.",5,2017,01,07
236,Great stay - warm welcome from Niamh,"Arrived early and stowed our bags away with ease. Niamh at the reception who checked us in was just a pure delight- friendly and genuinely interested in how we spent our day, she was looking for tourism spots herself to try on her days off so that she could recommend. She'd remembered our names from early on in the morning- a small thing which makes a big impression.

Another thing which made a big impression was our room. It was huge with a dressing room and a sofa. The bed was so comfy as was the bath. I've never been one to have a bath in hotels but this one was spotless. Our bags were brought up for us already and the radio was playing christmas fm, it set a lovely mood. We were quite gutted to go out and leave the room but had to go and have a beverage or few...  ",5,2017,01,07
236,Great hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for one night after Christmas. We found the hotel to be clean and welcoming. The receptionist was very friendly. We are in the bar. As it was after 5pm it was pub food . I had fish and chips and my husband had burger and chips. The food was delicious and again friendly service. Also this food was cheaper here than in The Hairy Lemon pub next door. The bar has a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable seating. The hotel is very central and within walking distance to all Dublins shopping. St Stephens green shopping centre is literally around the corner. During the evening they offer a turn down service for your bed. Wh n we arrived back from shopping we found the bed turned down with a little chocolate placed on each pillow. They also have a pillow ""menu"" where you can choose different pillows according to preference. The breakfast was delicious. Large choice of fruits and cereals and yogurt as well as porridge and Bircher. This is followed by a cooked breakfast. I had poached eggs which were perfect. I would definitely recommend this Hotel.",5,2017,01,04
236,Smart hotel in great location,"We stayed in Brooks last year and were looking forward to returning.
The rooms are good, very clean. All of the staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel is in the city centre and all areas are within easy walking distance.
The slight issue was the breakfast service on the first morning. The dining room was full and the staff struggled to take orders. We had a long wait. The food was very good when it did arrive. Ensure you attract someone's attention or you may wait a while.

We look forward to returningredients.",5,2017,01,04
236,Really Poor Service,"I dropped in here over the Christmas break for an evening meal and left feeling very disappointed.  This is a well located, city centre hotel and was full of a mixture of Irish and foreign guests so it appeals to all, across the board.  There was a piano player in the lobby and the food which we were served was excellent.  The issue was the waitress - she was so rude and oozing attitude that it ruined the experience.  She should take up some other job as she was useless as a worker in the hospitality business.  It will be a long time before I darken the door of this hotel again.",2,2017,01,04
236,Great combination of location and comfort,"Location was ideal for walking to all major attractions we wanted to visit.  Rooms were comfortable, and surprisingly quite given the central location of the hotel.  Breakfast was outstanding each day, and the staff was very friendly.  The common area on the lower level provided a convenient and comfortable place for our family to gather.  I'd stay here again!",5,2017,01,02
236,2 breaks,"In the last 10 months we have stayed on two occasions in Brooks.  It is a great hotel in Central Dublin.

The staff are very friendly and helpful throughout the hotel.  For some years we have been going to another hotel in the area, however we feel more at home in Brooks.

The bedrooms are brighter in Brooks, it seems to be a trend now in hotels to have poorly lit bedrooms.  The beds are very comfortable and one has a choice of pillows.

Breakfast in most hotels is an over priced item, in Brooks this is not the case, with a mix of self service and waiter / waitress service.

Thank you to the staff.",4,2017,01,02
236,Lovely short stay,"We only stayed for one night but this is a little haven right in the centre of Dublin. The location is second to none, surrounded by some of the best bars and restaurants the city has to offer. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The rooms, while small, are exactly what you'd expect from a city centre hotel. They're nicely decorated and the bed is extremely comfortable. 
Would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a nice place to stay (as opposed to budget!) while visiting Dublin.",5,2017,01,02
236,Made New Year very special,"Lovely welcoming hotel. In the heart of Dublin, but maintains a cozy friendliness. All the Staff were helpful and smiling, faultless check in/out. Great breakfast with a varied choice, all cooked to order. Our room was a deluxe double and met all our needs. We asked for the Aircon to be switched on at reception and was done immediately without fuss. The location is perfect and close to all shops and bars, perfect for any event. It was nice to see a concierge who was a delight, helping out with any requests and a good bit of advice on things to see and do. 
We will return again soon
A fantastice choice of World Whiskey/Whisky available and the staff can advise if needed. ",5,2017,01,02
236,Great small luxury hotel in city centre,"Charming hotel in Dublin City centre, spent two days there before Christmas and had a good experience there. Lovely rooms, great breakfast and nice friendly and helpful staff. Ideally situated for shopping and exploring the city, nice bar and restaurant.",5,2016,12,31
236,Great Staff iin a Great location,everything was perfect from the warm welcome to the well appointed room with a big comfortable bed. nice small bar with a great selection of whiskey and breakfast was fabulous and cooked to order. the staff are second to none and they do everything with a smile and nothing is too much for them. the hotel is centrally locate close to shops and tourist attractions so is perfect for all needs,5,2016,12,30
236,Fantastic hotel with attention to detail ,We stayed at Brooks on a two night city break.  Excellent room with sumptuous beds. Top notch breakfast. Very friendly staff. Very good location for major attractions. Would definitely recommend a stay at Brooks.                 ,5,2016,12,30
236,Great Location,We stayed 2 nights at the Brooks Hotel and it's a lovely boutique hotel with a warm and inviting  bar/lounge area. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas which made it feel even more inviting. The rooms are small but cozy with low lighting. The breakfast in the morning is well worth it. It's a perfect location without being in the middle of all the chaos of the city center. Only a 5 minute walk to Grafton street. Great value for the location. Staff are wonderful.,5,2016,12,30
236,"Lovely hotel, great location","Stayed here for 2 nights and will definitely be back. Very comfortable hotel, lovely bar, beautifully decorated for Christmas. Rooms are nicely done, with all you need. Very little outside noise for a city centre hotel. Great central location for everything. ",4,2016,12,29
236,Christmas in Dublin,I stayed here on 23rd December with my mother and 13 year old son. We had a fantastic stay and the staff couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming.  Would highly recommend this hotel.  The location is perfect!,5,2016,12,28
236,An excellent manager ,"This is my first review on trip advisor. 
I stayed in Brooks Hotel on Dec 24th and 25th. The hotel foyer and bar were extremely busy on Christmas Eve. Some of the serving staff were showing the stress of serving large numbers and as a guest I was aware of staff, including a bar manager, discussing customers and what to do in a manner that felt like it was a works canteen and not a 4 star hotel. A harsh comment I know but I think a busy situation should have been handled better. 
My main impression though was how excellent Matt (manager I think ) was. I had phoned a few days earlier with a request re the hotel storing a bicycle for a friend who was visiting on Christmas Day. Matt assured me they would take it in and store it in a room downstairs. When I introduced myself on arrival he remembered our phone conversation and again assured me that it was no trouble. Observing Matt in the dining room and foyer he was most impressive in his dealings with customers in a friendly and efficient manner. A great asset to the hotel. I was also impressed with Michelle on reception. She was most helpful and very pleasant. The Concierge is a great character and added a great sense of continuity to the hotel. 
Not huge observations I know but I really wanted to commend Matt on such a pleasant, Charming and professional manner. 
It should be the norm but so often it's not. 
Happy New Year to all in Brooks. 
Daniel Costello. ",4,2016,12,27
236,Great location - comfortable hotel - great breakfast,The rooms are small-ish but very nice. The hotel could not have a better central Dublin location. Check out the Hairy Lemon bar next door. The breakfast is fantastic. The bar has an excellent whiskey selection. Highly recommended!,5,2016,12,21
236,A good choice,"Stayed here for a four night break away,The Hotel is a little bit out of the way but in some respects that can be a bonus if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of the Temple bar area.Will happily book here again when i'm next in Dublin.",4,2016,12,21
236,My fave hotel in Dublin!,"I stayed in brooks on Friday night with my mum. I absolutely love this hotel, it is my favorite in Dublin. On arrival our room wasn't ready as we were early, we dropped our bags and went out for lunch. The girls at reception were so welcoming and really pleasant. Our room was perfect (room 102) - I can't fault this place. Breakfast was excellent. As well as a buffet you can choose a hot fresh breakfast from the menu. The staff were great, very friendly and always smiling. The location is just perfect too, it's surrounded by shops and restaurants. This is the most welcoming and homely hotel I've ever stayed in and I highly recommend it. Can't wait to stay again. ",5,2016,12,10
236,Emmanuel's 40th Birthday Celebrations,"Fantastic is the only word I can use for Brooks Hotel - staff, accommodation, food, cinema experience & the Liberties Suite.

We had a wonderful evening with family & friends celebrating my husbands 40th birthday, I would recommend anyone who wants a different experience to book your birthday celebrations with this amazing hotel.

The cinema is so comfortable and to sit with just family & friends was an experience we will always remember, the popcorn supplied went down a treat also and because it was just adults, it was wonderful for them to be able to bring in their drinks and place them on the individual tables that fold out from each arm of the seats.

We then went on to continue celebrating in the Liberties Suite and nothing was too much trouble for the staff, any last minute requests were taken care off immediately, the room really suited the gathering of 50 people, the set up of the tables and pod tables was excellent, the soft lighting was great and also to be able to bring in your own music on an Ipod and for it to be played through the sound system made our night.  The food was absolutely delicious so our guests left fed and extremely happy.

Our room was an Executive Double on the 4th floor, it was very peaceful & quiet and the bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was lovely and big and the shower was very powerful.  The breakfast was just delicious and they catered for my Coeliac diet, nothing was too big to ask of the beautiful staff that run this hotel.

To sum up, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a true comfortable experience in the heart of Dublin and to say the Customer Service was second to none is an understatement, from the Event Planner to the Concierge Connor to Reception Staff to the Management, Bar Staff, Servers, everything was done so expertly and with a smile.  

Thank you all for such a wonderful experience.

Elaine & Emmanuel Stratford",5,2016,12,04
236,"Nice hotel, great area","Stayed for one night in a Deluxe room at the Brooks Hotel.  It was nice, clean and recently decorated,  but I wouldn't really call it Deluxe in absolute terms.  Very comfortable bed though.  There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel. 

Breakfast is good quality and quick, unlike Reception which takes quite a long time to check people out.  

Great location, about half way between St Stephen's Green and Temple Bar.   Lots of bars and restaurants.  I will definitely use this hotel again.",4,2016,12,02
236,Short stay,"A lovely hotel, friendly and clean and lovely food, I found the room comfortable, not very big but had everything that we needed. It was a nice temperature and the food was lovely. We had a nice relaxing break. It is on the expensive side but I would go back.",4,2016,11,30
236,"Wonderful business stay, located in the right spot for business and fun","Hotel was excellently located walking distance from Government offices and amidst great places for food and drinks. Staff was extremely friendly, and they always tried to help (one day upon arriving wet we were offered a hot tea or coffee). I stayed for over two weeks so it was good place to stay, to call temporary home.
 
Breakfast was ok but a  bit slow in hot breakfast (can understand since made fresh). 

Hotel was of the less expensive, good value, location, good for long stay places we found for work related travel in Dublin.",5,2016,11,28
236,"Great location, very comfortable hotel with cosy atmosphere","Just got back from a fabulous birthday weekend in Dublin. I can't fault this hotel. We didn't eat there as there is such a vast choice of restaurants, cafes and bars in very close walking distance so I can't comment on the food but everything else was very good. Reception staff and the concierge were efficient and helpful. We arrived on a very early flight so had to entertain ourselves before the guaranteed check in of 3pm. This was fine as we went to the Guinness factory which is a superb activity! Anyway, I think if you book the hotel directly on their website you can request an earlier check in of 12 o'clock so that is good to know. 
We stayed in a deluxe room after a free upgrade with a trip advisor code even though we'd already booked. The room was plushly decorated and the white company toiletries were a nice touch. There is a fridge which was handy and it was quiet so we had a great sleep. We were able to use the residents' lounge on our last day even though we'd checked out and I found this common sense approach to customer satisfaction very helpful unlike some places that stick to rules at the expense of service. So much on the doorstop of this hotel I feel I haven't even scratched the surface so hope to go back soon. Highly recommended! ",5,2016,11,22
236,Great Base for Visiting Dublin,"I had a very enjoyable stay for a 3 nights at the Brooks Hotel.  I loved the ambience and decor, staff were exceedingly friendly and VERY helpful and although on the small side my room was very comfortable and quiet.  This hotel was a great base for exploring Dublin, very close to the thick of it yet on a quiet street.  I did a good bit of walking during my stay so the location was perfect.  Breakfast was delicious and the dinners I had in the bar and restaurant were scrumptious.  I loved the pillow menu!!! I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,11,21
236,Not sure what I'm paying for.,"This hotel is fine, well-appointed, clean, and in a good location. However, there are a large number of hotels in the same area with comparable facilities available for 1/2 or 2/3 the price per night of this one, and I can't tell why this one is more expensive. Service was good and I enjoyed my stay, but I feel like I overpaid.

- Power sockets are nowhere convenient. Charging a couple of phones means unplugging things on the other side of the room.
- The fridge is ""available as a minibar"", but when you get to the room it's empty. It's only a minibar if you explicitly request it.
- There are teabags and a kettle, but no biscuits. It's a minor thing, but for 330EUR a night you'd think they could stump up 0.50 for a biscuit.
- The guest information packet includes their movie listing... from a year ago.
- The room barely fits in anything other than the giant bed and the furniture, there's barely enough room to walk around and open a couple of suitcases. Sure, it's going to be a small room in the city centre, but I can get a room this size for less money elsewhere.",3,2016,11,20
236,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"Our room was amazing, the service was excellent. Our stay came with a complementary Breakfast including a choice of full Irish Breakfast as well as a spectacular buffet. The location was perfect for exploring Dublin. Wishing walking distance to major attractions including Trinity College and the Book of Kells.
Be sure to check out the Hairy Lemon, a terrific little pub next door to the hotel.",5,2016,11,19
236,Great location and very nice room,This was a quick trip to visit Dublin so I wanted a convenient location. The concierge was helpful in directing me to the attractions I could visit in one afternoon. The room was well appointed and very clean. They arranged a cab for me the next morning. It is conveniently located to several pubs for informal dinners.,5,2016,11,17
236,"Ideally situated in Dublin city centre - near to everything, tourist office closeby and Grafton Street.","Brooks hotel is a charming hotel with a warm welcome and delightful helpful staff.
I had a single room, very well appointed with everything I needed and the breakfast was one of the highlights of my day.  Newspapers, freshly cooked full breakfast as well as all the fruits, yogurts breads etc. served in a friendly manner.  No better start to my days of sightseeing.",4,2016,11,17
236,Recommend,"Highly recommend. Location is perfect. Breakfast is excellent, staff friendly and helpful. Love the pillow menu.. whiskey menu in bar is a good addition. Parking is not free, have to park in RCSI at Stephens green to get discount rate. Car park across road is only discounted for 24hr.",4,2016,11,17
236,Great position,"We arrived at 2 pm ,having booked 2 rooms.
Only one ready,the other at 4.30.Room very nice,good quality linen,and very clean.
At bed turn down ,2 chocolates put on bed.
Breakfast not included in rate ,but at 12.50£ quite good,though rushed.
Staff very pleasant.Would stay again",4,2016,11,16
236,Despite the view .... it's excellent,"Had an overnight stay recently with 4 friends.   Check in was friendly and efficient.  The rooms were clean, modern with nice decor.   Lovely hot shower, room service excellent.  We ate in the hotel; food was nice, although nothing special.   I'd suggest eating out as there are so many nice restaurants close by.   The breakfast however was delicious, hot, very tasty and the staff were lovely.   I really liked it, a very good hotel for the city.  Hated the view, pic attached, but if I'm staying in the city, it's generally not for the views.  Highly recommend Brooks.  ",5,2016,11,16
236,"Great location, small boutique-y, friendly","A friend and I recently shared a room at the Brooks hotel.  We arrived early in the AM (7:30), and they stored our luggage and gave us sightseeing advice quickly, efficiently and with a smile on their face.  Our room was ready when we returned in the later afternoon.

The room was fine--not huge with limited closet space (we just pulled out the ironing board), but it had a safe, plenty of bathroom counter space and the heater/AC worked well.  We did not hear noise even though we were close to the elevator.

Breakfast was included in our rate, and it was a great array of choices that filled us up!  The staff was friendly and helpful, and they arranged a cab for our departure.  I have nothing but positive things to say, and I would stay at the Brooks again!  The location was very convenient for walking to the big sites, shopping or catching the hop on/off bus!",4,2016,11,14
236,Another great stay !,"This was a return trip for a girls break.  Last year we stayed for one night, this year we stayed for two! As we expected the service from  the staff was excellent, in particular Conor , who is a huge asset for the hotel.  Breakfast was delicious,  we could relax and enjoy it at our leisure, even when breakfast was finished we were never rushed.  Our room on the third floor was spotlessly clean, had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  Maybe a bit on the small side but was adequate for our trip.  Location is perfect for shopping, access to transport, restaurants etc.  This hotel has a fantastic ambience and I would highly recommend it for a stay in Dublin.",5,2016,11,12
236,Fabulous hotel & great location,"I booked this hotel because of the good reviews as well as being ideally located in the centre of Dublin and we were not disappointed.
We were greeted with a smile, met by the very friendly staff who went out of their way to make sure we were settled.
We stayed for one night but had 2 days in Dublin using the hotel as our base.  We also ended up eating in the bar and restaurant for convenience and can recommend them both as well.
The room was lovely.  Very clean and well presented.  Nothing was wrong, and believe me I looked!  
There's a pillow menu and they even bring chocolates to your room to place on your pillow.
The bathroom is spacious and the bed was very big and comfy.
Overall a lovely stay.  We will be visiting Dublin again and most definitely staying at Brooks Hotel.  It's located near to all the main sights and not far from the bus route so easy all round.",5,2016,11,12
236,Great Hotel,"Would highly recommend this hotel for various reasons.  The hotel is in a great location right in the centre of the city on the south side of the river so only a short walk from the Temple Bar area.  There is no parking at the hotel but there is a multi-storey car park directly opposite.  Railway station is a 10-15 minute walk away and the airport is 20-30 minutes in a taxi.  Check in was quick by very friendly and hospitable staff.  There is a large selection of whiskies in the hotel bar.  The rooms are modern, spacious and clean.  The hotel was quiet considering it is on a main street.  The Temple Bar area is only 5 minutes walk and the main shopping areas and river are around 10 minutes walk.  There was an amazing choice for breakfast on the buffet and hot food was made to order but was very quick.   I was really impressed with this hotel and would definitely recommend and would return.",5,2016,11,12
236,"Great hotel, reasonable rates, close to everything","This hotel is a great find. Its only 2 short blocks from Grafton Street and really close to all the important areas. The room, although small, is modern and was quiet at the back of the hotel. The staff was pleasant and helpful - personal input regarding sites and excursions. This seemed reasonably priced for the area and we're definitely going to stay here again!",5,2016,11,09
236,"Ambient like in a friend family house, food like it should be","I was always passing by without much of attention to this place. Everything changed when once I stepped in. I never expected such a worm welcome from a receptionist and this dedication from a hotel staff. There is a feeling of lite tranquility in the middle of buzzing city, not crowded and without obligations. This place is modest and sophisticated at this same time. Service in the lounge is good - fast and efficient. Food is a quality. I had a Pumpkin, coconut and green chill soup followed by club sandwich and it was delicious and well priced. Bar have a home made cookies, scones and they do a good deal with the coffee. I I found a hidden gem in the city place that is not stiff and overpriced but have this unique quality. I will be back.",5,2016,11,09
236,"Great hotel, great location ","We went to Ireland with my parents. Our first stop was at the Brooks Hotel. We arrived extremely early in the morning-before our rooms were ready and they have this room where you can rest. Its like resting in your own living room. Couches, chairs-beautifully decorated. We were the only ones using the room so we could take a short nap on the couches-which was very needed and much appreciated. They also offered a coffee and tea service. Our rooms were beautiful and quite large. Don't forget to bring your outlet converters, but if you do (forget) they have some at the front desk. The location is great and great views from the room. Excellent service. They have a great whisky bar too.   Highly recommend!",4,2016,11,05
236,Fantastic stay at the Brooks,"We loved the location, our room, and the staff.

The Brooks is located a few blocks from the crowded Temple Bar area.  The location is perfect. Dublin is a great walking city, and we took full advantage of their location on Drury Street.

We arrived early, (8:30:00am), so our room was not available yet.  They held our bags and we explored the city.   We came back, in the early afternoon. Check-in was a breeze. Fast, efficient and friendly.  The concierge, Conor, (sp?), was a hoot, and very helpful.

The building is beautiful, and the room was quite spacious, (Standard Room with a King size bed).  There were 2 chairs, a small table,  a bureau, a bathtub shower and mini-fridge, tucked away in the bureau. There is also a small, flat-screen TV.   There is a small, iron and ironing board, that's attached to the inside of the wall closet, along with a trouser press, (which we did not use).   There is a small, electronic safe in the closet and 7 hangars.  The bed is one of the most comfortable that we've ever slept in.  They offer a ""pillow"" menu, but it was not needed ,as the pillows that were provided were very comfy.

The only beef, with the room,  is that there is not enough drawer space. There are only a handful of small drawers, the closet is small, and only not nearly enough hangars.    We lived out of our suitcases for 4 nights.   This is an old building, so it's understandable but, somewhat, inconvenient.

A full breakfast was included, each morning, at the on-site restaurant, Francesca's.  There was a buffet, with fruit, breads, meats, cereal, etc.  The variety was good.  You could order off of the menu.  I ate either a full Irish breakfast each morning, or poached eggs and smoked salmon. The food was good.  The only problems that we had is that they would bring you toast, 5-10 minutes before your food arrived.  It was always cold.  That was a bit odd.    That, and the service was uneven.   It was usually pretty slow and the servers seldom checked back with you for coffee or tea refills.

The on-site Jasmine Bar was fantastic.  It's considered a top-notch Whiskey bar and it is. The selection was wonderful, and the bartenders were friendly, outgoing and attentive.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay, and will be back.",5,2016,11,05
236,great location,"This lovely little hotel is well priced and nicely appointed and is perfectly situated close to shops, restaurants and museums. I so enjoyed my stay here because it made coming back to the hotel once or twice a day very very easy.",5,2016,11,01
236,The Brooks Hotel - Dublin,"It is always a pleasure to return to the Brooks Hotel in Dublin, which we did recently whilst visiting Ireland to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  This charming boutique hotel is centrally located and is within easy walking distance to most of the historic sites, galleries, shops and restaurants in Dublin.  The staff at The Brooks are always friendly, helpful and courteous; and Connor O’Connell, the concierge, is an absolute treasure.  There is truly no question about Dublin he cannot answer and no problem to big, or too small, for him to assist you with – always given with a smile and addressing you by name.  As on previous visits, we stayed in The Brooks at the start and at the end of our fortnight in Ireland.  Both of our rooms (306 & 508) were spacious, comfortable and tastefully decorated.  The morning breakfast buffet is superb, offering an ample selection for every palate.  The wood-paneled guest lounge, on the lower level, is a welcoming, quiet and cozy snug - a great place to relax.  We look forward to our next visit to The Brooks and do highly recommend.",5,2016,10,31
236,Great hotel with central location,"We stayed for 2 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin. The hotel has a great location, walking distance to many local attractions, including Trinity College, St Stephans Green, Temple Bar Area. 

The concierge, Connor was wonderful, offered suggestions of things to do, near by restaurants.

The bed was the very cmfortable. Housekeeping was great, room was clean. 

The area is very safe and walkable. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,30
236,"Excellent location, facilities and services","We stayed for 4 days here. We got a room for 3 people. All of us agree that this hotel is excellent. We like itl very much. All eateries, departmental stores, parks & the famous Grafton Street are close by . There is also a theater nearby. 
We were even given the choice of choosing the type of pillow that we prefer. 
Wow!!!! We feel pampered here. 
The best was the concierge, Mr Connor. He is extremely friendly, informative & helpful. 
",5,2016,10,27
236,Perfect boutique hotel in Dublin,"The Brooks Hotel is perfectly located in Dublin. Walking distance to numerous restaurants, shopping, famous Temple Bar area, Grafton St., Trinity College and many other highlights of Dublin.  We found a great laundry just a block away, fluff & fold in just a day. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful with recommendations, directions/maps, remembering our names, etc. Conor was a prince!  Giving us all sorts of advice about  the area, food, etc. It seemed as though he was on duty 24/7. Our room was charming, like staying with family, furnishings were comfortable, felt right at home immediately .  We would definitely recommend The Brooks Hotel to everyone and we would stay there again!",5,2016,10,27
236,Love this hotel!,"Just spent a fantastic 5 nights in The Brooks Hotel.  What a little gem!  The rooms were nice, a little dated but very clean.  The huge bed was so comfortable as were the pillows.  it is a bustling area with the window open there was a ton of noise but closed nothing could be heard.  its an extremely quiet hotel, there were a ton of people staying there yet we didn't hear anyone.  I have to say the staff and the location are what truly make this hotel special.  The staff are lovely, Connor the Concierge is worth his weight in gold. One Friday evening we were undecided about dinner he make immediate reservations and walked us to the restaurant where we were seated right away and we had a fantastic meal as he had promised.  The housekeeping staff are so sweet especially Lynn and Edel, they made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay as nice as possible.  We didn't have dinner here but breakfast was delish, I tried to be good but I ended up having the Full Irish most mornings because it was so good.  I will definitely stay here again on my next visit.  I have friends traveling to Dublin for St. Patricks Day and they will most likely stay here the location is perfect for a Dublin City Break.",5,2016,10,26
236,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed in the Brooks Hotel during our visit to Dublin in October 2016.  The hotel is a great, its location is perfect.  Our room was a basic US hotel sized room with a good sized bathroom. We stayed there for five nights and were completely comfortable the whole time. The room (#404) was very quiet, no nighttime noise from the street or other rooms.  The hotel staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was very good with many offerings including cooked to order eggs.  The location put us within easy walking distance to the parts of the city any tourist would be interested in.  Dublin is a great walking city.",5,2016,10,25
236,A Great hotell! ,"We stayed at Brooks hotell for 3 nights. Its a Nice, clean and a good  hotell nearby Temple bar district.  The beds were fantastisc. 
Breakfast was Nice, Its a buffé but you can also order hot food from The Breakfast menu. 
Som i really recomend this hotell! ",5,2016,10,25
236,I love the Brooks,"I just love the Brooks. It's not spectacularly luxurious. It's like visiting your favorite aunt, whose house is always spotless but super-comfortable, but best of all, your aunt and uncle (that would be Conor the concierge) just want to make sure you have a great time and everything is okay. Nothing is too good for you, their favorite niece. The service here is so wonderful, everything else pales. The rooms are nice but not huge, and your aunt and uncle do live on a fairly busy street so there may be noise in the morning if your room fronts on the street. The beds are comfortable and the bathtub and amenities are nice, the breakfast is very good. Your aunt and uncle have a lounge downstairs where you can collapse if your room isn't quite ready. It's extremely comfortable. They are very close to all the cool things in Dublin--you can walk to many of them. You could offer me a room at the Westbury--all stuffy and formal--for free, and I would still pay to stay at the Brooks.",5,2016,10,22
236,Dublin,"Very nice hotel, offered nice breakfast, ate other meals around town, convenient to city and sites.  Watched street musicians entertain tourists.  Visited lovely gardens able to walk to, traveled city transportation, enjoyed meals at Against the Grain. Toured St Patrick's Cathedral, Castles, Gardens, Beaches, Presentation about Irish history, Waterford Crystal, Dingle Crystal. Weather for this time of year was unusually warm, they said the ""Yanks"" brought the ward weather from Texas.  People were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Great visit for anyone.",5,2016,10,18
236,Nice Hotel,"We stayed here 2 nights in September.  The location of the hotel allows easy walking to Christ Church, Dublinia, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Trinity College, shops and pubs.  So you'll have plenty to see close by  We also walked to the DART train station for a trip to the Irish Sea and Malahide Castle.

The hotel itself is nice.  The room we had was small, but adequate.  Bring an extension cord, as we only had one accessible unused outlet.  We had to unplug the TV & plug in our adapter there for our needs. 

We had a nice burger at the bar, which served food later than most places nearby.  If you want dinner, then get out well before 7:00.  After about 8:00, the restaurants nearby only serve drinks.   We tried several places, but ended up at the hotel & the food was good there.  Also FYI; do your shopping early.  The mall nearby was nearly closed completely at 7:30 and most gift shops are closed at 8:00. Carroll's gifts just south of O'Connell St Bridge is open 'til 9:00, but a bit of a walk. 

So, my review is mostly about the Location.  It is ideal for getting to see quite a bit of Dublin if you don't mind a little walking.  The hotel employees were pleasant, as was the case nearly everywhere in Ireland!   Overall a good place to stay.",4,2016,10,18
236,Great!,"We stayed here for two nights, whiskey bar was great. Very clean hotel. Front desk was super helpful. Conor helped us plan our second day. What a great experience, took a hop on hop off tour. Definitely would stay here again ",4,2016,10,13
236,Lovely hotel,"Booked for a surprise for my husbands 40th and wasn't let down.  Upgraded to a suite, room was huge, very spacious and everything we wanted. 
White collection toiletries in bathroom. 
Had breakfast one day, fantastic buffet with a great selection! ",4,2016,10,11
236,Thank You Conner,"My husband and I were greeted by Conner, the concierge, when we arrived at this lovely hotel after spending 4 days in NYC then flying all night to get to Dublin. We were exhausted and we arrived too early to check into our room so we were seated in the lobby. Conner made sure we were comfortable brought coffee, cream, sugar on a beautiful service tray. Just extra special touches. They did put us in our room early. We were a little curious because one of the young ladies at the desk kept us waiting at the couches. When a couple came in about an hour after us, in the same situation. She immediate had a room for them. Then she left the counter. We assumed she was off duty so we asked the new young lady if a room was ready and she said yes of course. So we were not certain why young lady # one chose to over look us. They weren't that busy but we overlooked the slight. The hotel is nice. Convenient to tourist sights such as Temple Bar area. Nice breakfast in the mornings, beautiful room, spacious, clean, nice clean bathrooms, nice bar area to relax and have a night cap in the evenings. It was really wonderful. I would definitely recommend especially to a more mature crowd who appreciate the niceties of this gracious and classy hotel",5,2016,10,11
236,Great value for the money.,"A clean comfortable room, quiet hotel. I give the restaurant high marks for quality and freshness of the food. Breakfast was delicious. Centrally located, everything was within walking distance.

The gripes were the thermostat in the room did not work leading to uneven temperatures. The electric sockets were out of order so charging electronics got tricky and the sinks ran slow. 

None of these was enough to keep me from staying again, however the staff did not seemed concerned about them either so this could be a red flag in the future.",4,2016,10,09
236,"Really nice room, good hotel","Stayed for 2 nights in October. Price about average for a decent hotel right in middle of Dublin. Only a few minutes from trinity college and temple bar. Lovely room and bathroom, really comfy bed. Bit of an ancient air con system but it seemed to work fine. Would recommend ",4,2016,10,08
236,"Great location, nice property, good service","This hotel had a great location, very near Grafton Street, Trinity College, Temple Bar and all the other touristy things south of the Liffey.  We were easily able to walk to all the places of interest to us (as far west as the Guinness Storehouse and even neighborhoods north of the Liffey).  

The staff at the hotel were very helpful; we arrived early in the morning and they gave us access to the guests lounge as the room wasn't available.  They stored our bags while we were out for the day and had them in our room (which they had upgraded) when we returned.  There were a couple of maintenance issues with the room, but they were taken care of quickly.  

We had opted for including breakfast in the rate and found the selection of food items to be very good.  The cooked breakfast items were excellent and the service was timely and efficient.  This seemed to be a good value.

The hotel was a bit on the expensive side, but it was a very comfortable and pleasant stay, and we would stay here again.",4,2016,10,07
236,270 Euro for a room with a Murphy bed!,"I couldn't be more disappointed with a hotel...we paid 270 Euro for a room in this hotel which came highly rated and were told at reception that our room was being 'upgraded"" and our room (room 200) contained a Murphy (hideaway bed).  It was the complete opposite of luxury - it was like staying in the den of a friend's house.  They were not responsive to fixing the issue and when I sent in a complaint afterwards via survey they didn't respond at all!!  Awful customer service and horrible- backbreaking room!  Worst night sleep in all of Europe and I paid a lot for it!!",2,2016,10,06
236,Wonderful short break to Dublin,"This hotel is ideally placed to walk to most attractions including Temple Bar, St Stephens Green and Grafton Street.  Hotel staff were friendly and professional and the bedroom was comfortable and quiet.  Nice touch having the Roberts radio on as you go into the room.  Bathroom was small but more than adequate and great to have the White Stuff toiletries provided.   Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay in Dublin and if I come back, this is the hotel I will stay at.  Good choice at breakfast from both buffet and menu.  Thank you for making my stay so pleasant.",5,2016,10,03
236,Great mix of old and new!,"Good old fashioned service but with lots of modern touches throughout the hotel!

The doorman/concierge is a credit to the hotel - so obliging! 

Loved the White Company toiletries in the bathroom. Loved the cooked breakfast in the morning. Loved the friendly and helpful staff. 

Hotel is in a great location with lots of great bars and restaurants nearby.

236,Very nice Hotel in great location,"We stayed our first and last nights in Ireland at the Brooks Hotel.  When we first arrived in Ireland we took a taxi to Brooks and arrived at 5 am, checked in to a room on the 4th floor. To our surprise they had decorated the bed with rose petals, because we were on our honeymoon.  That was a nice touch..  The room itself was a bit small, dark and outdated.   We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient for walking around Dublin. After traveling around Ireland, we stayed our last night there and had a room on the 6th floor.  This room seemed larger, the furniture appeared updated and had more natural light..  The bar in the hotel is very nice and all the employees throughout the hotel were very professional and pleasant..  I would definitely recommend this Hotel if staying in Dublin..",4,2016,09,28
236,Coffee with Friends at Brooks,Visiting from USA meeting my Irish friends for coffee.  Enjoyed a mid morning coffee in a lovely setting. Relaxed setting with comfortable seating.  Excellent service not feeling rushed we were able to enjoyed a wonderful visit.,5,2016,09,28
236,Good Hotel,"As referenced by previous guest, I agree 100%.  Rooms are a tad small and a bit dated but in all, good location and even better service.  Nicely stocked bar, decent restaurant. They have AC and showers with very good water pressure.  ",4,2016,09,28
236,Good Hotel; Great location.,"This is a nice hotel.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  One of the best features is the central location of the hotel in Dublin: easy walking distance to a lot to features, etc.  The rooms, however, are some what limited in size and having enough room to move around in and store things can be difficult.  Nevertheless, the rooms are similar in size to ""standard"" hotel rooms in the USA and of course in Europe one can find many smaller sized rooms.  The restaurant is adequate with reasonable food.  All in all, a good place to stay in Dublin.",4,2016,09,25
236,Great City location ,"Stayed in Brooks now numerous time as it is slap bang in centre of Dublin and close to my meetings locations. 
It has. A at park just across the road at discounted rates which is great and a Wee Jen of a coffee shop also on entrance to car park. Great coffee. 

The rooms in brooks are compact but very comfortable. 
Breakfast is a treat with plenty on offer at the buffet and all hot choices are cooked fresh from the kitchen, so my crispy bacon was actually really crispy and obviously cooked fresh. 
Staff are very friendly and helpful every time I stay here   
I've stayed now approx 15 times at this hotel and it's brilliant hotel close to graft on street, st Stephens green and some great restaurants. ",5,2016,09,25

236,Great Hotel in center Dublin,"This modern, step-back-in-time, hotel is perfect for a stay in the heart of Dublin. The staff is very personable and helpful.  The rooms are clean and offer all the modern amenities needed.  It's within walking distance of the heart of Dublin and the city tour bus.",5,2016,09,18
236,Brooks is the best .....,"Once again this hotel never disappoints. The rooms are beautifully decorated, air conditioned and quite spacious. It is very centrally located and close to all amenities. The staff are friendly and efficient and there us always a buzz. My husband and I have been coming here for our annual all Ireland night away for the last number of years. We have stayed over the years in a number of Dublin hotels but have found this gem in the last 5 yrs and are sticking with Brooks.",5,2016,09,18
236,Excellent hotel centrally located,"An excellent old hotel that offers a clean attractive room at a moderate price. Centrally located within the shopping area and a short walk to the college area where all of the tours begin. The restaurant is only fair for dinner, but there are numerous pubs nearby including the Hairy Lemon a few doors down that offers very good food.",5,2016,09,16
236,Fabulous hotel in heart of Dublin ,"My mum and I stayed here for 2 nights in September paid for via her employers for 25 years service. The hotel was truly fabulous and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was on the 5th floor facing the multi storey car park and whilst you wont get a great view, who really goes away to sit in their room anyway!? We ate dinner on the first night. 3 courses and a glass of wine. Beautiful. Breakfast both days was amazing. I'd definitely stay at this hotel if I returned again to Dublin ",5,2016,09,16
236,Delightful boutique hotel,"Friendly staff greeted us and assisted us with our bags to our good size room.  Everything was clean and stocked with toiletries, ironing board and safe.  Comfortable beds and pillows.  Even have a pillow menu so you can select a specific pillow for the next night.  Quiet ""library"" in the lowest level to visit with friends.  They provided us with a ""sack"" breakfast as we were departing early for the airport.  Very convenient to sites in downtown Dublin",5,2016,09,16
236,Great hotel and service,"I stayed at the Brooks hotel 10 years ago and was so impressed that I vowed to return the next time that I visited Dublin.  I am pleased to report nothing has changed.

The hotel is in a superb location in central Dublin.  There is an abundance of nice restaurants and bars in the area, and it it is ideally placed for exploring the city.  Our room was clean and comfortable although arguably a little dated.  That said, I understand a refurbishment programme is ongoing and assume we were in an older room.   Breakfast was superb, there was a great selection of cooked and continental style food.

What really stands out at Brooks is the staff.  Without exception they were genuinely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  Any request that I made from the room was immediately dealt with.  Probably the best hotel service I have experienced and the same as it was 10 years before.

One slight gripe is that I was offered the ""opportunity"" to settle my bill in sterling.  When I looked closely at this it was apparent that the exchange rate was far inferior to the rate my credit card applies, so I chose to pay in  Euros.  The only other time I experienced this scam was coincidentally in another hotel in Dublin, so watch out for this.

I had a wonderful stay at Brooks and will surely return at some time in the future.",5,2016,09,16
236,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Room was comfortable.  Bathroom clean and functional.  Shower was a bit small.  Location was really convenient to Trinity College, restaurants, shopping and parks. 
breakfast was excellent. We would stay here again just for the location.",4,2016,09,16
236,Wonderful place at great location ,"The first thing you notice right away about this hotel is the amazing location. The Brooks is on a small side street but close to everything. Pubs , restaurants , shops all surround the hotel and Trinity College is 10 minutes away. We were able to walk everywhere which is always my preference .
The hotel is elegant and the staff super friendly , from the desk clerks to Connor,  the concierge and everyone at the restaurant. 
Our room was a good size , with a comfortable bed and nice size bathroom.
Breakfast is great with a very good selection of fruit , cereal, baked goods and hot dishes cooked to order.
My only two complains are that we could only find one plug in the room and that was not enough to plug all our devices and at times the water was lukewarm in shower.
Ends up I could have asked for an extension cord and that the water sometimes is an issue if too many people are showering at the same time.
I would highly recommend this hotel.

236,Customer service is spelled BROOKS,"Just returned home so the excellent customer service is fresh in my mind. This well situated boutique hotel treated us like royalty. We arrived a day early and they managed to settle us into the proper room, in spite of a mess up by our travel agent. Spacious and comfortable room and beds, with a welcomed pillow menu. The head concierge Conor and his sidekick Mike (??? Sorry, guess not every detail is fresh!) were helpful and charming. The front desk assisted as requested with dinner reservations and directions and such. Breakfast was a delicious and bountiful buffet with hot dishes available simply upon request. Housekeeping was attentive. I give the Brooks an A+. ",5,2016,09,14
236,Average hotel,When booking the room we requested  and early check-in time once we've arrived to the hotel they told us that we need to come back at 11 AM for check in we came back at 11 they stated our room was still not ready and come back at 3pm. Room was  spacious and clean. The hotel is located in a area that has a large weekend night life a lot of crowd noise can be heard at all hours of the night.,3,2016,09,13
236,"Location, location,location","Traveling with two teenage boys is a combination of scary and fun. The hotel was able to accommodate us with a connecting room. I called the front desk, they actually listened and set it up. My wife's relief allows for a degree of relaxation that allowed the trip to succeed. Great Staff!",5,2016,09,13
236,"""Great Boutique Hotel, Great Location in a Great City""","We spent 8 nights in this hotel, and the staff was extremely warm and welcoming. Emily, Megan, Ashley, Rachel, and Marvin made us feel so special. Breakfast was fantastic.  The Jasmine Bar has an impressive whiskey selection. Lovely to relax to the music of the piano.The best part is the location - so many wonderful things within walking distance - The Book of Kells at Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, The Whiskey Museum, great shopping, plenty of good restaurants nearby - to name a few. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel hotel.",5,2016,09,12
236,Short visit to Dublin,You cannot beat the location of this hotel - so close to Trinity College and Stephen's Green! Pubs and restaurants all over so very convenient! rooms are small but beds are super comfy! They even have a pillow menu! Bathrooms are also small but efficient. Not a fan of the old fashioned hair dryer but nice young woman at front desk got me a modern day hair dryer! Would stay again! No parking - you have to park yourself at the Stephen's Green garage for about 12.50 euros a day - discounted rate!,5,2016,09,11
236,Great Location! Very Good Hotel!,"Everywhere we wan't to go was in close walking distance (Trinity College, St Stephen's Square, Grafton Street). Comfortable, clean rooms in a good size. Good size bathroom. Pleasant staff. Good food, especially liked the breakfast.",4,2016,09,11
236,Perfect base for exploring Dublin on foot,"We couldn’t have picked a more perfect base for our 2 nights in Dublin.  A stones throw from my 3 favourite coffee shops - Kaph on Drury Street, Clement and Pekoe on William Street South and Fallon and Byrne on Exchequer Street - and our favourite wine bar - Olesya, just opposite Fallon and Byrne on Exchequer Street.  The buzz and energy of this part of Dublin is palpable and most attractive.  The hotel upgraded us from a deluxe room to a junior suite (the first time we have ever been so lucky) and gave us number 518 which we would recommend, though the deluxe and executive rooms look good too.  The junior suites have excellent walk in power showers.   Brooks is not cheap but then you are in the very heart of Dublin and because of that it’s worth it.  Using Brooks as our base we were able to ‘do Dublin in a day’ on foot and can recommend the following:

1. Breakfast at Dolce Sicily on Dawson Street or Fallon and Byrne’s on Exchequer Street
2. Trinity College Tour including the Arnaldo Comodoro sphere
3. Book of Kells and the Long Room
4. National Gallery of Ireland for the European Art
5. Coffee at Kaph on Drury Street or Clement and Pekoe on William Street South
6. Little Museum of Dublin on St Stephens Green North
7. St Stephens Green gardens
8. 29 Fitzwilliam Street at south east corner of Merrion Square
9. National Library on Kildare Street for WBYeats exhibition
10. Olesya’s Wine Bar for wine and cheese platter",4,2016,09,10
236,Gem of a hotel,"I only have one complaint and I'll leave that to the end.

The staff were super friendly and helpful.  Our flight arrived overnight at 6:30am and when we got to the hotel they let us check in at about 8am.  What a life saver as we were tired and in need of a shower and nap before our 10am Book of Kells reservation.

The location is great - quick walk to Trinity College (Book of Kells), St Stephens Square, Merrion Square, Temple Bar, Ha'penny Bridge, fine dining, pubs, etc.  But despite being in the thick of things, the rooms are quiet.  We were on the first floor facing the street and never were bothered by noise.

We didn't eat at the hotel (because there are so many interesting places to eat nearby) but had a drink in the bar.  The dining room looked lovely.

Here's the complaint - while well appointed, the room and bathroom were super small.  My wife and I were there only one night, so no sweat, but I can't imagine a couple being happy in a room that size for multiple nights.

All that said, I wouldn't hesitate to go back for a night.",4,2016,09,09
236,Great hotel,"Nice luxury hotel with a great breakfast. The only negative I have is that our room was not ready until 3pm.  I know the check in time is 3pm but I had hoped we could get in a little earlier. We arrived at 11am, left our luggage and walked around until 2pm.  They let us sit in the downstairs lounge until our room was ready - exactly at 3pm.",5,2016,09,07
236,Great location for our week in Dublin!,"Great hotel in a great location!  We like to have air conditioning and Brooks has it, while many in Dublin do not.  Our room was lovely and it was quiet.  The staff was very helpful. Pretty much everything we wanted was within walking distance or easy access to a on/off bus.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.  I just hope we might have the opportunity to return and stay there again ourselves!",5,2016,09,01
236,"Excellent location, good value","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here - it really is centrally located, walking distance to many attractions but on a quiet block so  no street noise.

I will recommend it to my friends and will surely choose Brooks for my next stay in Dublin.",4,2016,08,31
236,Great Dublin City Centre Accomodation,"We actually stayed here twice, for one night only each time, while on our honeymoon.  Hotel has great location, staff is accommodating, and you get a free pint of Guiness during your stay!  We had two different rooms each time.  
The first one was nice, pretty much what you would expect for getting the most standard rooms at a nicely rated hotel, but the second room was really neat!  It was one the first floor so closer to the street which was a little bit louder, but we really did not mind since it was a Friday night.
Our flight out was super early, but since we had paid for breakfast they packed us to go bags including hot coffee!  
They do not have valet, but if you are driving (which we would NOT recommend in Dublin city centre) they have a car park right across the street and another one a block or two over.",4,2016,08,29
236,Great place to experience Dublin,"This is a great hotel if you want to explore Dublin!  Old world charm, but well appointed and comfortable.The rooms are not huge, but that comes with the age of the building.  The big pay off being...Fantastically positioned for exploring the town but not on a main thoroughfare so quiet at night. The staff where friendly and the breakfast selection was a great way to start the day.",5,2016,08,26
236,the perfect place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I were absolutely delighted with the Brooks Hotel. We had a lovely room and the staff is exceptional in every way, being very helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. When we return to Dublin we will definitely stay here again.  The location and neighborhood is excellent.  They serve a lovely breakfast with many choices in the dining room which was included with the price of  our room.",5,2016,08,25
236,Would not rate this hotel as 4*,"Hotel needs updating, bit shabby, looks better on the photos on website than it actually is. This was a special occasion, very disappointed. Breakfast next morning my husband couldnt eat the scrambled egg, worst he ever tasted, rubbery! Bathroom bit shabby, towel rail hanging off the wall, only 1 bathrobe also. Overall, ive stayed in better 2 and 3 star hotels, over priced definitely. We paid with a voucher Hotel said it was invalid, very embarrassing as we had to tell the person who gave us the voucher of its invalidity, this was sorted after but should not have happened, would not stay here again.",3,2016,08,23
236,Great location,This is a great location in the city center and close to everything including the Temple Bar area. The people were friendly and very helpful in getting around or recommending areas to visit or places to eat. Accommodations were very good as well.,4,2016,08,19
236,Best service,"I booked Brooks for 1 night as I had a friend's birthday event to go to.  From the moment, I entered they could not have been more helpful.  I was given a complimentary room upgrade, which was a pleasant surprise. 
 I had a room on the 4th floor at the back which was quiet.  The room was spotless and most pleasant.  It had everything you would expect to have.  Only downside you had to pay extra to have your minibar stocked, but this didn't bother me as I was only staying 1 night.  I ordered some room service upon arrival and it was in my room in fifteen minutes (very impressed).

  It is very close to Grafton Street and so makes it an ideal location for shopping and sightseeing.  

My room tariff included breakfast which as it turns out I was unable to avail of as I had a family emergency and had to go home before they started serving breakfast.",5,2016,08,19
236,"Great location, helpful staff","Stayed here for 2 nights. We arrived around 9 am and were able to get into our room right away to drop off our luggage. This hotel is close to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Gaiety Theatre. You get a discount on breakfast when you stay there. They serve full breakfasts in the dining room. It's a bit off the main street so it's quiet at night (no loud pubs close by). They also have a pillow menu! The staff was friendly and helpful. The concierge gentleman showed us to our room. We didn't need his assistance while staying there but I overheard another traveler raving about his help. The room was comfortable. The shower had a tendency to spray the floor no matter how you adjusted the curtain. There was some water damage on the outside due to this. It didn't affect the overall stay in the room though.",5,2016,08,18
236,Wonderful Hotel - highly recommend!,"Can’t say enough good things about this hotel! 
It’s centrally located, within a short walking distance to all the sights, but is on a quieter street away from the crowded tourist hustle and bustle. 
The hotel is classy, modern and well taken care of and the rooms are comfortable, clean and updated.
We had a king room in the back of the hotel that was very quiet, bed and linens very comfortable, fantastic separate shower and tub and we loved that we could open the window for fresh air, plenty of outlets to plug in to.
The staff are knowledgeable, very friendly and helpful.
We stayed here for 5 nights just before and after our daughters wedding, there were 20 in our party, and the lobby, sitting areas and bar were perfect for visiting with friends and family, a great experience!
Recommend the restaurant “the Green Hen” (great food and whiskey selection) and the pub “the Hairy Lemon” (fantastic traditional pub food) within a 1.5 block walk. This is our “Dublin Hotel” from now on, we will definitely be staying here again!",5,2016,08,17
236,"Well located, nice hotel","Spent a mile stone birthday at the hotel who kindly provided an upgrade for one of the rooms which was very kind. We appreciated it !
Nice spacious rooms and bathrooms. Front of house staff were helpful. One room did not have the same TV channels that the other did (only reason to mention it is the Olympics were on and we missed out on the events).
Breakfast was good but the hotel was busy during our stay and the restaurant staff were very slow with service and replenishing the food each morning. 
Very well located and a good choice of hotel overall",4,2016,08,17
236,Amazing place in a really vibey part of town,"Having previously stayed on the outskirts of Dublin on my business visits, I decided to give the Brooks a go this time. So glad I did, it will be my regular accomodation moving forward for my monthly trips.

Location:

Right in the heart of Dublin, I was first struck by the exterior. Beautiful to look at, and very clean. There are a number of bars/restaurants and independant coffee shops within walking distance. Highly recommend Fade Street Social, most amazing food and cocktails, literally 2 minutes from the front door

Hotel:

Upon check-in, I was advised that I'd been upgraded to the Presidential Suite. Always sceptical about what that actually means, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the door to find more of an apartment than a hotel room. Seperate lounge area, sliding doors to the bedroom. The bathroom was exquisite, and I actually felt guilty that I'd been given the room as I was going to be spending so little time in it.

The shower was amazing, great pressure and very spacious. There was also a bath with what looked like a TV embedded into the wall above it (although I didn't try it, so can't confirm)

My only niggle that there didn't seem to be any tea/coffee making facilities in the room unless they were very well hidden. When I stayed at The Spencer, there was a Nespresso machine in the room with a couple of complimentary pods). 

The bed was really comfortable, best nights sleep I've had in a h otel for a long time. The room also had a balcony, although I felt this was a bit of a waste as it looked out into what looked like a bin area.

Staff:

All the staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough for you.

Overall:

I will definitley be staying at The Brooks again, my only word of warning is that if you've travelling for business and your office is at East Point, be prepared to sit in shocking traffic. Dublin really needs to do something about that. Worse gridlock than London",5,2016,08,17
236,"Great location, Decent hotel","The Brooks is centrally located in the heart of Dublin.  It helps you easily access the tourist spots of the city.  Regarding the hotel, I was shocked there was no doorman.  We got out of the taxi with 5 bags and had to lug everything in ourselves.  The hotel is well decorated - rooms are all a bit different and have a conservative design. The bathrooms are large and spacious, which is nice!  Our room overlooked a rooftop and ugly building - not exactly what I want to look at while spending this type of money.  The breakfast (included) was tasty as well.  Overall, great hotel - just needs a bit more service to make it a 5 rating.",4,2016,08,17
236,"Significant price, minimal facilities ","The room was specious but lacks clarity for the price. Television was awkward and out of date. No pay TV option, radio, bill info . Hot room service stops at 10pm. I was then served a less than average cold sandwich Eat elsewhere if hungry. Sent to room at check in but it wasn't ready. Details make hotels...",2,2016,08,15
236,Right in the hustle and bustle,"You couldn't ask for a more centrally located hotel in Dublin. The staff was really attentive to us, and even left us a special surprise in our room when they knew it was our honeymoon. 

Breakfast had lots of options, and the head waiter came over to take my husband's order to ensure that everything would be gluten free.

It is a little bit of an older hotel, but the space is well laid out. Not the greatest shower in the world, but overall a nice bathroom with tub.",4,2016,08,14
236,"Great service, not sure on the room though","First of all this hotel has a GREAT customer service presentation and it shown. WE had our bags loooke dafter whilst our room was being porepared (We a rrived a few hours early so this was our mistake not theirs) and whilst at the bar we were met by a chap calle dConnor. Within 10 minutes he and I were discussing recipes and John Bishop comedy gigs in Ireland. He discussed with us what was good to do in Dublin and told us to get out of Dublin for a few days in the holiday to Belfast and such like. A wonderful gentleman.

Now given this level of service, you are probably owndering why only 4 out of 5? Well a few niggling items irritated me. The bed was not one of them. Put this on record as the best bed I have ever slept on. I nearly asked the otel where they get their beds from and do they ship to England.

First issue is a telephone in the bathroom............This confused the hell out of me as to why it was there. The bathroom had a bath and shower attachment on the top rather than a dedicated shower or a bath. The kettle could not be moved form the roll out shelf in the cupboard thus preventing the door next to it to close if you were making coffee. The TV only played 9 of the 15 channels it advertised. 

The worst issue out of th elist of (admittedly minor) niggles was chocolates on the pillow. Seriously, what is the purpose of this? I have never understood this as to why hotels do it, what they think they will ge tout of it and it got me. 

Little niggles aside, the room was spacious and worked well, but do yourself a favour, say to the receptionist 'no chocolates on the pillows'...oh and print out a map of the area before you get to Dublin, finding this hotel was trickier than working out which genome is responsible for eye colour.",4,2016,08,14
236,Cosy 5 QUIET 5 star! ,"Brooks Hotel is that rare thing - a cosy 5* City Centre Hotel. It's smack bang in the best part of Dublin City centre being less than 100m from the essential Grafton Street (essential that is, till The Dundrum Shopping Centre took over it's functional significance) and it manages to exude calm & quiet sophistication in that understated way reminiscent of far grander hotels. All this without any of the accompanying snobbish sophistry that often accompanies 5* hotels makes The Brooks a very comfortable haven for in-the-know locals, let alone outside visitors. It's bar is generally very well stocked with more than the requisite essential libations; it's Whiskey Bar is another matter again, boasting over 150 of the worlds best whiskeys.
I was somewhat saddened to find - for us 4 at least - that the  restaurant did not quite live up to its reputation.  While the cuisine was overall quiet satisfactory, the seating, & the ambience friendly, the flavours were not as notable as expected. 
While I have not slept in the bedrooms, my friends whom I recommended the hotel to  have, and were most pleased with it. I visited them in the rooms and found them to be most decent indeed with generous quality fittings and comfortable armchairs (I'm unsure if all rooms had them or were only in the executive rooms).  This last is  very  essential prerequisite for me since I suffer from lower and upper back problems and I often judge a hotel by the presence or absence of such amenities.",5,2016,08,14
236,Perfect location great for business,"Stayed here 3 times now. Upon arrival greeted as someone the staff know. Great location and perfect for meetings. You actually get a pillow choice in your room depending on your mood. The only problem is that a room is  not always available with a weeks notice. 

Great Whiskey bar.",5,2016,08,13
236,4 Star Hotel but Felt 5 Star,Stayed here for our recent trip to Dublin booked for location and great reviews. On our last visit we stayed at the 5 star Fitzwilliam which was a big dissapointment. The Brooks however was a real pleasant surprise lovely welcome from the porter and front of house staff. Free upgrade to a deluxe room which was on an upper floor as requested. Room and furnishings were of a higher standard than the Fitzwilliam. Great girl on the bar never fazed even when busy doing a great job manning it solo. Location  is amazing for all the bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel. We didn't eat breakfast at hotel as so many great cafes in the area we didn't need to. Great checkout again  friendly and very efficient staff. We will definitely return and room rate was half what we paid at the Fitzwilliam. Highly recommended will be staying again on our next visit to Dublin.,5,2016,08,13
236,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Stayed with my wife in this beautiful hotel and we were not disappointed. The hotel was small but perfect.  Well appointed rooms and friendly, helpful staff. The location was ideal for shopping, sightseeing and eating out.  Would recommend the breakfast it was super.",5,2016,08,12
236,Very good hotel in great location,"Stayed here for 7 nights whilst in Dublin. Very comfortable room and facilities. Not overly large rooms, but generous by European standards. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for the staff. Streetscape is a bit drab with car park opposite. Excellent location affords easy access to the historic precinct. And close to the Hairy Lemon Pub!! ",5,2016,08,12
236,Great Spot!,"Brooks Hotel was my husband and I's first stop in Ireland.  The hotel was very easy to get to via city bus with a 5 minute walk.  This hotel had everything we were looking for: great location, free wifi, and had a breakfast option when reserving your room.  Our room was spacious and our king (I think all of their beds are kings or ""super"" kings!) bed was very comfortable.  If you include the breakfast option into your deal, you have the option of eating from their buffet or ordering from their menu.  The hotel was in a great spot that made it less than 10 minutes to walk to anything we wanted to see/do (if you like eating at pubs, we strongly recommend going to the Harry Lemon down the street!).  A few things we felt ""eh"" about: the quality of concierge wasn't that great, we never received our pillows we requested from their pillow menu (you read that right- pillow menu!), and the cleaning service was a little pushy with their services.  Overall, we had a good stay.",4,2016,08,11
236,Disappointment!,"I had often viewed this hotel and thought it would nice to try? Firstly I was surprised by its position on the street looking onto a carpark but as it was city center I thought so be it.I was welcomed and given my room. Never have I been in such a small room.....for sure the box room or I even felt I was in the servants quarters. The room was clean, not uncomfortable but too tiny, luckily I was staying one night only. It was very pricey but no wonder the reception asked if I would like to up grade ....at my own expense.
I certainly won't be back.",3,2016,08,11
236,"Good location ,good city hotel.","Good hotel with exceptional location ! 
Right in the city centre ,exceptional for tours ,shopping and exploring the city.
Helpful staff ,good service ,rooms ,breakfast etc.
Would reccommend for city break.",4,2016,08,08
236,Walkable Location - Comfortable Room,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel in early March 2016. This was our first time in Dublin, so we stressed a little bit too much about where we were staying. This location ended up being perfect. It was a relatively short taxi from the airport. We were able to walk to many places in the city. 

Instead of booking online we called and requested early check in, which we were able to get. It was nice to get a nap in right after we landed. The beds were great. Really comfortable. Nice bathroom, shower drained well. 

We ordered room service breakfast the first morning, and it was ok - to be honest not a huge fan of Irish breakfasts, so just not my favorite, but no fault of hotel. The breakfast in the restaurant was very good and many more options than just traditional Irish breakfast. 

Overall great stay at very reasonable rate.",5,2016,08,07
236,Better than expected!,"Admittedly, I am a hotel snob. I was a little worried. I wasted my time worrying---it was great. Desk attendances, dining staff and concierge were all extremely nice and helpful. Room was clean and spacious. Nice comfy feel. The shower pressure was awesome once I figured it out. We had breakfast as a part of our stay and it did not disappoint.",5,2016,08,05
236,Lovely place to stay,"Well located, with an incredibly friendly and helpful staff, any traveler will be pleased to spend time at The Brooks. Rooms were well appointed, with lots of room to store clothing and other items. Buffet and hot item Breakfast was included-fruit wa stress, and choice pastries and breads more than sufficient. Stay away from the porridge as it is not the oatmeal we thought would arrive. Cappuccinos and other drinks were made straightaway. Collin, the combination doorman and concierge, was delightful and very helpful. How he remembered everyone's name is a mystery. Our room had both shower and tub, but the shower stall reminded us of the shower on a cruise ship,",4,2016,08,03
236,Short stay to see Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre,"Location fantastic for theatre visit.  We don't normally stay in city centres but the room was quiet at night so sleep was very good.  Staff were very attentive and friendly, could not do enough to assist with information on the area including advice on where to eat.
Lovely spread at breakfast.",4,2016,08,03
236,Coffee in Brooks,"Called into to Brooks Hotel for coffee yesterday. This whole area has become very trendy and Brooks Hotel  probably gave the area a lift when it opened.
The reception area and seating is large with plenty of comfortable couches.

We had coffee in the bar/lounge area, again very comfortable. Service was prompt and friendly and the coffee was excellence. It a nice spot for a coffee and a chat. They were busy which is a good sign.",4,2016,08,02
236,"10 days at the Brooks Hotel, just wonderful","We had to be in Dublin for a long stay and wanted a hotel to be comfortable and home like. The Brooks was that and more. Our room on the 6th floor was pretty and comfy, with nice plants and tasteful art work. Lovely staff on every level. Breakfast could be very healthy if you chose (after a while a full Irish or deouxe breakfast gets old!) plus lots of goodies. Not all Irish hotels give you massive bowls of fresh fruit, smoked salmon, and cooked to order everything. The downstairs resident lounge has comfortable sofas, lots of books to borrow. The location is on a small street that was very close to almost every site. Also, although we had thought a hotel on St Steohens Green would be nice, there is massive construction going on in the city center for a new streetcar line, so you aren't overlooking the park, you are overlooking construction! Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,02
236,Enjoyed our stay!,"The rooms were clean and modern. All of the staff was outstanding. The front desk and the porters were great with advice and directions. The hotel cannot be in a better spot. It is centrally located to restaurants, shopping, parks, pubs, and most of the historical attractions of Dublin. ",5,2016,08,02
236,"Ideal location, great room and friendly service","Stayed two nights in July for business and found a special for the Brooks hotel on TripAdvisor, which I used to book the room.  The room was excellent, quiet and comfortable - perfect to work from and not too cramped like many hotels tend to be when you see you've booked at a special price. The location is perfect - steps away from pretty much all the major sights and in a very nice neighborhood full of cafes, shops and restaurants.  Just across the street is a great coffee place with delicious freshly baked scones and down Drury street to the right is the restaurant and bar in the Drury building - an excellent place for a drink or meal. Very helpful staff and efficient service.  I will recommend to others at the office and look forward to staying again on future trips.",5,2016,08,02
236,"Fantastic location, fantastic staff..  Couldn't fault it","I took my husband here for  a birthday treat and I have to say it was fantastic,  I could not fault any of it,  the staff are so lovely, the food  was delicious and the rooms tasteful  and comfortable,  I would highly recommend it and will be going back next year....",5,2016,08,01
236,"Friendly, comfortable hotel","We originally booked the Gresham Hotel, but changed our hotel a week before we were due to stay in Dublin and we are glad we did.  

The brooks was slightly more expensive and breakfast wasn't included, but we liked this hotel and found the staff to be friendly, the rooms were of a good standard, modern and comfortable.  It's location was close to numberous restaurants, pubs, cafes and one of the main shopping areas.  We were in the middle of a lot of tourists areas, but the hotel was still quiet and we didn't have trouble with noise from outside the hotel.  

Lastly we arrived late and the hotel had arranged for our bed to be turned down and they left us a celebration dessert in our room as it was my birthday. 

We would book to stay at the brooks again and highly recommend it.",5,2016,08,01
236,Overnight stay before touring Ireland,"Nice place, very nice staff. Our room was pretty small, but nice. Breakfast was great and the location is excellent. Nothing over the top about the hotel but really a nice place to stay. Great restaurant right across the street and the Temple bar area is under a 10 minute walk.",4,2016,07,30
236,A great central hotel ,"The hotel is centrally located in Dublin in an area full or restaurants and vintage stores and of course pubs.   A few minutes walk from the river Liffey and Temple Bar and a few minutes from the main shopping areas.  The communal areas are smart and clean.  Our room however although lovely and clean had a definite smell of stale cigarette smoke that permeated everything. 

The hotel breakfast was good value and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. ",4,2016,07,29
236,"Great location, good service and comfortable room.","Received a very friendly welcome when we arrived at the hotel and throughout are stay the staff were very helpful.  The room was perfect with everything we needed to make it a very comfortable stay.  Breakfasts were outstanding with cereals, pastries, meats, fruit to choose from as well as a substantial choice of cooked breakfast.  The dining area was spacious and relaxing.  The location was excellent.  We were a 5 minute walk from Temple Bar and were also very close to Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green and Trinity college .. all good places to visit.  The Brazen head (oldest pub in Dublin) is only a 15 minute walk away and worth a visit as it is so quaint.  On Sunday there is always live music.  The Chester Beatty library is is also nearby and has an excellent collection of very old manuscripts which we found quite extraordinary and fascinating  ... it's also free to visit!  Fallon and Byrne just around the corner from the hotel is a great food hall,  and wine cellar which is also great to see ... the list goes on!! If we stayed in Dublin again we would certainly stay here as it is so central and yet when inside it is very quiet.",5,2016,07,26
236,Great hotel in a prime location,"We had a wonderful stay at the Brooks Hotel. Our room was very comfortable, they even have a pillow menu. Breakfast was delicious. Located in the heart of Dublin, it was very easy to walk through the city and find your way home from the pubs.",5,2016,07,25
236,Great stay in Dublin,"This is a great 4 star hotel in the middle of the city and is very quiet, even the front rooms that are above Drury Street.  We stayed in Room 404 and it was a classic room but a bit small. The bathroom is tiny with no fan.  But this was our only complaint. Great location to other sites and restaurants.  Small coffee shop across street near parking garage is terrific!  Our plan included breakfast which was great; the dinner at the restaurant was only fair; lots of better places to eat in the vicinity.",4,2016,07,24
236,3rd time as good as ever,3rd stay at brooks as good as usual .. always try  to stay here home from home.. as ever well done brooks.. 20 euros from Dublin port by taxi your in a city centre hotel nice food great bar. and the hairy lemon pub next door .all bases coverd.,5,2016,07,24
236,Best in the (Temple) Bar area!,"My partner and I and our friends stayed one night here in a deluxe room the second week of November 2015. The traditionally-styled room was spacious and well-appointed and featured a sitting area with upholstered armchair's and a table. The bedding and upholstery was in great condition and mattress was very comfortable. The bathroom was modern with a nice soaking tub. The water pressure was amazing for sours and filling up the bath quickly!The complementary toiletries we're quite amazing as well. The hotel seems to be situated on a fairly quiet Street however there was a bar across that was closed and even if it had been open and people were swarming on the outdoor patio of the bar I think it still would have been quite quiet in the hotel.I did not hear other guests in the hallways or above me if there were any and slept like a baby. The hotel's location is absolutely superb in the Temple Bar area. Staying here you are near Dublin Castle, Trinity College and within walking distance to a plethora of bars and restaurants. We found the Hairy Lemon, a bar within a five minute walk, which was so much fun which made to stay here so much better. We are definitely going to return to Brooks Hotel on our next visit. Oh and by the way, the food in the on-site restaurant was fabulous for breakfast. We had several options to choose from off of the menu and there was a buffet which had some Continental breakfast items on it. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone. Can't say enough good things.",5,2016,07,22
236,You won't be disappointed,"From the moment we first arrived, we were treated with a smiling front desk staff, who seem to really love their job, and had genuine concern to be sure our stay in Dublin was a wonderful one. Everything about this hotel was spot on. The location is perfect. Walking distance to shops, pubs, Temple Bar, Tour bus, etc. The interior is well appointed, immaculate and inviting. The rooms are small, but comfortable. I purchased the Breakfast package, which was fabulous as an array of fresh breads, cheeses, yogurt, fruit, cereals, was abundant. A hot breakfast could also be ordered and customized. The staff were all very friendly and helpful with any questions or recommendations we asked about. There is also a nice bar as well. I will be back in Dublin next year and have no need to look for another place, as The Brooks exceeded my expectations.",5,2016,07,21
236,Great Dublin Hotel,"I love this hotel - so friendly with a great atmosphere, right in the heart of Dublin. Lovely bar serving snacks, drinks and food all day! Didn't get to have dinner here but breakfast was great; freshly cooked to order if that's what you want. Very comfortable room.",5,2016,07,21
236,Adequate,"After an amazing 10 day trip in Ireland, we decided to spend the last night in Dublin.  The Brooks hotel was a blemish on an otherwise wonderful vacation. First the parking - we had a car full of luggage pull up to the hotel after driving the entire length of Ireland that morning- no on site parking and no valet. There is a garage across the street - lucky me. However, it's closed on a Sunday morning - so you can't drive out if you have a flight to catch the next day - unless you want to pay an extra 40 euros. So I unloaded the luggage down the garage into the hotel. Fine. I'll move the car later. it's about 12:45pm at this time. Reservation says room ready at 1 pm. Ask for rooms and the receptionist tells me the ""guaranteed"" time is 3, so of course it's not ready. So, we were granted access to a room where people can sit when their rooms aren't ready. It was actually nice enough. Children played chess. That grants them on star. The location in the center of town grants another. Otherwise, everything afterwards was adequate - nothing more. The cold receptionist told me when I arrived that despite my rooms not being ready and connecting rooms not being available, I had been upgraded. Lucky me. Apparently the upgrade includes a bottle of water and a view of a parking garage. I doubt it was the sink that wouldn't drain, the room that smelled of harsh chemical cleaner, or the surgical tape repaired tv remote control. (This may seem excessive, but I'll post a photo) Early the next morning, the parking garage began a very noisy process of unloading the septic tank, or something to that effect. No sleep. Luckily I booked rooms that included breakfast. Never mind, breakfast starts at 8 on Sunday. Gotta catch a flight. No coffee. Oh wait, they were nice enough to open the breakfast doors at 7:30, so my family ate some bread while I trekked across town to get the car and load the luggage, The staff was not at all representative of the friendly people of Ireland. To her credit, she did ask how my stay was. I told her it was just OK. Apparently that was good enough for her. 

I recall a high rating of this property; I honestly cannot understand anything above a two. I guess it's OK for a Best Western or a Holiday Inn, but they are usually friendlier and cleaner. The hotel has beds, true enough. And walls. The location is ideal. But unfortunately this stay was the only negative experience on an otherwise great holiday. I absolutely do not recommend this property to anyone.",2,2016,07,18
236,Connor is the best!!,So loved returning to Ireland for the second year in a row!!  Connor was there to welcome us yet again!  The hotel is great. It's within walking distance to sights as well as the local bus!  It's always a great start to our touring of Ireland!  We recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,07,17
236,Classic Property in Prime Location,"We received the most professional service, particularly at the reception desk, but also at the lobby bar. There is an additional cozy, quiet sitting room available to guests on the lower level. The location is perfect for walking to Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Grafton St, St Stephen's Green & Merrion Sq. 
The compact room was immaculate & tastefuully furnished, including a room safe.
Highly recommend this property and wouldn't hesitate to stay again as the experience is well worth the cost.",5,2016,07,16
236,A bit disappointing,"This purpose built hotel is about 12 years old and has an excellent location in the heart of the shopping and restaurant venues in central Dublin. 
The staff are wonderful - Connor at the concierge desk cannot do enough for you and will take whatever time necessary to make sure you are oriented and taken care of. The front desk staff are terrific as well. 
The lobby and dining area is great, and there is Residents Lounge on the lower level that is reminiscent of an exclusive gentleman's club. Beautifully outfitted with overstuffed chairs and couches, arranged in conversation nooks, it is a lovely (and mostly unused) oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin itself.
However, the rooms are very uninspired and not terribly roomy. The bathrooms are adequate , but again nothing of note. Once you are in your room, you could be in any mid-range hotel in the city. 
In the evening, a knock at the door suggested that the turn-down service had arrived to freshen the room. Instead, gentlemen handed me two small, wrapped mint chocolates and bid us a good evening. Why bother? 
Next time, I'll look for some alternatives.",3,2016,07,16
236,Great location!,I had originally made a reservation at a different hotel and then cancelled it in favor of the Brooks.  I'm so happy that I did!  The location was the best part of the hotel and then the staff was #2.  What a great place... highly recommended!  The only reason that it got a 4 vs. a 5 is because it's just a bit dated.  But nothing major stopping us from staying there again in the future!,4,2016,07,16
236,Nice stay in Dublin,This is an older upscale hotel option in Dublin with a friendly helpful staff. Conner is the ultimate concierge with a genuine Irish personality going out of his way to make sure your stay is memorable. He had great suggestions on places to go and excellent restaurants to dine close to the hotel. The rooms are small but comfortable. The bathroom has a combined bathtub and shower. There is a nice dining area with a wonderful breakfast to get your day started. I highly recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin. ,4,2016,07,15
236,Good High End Hotel in a Good Location,"My wife and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for two nights upon our arrival in Dublin from the U.S.  It is a very nice high end hotel.  Maybe not as fancy as some other properties, but certainly up there.  The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable.  The staff is helpful and the location is convenient to the center of Dublin (for instance, Trinity College), only a ten minute walk away.
The hotel has a restaurant we visited for dinner on our first night.  Wide selection, good food, great service and reasonable prices for a hotel. That same restaurant serves breakfast.  For 12.50 euro you can get the buffet with an option for omelets.  If you want to go elsewhere, close to the hotel in the morning, there is a café across the street and a Starbucks virtually next door.
I would recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,15
236,Great location in Dublin,"Brooks hotel was conveniently located to many of the sites I wanted to see on my 2 day stay in Dublin. Very comfortable rooms with the amenities one expects at this price. The staff was helpful and efficient. I didn't eat here as there were so many other options in nearby proximity. A lot of Americans here, but as one myself, I can't throw rocks. ",5,2016,07,14
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin Ireland ,"Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for three nights and found it to be delightful.  Centrally located, reasonably priced, and good food.  The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly.  It's proximity to the center of the city, tourist attractions, and transportation made for a very nice vacation. Would definitely stay there again given the chance.
",5,2016,07,12
236,"Great Hotel, Excellent Staff, Right Location","We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for several nights before boarding the Shannon Princess for a barge cruise on the River Shannon.  Our group of three couples couldn't have been more satisfied...Excellence by everyone on the staff - especially Berry at the front desk, Connor at Concierge and Jacek tending a well-stocked bar. Spacious rooms and  wonderful Irish breakfast with lots of options each morning.  The hotel is within walking distance to many of the ""must see"" places everyone should visit: Trinity College (and Book of Kells), Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street shopping and the National Archeological Museum. The Harry Lemon Pub, a few doors away, also recommended for food, drink and fun.  Several other options also nearby for fine dining, ""pub grub"", drinks and music.  Overall wonderful experience, highly recommended",5,2016,07,12
236,A memorable stay with fantastic service! ,"I stayed at Brooks hotel the night before my wedding with my bridesmaids and on my wedding night with my husband! It was a perfect location as we were having a city wedding.  All the staff at Brooks went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special- lovely treats in our room on arrival, organising our room to be cleaned early on the wedding morning so that our photos would look nice and moving cases and dresses etc between the two rooms without hesitation. Nothing was too much trouble! We got a lovely surprise then when myself and my husband were upgraded to the presidential suite! They had more treats laid out for us and petals on the etc. Really thoughtful touches! The rooms themselves were gorgeous and the hotel was maintained beautifully. I would have no hesitation in recommending a stay here. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay as enjoyable as possible and deserve a huge amount of credit. ",5,2016,07,12
236,Great hotel in a great location,We stayed here last weekend for my wife's birthday with all our family and were very impressed with the hotel and it's very welcoming staff. The two nights we were there were very relaxing and the meals we had and the service was to a very high standard. Also the location was superb being only a 10 minute stroll to Grafton Street. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,07,10
236,Great location in Dublin,"We stayed here for three nights. Hotel was lovely, you cannot beat this location.  You can walk to all sites in Dublin, a lovely 10 minute walk to Trinity College, museum.  On the way you will hear some of the best music you can imagine.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,09
236,Spacious rooms,"Well located within walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants. The room is spacious and staff friendly. I would stay here again. If you have a car you need to park a short walk away but you get a discount on parking.",4,2016,07,09
236,Super Helpful Staff in Very Convenient Location,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 3 nights and walked to most of the sights (Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, Grafton Street), which were just blocks from the Brooks Hotel.  It is incredibly convenient, and on a relatively quiet street with the advantages of some local markets and good pubs just around the corner.  The hotel has a relatively small lobby (which gets crowded during check-in and check-out times), but there is a residence lobby in the basement which is usually fairly open.  

We arrived early (around 9 a.m.) and they gladly held our bags and directed us to the residence lobby to relax and freshen-up.  Unfortunately, one of our bags didn't arrive, and they were more than helpful in keeping an eye out for it.  Indeed, when it arrived the next day we found it in our room.  Over and over, the staff were accommodating without being asked.  

The breakfast was excellent, and while they did have a menu with a number of items, they did allow for some substitutions.  Again, very accommodating.  

The rooms are a bit small and outdated.  The bathroom in particular is small and needed some updating.  (This is the main reason I've given it a 4 rather than a 5 rating.)  However, I would gladly stay again because of the convenience and the staff.",4,2016,07,09
236,Wonderful stay!,"Great location within walking distance of numerous pubs, restaurants, Trinity College (and The Book of Kells), the National Archeological Museum, National Art Museum, shopping, and many other notable places to visit!  The staff at the hotel are warm, friendly, really helpful, and personable, as well as personal!  Breakfast is more than ample, whether guests opt for continental (the largest selection of any I've ever experienced) or full breakfast.  We stayed there twice during our trip to Ireland since we had such a great experience the first time we stayed.  It's a bit pricey, but within reason compared to other hotels of this caliber.  Rooms are lovely and amenities are nice!",5,2016,07,08
236,Great trip! Amazing customer service! ,"What a welcome! Gorgeous room, treats on arrival, lovely hotel and facilities. Very nice touches throughout- pillow choices, breakfast served fresh on the hot buffet! Personal touches and stunning decor, comfy beds and hotel seem very willing to help- organise dinner reservations, airport taxis etc! Also Perfectly located! ",5,2016,07,08
236,Great place and fantastic location! ,"Some friends and I visited Dublin and the Brooks Hotel for 2 nights at the end of June. When we went to check in we were missing one of our rooms but with a quick call and brief wait we were able to get another room. The front desk staff was very polite and accommodating and  put my worries at ease. The rooms were very nice with all 3 of our rooms having something a little different in each. The toiletries provided were wonderful especially the bath salts after a long plane ride and a day walking around Dublin.  The location was perfect to walk to all of the tourist locations and had wonderful pubs and restaurants around the area. Overall it was a great hotel with wonderful, friendly staff in a perfect location. ",5,2016,07,06
236,Very Enjoyable. And Jet Lag Friendly,"We stayed for two nights at Brooks Hotel at the end of  June 2016 and were impressed with staff and overall quality of the hotel.  We were able to check in early( received an email asking if we wanted to), played some chess in the residents lounge, and had dinner in the onsite restaurant. All of these offerings helped us in dealing with jet lag from the US.  Barbara at the main desk was very helpful providing guidance and suggestions to our questions.  Other staff were helpful also. The Brooks is a bit pricier than some hotels but we found the location and quality of customer service worth the premium.",5,2016,07,05
236,"Central location, pristine rooms","We loved this hotel as our last stop on our tour of the UK and Dublin. Our room was well appointed and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The lobby was divine and made for a nice resting place as a midday pitstop or for a late-night cocktail. The hotel employees were so nice, and offered many helpful recommendations.

The location was unbeatable. It is walkable to every part of Dublin (even Guinness if you are reasonably fit). Bonus: It is very close to a fabulous pub, O'Neill's. We ended up there two nights in a row, and it is about 50/50 locals/tourists. On our second night, an elderly Irish couple sat down next to us, and we had an amazing three-hour conversation consisting of travel, history and politics. We still wish we had exchanged information as it was one of the most profound experiences of our lives. 

Having veered off on a tangent, I'll just end with kudos to Brooks Hotel for being a fabulous base for our Dublin vacation.",5,2016,07,04
236,Two nights in Dublin!,The Brooks Hotel was a great central location for our two nights in Dublin. The room was very comfortable. The hotel has a restaurant that had a terrific breakfast buffet and a cozy bar to enjoy an afternoon drink. The hotel was close to the Temple Bar area which offered a large selection of pubs and restaurants from which to choose. It was close to the hop on-hop off bus to tour the capital.,4,2016,07,04
236,Hotel with a heart ❤️,"We arrived in Dublin Ireland At 4:45AM unfortunately our luggage didn't arrive with us. Brooks Hotel front desk (Ashley) went out of his way to help us retrieve our luggage as quickly as possible. Since the hotel was totally booked from the night before and it was only 5:30AM there wasn't a room available for us or the couple we were traveling with. We were escorted to a library filled with comfy couches and chairs to relax and were brought a pot of tea after a long night of traveling. The first two rooms available were immediately cleaned, we freshened up had a delicious breakfast in the hotel and were on our way exploring Dublin. Later that afternoon our luggage arrived and it was placed in our rooms.  The entire staff went out of their way to help us with restaurants, directions and touring suggestions. If you are in Dublin Brooks Hotel is #1 in my book!  ",5,2016,07,03
236,Great Location + Great Service,"We don't often book through a Travel Agent, but we did use one to help us book our hotel for our first night in Dublin. We arrived on a 7:00am flight from Vancouver, Canada - and wanted something night, comfortable and fairly easy to get to. We took the direct bus right to downtown Dublin, and using the directions on their website, found the hotel very easily. Lovely hotel, and perfect location. They stored our bags for us until our room was ready, and provided us with some great restaurant options within walking distance. I fell in love with the location surrounding the hotel, the unique shops, great cafes and walking distance to the Temple Bar location (but still far enough away so it didn't feel like a party). 

We loved it so much we tried to book for the night before our flight out as well, but they were all booked up. Don't hesitate, just book it. If you can get a breakfast included deal, I highly recommend it!",5,2016,07,02
236,"Stop looking, pick this one","If they have availability, just book it.  I did lots of research for the 3 couples (me & hubby included) who stayed here.  Location was perfect - right in the middle of everything, but not near the noise.  Uber friendly and helpful staff (as many others have noted).  Lovely, Comfy rooms with all the amenities.  Nice bar downstairs for a nightcap.",5,2016,06,29
236,Outstanding classic hotel in central Dublin,"This is a lovely building with  many historic details, but modern quiet rooms with air conditioning and every convenience.  The staff was pleasant, friendly, and helpful.  The location could not be any better, right in the middle of the historic district and easy waling to any attraction.   Would stay here again any time, a truly enjoyable stay.",5,2016,06,28
236,Lovely.  Perfect Location!,"First trip to Dublin and choose Brooks after looking at Trip Advisor reviews.  Lovely hotel with a beautiful room (all marble bathroom), hotel staff more than helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions and the location can not be beat.  Within walking distance of all the major attractions, plus restaurants and shopping.",5,2016,06,28
236,Excellent location and accommodations,"My husband and I stayed here 2 nights. It was very comfortable. The room was quite spacious for our very large bags. The bathroom was nice with excellent water pressure, but the shower/tub was particular small and with the high water pressure, we seemed to get water everywhere (something we don’t have happen at other places). Luckily, there were plenty of towels to mop up our mess. We had a very early departure and the hotel staff arranged for a taxi for us the night before. The breakfast buffet was excellent.",5,2016,06,28
236,Beautiful beginning,"Location, location, location!  Very centrally located to sight seeing in Dublin, Very attentive service the moment you walk through the door. Rooms are spacious and clean. If you need something extra, your wish is their command.  Lovely breakfasts each morning. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2016,06,28
236,Loved the Hotel,"Loved this hotel, we spent one night before our 10 day  trip started and it was wonderful. Could have stayed days with the location, food, clean rooms and friendliness of staff. Everyone was so helpful, the breakfast wonderful and the presentation was beautiful. Rooms large.  A nice hotel with a quaint little hotel feel. Our every need was taken care of, so the perfect start to a wonderful trip. We felt the price was fair.",5,2016,06,27
236,Perfect Ending,"Spent our last night in Ireland at the Brooks Hotel, convenient to the Temple Bar area and Grafton Street too. Lovely room with very comfortable bed and surroundings. Delicious breakfast in a dining area looking out on the streets of bustling Dublin. Short car ride to the airport and a perfect last stop before heading home.",5,2016,06,27
236,Perfect ! ,"The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing in Dublin, it's nice to return to after a day out and is then ideal for going out in the evening for a drink and dinner. We had a classic room on 5th floor overlooking the entrance and we didn't find it noisy at all - although we didn't open the window at night- the hotel is far enough away from the busy restaurants in my view- breakfast is wonderful and that is down to the chefs as the table service can be hit an miss - on our 1st morning we were looked after very well but on the second and third morning we had to ask several times for service- I also agree you have to ask several times for toast- however we loved the food and always looked forward to having breakfast as the quality was wonderful !- reception staff very friendly as was the concierge and the bar staff - with very reasonably priced drinks- this was my second stay at Brooks and when we visit again I can't think of a better place to stay .",4,2016,06,26
236,A very nice place to end our Ireland experience,"We recently spent 11 days in Ireland, flying into Dublin but immediately leaving for the southeast coast before making it back around to the big city for our last two days.

We left Galway around 11am, and had to drop our car off at Hertz as well.  We thought that we might drop our bags off at the hotel, and called them in advance but they advised us that it would make more sense to drop the car off and take a cab back to the hotel.  Very good advice.  First off, the GPS really struggled with locating the hotel.  I do not know why, but Dublin is a bit unique and this was much easier to find on foot.  Second, they don't really have an area to drop off luggage conveniently and you actually would have to park your car down the street.  So if you are in a similar situation as us, get rid of the car at a city hertz location (there were several, we chose south circular) and get a cab to Brooks.

Once we arrived, we noticed how splendid this place is, and how beautiful a lobby they have.  The staff are attentive and we explained that we wanted a quiet room (not always easy as we found out in Dublin centre) which they did their best to accommodate us with.  Our first room was great, but not to my wife's liking as their was already a fair amount of noise) so we ended up moving to an even nicer room on the 4th floor.  They did not charge us for the upgrade, which was very nice.  We did appreciate the location of this room as we saw two other parties with rooms on the other side of the hallway asking to switch, which I saw happened the next morning.

Brooks is in a great location, and we walked a large part of the city/shopping districts, pubs/docks and business, where I saw where my firms 5 story building was located.  

Breakfast was good, not great.  I'm not sure if after 11 days we were burned out on full irish breakfast's, but this was slightly below the quality of the other places we stayed at.

The other negative was that for 1 day the wifi on our floor didn't work most of the time.  We reported it, and the staff stopped up and were very empathetic but sadly it took until later the next day for it to work.  So many of us were in the lobby trying to get directions or check email that quite frankly it was an exercise in futility.  But once it got fixed we had no issues at all.

I would definitely recommend Brooks.  I can't compare it to other Dublin hotels, but it worked for us.",4,2016,06,25
236,Excellent Boutique Hotel with Exceptional Staff,"Dublin is expensive. But if you have to spend hundreds of euros per night on a room, spend it at the Brooks Hotel. Centrally located within walking distance of most major attractions. The staff are superb. The meals are excellent, and it's a nice touch to offer your guests a choice of pillows for the night. Our room was a little tight, but tastefully furnished with a lot of light. The only miscue was the shower that ran hot and cold at intervals, which I wouldn't expect from a hotel of this caliber. But if we ever pass through Dublin again, the Brooks Hotel would be our accommodation of choice.",5,2016,06,25
236,Birthday surprise,"Hotel was first class. Staff were excellent. We had the most wonderful bedroom with a balcony and all the amenities you could possibly wish for.
However we have only given  4 stars as on the first night we ate in their restaurant having asked if we needed to book, the answer was no, and we enjoyed our meal, however it would have been helpful to have been told at the time that if we wanted to eat the following night we would be unable to do so as a large group were booked in and that it was essential to make a reservation elsewhere as it was Ireland v Italy (football) and everywhere would be completely full. We tried to find somewhere that had a table free but with no luck so we ended up with nothing to eat that night and the bar and room service were also not doing food due to the hotel being so busy with the large group.
Apart from that we can thoroughly recommend this Hotel.",4,2016,06,25
236,Simply the Best Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"This is my second stay at the Brooks.  Like so many other reviewers, once you stay at the Brooks, you stay every time you come to Dublin.  Reason One: The most service-oriented staff I have ever encountered in hotels of all sizes.  If you need it or want, they deliver it--without fail, every time, and with graciousness.
Reason Two:  Location-The hotel itself is on a quiet side street (unlike most hotels which face noisy streets), but a 5-minute walk in any direction lands you in great shopping, dining and entertainment.
Reason Three: Consistency.  Every friend I have referred to the Brooks has reported the same experience as I have--they wish they could stay longer.
My only regret in making this review is that the more people that find out about the Brooks, the harder it will be for me to get a reservation on my next visit.
Selfish, but the Brooks it too good not to let the world know...",5,2016,06,25
236,Great hotel in great Dublin location!,"My husband and I  recently returned from our second visit to the Books Hotel in Dublin. We happened to stumble across this place on our own on our last visit  a few years ago and WOW! What a find!
The location is fantastic, the service excellent, the decor clean and handsome. It is priced less than several more better name known hotels in the area and offer special rates 
The Brooks is situated right off Town Centre, Grafton Street and Temple Bar area. You can walk tothose areas and more popular sights including (but not limited to)  Stephens Green, O'Connell Street,Trinity College. Grafton Street  Every amenity is available in the hotel and area. The hotel itself has a private library room on an  upper floor and  a lounge and restaurant on the ground floor. Right around the corner are pubs, shops of all sizes and pricing scales, salons, and lovely churches. What  neighborhood!
But perhaps what really makes this hotel is the staff. They are so pleasant and accommodating and understand the meaning of service. In particular, is Connor the door man, a very kind character who will charm you with his attention, Irish wit, helpfulness and cheerful manner, making you feel truly  at home in The Brooks and in his beloved Dublin. 
We highly recommend this establishment and look forward to returning to what we now consider our ""home"" hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,06,23
236,Boutique hotels felt like home.,"The staff was so welcoming that we knew we were going to love this small, perfectly located hotel in Dublin. Easy walking distance to everything: Grafton St., Temple Bar, Trinity College and Dame Street. A good sized room by European standards and a large well appointed bath. Breakfast buffet is great and we had a very nice dinner in the lovely restaurant one night as well. ",5,2016,06,22
236,"Great Location, Charming Hotel","Loved this Hotel...First Hotel on our arrival to Ireland.  A great beginning...The front desk was so helpful and Connor , The Bellman , although he seemed more than a Bellman was fun and helpful and set us in the right direction for dinner...Our room was lovely...We had the most wonderful travel person, Mary Boyle of Love Irish Tours who found this hotel for us among others...Our hotels were all perfect....",5,2016,06,22
236,Solid mid-range hotel,"The Brooks is a good choice for a friendly, well-run hotel in a central location.  

On the plus side:
*Friendly, accommodating staff.
*Excellent breakfast - basically anything you want + goodies you want when you see them.
*Fairly good-sized rooms.
*Lovely, homey room on the ground floor where you are invited to rest if you arrive before your room is ready.  We were with a group one night and brought our drinks down there.
*Very comfortable bed.
*Excellent, free WiFi.

Less positive:
*Rooms are a bit dated.  Furniture is on the old side and is a bit quirky.
*Bathroom needs updating as well.  Water temperature in the shower vacillated every time it was used.

Overall, a fair price/value deal.",4,2016,06,22
236,Superb 50th Birthday Celebration,"Excellent accommodation, the best food especially breakfast, friendly helpful staff and right in the heart of Dublin. The hotel staff acknowledged my birthday and sent cookies and a cake to the room. Very clean and spacious bedroom with all mod-cons and facilities. Fantastic overall with a last mention by my wife of the scrumptious lemon drizzle cake at breakfast.",5,2016,06,22
236,close to perfect,"Perfect location. Lovely breakfast and spacious, spotlessly clean, attractive room. The bed was extremely comfortable and huge. Our room was in the back, so was quiet. We were upgraded and the room was spacious, with all amenities except for, and this was my companion's quibble, not enough electrical outlets. For those who have complained about the hairdryer in the bathroom, there is a better one in the desk drawer. We don't care about TVs but it did have a good flat screen one. Loads of restaurants within 5 minutes (or less) walk. Close to Trinity College, National Gallery, etc. we would definitely return if we return to Dublin, which we just might! There is a lot more to do and see if you look under the surface. HIghly recommend, excellent value for center city hotel.
",5,2016,06,21
236,Excellent Hotel & very good location.,"My wife and I stayed a total of 3 days at the Brooks Hotel, and enjoyed our stay very much.
The reception staff is outstanding and friendly.  The rooms are nice and updated.  The breakfast was really good.  If you walked away hungry it was your own fault.  Plenty of food options to choose from.  WiFi worked perfectly in our room.  We would definitely stay at the Brooks again.",5,2016,06,16
236,Luxury in the heart of Dublin!!,"We ended up at The Brooks after arriving at another hotel to find it in shambles.  The Brooks is a higher end hotel with nice amenities, very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms are large and spacious and so are the bathrooms.  They even give you a pillow menu and foot massager if requested, both complimentary.  The location could not of been better.  It is right next to the best shopping and also good for nightlife more popular with the locals, but an easy easy walk to Temple Bar area.  Nice restaurants in the vicinity as well.  After 9 days in Ireland traveling, our last two nights in Dublin staying here was a nice recharge before the flight home.  Breakfast included was a nice spread, but you need to pay more for anything hot.",5,2016,06,16
236,Excellent choice,"Perfect location , especially on a first visit to Dublin, right in the middle and at walking distance  of many points of interest ( st Patrick's cathedral, Trinity college, Temple bar...) of  famous pubs and restaurants . Very friendly and helpful desk staff. We had a comfortable room on the 6th floor, street view. On returning to Dublin a week later, we chose to stay at the Brooks Hotel again and were welcomed like old acquaintances. 
",4,2016,06,14
236,Great location near Temple Bar Area,"Based on the reviews I had read about the Brooks Hotel; I was somewhat disappointed.

The staff was excellent, very professional and went out of their way to be accommodating.

The lobby and hallways had the old world charm that I had expected, but

The rooms were very small and the furniture was dated but not in a good way. The shower stall was tiny and we are averaged sized individuals. 

We stayed at 5 different highly rated hotels (including another in Dubin) during our trip to Ireland and the Brooks was the most expensive. 

I would not recommend this hotel!",3,2016,06,13
236,The perfect hotel in the perfect location,"Quiet hotel in a great location. Walking distance to the main attractions in Dublin. Tons of restaurants and pubs in walking distance. Close to the action and nightlife without being in it. The staff were excellent, and addressed all our needs with a smile. We will absolutely stay here again",5,2016,06,13
236,Excellent Location,"We were on a group tour with Brendan so we were only here 1 night. I wish we could have stayed longer. Our room was very comfortable, and the location of this property could not be better. It is an easy walk to Trinity College and Grafton Street for the shopping. If your plans call for a stay in the center of town, this property is a winner.",5,2016,06,13
236,"Best service , best location","This was our 3rd visit to Dublin and I must say it was the best. Top service with very friendly efficient staff. There was a small issue (that i wont go into as the issue is not important) they resolved the issue in a very efficient and professional manner. Abell Rentals NZ totally recommend this hotel on price , location and friendly service. We'll be back ! Allan & Moira Scott Christchurch NZ",4,2016,06,12
236,Fantastic Irish Hospitality,Staff here are so friendly and welcoming and that makes a pleasant change. Ideal location for city centre. Breakfast is excellent and rooms are very comfortable. Great rates for parking at the car park directly opposite the hotel. Highly recommend to stay here for business or pleasure. ,4,2016,06,11
236,"Location Perfect, Rooms Comfy, Staff Helpful","We started our 10 day self tour of Ireland with this fantastic hotel.  Close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College and the Irish Tourism Board, however quiet for a good night's sleep.  (Pillow menu!).  Every thing you can possible need is close by: Pubs, variety of restaurants, small stores for water and refreshments and the hop on hop off bus which allowed us to go to Guinness Storehouse and St Patrick's at our own pace.

Breakfast a delight, continental and cooked to order, bath fully stocked, the staff welcoming and of course helpful Conner.  Need to go back to Dublin soon so I can stay at Brooks Hotel.",5,2016,06,09
236,"Clean, Friendly and Great Location!","The charm and warmth of an old world hotel with modern amenities. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our flight arrived at 8:00 in the morning and it was too early to check in but the hotel held our luggage while we went to get some breakfast and walk around Dublin taking advantage of the beautiful weather. We were given a key to use the bathroom facilities and relax in the lounge downstairs also if we wanted to freshen up or rest until the room was ready. The concierge, Connor, was helpful and friendly and answered all our questions cheerfully and made sure we had everything we needed suggesting tours and restaurants. The room and bathroom were spotless with comfortable beds and linens. There is a safe in room, toiletries and air conditioning (which you do not find in all hotels in Dublin). We were glad to have the ac because the room would otherwise have been stuffy and it was very humid weather. The location is perfect and central to walk to all the main attractions like Temple Bar, Trinity College, LIffey River, Famine Sculptures, Molly Malone Statute, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, St. Patrick's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Green, etc.. However, Kilmainham Goal and the Guinness Storehouse are too far of a walk but doable with public transportation. We stayed here for three nights and used it as a base to tour Dublin, a day tour bus to Glendalough and the Wicklow Mountains, and took the DART to Howth for lunch one afternoon. A very enjoyable stay in a nice mid sized hotel where you are not just a number but a treasured guest. Would not hesitate to stay again while in Dublin. Only problem we had was regulating the temperature on the sink faucet, it was a little loose and kept getting very hot.",5,2016,06,07
236,We loved this hotel!,"I brought my 18 yo son on a graduation trip to Ireland, Scotland and Wales all the way from Omaha Nebraska. We spent 6 days at the Brooks hotel and had a wonderful experience. The front desk, especially Liam and Eduard, could not have been more helpful. Connor and Marvin guided us to great restaurants and other sites and made sure we got to where we needed to be on time. The rooms were lovely and very clean. The breakfast was fantastic as was lunch room service: the smoked salmon and the seafood chowder are amazing. Everyone had a smile and was very accommodating. If I have the chance to return with my husband in the next few years we will definitely come back to The Brooks. Thanks so much from Maureen",5,2016,06,07
236,A Good Experience,"We were there at the beginning of December 2015 for a long weekend, the place is clean even if not so new and the rooms have every comfort required. The breakfast, both in the Irish and in the Continental version, is excellent. The people working in the hotel are very kind and helpful, a good stay.",4,2016,06,07
236,Quiet Comfort Near the Heart of Dublin,"The hotel's location on Drury Street is quiet but within short walking distance of Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Trinity College, and St. Stephen's Green. The hotel itself is quite comfortable and the staff accommodating. We arrived at 6:00 AM after an overnight flight and were given a room right away instead of afternoon, which we really appreciated.
The concierge Conner was wonderfully friendly and helpful, and the Jasmine Bar introduced me to Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey, for which I will be forever grateful!",5,2016,06,06
236,"Great location, great staff, quality dining","This is a really well-located hotel in a hip area of Dublin with lots of quirky shops and restaurants - and pubs, if you'd like. Not far from Temple Bar , but quiet. Good rooms, getting slightly tired. Very helpful staff. Their fine dining is great and breakfasts a good, too - I'd maybe skip room service, though. There's a nice lillte drawing room for guests and business support.",4,2016,06,05
236,Very nice hotel and excellent location!,"Stayed here for 2 nights recently and it could not have been better.  Very friendly staff (especially John the concierge), clean, nice rooms and excellent breakfast.  The location is fantastic!  We had a room on the backside and I suspect that is preferable and the rooms on the front face the street.  Not real busy so probably not such a big deal.  You will not be disappointed.  5 crawfish rating!",5,2016,06,03
236,"Patronizing, Rude and Dismissive Managers","I expected more from this establishment. Looks great from the outside, but the rooms are small. I asked the duty managers (different ones, especially since receptionist was busy and when I asked them didn't know the answer)) about details of certain local attractions, but got brushed off with remarks, such as: ""Well, you gonna have to look it up"". When I replied that this is a 4 star hotel, I was told: ""There's no point being smart!""
Enough said.",2,2016,06,02
236,"Excellent Hotel, Clean, Courteous, Best Shower Pressure","This was a great little hotel, very convenient location, wonderful staff.  Rooms were clean, though just a tad dated (which would be my only minor complaint--and some would even call them ""traditional"" or ""charming"" as opposed to dated, to be honest).  Bed was very comfortable and they give you a ""pillow menu"" so you can get exactly the kind of pillows you want (I just used whatever was already on the bed, which was lovely).  The staff was kind and helpful.  The amenity that really made it, for me anyway, was the shower pressure!  I have never had such an awesome, solid, shower experience while traveling.  I was truly impressed.  I would not choose to stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2016,06,02
236,What a lovely introduction to Ireland,"The hotel is quite centrally located with easy walk to shopping precincts and attractions. Lots of lovely places to eat or grab a drink.
The staff are warm and welcoming and happy to assist in any way.  Breakfast was a vast array of cold buffet selection or hot options cooked to order.
The room was well proportioned, tastefully decorated and well serviced.
 Concierge guys both a delight and very helpful, thankyou  ",5,2016,06,01
236,No complaints!,"I really loved this hotel!
Check in was quick and easy - room was ready an hour early (as per my request),
The room was front facing on the 6th floor. I was a little concerned that it might be noisy but it wasn't at all!  It was spotlessly clean with tea and coffee making facilities, plenty of space in the wardrobes, an air con unit, a nice bathroom and a window that opened for fresh air!
The breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice. Lots of homemade breads to try and food cooked to order if required.
The hotel is in a good location - just a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar - surrounded by lots of nice restaurants and bars.
Free wifi
Note: I found this hotel on Booking.com and then rang the hotel directly and got a better rate!",5,2016,06,01
236,Welcome to Dublin," From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we experienced nothing but friendly and efficient service from all the staff we encountered. We stayed 2 nights in an Executive room at the rear of the hotel. It was peaceful, comfortable and extremely well-appointed. We ate breakfast both mornings and the selection available from the buffet and hot choices was very substantial.
The entire hotel from staff, common areas and rooms  feels warm and inviting and certainly contributed to making our stay a memorable one.
",5,2016,06,01
236,Connor!,We arrived weary and exhausted after a long flight from US.  Our welcome was great and so helpful. We were able to get into our room straight away. Conor is amazing as a concierge. We needed some help and he loaned us what we needed. This helped us recover and begin to enjoy our trip. Conor's advice is trustworthy. ,4,2016,05,31
236,Nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed here for a concert last year, very good hotel. Check in and out were both quick and painless. The room wasn't the biggest but it was spotless and the bed was comfy. Only here for the one night and didn't bother with breakfast so cant comment.",4,2016,05,31
236,"great hotel, great location","This hotel is in the center of it all, the Temple Bar area.  If you have a car, park it and walk around.  Everywhere you go there are throngs of people eating, drinking and having a really good time. The hotel is lovely inside.  Large well appointed rooms. The staff was very helpful and the hotel is very well kept.  One thing, parking is very  expensive.  Ask the front desk for a discount voucher and the parking is cut in half. watch out for the ""mannequin"" in your room. Odd to see a form with no head, arms or legs, just a ""body"" from neck to  hips, staring at you.  We had to remove ours....it was creepy. The bathroom is also very nice with lots of amenities.  We enjoyed our included breakfast in a very nice restaurant. Very pleasant.  Glad we stayed there.",4,2016,05,30
236,REAL HOTEL FOR REAL PEOPLE ,"Stayed there a while ago must say 
Super staff  ....... Not to fussy but know there jobs ...  very professional 
With be too pushy ... Very relaxing stay .. Great bar for a night cap 
Try the hot ports. 
Well done to all involved 
Thanks again .... Will be back ",5,2016,05,26
236,Birthday Weekend Away,"My partner and I stayed here for one night on the May bank holiday weekend. We were upgraded which was great as we had requested it if available for my partners birthday. However, we were very disappointed with the standard of the hotel. The receptionist we had was lovely but never told us of the dinning times, breakfast, hotel facilites, etc. which left us clueless. I booked this hotel primarily on location as i was told the Guinness storehouse was only a short walking distance to find out it was over a 20 min walk which resulted in us having to get two taxi's. The standard of food in the restaurant was poor and my gourmet sausages were burnt. As with breakfast the next morning, it was poor quality and took 20 minutes to get our order even though the breakfast room was quiet. I was really looking forward to our stay from reading reviews but im afraid i wouldn't stay here again as it was a  special occasion that i should of enjoyed with my partner.",2,2016,05,25
236,Perfect stop for touring Dublin,"After a long flight this outstanding hotel was well worth the price.  Dreamy rooms in a quiet, well located spot in central Dublin (away from Temple Bar yet close enough to walk).  And excellent service.  Book early.....this place is memorable comfortable and wonderful staff.",5,2016,05,25
236,Great hotel!,Fantastic central location. Easy walking distance to everything in Dublin.  Car parking right across the street which is expensive during the week but cheap on the weekend. Less expensive parking is only a few blocks away. The entire hotel has been updated and the breakfast and staff were great. I can't imagine a better hotel for the price in Dublin. I would definitely stay here again.  ,5,2016,05,24
236,Comfortable and Welcoming!,Very welcoming and friendly staff.  Had a lovely room that was very clean and comfortable.  Wifi was free and very reliable.  Located within walking distance to many attractions.  A little noisy if you have a room facing the street since there are many pubs located near by and are open till late at night.  Would ask for a room in the back of the hotel if you would like a quiet room.  Offers a delicious breakfast!  Recommend The Hairy Lemon few doors down from Brooks Hotel for some traditional Irish dishes and pub atmosphere!  Would definitely book this hotel for future stays in Dublin.,4,2016,05,23
236,Great place,"Perfect for a first stop arriving in Dublin. Excellent staff who were friendly and helpful, professional and courteous, very clean and comfortable, perfect location. Would highly recommend. Everything was great and appreciated. We would return. ",5,2016,05,20
236,Incredible Comfort!,"This was our first hotel after arriving in Ireland and we couldn't have had a better experience.  It is centrally located, within walking distance to many attractions.  But, the best part is the absolute comfort of the entire property -- especially those fabulous Irish linens on the amazing beds.  Wow.  I've never slept so well in my life!

The rooms are average size, but have all the amenities needed.  Free Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.

There is a great pub next door called the Hairy Lemon -- well worth a stop to get the full story of the origin of the name (a bit of mallarkey, no doubt, but very funny!).  

I would definitely return to this hotel if I were to stay in Dublin again.",5,2016,05,18
236,Wonderfully Friendly Hotel,"Very friendly staff. We were greeted with a smile and ushered through registration with little fuss and then escorted by the concierge, with our baggage, up to a lovely room. We were given a lovely street view. However, if you want a quiet room, I would ask for a room in the back. The street atmosphere is ongoing until about 2:30 - 3:00 o'clock am. The breakfast was delicious and filling. The hotel is within walking distance of most of the historical sites as well as Grafton Street for shopping.",5,2016,05,18
236,"Clean, well appointed hotel in Great Location!",With only 2 days in Dublin our location was especially important so we could see as much as possible!  This was a great choice. Although not right on the bus routes it was a short walk to the hop on hop off and the airport shuttle.  We had lots of great restaurants and pubs nearby and even a great hairdresser right across the street!  The rooms were very clean and well appointed and the staff very helpful.  They were also quiet even though we faced onto a street; the double glazed glass really worked.  If this hotel is in your price range I wouldn't hesitate to book!,5,2016,05,18
236,Great hotel in prime location,Stayed here for one night as part of business trip. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Choice of pillows is a great touch to get a great nights sleep. Rooms impeccably decorated and very nice toiletries in bathroom. Good location and easy to get to. Not given 5 stars as didn't eat here due to Business plans so can't comment on food but will certainly be going back to use again. ,4,2016,05,17
236,Brooks Hotel,A small hotel in the center of Dublin within walking distance to Trinity Collage and the shopping areas.  The rooms are well appointed with modern bathrooms and amenities.  The breakfast has both cold and cooked to order hot foods.  The rooms to the back are very quiet with adequate space.  The staff is willing to try to accommodate guests needs.,5,2016,05,15
236,Friendly staff ,Very friendly and service-minded staff. The wi-fi connection in room 215 wasn't working. They tried to adjust the router but it didn't help. Other pros were the location and good breakfast and other cons were lukewarm water and leaking shower cabin.,3,2016,05,11
236,Pleasant stay in the city,"We spent two nights at Brooks while visiting Dublin friends.  The staff are courteous, the room pleasant and bathroom lovely, with great amenities.  Our only downside was that window looked onto parking garage wall and the street was a bit noisy. But the location is great,  walking distance from every place you might want to visit. ",4,2016,05,08
236,Fantastic location,"What the hotel lacks in modernity, it certainly makes up in location. This is a very reasonably priced hotel in a fantastic location. We would highly recommend it as a base to explore this great City. The pillow menu is inspired. Note that if you have a room facing the front of the hotel there will be some noise into the evening / night from revellers at local venues such as Fade St Social and the Drury Buildings. Breakfasts are fine but our scrambled eggs were very dry so possibly better sticking with the continental breakfast.",4,2016,05,08
236,Setting the standards .,"Stayed here for a few days with my family, to summarise .
This hotel is in an excellent location, with a spacious carpark opposite. Probably best to avoid driving here as the traffic as you would expect Is a nightmare .
The condition of the hotel is spotless and has so much character. We tried their cocktails , lunchtime food menu , everything was perfect. 
However the staff are the real winners & they can't do enough for you. So welcoming & friendly , a real proper welcoming . No issues checking in & our room was available.

My little  fella who is 23 months just couldn't stop running about the entire hotel, climbed everywhere , up & down the entire hotel, again the staff always charmed   & supported us all. 
The only negative was that there was only 1 high chair available , so please sort this out, it's a nightmare trying to feed a little one in a pram 

As the entire staff were just amazing,  from reception , breakfast staff & house keeping its only fair to keep this to a 5 star rating...
Thank you very much
",5,2016,05,06
236,A real pleasure,"We were in Dublin for our silver wedding and the staff at Brooks really helped make it a special event.  They could not have been more helpful and welcoming, the upgrade was welcome too.  Quality of accommodation and price were excellent for hotel in this class, location excellent for exploring Dublin but the staff were what set is a notch above.  Well done and thanks!",5,2016,05,06
236,Perfect location ,"We loved our stay at the Brooks Hotel! This hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin's city center and it made getting around the city a breeze--no need for the hop on/hop off bus here! The staff were friendly, the food was delicious, and the decor was perfect. Highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2016,05,06
236,Lovely Staff; Lovely Stay,"We could not have found a more welcoming, charming, and well-situated hotel for our first trip to Ireland.  After getting off our bus and dragging our suitcases in a late April sleet/hail storm, we were warmly greeted at the front desk by Ellen and Connor, the concierge.  Ellen was gracious and helpful on more than one occasion--arranging to store our bags until our room was ready and making suggestions on where to eat or drink.  When we asked Connor if he could recommend someplace close to get something warm to eat, he personally walked us out of the hotel, down the street, through the pub door, and all the way to a table at the Hairy Lemon.  Our room was clean and had all necessary conveniences.  The breakfasts were outstanding--my husband highly recommends the porridge with whiskey.  There's a warm and cozy lounge for guests downstairs; the wifi worked well in the lobby and in our room.  All downtown attractions were within a short walk.  All in all, an outstanding stay--we would certainly book another stay here!",5,2016,05,03
236,"Good location, comfy beds","The staff from check in to check out were wonderful--friendly and efficient. The Concierge was very personable and asked if we needed any help as we set off for the day.
We arrived late morning after a long flight and were pleased to have our room ready. One hot shower and a 7 hr 'nap' later and we were ready to take on Dublin!
Highly recommend dining at the Hairy Lemon down the street to the left of hotel about 20 steps for down home cooking and family friendly service.

The beds and linens at hotel are so comfy. The rooms were too hot for us but a quick turn off of thermostat fixed that. Showers were hot and toiletries very nice.

Hair dryer was a bit awkward as it was hard wired into the top dresser drawer so uncurling the cord took some effort ..warning it blows HOT.

Nice perk was the three styles of plug ins...EU, US and IE. Trouble was the US one didnt work for us but luckily I had adapters for the other two...conveniently located by the desk.

Included Breakfast downstairs was typical buffet continental style OR you could order from the menu for more choices. It got very busy at 8 am with only one table for 4 so it made our party of 8 impossible to eat together.
Free wifi with no password needed which was a nice perk too.

Nice quiet hotel well located close to Trinity College, Grafton Street .",4,2016,05,03
236,Great Location; Great Staff,"The hotel is in a very convenient location within walking distance to most things you would want to see, including St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle and many other beautiful sights.  Many pubs/restaurants for you to choose from.  Large cold breakfast buffet plus a small menu of hot breakfast options; you get to enjoy both. The staff is amazing, they do everything in their power to make your stay enjoyable.  Rooms were very basic, good styling, not great.  I would definitely stay here again because the hotel met all of my needs.",4,2016,05,03
236,""" Fantastic stay....Excellent staff""","If I could use only one word to describe the staff and service at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin it would be ""exceptional.""   We were amazed by how kind, friendly and helpful everyone was.  We walked in as strangers and after our six night stay we felt like we were leaving as friends.  Our first trip to Ireland was such an awesome experience and I attribute a lot of that positive feeling to how wonderful we were treated at the Brooks throughout our stay.

Our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed and nice amenities.  Our breakfast had a delightful choice of continental breakfast items as well as a cooked to order menu. The breakfast servers were always very pleasant and accommodating. It was nice to be greeted so warmly first thing in the morning.  

The central location of the Brooks is ideal for those who enjoy walking and exploring the sites of Dublin.  It is close to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street as well as surrounding pubs, restaurants, and shops.  

Thanks to everyone at the Brooks Hotel. You deserve the highest rating for your professionalism and superb customer service.",5,2016,05,02
236,"Nice location, above average place","Brooks Hotel is well located and quite acceptable for a short visit to Dublin. My room was loud from some type of air system. the lobby is quite low key and the desk people were fantastic. Not as fancy as the Shelburne or Westbury, but not as expensive either.",4,2016,05,01
236,Irish Charm!,"Planning our stay in Ireland was all done online. Being members of SLH we then read a few reviews, previewed location and the proximity to what we like to see and do.  It was perfect!  The staff are all amazingly accomodating, rooms are more than adequate and location to all major sites could not have been better.  We will definitely stay here again!

Thank you all!",5,2016,05,01
236,Great city centre Boutique hotel,"Really enjoyed our 3 nights at Brooks. Stayed for an Anniversary visit to the city. In a quiet street but close to shops, restaurants and bars. Received room upgrade which was very nice. The hotel was very smart with nice reception and very helpful staff. Room was lovely and spacious. Bar produced some nice cocktails for us. Helpful advice for places to visit and recommended restaurants. Had breakfast once in room and twice in dining room, there is a buffet continental but good choice of hot dishes. All our choices very good. Would definately return here on our next visit to Dublin",5,2016,04,30
236,This place is a real gem,"I really enjoyed this boutique hotel. Great location. Nice lobby, rooms, terrific service. Everything about the stay was perfect. Would definitely stay here again when in Dublin. Also had a light dinner one night there. Nice set-up because there are different rooms you can be in whether you just want to be in bar, more of a restaurant feel, or more in open where you can bring your laptop and get some work done.",5,2016,04,28
236,Excellent hotel in a fantastic neighborhood!,This hotel is really close to many attractions of Dublin and in the middle of lots of shops. Nevertheless it is very quiet in the night. I still am overwhelmed by the friendly staff and their kindness - something you would never get in my home country. I just stayed a few days here but felt at home immediately.,5,2016,04,28
236," Central boutique hotel ","Very central hotel. 
Business hotel. 
Located near St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Hotel is near fade street and Georges Street which has many restaurants.  
Has restaurant and private cinema.
Hotel has a bar.  
Boutique hotel with emphasis as a business hotel.

",4,2016,04,28
236,Brooks hotel Dublin,"Great hotel. Great location. Staff is wonderful , helpful, and friendly. Bartender was fun and attentive. They let you pick your pillow from a pillow menu each day and offer complimentary foot spas delivered to your room upon returning from a day of touring the city. Several good restaurants and pubs in easy walking distance. Also close to several tourist spots.",5,2016,04,27
236,"Solid, high quality hotel with good beds and breakfast","I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for a conference, and upon checking in was upgraded to a bigger room (thanks!). The room was spacious, comfortable, very quiet, with a superb bed. Only downside was the view from the window on the first floor on an airconditioning installation.

Service was friendly and fast, and the breakfast really nice in a comfortable space. The hotel is well located and easy to reach. I'll definitely keep this in mind for next time.",5,2016,04,27
236,Lovely staff and great location,"We stayed for 4 nights on a city break. All staff were great from start to finish, always helpful. The facilities are good too with spacious well appointed rooms, good free wifi everywhere and plenty of open space in bar lounge etc. Breakfasts also very good, all freshly cooked and plenty of choice.",5,2016,04,26
236,"The reason we came back, it is fabulous","Myself and my husband have just returned from a 4 night return visit to the Brooks Hotel and we were not disappointed. Following a stay in December with my elderly parents, we had hoped we had not imagined it to be better than it was, we hadn't - the place is fabulous. Considering the 1000s of staff that cross its doorstep, we were made to feel like family visiting whilst we were there. Numerous staff remembered us and Conor the Concierge (a legend amongst concierges and a true Irish gentleman) not only remembered our names, but also the names of my parents who had stayed with us in December. From the fantastic breakfast, beautifully spotless rooms, the turn down service, the lovely bar and fantastic bar staff, we cannot fault the place. Its location is second to none. On our final night Conor booked us into an Irish restaurant that we subsequently found we would have found it difficult to get a table and we were treated like royalty. We know this is because he had made the booking. We think we may not have the names of the staff right, but Celia who runs the breakfast room with efficiency and Rory who always has a smile and chat for you and Jacksig (sorry for the spelling) who runs the bar and always has time to talk and make you feel at home and of course Conor, are a real credit to this fabulous hotel. We will back and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2016,04,25
236,Absolutely Perfect,"My Fiancee and I just spent the weekend here at the Brooks and the title says it all. It was perfect from end to end.

The location is ideal, the room was furnished impeccably, the place was meticulously clean and well kept. 

Every single member of staff was warm, welcoming and accommodating. Every request we had, small or large, was met with a smile and a response of 'No problem at all' or 'Absolutely'.

To top it all off, upon booking I notified the staff that this trip was for our anniversary and we were met with a beautiful bouquet of hand picked flowers, a deliciously moreish dessert from Francesca's Restaurant and a personal welcome letter from  the manager, congratulating us on the occasion. 

All in all, this has been the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in.",5,2016,04,25
236,Great location and service,"Clean, comfortable and good location near St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street but on a quiet street. The staff is competent and friendly and most of the rooms spacious.Excellent HVAC controls and choice of pillows. Great club  room for small gatherings but on a lower level from the bar.",5,2016,04,24
236,Great Visit,"Just checked out. What a wonderful stay!  Staff were excellent. Room was warm and welcoming with no noise from Drury Street.

Restaurant meal was high quality and again the staff were very good. 
Well located in Dublin with Temple Bar a 10 minute walk. 

Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,24
236,"Lovely, friendly hotel in perfect location","I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Dublin!

From the moment we arrived, we was welcomed by friendly and helpful staff members, willing to go an extra mile to help. Although it was a little difficult to find (sat nav on my phone wasn't the best help) I was pleased when we eventually got there!

Rooms are clean and bathrooms are lovely. Fresh towels and our bed was made when getting back from a long day with chocolates on the bed! Was very impressed.

Breakfast was lovely, freshly cooked and clean and friendly staff members.

Would recommend to anyone and will be visiting again!",5,2016,04,23
236,Quaint Dublin hotel offers great service and food,"Our trip to Dublin centered on Trinity College, the National Gallery, and the area around Grafton Street. The Brooks Hotel was perfectly located for that and provided us with a welcome 'home base' after wandering. The concierge and staff were extremely friendly and helpful, answering questions when we were stumped: how to make outbound calls to the U.S. when our cellphones didn't work (though we had advised our phone carrier of our trip and supposedly gotten instructions), how to get the thermostat to respond, how to use the hotel intercom, etc. The kitchen gave us excellent breakfasts and superlative dinners in a relaxed ambiance. We would definitely return.",4,2016,04,22
236,Great Location in City Centre,"Good central location for Temple Bar and Grafton Street, and lots of great eating places and bars nearby. Standard rooms are perfectly fine, but not particlarly memorable. Breakfast was great, and we would probably stay again for a similar city visit. Might go for a delux room next time.",4,2016,04,20
236,Right in the middle of everything,"This is an excellent base of operations when visiting Dublin. It is centrally located and the staff are very helpful. St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Grafton St., and Temple Bar are all close by as are numerous pubs and restaurants. The rooms are well appointed and up-to-date. I will certainly come back here on my next visit.",5,2016,04,19
236,Fantastic stay in Dublin,"Lovely hotel with the most friendly staff I have ever experienced, so helpful.  It was our 20th wedding anniversary and they left us a lovely treat in our bedroom from the kitchen, complimentary.  The receptionist organised a meal for us and it was lovely, Brasserie 66.  We will definitely be going back.",5,2016,04,16
236,Thoroughly enjoyed staying here,"Overnight stay for work visit; travelling with my partner who hqs some mobility difficulties. Very helpful staff, very comfortable room, excellent breakfast, and the area (listed on the map as the ""artistic"" area of Dublin) was lovely to walk around and full of good places for supper.  St Stephen's Green, a few minutes away, was lovely for a morning walk.",5,2016,04,14
236,Great place!,My husband and I came here for a night away while we were in Ireland visiting family. Great location. Staff went above and beyond. Amazing breakfast. Bartender was a great guy.  Enjoyable experience all around.  ,5,2016,04,13
236,Great Hotel in Downtown,"The Brooks hotel was very accommodating and friendly staff.  We arrived at 7:00 am, the hotel held our luggage, as check-in time was at 3 pm. This hotel, being tucked away, from busy streets, was close by to everything.  If you want to pay a modest amount, then choose this hotel.  Breakfast can be order off the menu or buffet.  I opted for the buffet and was impressed, continental breakfast style.",4,2016,04,13
236,Excellent Hotel,"Everyone was so nice and so helpful. It was as if every member of the staff was your friend and each had a vested interest in you having a great stay. Any time I asked a simple question, the staff not only answered my question, but offered to help me in some way.  If I asked which direction to go, the staff member not only answered, but always gave me a map and drew out where to go.  If I asked what time to go somewhere, the staff member not only suggested a time, but also booked a taxi for me. I felt as though in response to every question, the staff member would go one step further.  The hotel itself was beautiful and everything was so clean it looked brand new.  The location was perfect.  It was close to everything; it seemed like every place I wanted to go was in a ten minute radius.  Major sights were a five to ten minute walk, great restaurants were next door or within a ten minute walk, great stores were within a five minute walk, etc.",5,2016,04,11
236,In the heart of it all ,"Came here for a weekend and didn't want to leave. Beautiful place with very nice rooms that have been upgraded recently. Amazing food and the staff can't do enough for you. It's a class place with some beautiful features. 

I would stay her again without thinking",5,2016,04,11
236,Fab hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for an overnight trip to Dublin. The hotel is located in a great location amidst local restaurants, bars, cafes, shopping and theatres.  I immediately found the reception staff to be very helpful and sincerely friendly. 

We were upgraded to a fab room that was well appointed with everything we would need for our stay.  The extra touches in this hotel such as the choc on the pillow and a 'pillow menu' were great and a clear indication that this hotel wants to stand out from the crowd.  Breakfast looked fantastic but we chose to explore the plathora of cafes around.

The late checkout of 2pm that was automatically offered was a great way to finish off our stay so there was no panic while we ate and shopped.

Will recommend to our family and friends and will be back to stay ourselves again.",5,2016,04,10
236,Great staff and location,"Had a very enjoyable long Easter weekend staying at this very well located hotel in South Dublin. A week before we went we find out that Good Friday is an official ""dry day"" in Ireland with no bars, pubs or restaurants serving alcohol open. This was despite is being the 100th anniversary of the Easter uprising weekend. However, Brooks has a good wine menu and a great selection of Whiskies which are available on Good Friday, so long as you are eating. The area around the hotel has a number of sophisticated bars, a million miles away in terms of style and ambience from some of the temple bar pubs. Also there are plenty of independent shops as well as high end fashion retailers. It's also very near to the Olympia Theatre, Trinity College and the South Georgian area of the city. Staff were also fantastic and extremely helpful at all times. The only slight downside to our whole experience was the night we ate in the restaurant. Our veggie meals were not very inspiring and our friends who joined us were not wholly impressed with their fish/meat course. It was especially disappointing given that the breakfast was so outstanding, with plenty of options and all cooked to order. We mentioned the meal to the staff and they could not have been more apologetic and have offered us a free upgrade and discount when we return, which we will most certainly will in the near future.",4,2016,04,08
236,"My New ""Usual Place"" in DUB","I checked into Brooks Hotel on the Saturday of Easter weekend….I’d never stayed there before, but it seemed in a good location and had good reviews. Honestly, I was very impressed with it…it is definitely a small boutique type hotel (certainly has the feel)….sadly, apart from sleeping, I didn’t spend much time there. The front desk staff were fantastic – really helpful, despite the fact that I was a little cranky (hopefully they didn’t notice that, I tried not to let my poor mood show)…as I said, front desk staff were beyond great – Connor – not sure if he was the Concierge or what, but he was super eager to please and a wealth of information – I had a few quick questions and he had all the answers right there for me.

I didn’t eat at Brooks, nor did I have a drink there – that said, they have an enormous whisky collection – huge! Something like 450 different selections or something. They also have what appeared to be a very, very nice lounge on the ground floor.

The room was tastefully appointed and well thought out, and was just the ticket for what had been a long day of motorway driving for me. Very up market beds and bedding, free wi-fi, a well appointed bathroom.

The location down in the liberties right near Christchurch Cathedral and St Pats Cathedral was absolutely perfect…and honestly, next time I am in Dublin and need a hotel, The Brooks will be my first call.

The next two days – as I was meeting a small group of people – I relocated (by prior arrangement) up the road to The Raddison Blu…another great property, but I will take the Brooks Hotel over that any day of the week and for the next few days, kept wishing I was still at The Brooks.

My only regret is that my stay was too brief and that my next stay is too far off in the future. Excellent, top notch and absolutely no negative feedback or criticisms at all.",5,2016,04,06
236,"OK, maybe a little better than that.","Really a 3.5 star, and almost a 4 in some ways.

I very much liked the staff there -- they were uniformly very nice.  And they did a great job arranging for a rental car for us -- grateful for their good efforts.  It's in a good location south of the river.

However, we had to have them come to the room three times to get the toilet working.  Only one electrical out of three worked.  The shower, oddly, had only the tiniest strip of rubber to separate it from the bathroom floor, all but insuring some flooding with each shower.",3,2016,04,04
236,Great location,"This hotel is in a superb location. Surrounded by great shops, cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants. Most of the main attractions are within walking distance. Hotel was very nice and staff we're great. Breakfast was good too. Overall, maybe a little pricey but worth it for the location alone. ",5,2016,04,03
236,Fabulous!!! ,"My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay at the Brooks, we love to travel, and have been lucky enough to stay in some beautiful hotels, but I have to say that this hotel was fabulous and excellent value for money! The staff were extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for you! The rooms were really lovely, the beds very comfortable, and the extra touches such as a phone call from reception to ask if the room was to our liking, a turn down service, and little chocolates on the pillow each night, were lovely gestures. The staff seem to take a lot of pride to ensure their guests receive the best service, and this did not go unnoticed. Breakfast was great, and again the staff were very attentive. Location was good, only a few minutes walk from temple bar and the shops. Overall we had a wonderful stay and we really can't fault it. We are hoping to return later in the year with family. ",5,2016,04,02
236,Wedding night,"We had our wedding party in nearby Fallon & Byrne and stayed in the Brooks hotel. I called Brooks a few days in advance to ask about early check in as it was my wedding day. They said no problem and called me the morning of to say they had upgraded is to the presidential suite and it was ready for us to check in. Had a lovely leisurely afternoon getting ready, even had time to chill out in the living room beforehand. The suite was beautiful with walk in wardrobe and large bathroom with separate shower and round bath. Breakfast the next morning was spot on, freshly cooked hot breakfast with good options for vegetarians and a good buffet to choose from. The staff we met were all super friendly and gave a really good impression of Dublin, I felt proud to be Irish (I live in UK).",5,2016,04,02
236,A friendly welcome and quietly comfortable rooms,"Great welcome, excellent recommendation to a nearby Italian Coffee & Cakery (excellent advice from reception staff throughout our stay, whatever the request).  Rooms at the back, though double glazed, can be near aircon machinery so check when you arrive.  One of us is a very light sleeper and with intermittant street noise being easier to deal with, we requested a front facing room.  This was effected courteously and quickly.
Super comfortable bed, all other services well up to scratch and a great G&T in the bar.",5,2016,03,30
236,Pleasant Stay,Stayed here on Easter Sunday night.  Very impressed with the information provided by the hotel about the Centenary of the Easter Rising.  Complimentary copy of the Proclamation was a nice touch. Staff friendly especially the young Porter working late that night in the Residents' Bar.  Mattress a little hard but would happily stay here again.,4,2016,03,29
236,Mrs c Kelly ,Arrived goods Friday morning got into our room straight away great start . Great location but there are many hotels in and around same area far cheaper than what we paid . I had contacted the hotel before arrival date and asked if we could get a drink in hotel with it being good Friday they replied yes. But we found out on the night only if you ate the said it was the law for Ireland on that day ???. We sat in the bar area and so many residents asking for a drink only to be told only if they eat . We met up with friends next day who where staying in another hotel but they where served drink without eating . What was going on in the brooks hotel I do not know . The room was a deluxe double but dusty and Fourth floor had a awful smell. Staff yes friendly enough but the service in bar area slow and always had to go and look for someone to serve us . We will not stay here again for sure . I am not sure he gave the the status of 4.5 star ,3,2016,03,28
236,Top Class,"My partner and I spent two nights here last weeked and loved everything about this hotel. From the lovely greeting, to the comfortable rooms, the quiet bar to the absolutely amazing array of choice for breakfast. Everything was first class. Add to this it is a two minute walk to Grafton Street and three minutes to Temple Bar. Its just superbly located. But best off all were the staff , who could not do enough for us. We will surely return soon",5,2016,03,22
236,Best hotel I've been to,"I had a great time in Dublin and enjoyed my staying in brooks hotel. Very helpful staff, comfortable rooms and rich breakfast. I will definitely stay in brooks hotel next time I'll visit Dublin. Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,20
236,"Nice hotel, great location.","The hotel is right downtown about a 10 minute walk (with luggage) from the number 8 stop from the Dublin airport. We arrived to a bustling town full of people hurrying about for lunch. The location is perfect as it's close to shopping, restaurants and is centrally located to all the sights in Dublin. Easily within walking distance of all but the Kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness factory.

The breakfast included with the room includes a full continental selection plus you get to choose breakfast from the menu. We had the full Irish breakfast and it was wonderful. Nice poached eggs, sausage etc. Coffee was excellent and the staff was very good.

A very nice stay and a very good staff.",4,2016,03,20
236,4th Visit to Brooks!,"Love everything about The Brooks,  Location is perfect -- rooms spotless -- great breakfast -- staff can't help you enough.  When they realized I was celebrating my neice's birthday and first trip to  left a lovely letter and delicious dessert plate in her room.  We walked the entire city easily from the location.  Great restaurants all around and pubs galore.  I will be back for a 5th visit soon!",5,2016,03,20
236,Great Location - Excellent Facilities,"This was our first visit to Dublin - a 2 night stay to celebrate my husband's 50th - and I was so glad I booked the Brooks Hotel. Everything about it exceeded our expectations - friendly/helpful staff, comfortable/clean room, fantastic location and amazing breakfast.",5,2016,03,19
236,Fantastic Stay,"The room was very comfortable.  I requested a room away from elevators, very quiet and the bed was wonderful.  Good hot showers.  The staff were wonderful and very accommodating.  Unfortunately every night my key didn't work and required re programming it.  It happened to many guests at that time, I can only assume that the machine was faulty.  The restaurant served amazing smoked salmon and little brown toasts that were delicious.  Location is amazing!!!!  Close to everything without the noise of Temple Bar.",5,2016,03,18
236,Rise with the Sun,"We arrived before the sun rose, straight off the plane from the states. The hotel had been booked up the night before so we figured we would have to sit by the desk and wait until the stores started opening. This wasn't the case the man at the front desk welcomed us happily gave us keys to the lounge room to relax and suggested some places around to enjoy some warm breakfast! Comfortable bed and the best pillows in all of our stay in Ireland so far! Our only frustration (a small one) was the confusion with breakfast the next morning-we had to flag down the servers after about 15 minutes or more of sitting there to just get coffee and tea and explain the buffet to us. Just something that needs to be worked on for a better understanding during the breakfast part of the stay.
This hotel is in the middle of Dublin so it is a good spot to settle for the night and within walking distance of Dublin Castle and the bus routes.",4,2016,03,17
236,Excellent,"Stayed @ Brooks Hotel for 2 nights last week. I would certainly recommend Brooks, all the staff were welcoming & friendly. The hotel is central to so many places within a short walk it is also near to the tour bus stop (which I would recommend).
The hotel is spotless, good choice for breakfast - very tasty.
Thank you Brooks for the birthday cake which was placed in our room.
Will certainly stay @ Brooks Hotel when I next visit Dublin. Thank you for making our stay so good.",5,2016,03,17
236,Proper Irish Hospitality,"I stayed here with my fiance last Saturday night and had a truly fantastic stay. The front desk reception staff were so lovely, really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was lovely, it was small but plenty of room for the two of us. There was a powerful shower in the bathroom which is a deal breaker for me!
We had a tasty breakfast the next morning, the waiting staff were delightful.
All in all a wonderful stay and will most definitely be back again.",5,2016,03,16
236,Really nice hotel - warm and friendly staff - great location,"I was on the 5th floor (506) looking out onto the street and a parking garage across but honestly you are downtown so it's not really a place with views.  The rooms were very nice, staff was so helpful, I ordered room service a few times as I was there for almost 3 weeks and it was very good - they even delivered a few warm whiskeys to my room for me when I had a cold.  Great location walking around the corner to great shopping and restaurants.  Really enjoyed the stay here - can be a little noisy on weekends with people on the street well into the night (and morning -it is Ireland) but thats hard to avoid and really wasn't a big deal",5,2016,03,15
236,Excellent hospitality!,"We stayed here for 2 nights near the end of February 2016. Absolutely wonderful hotel, the concierge Connor deserves a special mention, he was so helpful, the moment we stepped through the door he asked our names, showed us places of interest on a map and helped us with choosing and booking restaurants for both nights. Each morning at breakfast he made a point of asking us how our previous evening out had been. The hotel is very clean, quiet and close to both temple bar and Grafton Street. Lovely breakfast too. Highly recommended.",5,2016,03,12
236,Lovely Staff,Had one night here in Dublin city to catch up with family. Fantastic location and one of the reasons we chose to book this hotel. Car parking offered across the road and hotel will stamp so it comes down to €22. Absolutely friendly welcoming staff. Did have a light late lunch on arrival (delicious) but did not have dinner or breakfast so cannot comment. Plenty of cafes along the same road and directly opposite was one of the best dinners I have ever had at Fade Street Social. I would recommend this as a base for exploring Dublin for first timers and also those who frequently visit and rely on a central location and a very cosy bed! The only negative was the bathroom needed a revamp in my opinion.,4,2016,03,09
236,Cleanliness and service,"Today Mothers Day we found a quiet oasis in Brooks hotel
5 adults and 3 children enjoyed a casual lunch away from the maddening crowds 
Good value and service 
Must mention the cleanest toilets I have found with real individual towels 
Will be back",5,2016,03,06
236,Great help with family gathering,"Nice hotel, rooms are a little old fashioned . Staff were great at assisting with organizing a family get together from the other side of the world. All very friendly.
If you stay in modern hotels normally this one may not be for you.....dark and old fashioned but probably spot on for the area.",4,2016,03,06
236,"Good location, excellent staff!",Stayed here for a long weekend capping off a business trip to Ireland. Location was excellent for walking to all the Dublin sites. This smaller and quaint hotel was clean and well cared for and the staff was always most accommodating. Highly recommend.,5,2016,02,29
236,Weekend Break sans enfants ,"Had farmed the kids out to the mother in law so thought we'd have a nice night out in town dinner / drinks etc so needed somewhere central to stay. 
The location is perfect two minutes from Grafton St in one direction and George's Street in the other. Despite being close to the hubbub of Dublin nightlife there is no noise issue so a nights sleep is guaranteed. 

Staff are very helpful and the concierge is a particular gentleman and a font of local knowledge.

The only negative I will give is the shower -  it has a shower curtain - any readers of my reviews will know that I can't abide this throwback to 1980's and for a hotel that charges €200 a night I expect a proper shower door at least. 

I didn't eat here but the menu did look pretty good! ",4,2016,02,28
236,When all the staff smile?,"We were only staying one night so decided to give Brooks a try having walked past it hundreds of time. We had heard great things about the breakfast and that was the deciding factor. 
Parking is just across the road and there is a deal with the hotel if you get them to stamp your ticket before you leave. We stayed for 24 hours and it cost €21 which isn't too bad for Dublin. 
The check in was faultless and the lady we dealt with was friendly and asked if we needed any help finding our way around the city. 
The room is very typical of a city hotel. It was spotless. It was well designed and it was fine. 
The breakfast was all we hoped. There is a huge selection of cold meats, cheeses and breads for the continental option as well as the usual cereals and juices. The cooked breakfasts were cooked to order and we ordered at our table rather than a buffet. The staff at breakfast were particularly friendly and we noticed that every customer that came in was greeted warmly and walked to their table by someone who seemed to be a manager. She chatted away and didn't seem to be rushed or hurried even though she was very busy. 
It's worth saying that Drury street has a fair share of modern independent coffee shops including a very good one right across the road from the hotel. But if you leave the hotel and turn right you'll come across lots of quirky interesting shops. There is a big chain coffee shop as well but you can pass that by quickly. 
Would I stay again? without doubt.",5,2016,02,24
236,Great hotel!,"Very nice hotel, can't fault it.  Room was excellent, very clean, spacious with a comfortable bed.  Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  Hotel location is great, just a few minutes walk to shops/bars etc.  Would definitely recommend.  The pub just next door (the hairy lemon) is also great with an amazing pint of IPA!",5,2016,02,22
236,Great location,Right in the center of Dublin.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  The breakfast was one of the best we had in Ireland.  Quiet despite being right in the city.  They offer discounted parking at two local garages.,4,2016,02,21
236,"Lovely hotel, great location and excellent staff","We stayed in Brooks for a show at the Gaiety. It is in a brilliant location close to all main attractions. We were greeted by Conor who is lovely and made us right at home. The room was excellent and a great power shower in the bathroom. Breakfast was amazing, freshly cooked and loads of choice.
The only thing that was not great was the bar food. I had haddock and chips and my wife had a pasta dish and we have had better. In fairness I understand that the restaurant is excellent and had great offers. We had not time due to the early start of the gaiety show and had to opt for bar food. There is some hallway noise in the bedrooms but this is expected in a city centre hotel on a busy weekend.
We will definitely be back and would highly recommend the hotel, would give the bar food a miss next time though",4,2016,02,21
236,Good place!,"Great hotel, awesome location for seeing most sights in Dublin. Good service and helpful employees. Thank you! The only thing that we didnt love was the street noise and noise of the other guests in the hallway, which the hotel really can't help.",5,2016,02,21
236,Great location but quiet and quality!,"Spent 2 nights here and didn't regret choosing this for a moment from arriving!

City breaks are often spoiled for me by lack of sleep as I'm easily kept awake in hotels be it from noise inside or outside the hotel! Not here - requested a quiet room and can honestly say it was entirely peaceful and the furniture/fittings in the deluxe room were just lovely!

You are literally 2 minutes from the fabulous parts of Dublin and surrounded by soooo many different restaurants and bars within easy walking distance of this hotel.

Breakfast was gorgeous, don't overlook the residents lounge/library on Lower ground floor as so cosy!All staff were very welcoming and efficient whilst making you feel very comfortable and not like you had to stand on ceremony! 

Another lovely touch - the pillow menu, what a treat!!!! ",5,2016,02,17
236,Brilliant Hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights, had a fantastic stay, from the minute of arrival to the minute of departure nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The room was spotless, water hot and plentiful, breakfast was excellent you could have as much or as little as you liked. The hotel is ideally located within easy walking distance of both Temple Bar and Grafton Street. There were 8 of us in our group (4 couples) and we've all agreed we will definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,02,16
236,Great Location,"Stayed for 2 nights with friends, location was very central and staff were so friendly & happy to offer suggestions of places and directions. The room was clean & spacious and upon booking we were asked if there was a special occasion for our visit. We said it was a birthday visit for our friends & an Anniversary trip for ourselves. When we returned to the room early evening there was cakes & a greeting from the staff, nice welcoming touch.  Would highly recommend to stay here if visiting Dublin. 
p.s Breakfast was delicious ",5,2016,02,14
236,Great Stay,Stayed here for a night to celebrate a wedding anniversary. From the moment we checked and received a warm welcome till we checked out which was equally pleasant we had a great stay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Its hard to imagine a better location. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the surrounding area. Its only a few minutes away from shopping on Grafton Street.We were treated to pastries and a nice letter from manager to mark anniversary which was a nice touch.Had a nightcap in downstairs bar for residents. Again a very friendly barman. Nice breakfast and our only regret is that we were not staying a second night. Secure overnight parking across the road from hotel for €6 from 17.30 till 12 following day,5,2016,02,13
236,Very nice again,"Third visit to this hotel - we come over every two years for the Ireland v Wales match in the 6 Nations.

Very similar experience to the past two visits - friendly staff, comfortable room, great location, top notch breakfast, decent value (especially if you book well in advance)

Few minor niggles; water was a bit tempermental in the shower, bit of a wait at reception to check out - but these things happen and won't put us off staying again in two years time",4,2016,02,08
236,Wonderful!,"Stayed for 2 nights with my wife on Friday 29th and Saturday 30th January and it was our 3rd time staying in Brooks and everything was perfect. 

Hotel location, staff and service are all wonderful, recommend anyone looking for a hotel but overlook this one - its just Wonderful!!",5,2016,02,02
236,Birthday treat,"came for a treat the hotel is lovely and we have been to this area before which has now gone very bohemian which is great.
Ideal for walking to all other areas Temple bar for example lovely to go to but nice to come back to somewhere you can sleep.
The hotel is lovely and the breakfast was fantastic.
The female staff on breakfast at the weekends were brill. Doorman was funny and reception staff were good. Hk staff as always work  very hard and the bedroom/bathroom was immaculate. 
will defo go again.

my only grumble- tv didn't work from Friday till Monday and different explanations- all the time it didn't bother me but some people - different ges etc like to sometime have downtime to chill.

lovely thought - my husbands birthday- we already booked a deluxe room came back and there were cup cakes for us.

its not a hen/stag type hotel but there is plenty of trendy bars and shops and the markets indoors are lovely.

Bus stop - 5 mins walk away

Enjoy if you go x",4,2016,02,02
236,Fab fab fab!!!,"Thank you so much!! This hotel is just perfect in every way!! Just returned after a weekend in Dublin celebrating my birthday!Good location, friendly staff and beautiful rooms!! And the breakfast was amazing!! Can't wait to come back!! If ur visiting Dublin then this is the perfect place to stay!!",5,2016,02,02
236,Amazing hotel friendly staff excellent service,"Stayed here twice, once for my birthday in summer 2014 and again with our 2 children in December 2014. Rooms were spotless, and breakfast was first class. Nothing was too much for the staff. The hotel was warm and cosy and right in the centre of Dublin, 5* we are hoping to return again soon",5,2016,02,01
236,Popped into the bar,"Haven't been in the bar for a while 
We used to go in for a night cap 
Always quiet.  Not anymore in there on Saturday night great buzz ....
Thanks to the bar staff.  all seemed happy been busy 
Hot port with orange was cool
Wife enjoyed it 
Thanks 👍👍👍",4,2016,01,31
236,"Shame about the cold ""hot"" water","We spent 2 night in the Brooks Hotel for a short mid-week break. Very comfortable although rather old-fashioned, nice room (we were upgraded), but when we came back late evening the hot water in the bathroom was only just slightly warm, and the next morning stone cold. We complained, and when we returned the second evening it was O.K. But it shouldn't happen in a 4* hotel. Didn't have dinner, just breakfast, which was good with plenty of choice on the buffet table and a copious plateful for the ""full Irish"", although rather pricey at €19 p.p. Excellent location near all the main sights, restaurants and bars, so we would stay there again.",4,2016,01,30
236,Brilliant,"Just back from 2 jam packed filled days is Dublin. Booked this hotel very last minute and paid €200 per night. When we arrived they gave us a free complimentary upgrade on our room as it was a special occasion.  Very friendly staff, food was amazing I recommend the Irish stew, fantastic and only €15. Spotless clean, lovely and warm just what you need after a day sightseeing. Highly recommend you give it a try. Defo go back, had a great time. Thanks to everyone for a brilliant stay!",5,2016,01,28
236,"Great location, friendly staff, clean boutique rooms","Stayed over New Years eve - This location was perfect as it was in a quite back street but right within walking distance of all the 'happenings'. We were giving room 514 which had rather low ceilings that what my 6ft 4 son is used to in America! But it wasn't so bad. Room certainly on the small size but very cozy decor and clean and modern enough. Nice touches like unique wallpaper and a pillow menu and a real plant in the room. Decent soap/shampoo etc. Not much closet space if there's two of you and there for over a wk. Our friend was in room 311 which was an execute suite which was a much more spacious rather masculine room, very airy.  It was warm enough and it was nice we could control the heat and open a window. The only big issue was that there's hardly any electrical outlets! But they redeemed with the great strong free Wifi!  FYI if you get the breakfast they will only serve you a tiny cooked meal (and a buffet you can help yourself too) you are welcome to ask for more cooked sausages etc for no extra cost (we never realized this till later in the wk!).  All in all, a friendly place great for business, weekends away  It's not a party hotel (which is why we enjoyed it). Oh and if you get a chance go to the basement there's an adorable library/lounge which is a lovely peaceful place to sit and relax.",4,2016,01,27
236,Fantastic well Maintained hotel,"From the second I walked into this hotel I felt right at home, greeted by exceptionally well presented and mannered reception staff.  A nice little man spoke  us through a map and pointed out some sightseeing and shopping spots.  We stayed in. Deluxe Twin Room which was immaculate with lovely toiletries, complimentary daily chocolates and bottled water.  We had our choice of pillows every night which was an added bonus.  One lovely lady on reception greeted me daily by my name which was a nice personal touch considering the high number of guests staying within the hotel.

So close to all main soots such as Butlers Chocolate Cafe (which is a must) and close to the Temple Square however really expensive so I would recommend some of the pubs closer by as majority offer live music and a bit cheaper.

All in all a wonderful stay and will definitely return again.",5,2016,01,26
236,Fabulous hotel,"Lovely, friendly, comfortable central Dublin hotel in a great location. We arrived several hours before official check in time and only expected to drop off our bags, instead our room was ready and available. Very friendly receptionist went through local places of interest on map and made recommendations for drinks and dinner. Very comfortable room, well stocked bathroom with lovely White Company products. Would stay again next time we visit Dublin.",5,2016,01,24
236,Fantastic stay at this hotel,"We had a 2 night stay here, it was very good, nice and comfortable, friendly and helpful staff. The bar man was very helpful telling us where to visit next time we were in Dublin, all staff were always happy and helpful. We never ate there so I cant comment on the food. Would I stay here again? Yes",5,2016,01,24
236,Boutique happiness,"Having not been to Dublin in over 10 years we didn't know where to stay location wise but this hotel turned out to be a little gem. A short walk to Grafton St made shopping easy and pleasant (not sure my credit card would agree). The staff were helpful, nice and a little quirky - good combination. The breakfasts are great and dinner in the restaurant was nice and homely. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2016,01,22
236,A Little Gem,"This was our third stay at Brooks and hopefully not our last.  The hotel is well located in a quiet street.  Staff are professional and friendly.  Everywhere is immaculately clean.  Lovely breakfasts although service, and bar service, can be erratic.  We had a room on the sixth floor which was a really good size with a very comfortable bed.  Nice bathroom with White Company toiletries but perhaps could do with updating as there was no ventilation, or if there was it did not work, and the hairdryer is very old fashioned and wouldn't blow the skin off a rice pudding.",4,2016,01,22
236,Brooks Boutique,"Stayed here for four nights in a junior suite. I dislike having to work around a room because of its design faults.
Why, for example, would you plate glass the bathroom door, which lies right next to the bed, so that anyone turning on the bathroom light in the middle of the night floods the bedroom with light? Mind you, whoever designed the rooms left so many toe stubbing opportunities around that you need the light. That's design though and no fault of the management. The staff were hard workers and successfully tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The room staff in particular were well led and the chamber was always immaculately cleaned. 
The heating system was effective and tea, coffee and a fridge were provided as was an ironing board and nice stuff in the bathroom.
There's a good bar in the hotel and a residents' lounge too.
Parking is exactly opposite the hotel. If you arrive by car, ignite your hazard warners, unload and just drive straight across the one way street into the parking. It's not 24 hour though. Be careful when getting further car park directions for the 24/7 St Stephens car park entrance. The parking discounts are very helpful. 
The hotel is excellently situated and there are several places for eating and many more for drinking within an easy walk. Perhaps they could replace those swing front doors with something automatic in the future that would make entry with suitcases rather easier?
",3,2016,01,19
236,General impression,"This hotel was spotlessly clean, our room was very comfortable, the staff were charming The dining room and it was so convenient to the centre of the city. I cannot praise it highly enough. The fine dining was excellent with superb food and good service",5,2016,01,18
236,Great hotel right in the City Centre,"Stayed here for one night in January and would recommend it. As our stay was just for one night we didn't spend as much time here as we would have liked. Check in was efficient and the receptionist was more than helpful. Our bedroom was huge, very clean with a/c if needed. Bed was extremely comfortable with a chocolate on our pillow which I thought was a lovely touch. There is also a pillow menu which was most impressive. Our bathroom was clean, spacious with both a shower and a bath (the wall in the bath was fitted with a television if only we had the time to chill and enjoy this!). Our breakfast wasn't included and we didn't eat or drink here so we cannot comment on this but being a 4 star I'm sure it would be excellent. The only complaint is the hair dryer didn't work very well so I had to leave with wet hair. I pointed this out to the gentleman at check out and he was very apologetic. Also there is a car park right across the road which costs €6 overnight rate. Definitely will come back again making more time to relax and enjoy the hotels amenities more. ",5,2016,01,11
236,Great!,"Beautiful hotel, very clean and comfortable.  The location is perfect if you are keen to explore Dublin.  The staff are so friendly especially the lovely girl on reception who was so helpful and really made our stay.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone - couples, groups etc.",5,2016,01,08
236,The Brooks was a wonderful hotel in a wonderful location.,"The Brooks Hotel staff were wonderful and friendly. They gave us directions numerous times and had great suggestions. The hotel is a few blocks from Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar. We had to order our taxi for the Dublin Airport the night before we were set to leave and we allotted about 30 extra minutes to get to the Dublin Airprpt from the hotel. ",5,2016,01,06
236,Top class,"Spent 2 nights here & I will certainly be returning. You couldn't ask for a better location in the city centre. The staff were amazing, from the girls at reception to the breakfast servers and especially the barstaff. The room was spacious and very comfortable. 10 out of 10👍",5,2016,01,05
236,Late December in Dublin,"Our stay at this hotel was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and very quiet. The location was excellent, walking distance to shopping and nightlife.
I'll be staying here the next time I travel to Dublin.",5,2016,01,05
236,Excellent stay in a great location! ,"Stayed here for 3 nights to see in the new year. The hotel is in a central location and in easy walking distance of some of the main tourist spots and shopping areas. The staff in the hotel were pleasant and helpful. The rooms were a good size and had a nice mix of traditional and modern furnishings. Good facilities in the room and a good air con system. Comfy beds and a good shower. Rooms were well cleaned and toiletries restocked every morning. Breakfast was optional but we ate out, however I'm sure it would have been lovely. Overall a great stay! ",5,2016,01,02
236,Great location but construction noise was disturbing,"This is a very nice hotel, conveniently located in the city center.  The rooms were clean and well appointed and the staff was courteous.  The only complaint we had was the incredible amount of noise from room construction/repair during our one night stay.  We flew in on the red-eye and were anxious to catch up on sleep.  The room adjacent to ours was undergoing a massive renovation and the noise was unbearable.  After several calls downstairs, with responses ranging from ""they are almost done"" to ""this is the only time they can perform the work"" to ""we can't move you because other rooms on other floors are under construction as well"", the noise finally abated around 4:30 pm.  I filled out an exit survey with the hotel and the manager did reach out to me to offer a discount on a future stay. 
The only other comment I had was that the tub/shower combination is rather high and would be difficult for the elderly or those with knee problems to navigate.",4,2015,12,31
236,Perfect Base,"A stylish city centre hotel , a perfect base to explore the city on foot , near to a city explore bus stop. The friendly reception staff went above and beyond and Connor the friendly concierge who you are on first name terms with before you check in!! We had a great 3 night stay and could not find fault with the hotel. Relax in the hidden lounge for residents only and rest those tired legs. Rooms are extremely clean, comfortable and the bed was huge. Will most certainly be back.",5,2015,12,30
236,A Fantastic stay with amazing service ,"Stayed here with my family for three nights as I was getting married in a nearby church with the reception in Fallon & Byrne around the corner. We stayed in a beautiful suite and all our guests had gorgeous delux rooms. The staff went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and we felt very looked after. Everyone loved the location, so convenient for our wedding venues and shopping for those who indulged the day after. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choices and very good quality. Special thanks to Anne Kinsella who looked after all the booking arrangements - truly a professional. ",5,2015,12,30
236,A perfect place to visit Dublin,We booked this hotel based on TA reviews and it did not disappoint - from the minute we arrived the service was exceptional - lovely concierge (Connol?) beautiful room and the breakfast was worth every penny. great location as well - have recommended to everyone and will be returning next year.,5,2015,12,27
236,Just about satisfied...,"Enjoyed our night here, apart from having to ""imprint"" my card twice. With no clear explanation felt like I was paying twice. Other than that nice touches to the room. Deluxe was spacious and luxurious. However I would probably try somewhere else next I'm in Dublin.",4,2015,12,26
236,Return Visit,"Its often the case that a return visit to a hotel sees a fall in the standard expected but that was not the case with Brooks. Lovely warm and professional welcome, nice room and bathroom, helpful staff and great breakfast.
They even managed to get us a table at a very popular restaurant on a very busy night.
Another visit on the cards....",5,2015,12,24
236,"Great location, very comfy beds and good restaurant, bar suffers under pressure","Our third year staying in Brooks on the Saturday before Christmas. Nothing has changed. The room was excellent, very comfortable beds, etc, breakfast was superb with especially friendly staff in the restaurant - why can't all hotels in Ireland serve bacon as good as this.
And then there was the bar the previous evening, they used to be indecisive, now they're just not sure !  They could double their bar turnover with just a little effort  - it has been the same for the past three years. Basil Faulty would have been proud of it.
Finally while checking out I listened to the visitors beside me being asked  how their night was, everything up to standard etc. as they paid their bill. So here is my opportunity , I thought, to give some constructive criticism. No chance, my money was taken and not a word was said about the success or otherwise of my stay.

It was still worth it for the beds, bacon and dining room staff and we will stay again",4,2015,12,22
236,Cutesy and Cosy in the 'big smoke',"We had a quick weekend away from the kids in Dublin and were literally blown away (a good thing) by all aspects of this well located hotel. Firstly, the location is superb, being a stones throw from shopping and entertainment of Grafton St. Drury St where the hotel is located now also has a number of hip shops, cafes and of course pubs - the Hairy Lemon serving a great pint. 

The hotel is warm and quaint, almost like a B&B - so don't expect the polished experience you would get at a major chain. We had Roger serving us for dinner and breakfast - he has a great sense of humour and attitude to guests. Dinner and breakfasts were both of highest quality. We were pleasantly surprised as we normally steer clear of hotel food. 

Rooms were comfortable and slightly eclectic. Pillow menu, comfy beds and a weird 4:3 ratio old LCD TV (don't come here for TV entertainment!). 

And importantly the rate for B&B was Very reasonable....infact superb value. 

Enjoy Dublin, it's a great town for shopping, food and pints!
",5,2015,12,21
236,Nice hotel,The hotel was lovely and literally a 3 minute walk to all the bars Temple bar had to offer. Also only a few minutes to the shopping area of Grafton Street. Room was spacious and well appointed. Parking opposite hotel was a bonus. Only down side was that it was hard to find by car. Lots of little streets as it's very central but even say nav had difficulty. Worth it when you get there though,4,2015,12,19
236,Perfection where I least expected it,"I've seen this hotel recommended on Facebook and things but little did I know that it was going to be as elegant and delightful as it was. Location is ideal, quite literally just off Grafton street and yet secluded and peaceful. Surrounded by Dublin's contemporary quarter it is ideal. Step out for some Christmas shopping, abandon the bags, wine and done in their delicious tapas menu while sipping any amount of tantalising whiskeys they offer, all while being serenaded by a live pianist. The sound of natural conversation and laughter is all that can be heard in this gem tucked away in a big hustle and bustle city.  ",5,2015,12,17
236,Comfortable relaxing stay,"My husband and I stayed at Brooks Hotel for 2 nights and would recommend the hotel without hesitation. We were greeted with a warm welcome by the staff on reception who were friendly and extremely helpful. The room was spotlessly clean and the room was tidied and cleaned every day. We ate in both the hotel restaurant and the bar and the quality of food was good in both and well presented. Breakfast choice was amazing! Brooks Hotel is well situated to explore the town centre as it is very close to local bars, restaurants and high street shops. If you don't know Dublin it is well worth taking a hop on/off guided city tour on one of the buses.
This was our first visit and we very much hope that we shall be able to return again before too long.",5,2015,12,16
236,"Fantastic Hotel, Fantastic Staff, Fantastic Food","I recently stayed at Brooks Hotel to attend a family wedding. I flew over from the UK in the middle of 'Storm Desmond' with my husband and my 80 year old parents. We were greeted by the friendliest reception staff we have ever come across and all 4 of us have travelled extensively.

We had booked Classic Rooms and as requested, we were in the next room to my parents. The rooms were spotlessly clean and the bedding and towels (to our surprise) were changed for each of the 5 days we were there. My mother particularly liked the fact that when we went to bed, the bed was turned down and a chocolate on each pillow.

We ate in the restaurant one night and in the bar another night and had drinks in the bar every night. The food and staff were exceptional and had the time to chat with us and make us feel special. All the bar staff were so friendly, whilst being efficient and hard working. Table service in the bar was excellent and saved queuing etc. Prices were great too and comparable to the pubs we visited for a drink, especially for a hotel.

The Breakfast was absolutely to die for and my mother was chuffed to bits with pancakes every morning and the cooked to order Irish breakfast was delicious. Numerous unusual breads, fruits, yoghurts and cereals were on offer and I can highly recommend the lemon bread, the in-house baked brown bread and the warm scones every morning (we obviously ate way too much)

However, the main star of this hotel for us was the concierge Conor. I have never come across a more friendly, helpful and charming man. He made my parent's holiday. He knew all our names from the second we met him and remembered them throughout our stay. I heard him address other guests by their names too, so knew this was his standard excellent service. He made a point of coming speaking to my parents every morning at breakfast and took a genuine interest in them and their lives. I would recommend staying at this hotel just for Conor alone, however ever aspect of this hotel is brilliant. I very rarely do this, but I have returned home and re-booked to stay there in April for my birthday and look forward to spending time at this hotel, which despite its classiness and professionalism made me feel like we were staying with family. ",5,2015,12,16
236,"Very central, friendly staff, good cleanliness","We ran out of SPG points at the end of our trip and needed to try to find a decent, but inexpensive hotel for our Dublin leg. I settled on the Brooks for it's central location and good reviews on this site. I won't steer you away from the hotel, but there are a few caveats you should know about first before deciding.

The hotel is very quaint and clean inside. There is a decent sized lobby and restaurant just off to one side. It's well decorated, not exactly modern, but quaint and inviting. The staff are extremely friendly, willing to help with anything if you need it. 

The room was small but big enough for 2. The king sized bed was comfortable. Cleanliness was decent with no ""gross"" spots (believe me my wife checks EVERYTHING). We had no view, but there really isn't a view anywhere to be had looking out over on to Drury (parking garage directly across the street).

The caveats were mostly relegated to the bathroom. First, the tub did not drain. Meaning, you will have a foot of water around your feet after even a quick shower. At near $200 USD a night, this should not have happened. Second, the tub and tile are all very old. They have been patched up as best can be, but it's in desperate need of  renovation. I wouldn't go as far as call it dirty, but it could stand new grout and definitely a new tub, if not just replaced with a shower stall. Who takes baths in a 30 year old tub in a hotel?
 
The last problem was the ""business center"". This was an absolutely ancient Windows 98 machine that wouldn't even load the internet. There was no printer to print boarding passes either, I was informed to email the front desk instead. That's not a deal breaker really, but don't expect to use a computer even made in this century. I ended up just using my phone to check-in and emailing the front desk. 

Overall, it's a nice hotel for sure. The location made it ideal for us. The price was decent and the staff were friendly. Good find.",4,2015,12,16
236,Upscale hotel without the upscale attitude,"This was the second time staying at the Brooks.  Both time have been great.  Large rooms, first rate amenities.  Centrally located to the shops and pubs from Grafton St to Temple Bar.  Remember to grab a drink at the bar.  Breakfast is good, though a tad expensive compared to eating off property, but if it's rainy and cold out its a good choice!",5,2015,12,16
236,We got there at the end,"When we first checked in we were given what I believe to be the smallest room in the hotel ever hotel must have one .we asked to be moved and we got discs get a bigger room.The breakfast was excellent all the staff were also very good,I just can't give it the 5stars.",4,2015,12,14
236,Great Place!,"The Brooks turned out to be a great find. We booked it online with no real idea whether or not it would be a nice place. From the moment we entered the hotel, it was a delightful experience. The staff was so friendly and helpful and made our stay a pleasure. The location was a three minute walk from great shopping on Graffton Street and tons of good pubs and restaurants.
The food at the hotel was very good, especially breakfast. If you are a whiskey drinker, they have a huge selection. The room was very comfortable and clean. 
I would recommend The Brooks Hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2015,12,13
236,Perfect for a city centre stay,"Great place to stay, I wouldn't class it as boutique but the rooms were comfortable and the bedding was superb
The breakfast offer was fantastic and as usual the service came with a smile
The bar lads were helpful and knowledgable
Highly recommend",5,2015,12,11
236,Brilliant hotel,"Stayed at Brooks with my wife and 12 others on a work/leisure trip to Dublin.  Wonderful, friendly, helpful staff greeted us on arrival.  The hotel's location is great and within walking distance of all the tourist sites and Temple Bar.  The rooms were large, very well appointed , comfortable and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was excellent and for a city centre hotel the B&B rate was also relatively inexpensive.  I will definitely be coming back!",5,2015,12,07
236,No crepes!!!!!,"Hotel is very well located in central Dublin. The hotel is clean (with exception of large rug in the lobby) Our room was on 6th. Floor , it was not a large room but it had what was needed, a fine big and very comfortable bed. A good size bathroom etc., all in good condition and all very clean. Breakfast was the normal fare for a hotel of this standard. The quality of the food was good and buffet well presented. On our last morning we were told that they had run out of crepes, which was strange, you would imagine that it would not have been too difficult to whip up another batch!  The annoying thing about breakfast here (as indeed it is in many hotels) the dreadful coffee, it is amazing in this day and age that few hotel  breakfasts  manage to serve good quality coffee – I would rather pay an extra 50cent and have a decent coffee to start the day! Apart from that, this hotel is good and will be my choice the next time I visit Dublin.",4,2015,12,06
236,Nice hotel in good location,"An overnight business trip to Brooks Hotel, Dublin. Comfortable room, good breakfast, great location for other dining options, shower a little awkward due to fixed low head, but otherwise a pleasant stay. Bar staff very attentive. We shall use this again for our trips. ",4,2015,12,02
236,Great hotel in great location,"This lovely hotel is tucked away in the back streets off the College Green central area. It is an ideal location for visiting Dublin and the area id full of pubs, restaurants, and eateries of all shapes and sizes.... and close to best shopping areas.The hotel was superb from the warm friendly welcome at the front desk to the attentive breakfast room staff - Sudarsan & Cindy especially. The room was wonderful - large bed, nice bathroom, bath robes ... freeware, turn-down service,  and beautifully clean.
The bar has a great selection of whisky and a really nice young staff .. all in all a wonderful hotel - and ... they obviously read reviews because the breakfast prices were reduced and with the service were excellent value for money .. and with fruit, pastries, and a a nice selection of breads a full Irish was sometimes difficult to manage!  Brilliant! Thank you for a great stay",5,2015,12,01
236,Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend with friends. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms had just been refurbished to a high standard. Not really a view as it is in the centre of town but didnt expect a view. Breakfast was lovely and plenty choice. Would go again. Excellent location for shops, bars and restaurants.",5,2015,11,30
236,Great Location! ,"The service at the desk and with the concierge was friendly, helpful and expedient. The hotel is located close to Grafton Street. We walked to Guinness, St. Patrick's Cathedral, St. Stephen's Green, National Gallery of Art, and Temple Bar. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. Our room was on the first floor and on the street side. We could hear traffic but it didn't keep us up. ",4,2015,11,26
236,Good little gem,"I've stayed at Brooks quite a lot down through the years. It's bang in the middle of Dublin's hottest area (between Sth. Great Georges Street and Grafton Street, forget Temple Bar), but disdained by locals as it's associated with American tourists and mid-range business suits.

That may be so, but these people make well behaved room neighbors and the hotel facilities and service are excellent. It's not cheap, but you just don't get cheap, good and central in Dublin town.",4,2015,11,25
236,Boutiquie Style with great service,"I stayed here for 2 nights in November while traveling through Ireland.  The hotel is on a quiet side street & within walking distance of many restaurants, shops & pubs.  The trendy Temple Bar area is maybe a 10 minute or so walk.  

The rooms are lovely, larger than I expected. They have all the usual amenities such as iron/ironing board, safe, large flat screen TV, free WIFI, a lovely old fashioned radio, small fridge, coffe/tea maker, cd/dvd player, complimentary bottle of water, pillow menu, turndown service, & toiletries from The White Company.  Room service is also offered. 

They have a nice restaurant, a bar/lounge, a comfortable quiet sitting room downstairs, along with a sauna & small fitness room. You do need to get a pass to enter the sauna & fitness room from the front desk. The staff is so friendly & helpful, I can't say enough about them!!

They had a wonderful breakfast spread along with a cooked to order menu.  We also had dinner here at the Francesca Restaurant. The food was very good.  The Jasmine Bar has an extensive selection of whiskies & even do tastings.",4,2015,11,23
236,Leisure stay,"Excellent hotel. Great location.  Staff most helpful.  Would recommend highly for Gaiety theatre goers.  Very central to Grafton Street shopping area and also Stephens Green. Will certainly come back again 
      
      ",5,2015,11,22
236,Great Location!,Just home after a night's stay in Brooks..will definitely return. Fabulous location...nice walk over from Connolly Station. Lovely well equipped bedroom...super facilities...gorgeous breakfast. Staff were well trained and very friendly. Worth a visit.,5,2015,11,21
236,Lovely weekend!,"Excellent location, brilliant staff, lovely breakfast, room on the small side but as its only a place to rest your head we didn't mind. Took earplugs in case of noise at night but didn't notice anything! 

We had to ask for a replacement mattress as the one we had sunk in the middle, resulting in us rolling into the middle of the bed. There were no objections and a new mattress was there when we arrived for our second night there. 

Market opposite great for food (urban picnic is worth a try). Grafton street around the corner, Temple Bar was a 5 minute walk and the Guinness Storehouse 30 minute walk. 

Would definitely return.",4,2015,11,21
236,Outstanding staff service capitalises on the ideal location,"Brooks is perfectly situated for walking around Dublin ;  for the hop-on, hop-off bus tours, for shopping, and for eating.  It would be a good place to stay anyway, but the staff service is truly exceptional.   Someone has imbued a real culture of service.  There are old-fashioned extras, like turn-down service and a helpful concierge  (try the Whisky Bar in the Jasmine lounge) and the staff on the desk give excellent advice about Dublin.  Everyone smiles.  Trinity College is an easy walk, but so is most of Dublin South of the Liffey. I wouldn't look for anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2015,11,17
236,Great Hotel Great Location,"My and enjoyed our stay at Brooks Hotel and would like to thank all the staff who were really very nice.Special thanks to Marvin and Fiona for local eatery tips . We stayed in room 514,5th floor facing the street and never heard a thing ! Would have no qualms about booking again .",5,2015,11,16
236,Excellent central base,"This hotel was great, central for restaurants/bars and bus tours etc.  We arrived at circa 10.30am to be pleasantly surprised that our room was ready! We had booked a classic room which I believe are their older style rooms. The room was on the first floor over looking the front street/car park etc, which was fine as it is a city centre hotel so appreciate we arent going to getvrolling countryside views! Room was large with lovely modern bathroom and the bed was huge, tea +coffee making facilities, lots of wardrobe space plus iron and ironing board really well equipped, the only down side was the small hair dryer in the dressing table not very powerful for people with long hair! We ate in the hotel the first night and the food was lovely nice selection using local ingredients and very tasty.The first nights sleep was fine not noisy etc had a great sleep. Breakfast next morning was fantastic, fresh fruits, cereals, bircher muesli, yoghurt pots with fruit, cheeses meats, selection of pastries and bread, in house soda bread is delicious! You can then choose your cooked breakfast from a menu ranging from porridge and different eggs etc to a full Irish breakfast-delicious!! We were out most of the days sightseeing so just used the room as a base. Our second nights sleep was not so great very noisy on the street outside, which I admit we didn't notice the first night, then around 3.30am two ignorant rowdy people decided to have a very loud conversation in the corridor and were opening doors etc. After 15 mins I had enough and called reception who came straight up and dealt with it, 5 mins later the ignorant people were back in the corridor causing more disruption the female was very loud, some other rooms must have called reception as they came back up about 4.15am and politely explained to the rowdy guests that not everyone was in Dublin to drink and get in late, some of their guests have travelled worldwide with children and they clearly don't want to listen to drunk people in the corridor, the guests then did proceed to quieten down. I appreciate we all like a night out and I just think people need to be more respectful of other guests, hotel dealt with this efficiently and I appreciate they can't help who stays in their hotel! Overall our stay was great and would definitely go back. Reception staff friendly and helpful, room great and food excellent! Great base to tour dublin.",5,2015,11,15
236,A Fabulous Stay right in the Middle of Everything,"A friend and myself stayed just one night in the lovely Brooks Hotel in October, we were going to an Album Launch in Whelan's, which was within walking distance.
 
I booked through otel.com and got a very good rate including B&B.

We checked in at separate times in the afternoon and even though I was the lead name on the booking my friend was able to check in before me and make herself comfortable.

All Staff were friendly and helpful.

Our room was clean, cosy and very comfortable, lots of fluffy towels and bathroom goodies. Free wifi.

Breakfast was delicious with all one could ask for, a Full Irish, Eggs, Pastries, Cold Meats, Cereal, Fresh Breads, Yogurt with Homemade Delicious Fruit Compotes and more. 
And to crown it all FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE. 

I cannot remember the last time I have had freshly squeezed juice when staying in a hotel, be they budget or top of the range, it was a wonderful surprise, as you cant beat the taste of freshly squeezed juice!!

For those who stay longer, there is a beautiful Residents Lounge in which to relax, read etc.

I slept very well in a very comfy bed, this area has a lot of Nightlife and I purposely looked for and  chose a hotel that does not have a Night Club attached and is quiet at night, and this was the case.

Checkout was 12 noon, plenty of time to make lazy exit.

Brooks is just off Grafton Street and Stephen's Green is close by, there are loads of fabulous restaurants within walking distance and lovely shops.

On this occasion it was only a one night stay, I will definitely return to Brooks.

Thank you to all the staff in Brooks who make this a special place to stay.",5,2015,11,13
236,"Friendly, central hotel","A lovely hotel situated in the hip district of Dublin - near to bars, restaurants and shops.  Staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was bright and spacious with a great bathroom.  Only disadvantage was the car park across the road which I could hear quite late at night.  On balance though I would definitely visit again.",4,2015,11,12
236,Central Location,This hotel is ideally situated if you want to explore the very heart of Dublin. Whilst the hotel does not have Spa facilities the bar and restaurant are first class and the breakfast particularly good. The rooms are comfortable and week equipped and the pricing is competitive. Brooks will certainly be my hotel of choice for my next visit to Dublin! Recommended!,4,2015,11,10
236,The perfect place to stay in Dublin,"Brooks hotel could not be better situated. Located in the heart of Dublin, the hotel is just a short walk to restaurants, shopping and attractions.  This is a home away from home.  The rooms are clean, large and very quiet with comfortable beds, a pillow menu (to insure you get the right type for a great night's sleep) and well appointed bathrooms.  The restaurant serves a delicious breakfast featuring a buffet of fruits, cheeses, pastries and cereals as well as a menu of hot breakfast selections.  Best of all, this hotel treats you like you have been returning to them every month for the last 5 years.  Service is genuinely caring and helpful.",5,2015,11,09
236,Fine but not fabulous!,"The staff was friendly and helpful and it's very well located and close to restaurants and most of the attractions but there are some flaws in this hotel:

-	It’s is a little bit dated and has been redecorated many times as you can see the many layers of  paint on the bathroom door.
-	The view from the window is nothing other than huge fans that make some noise.
-	The breakfast room is nice but the waiters totally unorganized at breakfast. We got coffee twice but never any toast or had to ask three times.
-	The mini bar in the room was empty!
-	TV has limited choices of channels but internet works well around the hotel.
-	Some furtniture are worn and old fashioned.
The hotel could do with bit of modernization and update.

236,"Excellent location, fantastic staff,","Stayed for two nights for my husbands birthday. When we arrived there were cupcakes and a note from hotel staff wishing my husband a happy birthday which was a lovely touch. We had a room on the front of the hotel so we could hear some road noise but it wasn't a problem. The location is brilliant - everything is in walking distance and the hotel is right in the middle of everything. 
All the staff were excellent. Really helpful and friendly and made us feel really welcome. The bar staff were great too - knowing nothing about whiskey they helped to choose one for us and gave us advice on how to drink it.
Would definitely recommend it and if we go to again will stay there again.
Ps from the airport expect to pay about €30 for a taxi.",5,2015,11,08
236,Superb hotel in prime location,"We stayed here for 3 nights in November.  The hotel lived up to its excellent reputation.  Staff were numerous and attentive.  We were upgraded to an Executive Room which was immaculate and with a spacious clean and modern bathroom with superb power shower.  Everywhere was very clean and well maintained.  Breakfast was outstanding and nothing too much trouble.  We would highly recommend this hotel both in terms of quality, value for money and location.  ",5,2015,11,08
236,Great hotel in good location,The Brooks Hotel was a very nice hotel for a reasonable price.  The rooms were plenty big and very clean.  The location was also convenient to lots of restaurants and pubs as well as a couple blocks from Trinity College.  ,5,2015,11,06
236,FIRST VISIT BUT WON'T BE THE LAST!,"Was in Dublin for one night over the bank holiday weekend with a friend and booked Brooks because it came highly recommended by a few different people from ""down the country"".......The first thing that this hotel has going for it is the fantastic location - only a couple of minutes walk from the shopping area around Grafton Street and from the many great restaurants in George's Street and surrounds.  
The next plus for Brooks is the staff. From the reception staff to housekeeping to the restaurant staff, they were unfailingly friendly and helpful. However, I have to single out the concierge, Conor, for the welcome he gave us (and every other guest it seems!) and for his help with our queries re directions, places to eat etc. 
The bedroom was extremely comfortable and quiet and the bathroom and shower were fabulous.  Breakfast was very nice with a big selection of both hot and cold foods on offer.
All in all, I would recommend Brooks Hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin - I will definitely be back!",5,2015,11,06
236,Great location - very friendly staff!,"We stay regularly in Dublin and decided to try a different hotel.  Disappointed with the room we were initially given (small and tired looking, even though it wasn't their base level room, tiny TV and a fridge that didn't work) so we upgraded to a lovely room - 507 - for 30 Euro a night more.  Brooks is a perfect location in the midst of trendy restaurants and bars, short walk to everything.  The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.  Room was very comfortable with plenty of space, including a working fridge which is important to me.  It was quiet at night and dark, so easy to sleep.  Bathroom isn't large, but big enough, with nice toiletries.  The closet doesn't have many hangers and we were staying for 10 days so had a lot of clothes, but we coped!  Delicious breakfast, served for a long period.  We'll be back!",5,2015,11,05
236,Fabulous place to stay in the heart of Dublin!,"From the moment we walked into the hotel we loved it. Conor the Concierge could not have been any more helpful. Steps from Grafton St for shopping. Great location for good restaurants and pubs. Great to be in the middle of the hustle and bustle outside but inside the windows are triple glazed ""I think"" so it's really quite. Great bar. Just a lovely place to stay and can't wait to return next month!",5,2015,11,03
236,Great Hotel!!,"Stayed for 2 nights over a long weekend, check in was very quick and smooth. Room was lovely, view wasn't too pleasant as all we could see was a multi-storey carpark! The bathroom amenities were lovely and the pillow menu was a great touch, we had to turn down service every night which was a nice touch as you get little chocolates left on your pillow. Hotel location is great, walking distance to most places especially Temple Bar!!! 

We had breakfast both mornings at the hotel, the first day was perfect we both ordered a Irish breakfast and then had a few bits from the buffet selection. Our second morning however wasn't so great, we ordered our breakfasts, I ordered poached eggs and toast we waited a good half hour for our breakfasts, people who came in after us had eaten and gone before we got our food. Once we did I only had poached eggs and no toast, I had to ask twice before toast was brought over, by this point my eggs were cold and rock hard in the middle which was a shame.

Overall, a great hotel, very professional and helpful staff especially Connor on Concierge! Would stay again!",4,2015,11,03
236,Race trip/silver wedding,Wonderful hotel and location. Excellent food and staff. Very highly recommend. Lots of bars and restaurants in the area. We stopped in this hotel as we had tickets to the race meeting in leopardstown ..,5,2015,11,02
236,Excellent from start to finish !,"Excellent Location.  Excellent staff in particular concierge Conor, an excellent ambassador for Brooks Hotel.  Stayed in a twin room on first floor, very comfortable, clean and had everything we needed.  Breakfast cooked to order, staff were so efficient and friendly.  Will be staying again and will recommend to friends & family.",5,2015,11,01
236,Awesome place to stay,"My mom and I arrived early in the morning to Ireland and went immediately to the hotel. We were greeted upon arrival by Connor who made an amazing impression on us. He was helpful with directions, things to do and helped us with our bags. We asked to check in early because of the time our flight arrived. We were told they would see and directed to the breakfast area. The wait staff was great at seeing to us and getting us hot tea. We were able to get in early and once again Connor helped us to our room. We walked around a little bit and saw some great sights with the helpful recommendations of the staff. The next day we had the breakfast and was so amazed at the options that we were given. When we were ready to leave the front desk called a taxi for us and even helped us load the bags. Great hotel and would recommend staying here to anyone.",5,2015,10,31
236,Awesome last night in Ireland.,"After three-plus weeks traveling around Scotland and Ireland, we spent our last night in Dublin, at the Brooks.  It was nothing but delightful from start to finish. The desk clerks helped us with directions, brought us a DVD player and provided movies, printed our boarding passes for our flight the next morning and Connor held an umbrella over us as he flagged down a taxi when ours failed to show up.  The room was clean and comfy, although it was a bit noisy into the night due to people on the street below.  If ever in Dublin again, I would definitely stay here...good location, good people, comfy room.",5,2015,10,26
236,Decent Hotel & Conviently Located,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel mid Oct for my husbands surprise 50th w/e. The hotel is very conveniently situated and in walking distance of most of the tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.
We stayed on the 6th floor and you could still hear residual noise from party goers late at night/early morning but it wasn't too much of a problem. If your room is on the lower floors then this may be more of an issue.
When we first entered the hotel reception there was a rather unpleasant sewerage' type smell which seem to linger all evening. Fortunately this did go by the following day!
The room was very smart and you even get a choice of pillows from the pillow menu! Breakfast wasn't included in our room price but none the less, it was very nice with lots of variety to suit almost everyones tastes - good value!
Our only gripe was the bar staff. On each occasion we used the hotel bar, all, apart from one, bar staff were incredibly surly and unfriendly which was a pity as all other staff in the hotel were very pleasant and welcoming. Not sure if this is because we were English as they seemed very happy to serve non-English residents. Maybe just speculation but the rudeness was very obvious to everyone in our party.
Overall, I would certainly recommend this hotel but may be just choose to have your night cap in another bar before heading off to bed.",4,2015,10,26
236,"Beautiful rooms, outstanding service, great location","We arrived from Boston early in the morning, well before our rooms were ready.  We were ushered to a wonderful guest lounge that was comfortable and quiet.  The staff went out of their way to attend to our needs and helped resolve voucher issues we ran into with Aer Lingus.  The breakfast (included) was outstanding as was the lunch service and bar.  The location is perfect, a 5 minute walk from restaurants, shopping and the hop-on/hop-off bus.  Could not have been happier.",5,2015,10,26
236,Excellent Service,This was my second stay at this Hotel (the last time was April 2008). It was great to meet Connor The Concierge again and receive a great welcome. ALL the staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much bother. It was our Wedding Anniversary and on arrival to our room there was a letter of congratulations and a plate with sweets and strawberries - a lovely surprise thank you. We had dinner on our first night and the food was excellent and the Waiter was very efficient. Although the restaurant was busy on our second day at breakfast the staff were very efficient and friendly and the food was very good with a large choice. The Hotel is very central for sightseeing and we enjoyed relaxing in the Resident's Lounge after a busy day. We love the buzz of Dublin and will be back and hopefully stay at the Brooks Hotel again. Special thanks to all the staff for making our visit so enjoyable.,5,2015,10,25
236,Best Service in Dublin,"We had 8 people and 4 rooms at the Brooks including a 20 month old child. The service by ALL staff was unbelievably excellent from the time we checked in until checkout. The rooms are clean and large by European standards. It is the people at the hotel that make the difference. I have been to Dublin 5 times and never stayed in a better hotel, including the Shelbourne . Close to everything and you won't regret staying at The Brooks.",5,2015,10,24
236,Quiet and well located,"This is a nice hotel with friendly staff and is ideally located. I was a bit surprised when the front desk person said the quietest rooms were at the front of the hotel overlooking the street but we never heard a sound from outside in our third floor room. Our biggest complaint was that this is the only place we stayed in Ireland, where we never had reliable wifi in the room. Also we were glad we had not included breakfast in our rate. We ate at the hotel's restaurant the first morning and all of the pastries were so stale we never went back. I would also note that we booked the room through Expedia at a refundable US$ price that was better than the equivalent price available on the hotel's website.",4,2015,10,23
236,Irish hospitality at it's Finest! Thank you Brooks Staff1,"The Brooks Hotel is in a great Location !I stayed here for 2 nights 
on way back from Cork City .I wanted to especially note the exceptional friendliness of the  entire Staff here at the Brooks.I had a bit of a mishap eye injury while in Dublin and needed medical attention.Front desk was most helpful with call for taxi as well as asking  if i needed anything at all and even sent me an oversized head pillow as I was medically instructed  to keep head elevated.THANK You-The room was great-room service delicious and i loved the in room Tea coffee station as i needed to  stay in for a day.Overall a very nice hotel -special thanks to Connor The Concierge-he is most charming and helpful-hope to visit again one day-The hotel was very nice but the kindness of the staff  was really  appreciated.",4,2015,10,20
236,"Great Location, Outstanding Staff.","Books Hotel is located right in the heart of Dublin's tourist area making it the perfect place to stay on our visit to Dublin.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.  It was a very pleasant surprise to find the hotel had a resident's lounge where we could wait upon arriving at the hotel at 6 a.m. after a long overnight flight.  We spent a couple of very pleasant hours in the comfortable resident's lounge while we waited to begin our first day of touring Dublin. Staff went our of their way to make us comfortable, providing us with beverages while we waited.  Our luggage was stored for us and was waiting in our room when returned after a long day of sightseeing.  
The rooms were clean, comfortable, pleasant and very quiet.  Breakfast was very nice with a choice of pastries, cereals and fruit with the option of having a cooked breakfast.  
I would definitely recommend the Brooks Hotel to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay on their Dublin vacation.",5,2015,10,19
236,Amazing value and location!,"Special Occasion stay and we loved everything about it. The concierge and reception staff are the best I have ever encountered here, nothing was an issue. Enroute by train we lost some of our belongings and they were so helpful in getting contact details for us to get the situation sorted for us. We had a nice room, very cosy and quiet. The small bar downstairs is comfortable and the cocktails lovely. Location is key here, you are literally a stones throw from Grafton Area. Thanks Brooks Hotel!",5,2015,10,19
236,"Fine hotel, good location near city center, bad night's sleep","The hotel is just a couple of blocks away from Grafton Street, the main tourist area of Dublin's City Center.  There are multiple pubs on the same block as the hotel, which is great... until you want to go to bed.  The noise from the street was so bad, until 4:00 AM on a Friday night, that you will not be able to sleep.  To give you a chance to get sleep, ask for a room on the back side of the building.  The rooms are nice, but service and staff seems to be a little lacking.  They left a set of options for pillows to choose from, but nobody came to get it and a bed turndown service was not provided.  I expected this for the price being paid.  I had a very good dinner in the hotel restaurant, as well as a nice breakfast.",3,2015,10,18
236,First class all round,"With its very central location Brooks hotel is ideal for a city break in Dublin.
Very pleasant first impression by the desk staff who were very helpful. Breakfast was great with lots of  choice and quick service.
Rooms were well decorated and tidy.
Hard to fault.",4,2015,10,18
236,Great Hotel with a great and friendly staff,"We loved the Brooks. It is in a great location, a short walk to our hop on off bus, tons of shopping nearby, lots of pubs, close to Trinity College. The staff was so great. We were only there a day because we were leaving for 2 days in Belfast and returning to the Brooks after that. They stored our rather large suitcases for us and just took carry-ons to Belfast. Was so nice not to have to lug heavy suitcases on the train! On our return to the Brooks, the bellman, Connor I believe his name was, greeted us by name and welcomed us back. He had even put our suitcases into our new room, now that is service! I know our room was nice but somehow I forgot to take a picture of it. We also enjoyed the full Irish breakfast in their lovely dining room.",5,2015,10,18
236,Good solid hotel in great location,"The location is superb, smack dab in the middle of the ""creative quarter,"" near Trinity College multitudes of restaurants, as well as good shopping, museums and galleries. And the hotel lives up to its location: its well run, the service is good and the breakfasts excellent.  All in all, a real standout in a town with far too many shabby, overpriced hostelries.",4,2015,10,16
236,"Friendly staff, Easy access","Four star hotels. Prices slightly towards the higher side, but worth it. Very friendly and supportive staff. Easy access from Airport by 747 Airport link. To get down near Trinity College and walk for 4-5 minute. 3 minutes walk to Dublin Castle. They offer a simple complimentary breakfast, but you can also order 'add on's if you want",4,2015,10,16
236,Great but price is going crazy,"Brooks is everything you want in a top class hotel. Im no skinflint but Im no mug with money either, I always check price and availability at Brooks first and lately the price has gone through the roof, when I asked why the price has gone up so much the reply was because we can fill the rooms. I keep away from Brooks between May and September to avoid the silly prices but they wanted €300 per night in October!!. So I booked into the Ashling hotel over the river at a 3rd of the price but believe me I did not get a shabby hotel. The food, service and rooms were brilliant. So if you have money to burn enjoy Brooks its brilliant if you prefer to have more in your pocket for Temple bar then its Ashling all the way.",5,2015,10,16
236,Hidden gem in the centre of Dublin,"I love the Brooks Hotel.  I've stayed there several times now, including for some lengthy business trips.  It always feels like a home from home.  As  a lone female traveller I feel very comfortable there. The staff could not be more friendly or more helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable and well maintained.  The food in the bar and restaurant is absolutely excellent and the breakfast is amazing.  The location is also great with very easy access to the centre of Dublin and shops, bars, restaurants etc. Absolutely excellent.",5,2015,10,15
236,"Superior service, great location",A true 5 star hotel.  I even went down to the bar to get a couple of cups of coffee for my wife and I to drink in our room.  The staff refused to let me carry it and they delivered to the room at the same time I got there.,5,2015,10,14
236,Great Boutique like Hotel,"I loved this hotel. It was clean and fresh and just off the main drag, enough to be quiet but still in the midst of it all. Walking distance to all of Dublin. Cozy rooms. Great restaurant and bar food. Very friendly staff. I really enjoyed my 3 night stay.",5,2015,10,14
236,great stay,"Great location, staff, room and food were great, however parking is only available at the oarking garage across the street and while if you are only parking for the evening the hotel rate is good, parking for any longer is very expensive.
      ",5,2015,10,14
236,Excellent all round,"We stayed at this property for 3 nights and had a wonderful stay.
The rooms were large and comfortable and the hotel was very central. We were able to find great coffee shops and pubs close by and were within walking distance of all of the must see sites of central Dublin.
The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",5,2015,10,13
236,"Large rooms, friendly staff","Stayed here just one night on business - great check-in, quite a large room, and very comfortable king bed. I had a great (included) breakfast the next morning as well - would strongly recommend a stay here.",5,2015,10,12
236,Great location for city trip,"Booked this for a two day trip with the wife, Great location for the city only 3 mins from Grafton Street so easy to nip back and forth. Car Park just opposite the main door which was reasonably priced.  Bedroom was ok but a wee point that the bed quilt was quite short and left me a bit cold of the shoulders but air con was available if needed. Good choice of breakfast with all usual on offer. Price for stay was reasonable bearing in mind the location and also 3 mins walk from the Gaiety.",4,2015,10,11
236,Great stay,"Stayed here for 1 night party of our 18th anniversary celebrations, really appreciate the efforts that the hotel made in helping organise some flowers for my wife and also the welcome note from the duty manager and celebration dessert plate that we received on our arrival. Nice touch. Staff were helpful and welcoming. Room was clean and fresh, if a little on the small side. Breakfast was just ok. Service was prompt and attentive but the quality of the breakfast could be improved. Pastries weren't too fresh and the cooked breakfast was overcooked and a little disappointing. Overall a very nice stay but it's the little things that could raise it higher.",4,2015,10,11
236,Great location and room,"Thie hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin within walking distance of Trinity College (Book of Kells), bus tours, shopping and restaurants. The room had a terrace (although the view was not pretty). The front desk and concierge service was good. Housekeeping was fair and they forgot our evening turn down service for one night.",4,2015,10,09
236,Highly recommend Brooks Hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights at Brooks Hotel and couldn't have been happier. The location is perfect for visiting Dublin sights. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in our package and it was plentiful with both hot and cold selections. I would definitely stay again!",5,2015,10,09
236,Perfect!,"Cant fault this place, nice welcome (although I do feel a bit sorry for hotel and restaurant staff these days who seem be expected to fall over themselves to please)
Anyway, lovely room, excellent location (which is why we chose it), cosy bar and a nice hot breakfast.",5,2015,10,07
236,Great for a city centre visit,"Busy city Hotel Comfortable and  friendly. Rooms are functional but not large they are surprisingly quiet,  it is very central for walking round the city the staff are helpful and friendly.Car parking off site but very easy to find and secure a must with a classic car.",4,2015,10,07
236,Great hotel and excellent location,"We stayed here our first night in Dublin.  The staff were very friendly, helping us with the best deal to park our rental car, getting our 2 rooms ready for early checkin. The location is fantastic. Easy walk to everything we wanted to see in Dublin City Centre. Archaeological Museum was only an 800m walk and from there we did a circuit where each segment was that length or shorter, Trinity College, HaPenny Bridge, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Dublinia, St Patrick Cathedral, etc. If I ever stay in Dublin again, it would be here at Brooks.",5,2015,10,07
236,GREAT LOCATION & GREAT SERVICE,"My sister and I are just back from staying here for 2 nights. What a wonderful hotel! Comfy beds, great water pressure in the shower, really quiet at night. The breakfast was super - we also had dinner at the restaurant one of the nights and it was first class. Special praise to ""Rachel"" who worked in the restaurant, always smiling, always lovely - a credit to the hotel.",5,2015,10,06
236,Lovely friendly hotel in excellent location,The hotel is well placed for walking to all the important attractions. There are some good restaurants in the vicinity. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful despite being very busy.The room was clean and comfortable. The only slight negative aspect was a wait for a free table for breakfast. There was a large tour staying at the same time as us.,5,2015,10,06
236,Perfection!,"Stayed here for a surprise 60th birthday for my husband and I could not have chsoed a better hotel for service and location. Everything was fabulous but particularly Conor, the Head Concierge. Wish all hotels had a Conor!!",5,2015,10,05
236,Great Location,"My wife and I stayed at this fine hotel while on vacation to Ireland. It is located within walking distance to many of the tourist attractions and good restaurants in Dublin. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel has a very good restaurant and whiskey bar. The whiskey bar is spacious with comfortable seating areas. We found it to be a very nice place to finish our day and have an Irish whiskey. The staff is very helpful, but I would recommend double checking the info you are given, as we were given conflicting information on a few occasions. I would have given an overall rating of excellent but for a few missteps. A missed wake up call and dinner reservation at the hotel restaurant. The hotel did make amends for the missteps.",4,2015,10,04
236,Great stay,"Stayed here with another couple for 3 nights and have no complaints.  The bed was comfy, pillows were fine and everything was clean.  Hair dryer and iron in the room. Room service is available all day and night with a limited late night menu.   Breakfast was not included with the room but was available for a charge depending on what you wanted.  It was pretty good as well. We couldn't ask for a better location either. In the middle of everything. ",5,2015,10,04
236,Perfect!,"The Brooks Hotel was another TripAdvisor win as we booked here based on its high rating and were not disappointed once again. Bravo TripAdvisor!

From the minute we checked in, we were greeted by an incredibly helpful and friendly concierge who took our bags to the room while we were checking in. He introduced himself when we finally got up there and offered to help in any way if we needed.

The rooms are properly suited (would have enjoyed more than 10 channels on the TV though, can't even remember the last time I had such a skimpy selection) and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had all the amenities we needed and none that we didn't. They were very generous with a supply of different pillows, which helped a picky sleeper like me get comfortable!

The location is also excellent. Very easy to walk to the Temple Bar area (maybe 10 minutes) and Grafton Street is only about two blocks away. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants in the area so you certainly won't be hurting for things to see, do or eat. 

And speaking of eating, the breakfast was spectacular. One of the most thorough I have seen, and we were often full until mid-afternoon. And included in the room rate? Check!

The Brooks is DEFINITELY an excellent choice for your stay in Dublin, no matter your reason for staying or for how long.",5,2015,10,03
236,A fine hotel!,"We stayed here for three nights and absolutely everything from the very comfortable room to the friendly and helpful staff and the outstanding breakfasts made our visit to Dublin memorable.
Pleasantly decorated bedroom, a really comfortable bed and choices of pillows.
This will be our hotel of choice next time we come toDublin.",5,2015,10,03
236,"Lovely room, helpful staff, good location","We booked a room for three days.  The desk staff was accommodating, the concierge, Conor, gave us good recommendations for tours and restaurants, and the restaurant staff at breakfast were the stars of the hotel.  Their service was very fast, they went out of their way to see that guests' needs were met and they just seemed to be having a good time while providing top service.  Special kudos to Rogilio and Fiona, who were standouts.  The breakfast itself was fabulous - a huge array of choices.  There was a vegetarian choice for hot breakfast that was excellent. Their oatmeal/porridge was the best on the trip.

The location is excellent - walking distance in any direction to the must-see sites.",5,2015,10,02
236,Business trip,"Excellent Hotel, attentive staff, great location. Room was spotless, slept really well, breakfast was excellent. A very nice Hotel, walking distance to lots of different restaurants and shops, lovely atmosphere.
      
      ",5,2015,09,29
236,Highly recommend,"Fabulous hotel, fantastic staff, great position, walk everywhere, great service, beautiful brekkie, handy to shopping centre, lovely comfy bed, we highly recommend, would stay here again, parking nearby, porter to help with cases",5,2015,09,28
236,"Central location, otherwise disappointing","The best aspect of this hotel is its convenient location in the city center, which is why we chose it. It's an easy walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green and nightlife. It's also a 5 minute walk to the Airlink bus to Dublin airport.

The room had plush furnishings but the bathroom was shabby. The paint was cracked and peeling. The tub had rust stains. The wifi was free but did not work well. The view out the window was to the back of the building and the ventilation system. The drapes were lovely, a plus since there was no reason to open them. The breakfast buffet is extensive but not the freshest or best selection and not worth the price unless it's included in your package. There are many eateries nearby where you can find better.

Next time I need to stay centrally in Dublin I will look for a better value.",2,2015,09,26
236,Old world charm in the heart of Dublin,"We had a wonderful three-day stay at The Brooks Hotel. Situated in the heart of Dublin, everything we wanted to do was within walking distance. The staff was exceptional! Liam and Ellen at the front desk were professional and pleasant. Our Concierge, Conner, was always around to say hello, (yes he remembered our names), and offer us advice on getting around, or fine dining tips. Our room was adequate with tv, WiFi, refrigerator. It is an older establishment, but to us, old school service wins every time.",5,2015,09,24
236,Great location! Great Hotel,"I stayed here for a few nights in December 2014, we were after a nice hotel in a good location and found this to be a great option. It was very close to restaurants and night life however on a quiet street so not to be affected by this. We had a triple room and it actually was quite spacious considering there were 3 beds in the room. 
We ate in the hotels restaurant once and this was good with a choice of food.
The selection for breakfast was very good, lots of choices, including hot food and cereals,  fresh bread, juices... One of the better breakfast that I gave had in a city hotel.

Would recommend this if your looking for a hotel with a bit of class and in a great location!",5,2015,09,23
236,Best part of this hotel is the location,"Location is great, as it's on a quiet street away from noisy bars, yet still within a few blocks of the centre of everything. Staff are very friendly and do their best to accommodate. The rooms are very small, and because of the shape of the building, the higher the floor, the smaller the room. King bed takes up the majority of the room. Bathroom needs updating. Tub is typical European narrow and the flimsy shower curtain blows in, leaving you with a 10 inch width to shower. A door stop is required in the bathroom to keep the door open, which became very annoying very quickly. This hotel is great for a 3 to 4 night stay. We were there for 2 weeks and wished we were in a more spacious, more modern setting.
Suggestions: fix the bathroom door problem, replace king beds with queen size, replace shower curtain with a glass door or a wider shower curtain rod.
Restaurant: same menu the entire two weeks we were there. Breakfast buffet at 20 Euros consisted of some yogurt, fruit, breads, hardboiled eggs and cold cuts. Get your full Irish breakfast at any pub or restaurant for a third of that price.",3,2015,09,21
236,great stay at the Brooks Hotel,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel in early September for two days. We loved the location, very close to Grafton Street in the center of Dublin. The room had a comfortable bed and chairs, and everything (lights, coffee machine, shower, wifi) worked well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. highly recommended.",5,2015,09,19
236,Central dublin,"The best part of this hotel is its location, you can walk anywhere you want to go. We never once even had to consider taking a cab or tram. Breakfast was very good with good service in the morning. We were given a room on the second floor next to the elevator (boo) overlooking a bank of AC units (boo). That being said, the room was very quiet and we had no difficulty sleeping. 
My complaint with this hotel is the details, over all the room seems clean but on closer inspection it's not. Holes in the wall, dusty lampshades, mildew stains on the shower curtain (an obnoxious curtain that sticks to you, gag), grout in shower with black mildew stains. 
But, overall a good stay while in dublin. ",4,2015,09,18
236,Great location to main attractions!,Our first visit to Dublin was pleasant! Hotel in good location to everything. Room was European size - a little small. Breakfast was nice. Staff were all pleasant. Prices a little high. Only drawback was the noisy plumbing running intermittently all night.  Please be exceptionally careful with your credit card transactions. Have the card swiping device and your credit card visible at all times. Otherwise a nice hotel.,3,2015,09,15
236,Perfect location,"We spent 3 nights at this centrally located hotel.   It was easily within walking distance to many sights and had many nearby restaurants and pubs.  The room was somewhat small (typical for European hotels) but the bed was King-sized and super comfortable.  The buffet breakfast had a nice spread and the front desk staff were extremely helpful and polite.  My only complaint was the archaic hair dryer in the wall in the bathroom. I had to purchase a hair dryer at a local store.  Overall, we were very pleased with the accommodations and hotel.",4,2015,09,13
236,Irish Holiday,We were in Dublin for three nights and could not asked for a nicer hotel.  The staff was wonderful and the bartender was fantastic.  Walking distance to many of the sites or only a short cab ride to the rest.  The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  We will look forward to our next trip and a return to the Brooks Hotel.,5,2015,09,12
236,One Night In Dublin,"Spent one night at this hotel while touring around Ireland for a week.  It is centrally located and is very clean, and includes breakfast.  If you are staying in Dublin I would recommend, affordable, clean, and good service.   We stayed on the sixth floor and the room was quiet and had AC (most places in Ireland do not). ",4,2015,09,11
236,Nice Hotel in central Dublin location,We stayed for one night and the room was very nice and clean with a very comfortable bed. The room was on the small side and the bathroom was also small. The staff at checkin and checkout were very friendly. The cost of a room for our night was €300 which is I think on the high side given the facilities. Perhaps you are paying for the very central location. Overall it's a nice clean friendly hotel and certainly good for a few nights stay in central Dublin.,3,2015,09,11
236,Delightful Dublin Hotel with Conor the Concierge,"What a delightful Dublin hotel to begin our trip!  The service was excellent and friendly.  Conor the concierge was funny, engaging and incredibly helpful.  For example, shortly after we arrived we asked him where we could get a quick lunch and a pint.  Instead of just telling us, he escorted us out of the hotel to a little place a half a block away, took us to a table inside and told the hostess we were his American cousins and she should treat us well.  The restaurant was very good and a nice introduction to the area.  But the excellent service at the Brooks Hotel did not end with Conor.  The reception desk attendants were kind and understanding and the restaurant host and waiters were quite cheerful when we had a superb buffet breakfast at the hotel.   At night, a pianist kept the evening classy.  The rooms were small by US standards, but pretty typical for European hotels.  They were clean and comfortable and quiet with a nice a/c and heating system controlled within the room (which I discovered was not all that typical in Ireland).   The hotel is located within a short walk of Trinity College, St. Stephen’s Green, and the Temple Bar area.",5,2015,09,10
236,Charming hotel which pays attention to the little details.,"When my husband and I checked in, we chatted with the person at the front desk and I mentioned that it would be our 43rd wedding anniversary during our stay.  That afternoon, after walking around Dublin, we came back to find a plate with little desserts for us and a congratulatory note mentioning our anniversary!  Thru out our stay, it was truly the little things that made the difference!  Confirmation of dinner reservations, chocolates on our pillows, etc.  would highly recommend staying here.",5,2015,09,09
236,Smelled of cigarette smoke,"We had two rooms at the Brooks Hotel and felt they were totally different experiences. One room for our kids had three twin beds, was clean and comfortable. The other, for my husband and I, was a problem. The first room we were given smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke (even though it is supposedly nonsmoking). After complaining, we were moved to a different room in which the thermostat didn't work--the room was freezing when we went in with the fan constantly blowing and no way to shut it off. We reported the problem and went out for a little while. When we returned, the room was super hot--must have been 85 degrees! When we reported it again, we were moved to a different room. This room seemed ok when we moved in but we noticed occasional wafts of cigarette smoke. Still, after two room moves, we were sick of it and just stayed there. During certain portions of the day, the cigarette smell would get stronger. I finally figured it out on the second day--our room was next to the staff staircase which I took once going down to the lobby--the staff must smoke in the stairwell and the smell then drifted into our room (room 108). It was bad enough that the clothes in my suitcase smelled of cigarette smoke days later!! Highly annoying!!

Other aspects of the Brooks were fine--overall clean, great service in the restaurant for breakfast with lots of yummy choices, good central location. Still, the hotel management needs to make sure that the staff does not smoke in the stairwell (or the rooms!) if they are going to advertise the hotel as a nonsmoking establishment. They could use a few more plugs for electronics also but that was a minor issue overall.",3,2015,09,08
236,Irish hospitality.  Great location.,"I stayed here for my first and last nights. I found the staff to be very welcoming. As I was checking in after a flight from San Francisco in the middle of the night my body time, I said I was dying for a cup of tea.  The person checking me in had tea sent to my room within minutes. This is just one example of the  thoughtful and professional service. There was an issue on my first stay and it was quickly and graciously resolved by the duty manager. Manuel, the unofficial greeter and concierge,  could not have been more pleasant or more helpful.   True Irish hospitality provided by a multi-cultural staff. Perfect location a five minute walk from all the key places. I would recommend it.",5,2015,09,07
236,"Lovely hotel, great location.","It was a little more expensive than we had planned to pay but really worth it. It was old fashioned in good way, kind of cosy. The room has a little living area and a small office room with storage and they left a selection of lovely books. The staff were extremely professional and helpful and the breakfast was delicious. It was good that you could get an Americano and not just the regular coffee.
The hotel's location is excellent, right in the middle of everything without being noisy somehow. You are right beside Fade Street and George's street so you have your choice of good restaurants and just beside Stephen's Green and Grafton Street for shopping. It's only a five minute walk from Temple Bar.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,02
236,A very nice hotel in a fantastic location ,My girlfriend and I stayed here  for two nights.The hotel got off to a fantastic start by allowing us to check in extremely early(9am) at no extra cost. The rooms were very clean and tidy but weren't the biggest.Breakfast wasn't included in our room price but at €12 each is very reasonably priced and includes both the buffet and hot to order breakfast.The hotel is within walking distance from a number of the main attractions Dublin has to offer.We didn't drink in the hotel bar but it looked nice.,4,2015,09,01
236,A good B & B type hotel,"We were a group of four people starting a nine day self-drive tour of the republic of Ireland. The tour was organized through Exploring Vacations in Mullingar, Ireland who did an excellent job.  The first hotel we stayed at was the Brooks Hotel in Dublin  and we could not have asked for a better site.  The location was extremely central in the Temple Bar area, with all the hustle and bustle associated with Dublin.  We had two good rooms with very comfortable beds, and breakfast the following morning was very good - all the usual Irish breakfast components - bacon, eggs, sausage, black pudding etc..We were only in the hotel one night and appreciated the friendly and knowledgeable staff who were able to guide us to the Guinness  factory etc. as well as a few locations where we could sample some of the fine product produced there.",4,2015,08,31
236,Impeccable,"Lovely in every way. Great location, walking distance to pretty much anything you would want to do in Dublin. Very helpful front desk service; my son's guitar did not make it on our (direct non-stop) flight and they kept watch for it. Conor the concierge was fantastic; had great advice and always a smile. Breakfast was tasty, fast, and hearty. Could not ask for more.",4,2015,08,27
236,"Comfortable, good atmosphere and location",Brooks was a really nice place to stay for a weekend in Dublin. Set in a quiet street with most things within walking distance. The staff was very helpful when we wanted to do a day trip outside Dublin. Breakfast incl. service was outstanding!,4,2015,08,27
236,Thank you Brooks,"Stayed at Brooks Hotel with my partner for a 1 night stay. 

The rooms are immaculate, spacious and full of character. The shower is powerful and the chocolates on our pillow at night time are a lovely touch. 

Jacek in the bar was great. Rarely have met a bar man who is as passionate about his job. (Ask him about whiskeys) 

Breakfast was great too. Cooked to order, the food is delicious and all of the waiters were friendly and quick to react to any request. 

Some 5 star properties in Dublin could learn a thing or two about customer service and attention to detail from Brooks Hotel. Special thank you to Fiona and Matty for booking tickets, recommending restaurants and doing everything in their power to make our stay so special. 

We will definitely return and recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. ",5,2015,08,24
236,Excellent hotel with a fantastic staff,"Our stay at the Brooks Hotel was wonderful. After an overnight flight, we were given breakfast, a quick tour, and allowed to check in early. Fiona and Connor made us feel right at home.  The hotel rooms are clean and bright. The location is within walking distance of Dublinia, Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin Castle, and many other things, but you don't have any of the noise or traffic to deal with because it's on a small street. You do have to hold the bathroom door open with a stopper so it won't slam, but that's really the only downside.  Breakfast was the best of any of the hotels we stayed in during our time in Ireland, and the service was unparalleled. Another bonus: soft, fluffy towels. ",5,2015,08,22
236,"Comfortable, Friendly and Great Location","Recently stayed in this hotel for an overnight as part of a theatre break we were having in Dublin.
The hotel is located very close to the Grafton Street area and Olympia Theatre.
On arrival at the hotel we were checked in very quickly and received a complimentary upgrade-thanks to reservations staff.
The room was lovely with king size bed, TV (although there were only 9 or 10 analogue channels and some digital radio channels), tea/coffee making facilities. The bedroom and ensuite were immaculate.
The service was outstanding and the mints on the bed were a nice touch on our return after the theatre.
Breakfast in the hotel was outstanding with a wide range of breads, cereals etc and an extensive cooked breakfast menu. The service was quick and the food was excellent. Our waiter, Rogelio was a star and Brook's Hotel have a great member of staff. Rogelio is courteous, friendly, helpful and makes you feel so welcome.
Checkout again was prompt. Overall, an excellent experience. We would highly recommend this hotel and plan to return in the future.",5,2015,08,22
236,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed in Brooks as part of a Theatre visit.  It is a really lovely hotel situated perfectly in Dublin.  Just minutes from St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street area and a 5 minute walk from either the Olympia Theatre or Gaiety Theatre. Parking is located directly opposite the hotel.  The room was lovely, clean and spacious and the bathroom was sparkling.  The staff were so friendly and Rogerillo provided plenty of craic at breakfast. I would highly recommend Brooks and would be my first choice to stay in Dublin",5,2015,08,20
236,Loved this place!,"It was our first stop in Ireland, and we stayed here the entire time while in Dublin. Its perfectly centered with walking distance to many stops, and to the Double Decker Dublin Trolley Bus Tour. The hotel was super clean, room was very nice, and the bed was super comfy. We had a small confusion with getting hot water in the room, but  apparently we were using the extra handle wrong, and the front desk was super friendly. My husband who is 6'2 had no problem fitting anywhere, so that was a plus. We also loved the breakfrast spread, and it was so delicious! The staff was so helpful, and kind. We would so go back!!!",5,2015,08,19
236,Fantastic Hotel - delightful staff and tremendous Breakfast,We stayed at the Brooks for business travel and had a delightful time.   The rooms were clean and comfortable and we very much enjoyed the guest lounge on the lower level - a great place to read or relax.   Connor as our concierge was incredible - remembering our names each day and checking in with us over our delightful breakfast (you must book the Bed & Breakfast rate...you won't be disappointed).   Lovely accommodations in Dublin.  The small bar has a very full selection of Irish whiskey to enjoy (and a nice selection of teas for the non drinker as well).,5,2015,08,19
236,Excellent Service: Comfort With Some Quirks,"While friendly service is not uncommon in Dublin, I found the staff at the Brooks Hotel was always helpful and happy to go beyond the basics to help out their guests. Every interaction with every member of staff was exemplary. Kudos to the hotel for that. 

We also found ourselves very comfortable in our room (and throughout the hotel) and would absolutely stay here again on a future visit, so I do highly recommend this hotel. 

But, considered against all hotels the quirks we encountered in the facilities prevent it from getting a full ""5 star"" recommendation. Included in this category would be the door to the bathroom in our room. It was quite solid and very heavy but required a door stop to keep it from swinging closed with some force. This got to be a bit tedious, blocking and unblocking the door all the time and remembering that it was going to swing shut with a ""whoosh"" every time you walked out.

Lighting in the bath was also not well placed, making it awkward to shave one's face. Also, the Internet, while free seemed to come and go during sessions and require frequent logins on various servers even during short sessions. Thus, if you want to work from your room for a few hours during your trip, be prepared to be patient. 

The facility was mostly well maintained although there was a half inch of bare wood showing where paint has been damaged and chipped away at the base of the molding in the bathroom. 

Finally: location is fantastic! Short walk to Dublin Castle and Trinity College and Temple Bar so really quite perfect for a tourist visit. We also found the hotel generally quiet aside from some common bumps and booms from nearby rooms.",4,2015,08,17
236,Well situated Dublin hotel,We stayed for one night in this centrally located Dublin hotel. The hotel has parking across the road. The rooms are small but well equipped. The bar and restaurant were both good if not a little expensive.  The waiters were particularly entertaining.  Great breakfast.,4,2015,08,17
236,Excellent location. ,"We stayed here for a city break. The hotel staff were very friendly, the room spotlessly clean.   

The location of the hotel is perfect for everything you may wish to do in Dublin. I will definitely be staying here from now on when I visit Dublin. 

My only complaint was that the bed was short.  I'm only 5ft 6 and my legs were dangling out the bottom of the bed. ",4,2015,08,16
236,Caring staff,We were cordially greeted and made to feel very welcome.  Our room was spotless and welcome after our flight from the USA.  The breakfast room was amazing and the food fresh and delicious.  The staff went out of their way to make sure my wife and I and our son and his wife and three young children were well cared for.  Brooks Hotel was selected for us as part of our tour package.  We were not disappointed!!,5,2015,08,14
236,Excellent Service Polite Employees,"Stayed two nights at Brooks with a group tour summer of 2014.  The room was clean, with great bed linens.  Breakfast was outstanding with so many choices.  Location great. We tried to stay July 2015 with another tour and could not get a room. Definitely recommend",5,2015,08,12
236,Excellent service & attention to detail,"We stayed here for my wifes birthday celebration in Dublin. Found the service impecable with personalised birthday chocolates in the room upon arrival and 5 minutes later 2 ice cold glasses of prosecco were delivered to the room, all of which were provided complementary. A truly nice touch.

A really excellent breakfast was provided with a full hot menu cooked to order, as well as a selection of fresh fruit, juices, yogurts, pastries etc. Excellent location, with numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance. 

We'll be back and would recommend.",5,2015,08,09
236,"Perfect location, pleasant boutique hotel","We had a wonderful four-night stay at the Brooks hotel. The deluxe double room was pleasant and spacious, that the bathroom was also nice.   The location was fantastic -- we had debated opting from a more upscale hotel on Merrion Square, and were very glad that we chose the Brooks hotel instead -- it is in very close walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and many charming restaurants and pubs.  Breakfast was good and the breakfast room was quite pleasant.",5,2015,08,09
236,"Location, Charm, Service","We started our grand ""Green Blur"" tour of Ireland with two nights at Brooks, which we'd chosen through Trip Advisor. At the  last minute we decided to book the room for an extra day to ensure it was ready for our 5am arrival on a Bank Holiday and we were glad we did, as Dublin was locked up tight when we landed. A radio in the room was softly playing opera on RTE.  Lovely. We fell into the comfy beds and slept for a few hours then ate a delicious hotel breakfast and launched our tour with the help of the hotel's free and speedy WiFi. We were consistently pleased with Brooks' central but quiet location and we are glad we are stopping back for one more night at the end of our tour.",5,2015,08,09
236,Home away from home.,Location is ideal. Service was excellent. Staff was friendly and professional. Breakfast each morning was delicious with choices from the buffet or the menu.  Rooms are large with a small table for a work space. We stayed for a week and I felt very comfortable there. I loved the guest lounge downstairs suitable for printing plane tickets or reading a book.,5,2015,08,08
236,Perfect location,"Someone else booked this for me and I could not have been happier. Quick check-in and a well equipped room. The room had free wifi and very comfortable pillows.

My only small niggle was that the hotel was generally cold. They come to turn your bed ready, but put the aircon back on. And the breakfast area was pretty cold - but maybe I just like it hot!

Certainly my hotel next time I'm in Dublin",5,2015,08,05
236,My new favorite hotel!,"I cannot say enough about this gem of a hotel. Yes, the location is absolutely perfect. Yes, the rooms are big and bright. Yes, breakfast is delicious. But it's the staff that make it five stars. I emailed from Belfast after seeing a special online for room, breakfast and tickets to see Riverdance. We were two adults and 1 child and online booking wouldn't let me add our daughter. When I didn't hear back, I called as we were checking out and wouldn't have internet. The cheerful, helpful, lovely woman I spoke with said they were in the process of getting us tickets to the show. (Later I learned she was the manager: I think named Anne) She was absolutely wonderful! By the time I left Belfast we had a room, and tickets. Upon arrival, Fiona knew who we were and made us feel like we'd come home. She recommended a pub for dinner that was kid friendly and adult yummy. Everyone we encountered there was simply terrific. There's no question where I'll stay next time I'm in Dublin. ",5,2015,08,05
236,Exceptional Location and Service!,"We arrived at the Brooks Hotel at 7 am from the airport, and they kindly gave us a key to an extra lounge to change clothes and store our bags while we headed out on the town. Upon our return, they already had our bags taken up to our room. Our room was very generous in size, had a large comfortable bed, and all the amenities we needed. I think this hotel has the best location in Dublin, as it was just a few blocks from all the major sights including the Dublin Castle, Christ Cathedral, and Temple Bar but it was on a nice quiet street. Breakfast was included with the room and fabulous with a buffet of scones, breads, fruit, juices, cereals, cheese, and meat and the option to order hot food such as eggs and bacon included. The staff was friendly and always helpful. We chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and it did not disappoint! I think it should be rated #1...We could not have been happier with our stay here and willl definitely come back again!",5,2015,08,05
236,"Great service, Excellent Location.",The Brooks hotel is centrally located and the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. Rooms are quiet and comfortable.  We had a room with a window at the front and had no noise issues. The breakfasts were excellent too.,4,2015,08,04
236,Wonderful boutique hotel in an ideal location.,"We spent 4 days at the Brooks Hotel and enjoyed every minute of it.  The room was well appointed and scrupulously clean with comfortable beds and an excellent shower. The location was second to none for exploring Dublin with Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College all within short walking distance.  Above all the staff is second to none!  From reception and concierge to housekeeping and the restaurant everyone was friendly, welcoming and went out of their way to accommodate any request.  While the hotel itself is lovely the people who work there give it a distinct '5 star' feel.  I would highly recommend this property.",5,2015,08,03
236,Good overall,Stayed for 1 night recently. Found the room a little on the small side but had everything one needed - comfortable bed and quiet air conditioning. Bathroom was very cramped and did not like the fixed head shower in the bathtub - prefer a proper stand alone shower. Breakfast was good value and a great selection of quality food - cold buffet and hot table service in relaxed surroundings with attentive staff. Location of the hotel in the city centre is a big plus and compensates for the cramped  room. Special €6 overnight parking across the street is great value for city centre parking. Would be happy to return. ,4,2015,08,03
236,Amazing Service,"The service at this hotel was superb.  Everyone at the hotel was so helpful, especially Connor (the concierge).  The breakfast was excellent, and the location can't be beat.  The rooms are spacious and very clean.  We have been home for a week and we still talk about how wonderful Connor was, and how much we miss Dublin!",5,2015,08,02
236,You have to try out the Brooks !,"This is without a doubt one of the best places to stay in Dublin, the location is central 2 minutes from Grafton St , Dublin Castle,Temple Bar and Trinity are all close by. But the hotel was superb everything you could wish for, and Connor the concierge was unbelievable, you warm to him straight away, what he doesn't know about Dublin is not worth knowing. So well recommended to everyone, we will be back . 
",5,2015,08,02
236,Great find in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for 2 nights in July/August and could not fault it. Having had an early flight in, we left our cases at the hotel and they gave us some really helpful recommendations for our day, even before we'd checked in.
The room, including the bathroom, was great, and the breakfast was wonderful, and served quickly and efficiently, without you being made to feel rushed.
The best point however was the staff. They couldn't do enough for you and were always cheerful and polite.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,02
236,Jasmine Bar is a nice spot,"My colleagues and I went to the Jasmine Bar to gather and remember a colleague who had passed away. The hotel staff had reserved some nice tables for us, which was great. The location is perfect. So convenient and it is a real oasis of calm and tranquillity in the city centre. 

We had some finger food and it went down a treat - we were all delighted with it. The staff were friendly and efficient. Drinks are a little on the expensive side so certainly wouldn't be staying all night in future!",4,2015,07,31
236,Wonderful hotel near everything,"This was a great surprise. From the welcome and assistance upon our far too early arrival, the wonderful ""guest"" room while you wait, the extraordinary concierge (Connor), the evening bar with a magnificent collection of single malts and boutique Irish to the restaurant (if you decide you don't want to go out and try some of the close by outstanding restaurants). Its location: two blocks from Grafton Street, short walking distance to Trinity College, near the tour buses, and if you like to walk, a walk to Christchurch Cathedral and all the greens is near perfect.",5,2015,07,30
236,Did not meet expectations,"Some lovely staff , but no water in rooms , very slow service at breakfast , 
While waiting to be collected for trip home , was asked by a member of staff to sit elsewhere , 
Did not appreciate attitude .",2,2015,07,29
236,Attentiveness,"We enjoy our stay here very much, the hotel staff were so friendly and took care of any needs immediately. The breakfasts were our favorite of the 4 hotels we stayed at during our time in Ireland and the staff were really great. I would choose this hotel over and over again.",5,2015,07,27
236,4.5 Stars,"Excellent property. Great staff and room was very nice, albeit, small. Bathroom wasn't though. Shower was amazing. It was great place to take a 10 minute 'guilt-free' shower, as I'm from drought-striken California!

The included b'fast was excellent....buffet and you could order from the menu at no extra charge. The OJ was fresh squeezed and delicious! 

So centrally located! Room was quiet and clean. Ask for special pillows if you don't like the ones provided.",4,2015,07,26
236,Centrally Located and Very Comfortable Hotel,"This hotel is in central Dublin (south of the river) and is close to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, major shopping areas etc. There are many good and affordable places to eat within walking distance. But the hotel is on a side street and very quiet. The staff is polite and knowledgeable. Breakfast is included and it is a good one: in addition to the usual continental fare, they also can make you hot breakfasts including a Full Irish or scrambled eggs with salmon. Our room was clean and very comfortable (you can request specialty pillows) and housekeeping gets the room done early, unlike some other places. My one recommendation to them  ss to upgrade their somewhat anemic wifi to more robust speeds, especially if they want to attract the tech crowd traveling to Dublin on business. Highly recommended place to stay. ",5,2015,07,24
236,Again Number 1 in Dublin,"This is the third time I have stayed in Brooks Hotel and I really cannot praise the hotel enough.  The location is excellent, the size is small enough to be a boutique hotel but the kudos goes to the Staff.  It is the friendliest hotel in Dublin.  Connor the concierge is an institution in Dublin, Fiona on the front desk was so helpful and always had a smile on her face. Anne Kinsella in Reservations did everything possible to make my small group's stay perfect.  The staff in the restaurant and the bar were so friendly and kind to the group.  We had dinner in the restaurant the first night and it was superb.  I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel.  Would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. Congratulations Brooks Hotel, you deserve all the praise you are getting.",5,2015,07,24
236,"What a great place, great service And great location ","We stayed for 2 nights at the end of our driving tour of Ireland and what a way to end a 9 day trip with incredible hospitality, efficient attentive staff who care about their job, Fiona our server at breakfast I single out for her personality and smile but all the staff were great. Compared with other city centre hotels the room was pretty good size and the amenities were good. I love the white company toiletries. The location is very very central and although we had returned the car the concierge we overheard explaining parking was across the road if only overnight but cheaper around the corner, that's honesty and consideration. Breakfast was cooked to order but service was quick and very tasty. Thanks everyone at Brooks for a perfect punctuation to an already great holiday. A hotel that I will definitely recommend and visit again",5,2015,07,24
236,Two night stay. ,"This is a lovely hotel right in the middle of the city. The location is great. 

The staff on reception and at breakfast are super friendly. They couldn't do enough to to make our stay better.  

I think this is a great hotel rooms were very clean and had everything we needed. ",4,2015,07,22
236,Excellent staff - very welcoming,"I recently stayed at this hotel on business.  As a frequent visitor to Dublin I am not quite sure why I hadn't discovered the delights of the Brooks Hotel before!  I definitely won't be staying anywhere else, now that I have found this gem!  As a single female business traveler it is sometimes awkward, however the staff at this hotel were ALL superb, very welcoming and made me totally at ease.  The room was very comfortable and really clean, and the overall facilities are perfect.  I actually can't wait for my next business trip to Dublin now!",5,2015,07,21
236,Highly recommended!!,"Brilliant location to explore Dublin. Easy to get to from the airport. Take the 747 which is only €6 each and get off at Trinity College and it's a two minute walk. Loads of little bars, restaurants and clubs within a short walk from the hotel. It's about a twenty minute walk from the Guiness Storehouse which is well worth a visit. Would also recommend the literary tour, a great way to find your way around. All hotel staff were lovely and happy to help. Breakfast is served until 11.30am and check out is 12. We couldn't have been in a better location to explore this fantastic city and we will definitely be back. Thanks you Books.",5,2015,07,20
236,Amazing Hotel,"Our family was traveling to Dublin for the first time and our travel agent set us up at Brooks Hotel.    The rooms were clean, had everything we needed and super close to attractions and shopping.   Their service was top notch and I would stay there anytime.     Thank You Staff and Connor!",4,2015,07,20
236,Delightful place to stay,It was a delight to stay at Brooks. The welcome was warm and the service efficient. The room was well appointed and quiet. The reception rooms on the ground floor were elegant and spacious. We spent the days exploring Dublin so didn't get the chance to use the guest lounge or cinema. Next time perhaps. We found the hotel a quiet haven in this busy city centre ,5,2015,07,19
236,My new home from home...........,"Tucked away in a side street near St. Stephen's Green, this well-positioned boutique hotel offers everything the business or holiday traveller could ask for - friendly efficient staff, superb accommodation, good food and above all fairly priced.",5,2015,07,16
236,Comfort and Convenience with a personal touch,"I was extremely impressed by Brooks Hotel and could not have imagined a better place to stay in my first time to Dublin.

Not only was Brooks centrally located next to great shops and the park, it was tucked just off the main street, making it quiet and convenient. The interior was spacious, tastefully decorated and had nice soft lighting. They also had an impressive collection of paintings that caught my eye on more than one occasion, but were not overwhelming. I had dinner and the breakfast buffet in the restaurant and both were excellent. (The waiter was particularly efficient and fun.) 

I found that my room had unusual personal touches that came through the art, furniture and wallpaper. The overall effect gave it a boutique hotel vibe when I was expecting business as usual. There was even a dress form in the corner where I could (and did) hang my shirt. I’m not sure if this is how all the other Brooks rooms appear, but I somehow doubt it. 

As for comfort, the bed was big, mattress was firm and the bathroom was meticulously clean and well-equipped with towels and good quality amenities. The only thing that would have made the room even better was a view. Though I expect that is a luxury few hotels in the city center can afford to have. 

The highlight of my stay at Brooks was by far the staff. Not only were they courteous and charming, but also, and the importance of this cannot be emphasized enough(!!)—they were incredibly competent. I had a couple of unusual requests, like storing excess bulky luggage, and needing to figure out how to fax some important paperwork overseas. Connor, the doorman greeted me (dressed in tails), chatted with me about my trip, and actually proceeded to engage with me BEFORE I asked for help. He took care of my luggage, and explained how I could get my paperwork organized. The front desk attendees ended up helping me print, sign, email/ fax some documents on my tight deadline, which was a lifesaver and probably went far above and beyond their typical responsibilities. Thank you!!! Yet another wonderful personal touch that was much appreciated.

I noticed before I left that Brooks has a sister hotel in the west of Ireland. After such a positive experience in Dublin, I wouldn't think twice to stay at their other offering, the Connemara Coast Hotel, when I’m next in that neck of the woods. 

Brooks Hotel: Thank you for an excellent experience and one that I would happily repeat the next time I overnight in Dublin. For potential guests: I can't recommend Brooks Hotel enough and encourage you to book early and often.",5,2015,07,16
236,Excellent location and the Hotel Service fully matches this.,"We loved this hotel. We stopped for four nights this our first visit to Dublin and Ireland.
A excellent welcome by the Reception staff and throughout our stay all the staff were very pleasant and helpful as well as efficient. The Hotel has a character and ambience 'very civilised' and relaxing and is like an oasis coming in from all that is  going on around. The area.
We were given a choice of two rooms, both at the front and we chose 212 on the 2nd floor rather than a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor.  It can be noisy at night outside at the front of the hotel and if you like the window open at night as opposed to having the aircon on then a room on the higher floor may be better at the rear of the hotel.
The room was just right for us, very comfortable bed and quite spacious with a good bathroom and integral shower.
The free wifi works very well. The TV could have a larger screen to match the room size.
Aircon is very efficient but we preferred to have window open.
Breakfast excellent in every way: good buffet and a cooked breakfast to order. Quality and choice excellent, and just loved the bacon.
The Hotel at the front does face a multi-storey car park but you are in the centre of Dublin and we think this hotel and its staff has the right balance to make your stay in Dublin enjoyable.",5,2015,07,14
236,"Great hotel, outstanding service, great location","If you are looking for a small, privately owned hotel where you get 5 star treatment by experienced staff, this is it.  Great location right in the heart of Dublin.  We were delighted by our accommodations, the room was spacious and the bedding was first class.  The front desk staff couldn't have been more welcoming, the concierge Colin was so very helpful and the bar staff was a delight.  We have spent much more money for hotels but didn't receive the great treatment afforded us at the Brooks.  Walkable to everything in Dublin and the be sure to catch the Hop on, Hop off bus for easy affordable transportation.  Be sure to visit Peter's Pub less than 2 blocks from the hotel.  The staff and owner are so professional and well trained, they will expertly guide you through the various whiskeys and beers.  We spent some wonderful evenings there!  Loved the whole trip!",5,2015,07,12
236,Great location but very dissapointing hotel,"I recently stayed there for a night in a triple room.... Room and hotel not as nice as expected on reviews nor on web pics!!! Views were really terrible to ventilators and extractor fan from close restaurant! Very dissapointing! ( good job I had requested a nice room....😁!,,",3,2015,07,12
236,"Great stay, great location","This was my first trip to Dublin.  The location of the hotel was excellent for getting around to the things I wanted to see. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  I arrived very early, grabbed breakfast and was quickly assigned a room.  Would definitely stay there on my next trip.",5,2015,07,10
236,Quaint,"We stayed the first two nights in Ireland at the Books Hotel and couldn't have been happier.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable, the staff very helpful.  The location right in the middle of things really gave us a good feeling for walking at night. The parking was the only draw back in was in a garage across the street, with a narrow driveway to enter and very expensive even though they were supposed to be special rates for hotel guests.  Still a nice place to stay.",5,2015,07,09
236,Hidden gem - private cinema!,I booked Brooks private cinema/screening room as a day activity for a bacelorette party and it was a great way to spend a few hours. You can watch your movie of choice by just bringing the dvd and the hotel staff are great at helping to set up if you have goodies or goody bags to hand out. I was under pressure time wise to have all this set up as a surprise for the bride to be and they could not have been more helpful. The room is very comfortable with plush let her seats for 24 like you'd see in cribs. Definitely worth considering for private party or event.,4,2015,07,09
236,"Quiet, cosy and brilliant location","Stayed here at the weekend for a wedding, lovely hotel,great staff and located on a quiet street just off busy Temple Bar, no complaints at all.Also it seemed to be located on the better side of Temple Bar.Both myself and my girlfriend would definitely return. ",5,2015,07,08
236,First Rate Experience,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for three nights in late June and couldn't have been happier. The best part is its location. We were within walking distance of virtually all the sights of Dublin and were right in the middle of the hip, active Grafton Street District with lots of interesting shops and fun pubs. Yet, the hotel itself is quiet. The rooms themselves are comfortable with modern appliances and bathroom and a decent size for a European hotel in a big city. The breakfast is excellent with both a buffet and a menu. Finally, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more acommodating.",5,2015,07,08
236,Service deserves 10 stars!!,"We stayed in the Brooks hotel at the beginning of the trip and at the end of our trip. As we came into the hotel we were greeted by Connor, and felt instantly welcomed after our long flight overnight.  Our room wasn't ready so we went out and about in the city and came back later to the hotel to go to our room.  (our luggage was already there and waiting on us) We had a triple room and we each had our own bed which was nice. The beds are very comfortable and we each had a table between us to sit personal items on.  The bathroom was large enough that two could fit to do makeup if needed.  The room faced the back so there was little noise (the first time we were on the 1st floor and then came back and was on the 3rd) Amy greeted us when we checked in and after we tried to visit the Book of Kells we had went online and ordered tickets that I sent the email to her and she printed and had them ready for us when we came back downstairs for breakfast.  Roger really took care of us at breakfast that morning before we left to go out into the country.   But it truly was our return trip that really stood out to me.  When we walked back into the hotel Amy immediately greeted me by name and had our paperwork ready to go to our room.  Connor was there welcoming us back and both he and Amy made us feel so welcome.  The hotel was within walking distance to most everything we were doing in the city, including Trinity College and  St. Stephens Green.  We all like walking to see the city and it was easy for us to make it to Christ Church and St. Patricks Cathedral from the hotel (again that depends on how much you want to walk)  Once again Roger welcomed us back to breakfast and took care of anything we needed.  After visiting Trinity College and Book of Kells we came back in the afternoon for tea and it was very nice to sit and relax in the bar area and get recharged for the rest of the day.  We asked Amy about recommendations for dinner and they recommended and got us reservations at Fade Street Social.  It seems that anything that we needed we were attended to, and that made us feel special.  On the morning we were leaving to come home, the breakfast wasn't open, however, Connor went out of his way to make sure we had something to eat by bringing food to us in the lobby and getting us started the right way.  He would not hear of us leaving without food to make our trip home, and that was over the top on service.  If you want excellent service, comfortable room, and great location you just need to stay at Brooks when in Dublin.  I would definitely stay there again on a return trip.  

My only complaint the whole stay was the lack of plug ins.  3 women trying to get ready with one plug in does not make for a happy morning sometimes.",4,2015,07,07
236,"Great stay, better people","We stayed here after a 4 night road trip through Ireland staying in B&B's. This hotel was in a perfect location, had very helpful and friendly staff, big rooms, and was an overall great experience. While overnight parking is not available onsite, the 24 garage was a very short walk through a fun neighborhood so I don't have any complaints.",4,2015,07,06
236,Business,"I previously stayed in Brooks in early June and on my return I most impressed with the service. The staff were polite and approachable, check in and out was very efficient and there were no delays. The rooms were clean and fresh and I particularly appreciated the nice touch of providing a cookie in my room! I have stayed in various hotels in Dublin whilst working here and I will be happy to recommend the Brooks to friends and family both professionally and personally as a place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,07,06
236,Great Service!,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Brooks Hotel for three nights.  While the hotel itself is not the greatest, the staff make up for it.  

Room- I stayed in a room on the fourth floor opposite the main road; however, I do not believe noise would be an issue on a front-facing room.  The room itself was small, but adequate and comfortable.  My only issue with the room was the lack of power plugs.  There was one for UK and one for Europe plug fittings, so bring both adapters.  The one plug was only a minor inconvenience.  

Location- I found the location desirable.  It was ever so slightly off the beaten path, but close enough to all the action.  Walking to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, the parks, the attractions such as Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's, etc. was all very easy. 

Food- I only had breakfast at the hotel.  There were plenty of options and the food was fine. 

Service and Staff- the staff at this hotel made my visit.  They were fantastic!  I have stayed at high-end hotels in major cities where when you make a request, you receive great sounding response, but then very little action is made on your request.  At Brooks, I had several requests where the staff went above and beyond to accommodate my needs.  I was so impressed.  Trust me, I am not high maintenance.  When I had questions, they were above and beyond.  When I wanted a top sheet on the bed, it was done.  They asked if we wanted different pillows and it was done.  They asked if we wanted to use a little foot spa machine after a long day of walking.  We said ""yes"" and it was brought to our room within 5-10 minutes.  Again, I cannot say enough about the entire staff from front desk to room staff.  Thank you!  

Overall, I would stay at the Brooks Hotel again when in Dublin.",4,2015,07,05
236,Great stay,We stayed for 2 nights and loved our stay the room was very clean and the bed was so comfy it was one of the most comfortable beds that we slept in breakfast was very good and roger was so friendly would definitely stay again,5,2015,07,03
236,Overall very nice experience,"We stayed at the brooks hotel for 3 nights - 2 at the beginning of our southern driving tour and 1 at the end. We really enjoyed our stay - the rooms were large and very comfortable. We had a rear facing room for the 1st part of our trip and they were very quiet. The breakfast included with our rooms was very good - I especially enjoyed the Nutella crepes. We also enjoyed the bar area upon our arrival - enjoying some tea and Irish coffee while our rooms were getting ready. The staff was very nice and helpful. Parking is conveniently located in a garage across the street and a discount is offered for hotel guests. Overall, we were pleased with our stay.",4,2015,07,01
236,"Great location, fabulous staff","We had a family group and had 3 rooms for 2 nights.  The service was terrific.  The front desk was helpful with directions, things to do, and even printed us a google map to get to our next destination.  The room was clean, comfortable and quiet.  The bed was very comfortable.  Close to great restaurants and many tourist attractions.",5,2015,06,26
236,weekend stay,"Had a fabulous stay very quiet but a few minutes from shops bars and the river, the beds were so comfortable and the breakfast was amazing we stayed full all day the staff were so friendly and chatty I am definately staying here again  
      
      
      ",5,2015,06,26
236,Stylish Quiet Gem in the Heart of City,"A stay at Brooks Hotel is a luxurious experience. On a back street close to leafy St Stephens Green the staff are attentive and friendly and the breakfast offers so much choice.

I sometimes visit during the day for a business meeting or to do some study.The quiet comfortable surrounds are just what's needed.

There's a great selection of teas and pillows!",5,2015,06,25
236,"Great location, wonderful staff","We spent two days in Dublin as part of a family heritage trip to Ireland, and our stay at the Brooks was a wonderful welcome home. While I was checking us all in with the efficient and friendly Liam, Conor, the hotel concierge, introduced himself to my grown children and their spouses, and had the whole group laughing and energized in no time.

Our rooms were beautifully furnished, the bathrooms large by any standard.  And the location of the hotel cannot be beat - walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, shopping, restaurants and pubs. We enjoyed breakfast in the hotel each morning, and highly recommend the full Irish breakfast as well the porridge.",5,2015,06,24
236,Great location for night life,"not an over the top luxury hotel. clean, nice rooms. they are small but your here for the location l Steps away from bike rental, fabulous Restuarants, short walk to te,plenary area. lobby is small . A breakfast buffet is included. wait staff always seems confused and the buffet is not refilled in a timely manner. If you want alocation thats close to the night life this works. You will hear partiers out late at night.",4,2015,06,24
236,Great Hotel.  Best in Dublin,"Nice big room...perfect location...great service.  The people in all areas were absolutely attentive to the needs of customer......  Breakfast was very good......  When and if we return to Dublin, we will stay at his hotel.",5,2015,06,24
236,lovely hotel,"we stayed here on saturday 20th june as part of 2 couples. There is a carpark directly opposite the hotel which is secure,the hotel was beautiful,upon arrival the staff couldnt do enough for us and it continued right next through to breakfast the next morning.
the breakfast was beautiful and the staff couldnt do enough for us,id definitely stay at brooks again,as its also so central to temple bar etc.Thanks for a pleasent stay",5,2015,06,24
236,Very solid hotel in a great location in Dublin,"Brooks is in a great location in Dublin, with Murphy's ice cream just around the corner (must try the gin ice cream!) and a lot of restaurants near-by.  The hotel decor is clean and comfortable, with a nice sense of luxury without being over-the-top.  Bed was medium-firm with a selection of pillows (although the pillow descriptions were somewhat unhelpful, listing them all as firm).  The breakfast was very nice (porridge is excellent)!",5,2015,06,24
236,Saved the Best for Last,"We had the good fortune to have outstanding hotels in both London and Paris, but we saved the best for last, the Brooks Hotel, Dublin, Ireland.  From the front desk, to housekeeping, the pub and the restaurant, the staff was outstanding.  The Hotel located near St. Andrew’s Church in the Trinity Section is ideal for restaurants, major shopping centers or just plain sightseeing.  Each morning they serve you an outstanding breakfast from 7 to 10.  One morning our sightseeing adventure started before the dining room opened, so they made up a light breakfast as a take along.  There was nothing that if you asked, the staff would not try to handle.  From transportation to suggestions for dinner, they could not have done more to please.  If staying in Dublin, I would recommend the Brooks Hotel to one and all.",5,2015,06,24
236,Great hotel,"Everything was excellent you would expect it to be 5*.
Breakfast was included and was excellent.
Beds were massive and room was modern and very clean.
only thing that would let it down is no pool or spa.",5,2015,06,22
236,Lovely hotel,"This is a lovely hotel with really nicely decorated rooms. The rooms are really quite even when you are in the middle of dublin
The bed is perfect as is the breakfast (great choice!).
I really recommend this hotel in Dublin for both leisure and business purposes.",5,2015,06,21
236,"Wow, comfort, convenience and yummy food!","Brooks Hotel in Dublin was great. We arrived earlier than our rooms were ready and so spent a while in the residents lounge. We were early enough to enjoy a great breakfast to keep us going on our first day in Ireland. The service was excellent, staff were accommodating, and tea in the afternoon was rejuvenating.",5,2015,06,21
236,Centrally located,"This hotel is in a quiet side street, very close to the city centre, making it a good hotel for tourists.
The rooms (standard size) are relatively small so that placing two open suitcases on the floor is a hassle (for two nights we didn't unpack).
The bed was  very comfortable and the room quiet, even though it overlooked the street (opposite is a parking garage).
Breakfast is good with a large selection. 
What bothered us was the upkeep of the bathroom (cracked basin) and the general state of the room. At this price you can expect more.",4,2015,06,18
236,Weekend visit to Dublin,Absolutely fabulous stay!  Visited with a large party to celebrate a special birthday. Anne went that extra mile when dealing with our booking and made everything run very smoothly even giving me some advice on where to visit. The rooms were lovely especially our upgrade! The plate of fruit and sweet treats was a nice extra touch wishing my husband a happy birthday. All the staff were very friendly and helpful whith a special mention to 'Roger' who made us feel very welcome on arrival and looked after us all extremely well at breakfast time. The beds were really comfortable and the overall standard of the hotel was excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2015,06,18
236,a great hotel and a great location,"We booked Brooks hotel because the hotel we were out was sold out for the night and what a great thing that turned out to be.  The Brooks is a great place !!   The staff are all professional and friendly, the lobby is really nice and classy, the rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet.  The breakfast was really very good.   They have a pretty interesting concept about toppings for oatmeal - be sure to check it out.  The location is prime - there is everything to do with a short walk from the front door.   I would stay here again !!!",5,2015,06,17
236,Classy with a great vibe,"This hotel was gorgeous and everything I could ask for for my first trip to Dublin. From the great location, to the beautifully decorated rooms, to the music coming from the vintage radio, it was all perfect. It is a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for with this hotel.",5,2015,06,16
236,"Excellent location, very helpful staff","I arrived at this hotel after travelling for well over 30 hours from Sydney. My main suitcase hadn't made it through on my last connection from Heathrow. Reception staff were wonderful - by the time my bag arrived they realised I was probably asleep so left a note under my door and it was delivered the following morning. Also very helpful in providing directions and advice for dinner, and providing a foot stool when I asked for one. Breakfast was great with a good a la carte selection in addition to buffet. Location is fantastic - right in the heart of all the main attractions.",5,2015,06,16
236,Damp in Dublin,"My wife and I, veteran global travelers, spent the weekend of May 2 -3 , 2015, exploring Dublin and stayed two nights at the conveniently located Brooks Hotel. The room was very nice, the breakfast quite good, and the staff, like almost everyone we encountered in Dublin, pleasant. But the service could have been better. In particular, we jealously watched other tourists carrying their umbrellas from other hotels while we walked through the rain, getting wetter by the minute, until we could find some umbrellas to buy. Dublin is one of the rainier cities to visit, but even though it is supposed to be one of the city's better hotels, the Brooks did not have umbrellas for us. It was a distinct let down.",3,2015,06,15
236,Great Location,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for two nights before a tour. With our early morning incoming flight the staff did their best to get us checked in as early as possible. Staff was always friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean, stylish, and comfortable. The location is great, we were able to walk to all the attractions we wanted to see and there were plenty of great food options. Our room faced the street and was a loud one night due to the parking garage across the street and cars honking.",4,2015,06,14
236,Perfectly located hotel with a rustic charm,"Hotel is in a perfect location for the city centre, no road noise or disruption.
Staff were great throughout
Bedrooms were stunning in decoration. A bit of tlc in our bathroom was needed (couple of cracked tiles, some mould where some grout was missing)
4.5 / 5 really
Would absolutely recommend",4,2015,06,14
236,Brooks Hotel -Irish Hospitality,"My wife and I stayed at the Brooks hotel twice during April 2015.  We checked into the hotel on April 21st for three nights, and again on April 30th for a single night.

This is THE hotel to stay at while visiting Dublin. The staff members' hospitality was excellent, from the time you walk into the lobby to the moment leave.  The room was roomy and very comfortable.  There's even a ""Pillow Menu"" on which you can select the type of pillow you want for your bed.  Very unique.

The Brooks is nicely located in Dublin.  While Drury Street is unremarkable, there are a couple of excellent coffee shops (we liked Kaph), and it's a short walk to many Dublin icons and main shopping areas.  Anf, it's a bargain@",5,2015,06,13
236,nice hotel great location,"stayed for a couples trip in April.  Its not really a boutique hotel but its still very nice.  Check in was painless and we were in our room in minutes.  Room itself was nice, bed was firm but not overly so. Decor was fine, air con in rooms and free wifi.  Bathroom was a bit dated though and the water ran cold during the shower for both myself and my wife but that aside room was good.

Breakfast was included and was good, had a continental buffet and hot dishes to order.  Service was a bit mixed with toast arriving after the hot food but they were very busy.

The jasmine bar in the hotel was lovely, great range of whisky and beers.  Never ate at the restaurant but the menu looked v nice and was great value and very busy when we went out.

Location is 5 mins south of temple bar area, drury lane and william street (adjacenet) have loads of nice bars/coffee shops.

Dublin hotels seemed pretty expensive we were £125 per night inc breakfast which would happily go back to.",4,2015,06,12
236,excellent!,"friendly and helpful staff, clean and nice rooms, delicious breakfast, good Restaurant and nice Bar with a huge selection of Whiskeys. The Hotel is very central and perfect for walking to many things like shops, Restaurants and pubs.",5,2015,06,12
236,Boutique hotel that takes you back in time!,"This was our second stay at the Brooks and the staff couldn't be any better! They are so courteous and helpful with anything you might need, whether it is directions or recommendations for a bar or restaurant. We love the rooms and the location is perfect for walking to nearby shops, pubs and other attractions. We arrived very early in the morning and they gave us coffee and offered the lounge downstairs on the lower level to relax and hang out until our room was ready. It was like a secret library, so quiet and comfortable! Our favorite hotel in Ireland!",5,2015,06,10
236,Great location & friendly staff,"We were ""assigned"" this hotel through our vacation planner and are very happy with it. We slept through bfast unfortunately due to jetlag and had turned down an offer for wake up call.  Guess the concierge knew better than we.  Hotel staff are helpful and hotel is in a great location to everything you want and need. I would stay here again if ever in Dublin. ",4,2015,06,09
236,Back to Dublin,"We love to return to Dublin and always stay at the Brooks. It's a pleasant hotel, centrally located, great for walking to Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar and Trinity, to name a few. Rooms are very comfortable, nice beds and great pillows. Staff are helpful and friendly. The lounge is very comfortable for conversation and drinks. Breakfast was very good, and the buffet is plentiful. Finally, Connor is the best! Whatever you need, whether it be directions, places of interest, dinner reservations, etc., he's there to please. Looking forward to our next return. Thanks to all at the Brooks.",5,2015,06,08
236,A nice hotel and a pillow menu included!,"This was a nicely appointed Hotel and Bar,located in the center area of Dublin.Our room met our needs and I liked the pillows I ordered,what a clever idea! We found the bar very full on a Sunday evening,much better the next night.We found the staff helpful and polite,we would stay in this hotel again. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't speak to hotel food service.",5,2015,06,06
236,Loved this hotel,"What a pleasure the Brooks Hotel has been. We spent three nights and wish we could have stayed longer. The room was small but extremely comfortable and well-appointed-- and despite the hotel's central location, the quietest hotel room we've ever stayed in. Best of all was the staff. Without exception, everyone was was warm, friendly, and helpful. They made us feel special, which cannot be easy, day in and day out!",5,2015,06,06
236,Center of it all,"We have been traveling to Ireland for over 20 years off and on.  When in Dublin our go to Hotel is the Brooks.  Centrally located in the heart of Dublin it is the perfect tourist location.  Ten minute walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College and other places of interest.  20 minutes walk to Temple bar and the Guinness museum, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Christ Church. As a added benefit it happens to have one of the hottest restaurants in Dublin as well as the go to in all of Dublin for Irish Whiskey tastings, hosting the event recently.  Rooms are warm and inviting, and the staff is fantastic, always a smile on their faces from chamber maid to front desk to their wonderful concierge Connor!  The view is nothing to write home about, as it is directly across the street from a parking garage but who cares, its location is perfect for going out and exploring Dublin.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin for the first time!  Only negative would be the elevator(lift).  Its tiny!  two persons and bags barely fit.",5,2015,06,03
236,Underwhelmed…..,"Reading all the reviews and wanting to book a hotel located in the centre of Dublin, made us choose Brooks Hotel - we were underwhelmed!

The location is great and the staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful…and the bed is nice and firm.

We were checked into a room on the second floor facing away from the streets, which we first thought to be a great idea, but would not recommend it, as the constant noise from the AC system is just humming along in the background. We did not bother to ask for a change of rooms as we were only staying for two nights, but in hindsight it would have been the best thing to do.

The gym is downstairs and VERY small…..I would not like to have more than one person working out in that room at a time. It was a let down and we did not spend any time there, but had been looking forward to it.

We were in a Deluxe room and it boosts of a fridge on the website, but our room did not have one. It's a good size, but was crowed with furniture. It was impossible to access the right side of the bed…there was a coffee table and a chair in the way. I tried to push it to one side and it got a little bit better, but it was still not good. 

The bathroom was also a good size, but the door could not stay open unless a wooden wedge was pushed under the door - quirky maybe, but I didn't find it charming. The sink/vanity was very low and it made good for disabled people, but when you have a husband who's 6f1i it becomes a problem. 

The real let down for us was breakfast. We arrived the first morning and ordered from the cooked breakfast menu. While we waited, we sampled the buffet and it offered good choices. We had asked for toast as well and when the cooked items appeared, we asked for the toast once more and were told in an annoyed voice that it was on it's way.  Second day was not any better - once we arrived no one came to seat us and after some time, we approached a waitress to ask if we could sit down. We asked for tea for the both of us...tea for one appeared….we were then left to ourselves. No one asked if we'd like a cooked option, toast or more tea and it wasn't until we got up to leave, someone asked if we knew a cooked option was part of the breakfast. Staff seemed unengaged and annoyed with any requests.

We expected more for €540 (2 nights) and I'm sure we are able to get that somewhere else in Dublin next time we come around.",3,2015,06,03
236,Brooks Hotel Fan Here,"Second stay at Brooks and still perfect in my eyes.  Smack in the middle of all the action - walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and many attractions.  The staff could not be more accommodating to our needs, the rooms, spotless.  The beds - extremely comfortable (desperately needed after an over night flight).  Connor at the concierge desk is amazingly pleasant and easy to work with - Knew our names within the first hour after we checked in.  Breakfast is spot on.  I would recommend requesting a room on the back of the building as the front overlooks a parking garage and the street - I love European rooftops - so this is preferable to me.  We will be back!",5,2015,06,02
236,Can't beat the location,We spent 4 days in Dublin at the Brooks Hotel. The location of the hotel can't be beat. It's walking distance to most attractions and tons of restaurants and parking. The room is large by European standards. The bed is so comfortable. There's a pillow menu in case you don't like the pillows which are provided. The breakfast is great with a buffet or hot options. There are 2 parking garages right across from the hotel if you are driving. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel without a doubt.,5,2015,06,01
236,Superb boutique hotel,"Can't fault this perfectly located boutique hotel. Comfy rooms, friendly helpful staff, excellent position and quiet street. There are top quality pubs and restaurants within strolling distance. Would stay there again on any future trip to Dublin. ",5,2015,06,01
236,The Staff was amazing,"This was our first stop in Ireland after a long flight form FL and after the staff was aware that we were there on our honeymoon, they waited until we left the first day to tour the city, and decorated our bed with a heart of roses and left us a plate of treats. A great welcome and a great idea of how the people of Ireland were going to be. Location was good, walking distance to a lot but also close to hop on hop off bus stop to tour the city",5,2015,05,31
236,Pleasure ,"What can I say about this hotel.  I think WOW Covers it . Rooms are fantastic, great location for exploring Dublin . Breakfast is superb Great choice and at night time the restaurant in the hotel  is fantastic. O'connor on the door is a great source of information.  The buildings around the hotel might not be the best but please don't let this put you off.Not the cheapest but definitely worth it.  Going back for the 5 times in August  enough said.  ",5,2015,05,28
236,Great Location,Love this hotel. It was in the perfect area because of its location to nearby shops and restaurants. There was very friendly staff. The front desk arranged a taxi and gave us a wake up call for when it was time to leave for the airport. It was a no worry trip!,5,2015,05,28
236,Great location and concierge,"The Brooks is perfectly located for going shopping at Grafton Street or partaking in the partying in the Temple Bar area.   The room had a full size king bed that was very comfortable.  The concierge was the best surprise, he was the most helpful and interesting concierge on our entire Ireland trip.  Though restaurant choices are numerous, we found a gem for breakfast at the Marks & Spencer rooftop cafe located at 15-20 Grafton Street.",5,2015,05,27
236,"Great hotel, great location!","We loved this hotel.  It was clean, our room was lovely and the staff was extremely accommodating.  We chose to include the breakfast and it included both the buffet and items from the menu.  I loved the location of Brooks.  It was within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see.  The area is also filled with restaurants and pubs.  I would definitely return here, the price was reasonable and and our experience was excellent.",5,2015,05,27
236,"Location, Location!","Very good location, few minutes walk to the center! The room was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and soundproof windows! The only thing I would say negative about our stay was the FIRE ALARM went off two days in a row (early in the morning) and we got no explanation and no excuses!",4,2015,05,27
236,Solid!,"This is not a high-end hotel, but it is centrally located, clean, and staffed with friendly people.  Rooms are decent sized, but lack amenities to which most of us have become accustomed--a bedside clock, for example.  A good value, but again this is not for folks who are looking for the ultimate hotel experience.",4,2015,05,27
236,"Great Place, Location and Staff","This was a great place to stay. The staff was AMAZING, they welcome you with a smile from the moment you check in till the moment you check out. They help you with anything and everything that you may need. From directions to a place your looking to visit, to a restaurant in the area down to helping you with your luggage when you leave. The location is great, close to shopping, restaurants and bars.",4,2015,05,26
236,a superb stay!,"The hotel was very centrally located in the Temple Bar area.  We walked all over Dublin as access to most sites was easy.  The hotel was clean, great staff, helpful, and front desk help was always readily available.  Stayed for 3 nights.  Breakfast was wonderful, such an Irish treat!  We would stay here again and strongly recommend it.",5,2015,05,26
236,Great 'home base' for sight-seeing Dublin,"The Brooks Hotel was clean, and ""Uncle Connor"" was delightful!  Everyone was ready to give us advice as to where to go, what to see, dining suggestions!  Our room was spacious, clean, and quiet.  The only drawback was that we had to wait several hours to check in, because our room wasn't ready when we got there.  The hotel staff did offer us drinks in the bar while we waited, but we went and had lunch instead.  Breakfast was adequate.  I do not recommend any of their vegetarian options, as they were terrible tasting; but the porridge was delightful and we felt very welcome!  Good booking option!  Thank you!",5,2015,05,26
236,"Fantastic, in the middle of the action, yet quiet","Wonderful, first class hotel, with helpful staff, in a great area to see it all. We enjoyed our beautiful room and the easy access to all the local attractions! Check in and out was smooth and our room had a beautiful view",5,2015,05,26
236,"Everything is ""Just around the Corner""","Lovely traditional, polite and extremely helpful staff, pretty rooms and good food. Hotel very close to all amenities. The breakfast is wonderful, setting you up for a good long day. The concierge was a smashing fellow, offering great advise about our trip.",5,2015,05,26
236,"Great location, comfortable hotel","Excellent location a few minutes walk from the centre of Dublin, with parking in the public car park opposite.

Our room was well appointed, though the view was of the back of other buildings and air conditioning units as it was at the back of the hotel, but the advantage of this was that it was perfectly quiet through the night - unusual when you're this near the hub of things.

Breakfast was lovely, all hot food was freshly cooked and the service was fast and friendly (with the exception of one young lady who never made eye contact and just banged the coffee and tea pots down before scurrying away).

Bar area was good, with a variety of places to sit at the end of the evening.

Our only complaint was with the front desk staff. There was huge confusion over our booking on arrival, despite my giving them the confirmation I'd printed off the internet. They didn't seem to have a clue what was going on or how their booking system worked. Unfortunately the same thing happened on checkout, which was a shame.

Overall though, we would stay here again.",4,2015,05,26
236,good location,"I was in Dublin last febrary with my family and same friends, the hotel is in the center of the city,close to  major attractions and roads for shoopping  . It has comfortable rooms but little bathroom. I appreciated the   breakfast.
      
      
      ",4,2015,05,26
236,Great location,Stayed at Brooks for two nights upon arrival to Dublin for anniversary trip.  Great location with excellent service on arrival and during our stay.  Room was cozy and had all needed amenities.  View from window was limited due to a packed city centre Dublin and our request of a quiet room.  This didn't matter as we spent very little time in the room due to our traveling.  Would recommend to anyone needing walking distances to all major sights.,5,2015,05,25
236,Birthday retreat ,"Stayed at the brooks hotel for a long weekend for a friends birthday. The hotel was lovely. The rooms and staff superb 😀 would definitely stay again and would recommend it to friends. 

Btw the Irish people where the nicest people I've ever meet! Would stop to help you on the street if looking lost. Amazing weekend ",5,2015,05,24
236,Great hotel in Dublin,"This is a great hotel.  It is in the center of the city and within walking distance of so many places - St. Stephens Green, Grafton St., Trinity College, Christ Church Cathedral, the Temple Bar. The staff is great - can't do enough for you. Conor, the concierge, is the best ever. The place is clean and well appointed, and the food was very good. Great breakfasts!",5,2015,05,19
236,Friendly and Classy,The staff here are amazing. So friendly and so helpful. The hotel is clean and really homely! Breakfast was ridiculously good! The location of the hotel is probably what stands out more. Its close to some real good restaurants and nightlife but far enough away from noise. Quite a couples and family hotel. no young loud people which suited us! The price might put you off a bit but i can't stress how great it is to not be able to hear the carnage!!worth it,5,2015,05,19
236,"COMFORTABLE, FRIENDLY HOTEL IN AN IDEAL SETTING","Without our car's GPS I'm not sure we could have found the Brooks Hotel, but once found it is a gem of a place to stay while in Dublin. First, the rooms are spacious, well appointed, and comfortable. Second, the helpful staff goes out of their way to make your stay in their charming city a delightful adventure. From advice about where to eat and what to see to procuring show tickets at the last minute, they are up to every challenge. Third, everything the average 3-4 day tourist in Dublin will want to see is within comfortable walking distance of the hotel, including some of the world's finest theaters. Fourth, whether you're looking for a quickie breakfast, a comfy pub, or fine French cuisine, it's all just steps from the front door. Parking is in an enclosed public garage very conveniently located to the hotel and relatively inexpensive for mid-city parking. My recommendation is to park it, leave it, and walk, take public transport or taxi as you explore this wonderful old city that has really cleaned up its act in the course of the last few decades. The Brooks is not Ritz-Carlton elegant, but it is a handsome hotel where the staff will both graciously welcome you and greet you by name as you come and go.",5,2015,05,18
236,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Recently returned from a 2 night stay at Brooks Hotel and already planning a return visit! We stayed from Sunday to Tuesday and the hotel was busy but not too busy. From the moment we arrived, we were treated in an extremely welcoming manner by the hotel staff. During our stay, the reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel right at home. Connor, the hotel concierge, is a real gentleman. His warm humour and fantastic knowledge is a real bonus for the hotel and it's said that he never forgets a guests name. I can confirm that, this is indeed the case. During our stay, we spoke with Connor regularly and on each occasion, he remembered and used our first names. That's not a bad feat and a great example of the hotel's individual customer service. 
Our room was very comfortable and contained a couple of nice touches. Both the White Company toiletries and the retro Roberts DAB radio added another touch of class to the room.
We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis, but chose to eat on our first night in the hotel's Jasmine Bar. The food was very good and the bar was very popular with locals. As well as a good selection of beers, the bar has a fantastic selection of whiskeys (and whiskies!). 
Breakfast was excellent.You can order a cooked breakfast and as well as this, there is a very good selection of local Irish produce, meats, cheeses and breads. However, very rare for hotel these days, there is also a dedicated cooked vegetarian breakfast. More plus marks for the hotel. The waiting staff, once again were all helpful and friendly.
Well worth a visit on the lower ground floor of the hotel is the hotel's residents lounge which is well stocked with books and nice comfortable chairs. Just the place to unwind after a day's sightseeing, or just to spend some quiet time.
Location wise, Brooks Hotel is fantastically placed. Some of Dublin's most hip bars and restaurants are literally right on the hotels doorstep. If you enjoy style bars or über trendy places to hang out, you'll find plenty within easy walking distance from Brooks.  However for us, we really enjoyed local hero Dylan McGrath's Fade Street Social which is directly across from the hotel and well worth a visit. The rooftop bar in summer would be well worth spending a few hours in! Opposite Fade Street Social on the other side from the hotel is the Market Bar, part of the converted Victorian George Market. The bar is huge, very busy and has a great range of beers, wines, spirits and a nice tapas menu. Definitely worth checking out. There are however, loads of fantastic, cafés, pubs, bars and restaurants all within a five to ten minute walk from the hotel. They were all very busy though, even on the Monday night, so it's worth doing some research before travelling, or, using the excellent local knowledge of the hotel staff to guide you to your preferred establishment. 
For shopping, a five minute walk from the hotel takes you to Grafton Street, which has a really good mix of shops. Take time to go into Brown Thomas, which is Dublins equivalent of Glasgows House of Fraser. You might not buy anything but you'll enjoy the experience!
Sightseeing wise, there is far too much to do in Dublin for me to do justice in this review, however, we did some of the 'touristy' things, in particular, the Guinness Storehouse and the Old Jameson Distillery tours. Both were excellent (the view from the Gravity Bar in the Guinness Storehouse, while you enjoy your pint of Guinness is superb) but it is worth booking both tours online before you travel to save both money and time when you get to Dublin. Also, the Dublin Bus 3 Day Freedom pass is well worth buying. For 72 hours from validating your ticket, you can get transport from and to Dublin Airport, unlimited use of the Dublin Open Top a Tour Bus (the best way of discovering Dublin) and use of the local Dublin Bus network. We bought our tickets online before leaving Glasgow and  picked them up at Dublin airport. For €33 you get great value for money. Finally, Dublin Castle is a ten minute walk from the hotel. Time ran out for us, but the guided tour of the castle takes you into the State Rooms where the Queen visited in 2011. This is our must do for when we return to Dublin. When we do return to Dublin, we'll make sure that we stay at Brooks Hotel!",5,2015,05,18
236,Convenient and comfortable,"The second leg of our Ireland trip (after spending a week in the countryside) was four nights in Dublin. My wife found the Brooks for us as we were planning the trip, and I'm glad she did. It was so centrally located for us...everything we wanted to see in Dublin was a relatively short walk away, and the two day trips we opted to take outside the city departed literally a five-minute walk from the hotel. The accommodations were fine (comfortable and extremely clean), and the staff was superb. But neither the amenities nor the hotel restaurants (which we didn't try) were special draws for us. Rather, the ""find"" here was a very good hotel in a fantastic location for a reasonable price.",4,2015,05,18
236,Excellent hotel and great location,"As a repeat guest at the Brooks, I would recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin. Located in the Creative Quarter, you are no more than a 15 minute walk from everything Dublin has to offer. The staff are welcoming and ready to attend to your every need. I wish all hotels were this good.",5,2015,05,18
236,Great location!,"Super nice staff, top location for nightlife, people and shopping. We had a celabration and our room was prepared inb the nicest way with flowers, sweets etc. Staff nice and friendly, easy access with car",5,2015,05,16
236,Quiet Contentment,"Tucked away on a quiet street in a very busy downtown Dublin, we were more than impressed with the fantastic service and attention to detail throughout the hotel. The front desk staff are extremely helpful and accommodating, and the restaurant staff consistently go out of their way to ensure guest satisfaction.
we were very pleased with our stay at this property.",5,2015,05,13
236,Excellent Service,"Have nothing negative to say about the hotel and staff. Absolutely excellent. 
Room facilities great, lots of toiletries, clean, very comfy bed. We had chocolate left on our pillow every night and curtains closed for us. 
Great little bar full of different whiskeys. Pianist one evening. 
Breakfast was excellent, great choices and fresh home made bread and scones etc. 
if the hotel had a pool I'm sure it would be 5 star. 
We will definitely stay again",5,2015,05,13
236,Ideal if you are visiting inter city,We spent 9 nights here in April- the first night we arrived we were set up in a clean - comfy room - but not much space for being there for so long! But that was quickly resolved - I should have gotten her name but failed to but she was head of housekeeping and we expressed our concern about the space we had to her in the morning- we were peeping around in the other rooms and noticed some were much larger and she took the time to even show us one that was available - we asked if maybe we could switch rooms - we were told to go ahead and go to breakfast and when we returned she had it all set up and had our new key cards waiting for us - so thankful - I would highly recommend this Hotel - everyone was very friendly and attentive!,4,2015,05,11
236,GOOD CHOICE,"This is a very well located hotel hotel with very good staff. The rooms are a good size with good beds and nice modern bathrooms. Breakfast and dinner excellent, a nice bar and a quiet lounge for residents downstairs. We were a group of 30 and all very happy with this hotel. The Hairy Lemon pub on the next corner was a genuine Irish pub with good food and, like all Irish pubs, plenty of it. Would definitely recommend the Brooks which is close to most of the major attractions.",4,2015,05,10
236,Lovely Hotel great location ,"The Brooks Hotel on Drury Street is a beautiful boutique Classically styled hotel ideally located right in the heart of Dublin. The rooms were comfortable with large beds, great linens and clean, updated bathrooms. The staff was friendly & helpful. We got into Dublin extremely early (before our room was ready) and the staff stowed our luggage and showed us to their quiet lounge downstairs where you can relax or even take a snooze. The dining room and bar were lovely and the breakfast was delicious! Highly recommend it. ",5,2015,05,09
236,Fantastic from start to end!,"Given rooms to check in to despite being early. A few minor issues with the first room but reception immediately upgraded us no hassle! Being able to choice from 4 different pillow types made sure my partner and I were both happy! The concierge was so helpful i Swear he must know everything! Breakfast was delicious and so much to chose from, I ate something different for all 5 days! Would absolutely recommend and return should I ever be back in Dublin",5,2015,05,07
236,Excellent city centre hotel,"A fantastic hotel from beginning to end! Very courteous staff. Rooms were spacious and very cosy on cold December evening! Breakfast was a bit flustered as a big crowed accumulated but enjoyed once seated! Would definitely stay again as location was perfect to all restaurants and bars.
              ",5,2015,05,05
236,Ideal to explore the city,"We stayed for 3 nights in the Brooks hotel during the Easter weekend. I had selected this hotel because of its central location, surrounded by restaurants and at the right distance from the Temple Bar District:   at walking distance to enjoy a drink but far enough to be able to withdraw when you have seen enough drunk people (especially during weekends).
Nevertheless, especially when the weather is good & people are outside, the area can be quite busy and noisy. However, the double glass windows of the hotel amazingly lock out all the noise and guarantee a good night rest.  The room itself is pretty standard and not enormous. But it’s clean and has everything you need for a couple of nights in the city.
Breakfast is a real plus in this hotel: a combination of buffet & complementary à la carte gives you plenty of choice.
Across the street there’s a parking garage which might come handy when driving to Dublin. However keep in mind that this garage is not 24h open.  We came by Airlink bus (747) which stops in Dame Street, only 4 minutes away by foot from the hotel.  Just remind to take a map as the narrow streets might be confusing at first.
In summary, the Brooks hotel is a good choice when staying in Dublin.",4,2015,05,04
236,Wow will be back,"Spent one night here whilst visiting Dublin, we couldn't of chosen better.
The hotel is centrally located and looked contempory.  We landed early morning, staff greeted us with smiles checked us in and took our luggage until we were able to access the rooms.  Staff were so friendly, offered us maps and pointed out some of Dublins high lights.
Rooms were clean, spacious and modern.  You had a choice of 4 types of pillows and you could ring reception to change them:). We had a good nights sleep in the bed, very comfy and large.
Our bed was automatically turned down, curtains drawn and a chocolate left on our pillows - nice touch.
The toiletries were White Company - nice
Had a drink in the Jasmine Bar on our return, again staff were freindly and served us:)
Breakfast was excellent, good choice - continental then a choice of cooked breakfast.  The kitchen was open, which is always a positive.
The hotel served decaf coffee which the majority of places didn't.
I hope I haven't missed anything as this hotel was outstanding.",5,2015,05,01
236,Great Hotel and great service,"The hotel is in the center and the service have been wonderful! 
We had the pleasure to enjoy a really good whisky tasting in the Jasmine Bar at the hotel and everything has been fantastic! I really recommend this place and I will come back next time I am in Dublin.",5,2015,04,28
236,IMD Group visit - 25 people.,"How can you possibly please 25 people at the same time?
Visit Brooks Hotel in Dublin - the quality of the rooms, location, staff and food are without doubt the best we have experienced.   Over a three day period during April 2015 we had a trouble free, comfortable and very friendly visit.   Close to the shops, restaurants and all tourist amenities, this is a great hotel with good value for money.",5,2015,04,25
236,"Great Location and Staff, a few room issues","First, the location is great - you can pretty much walk to all the city center places, but if not, cabs are plentiful and pretty cheap (compared to the states).  If you get breakfast, it's pretty good with a lot of options.  They do have a sauna and small gym - 1 treadmill, 1 bike, 1 elliptical (iirc) and one plain bench with dumbells up to ~20lbs.  Rooms are a really good size for Europe and have a nice elegance.  The staff is very friendly and excellent - top notch.  

""Issues"" I had - the shower hot/cold ""regulation"" was terrible.  It would go from hot to cold at least 4 times in a 5-7m shower.  They somewhat fixed it our third day so that it only adjusted 2 times per 7m but this was really annoying at first, but tolerated it the last few days.  Other thing was that the walls have no sound barrier - I could literally hear the guy on the other side of the wall snoring every night.

Overall, I'd rate 3.5/5 - I wouldn't say a great value.  I'd stay here again then test the shower first :)",3,2015,04,24
236,Nice Hotel that Walking Distance to Everything,"We stayed 2 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin and the location was great, as we were able to walk to so many sights and attractions. Breakfast at the hotel was good, and the rooms were quieter than I expected from the amount of traffic on the street level. If driving to the hotel, it can be a little tricky to get to, even with GPS. I would avoid driving at all in Dublin if possible. The 24 hour parking garage is not too far, and the discount we received through the hotel for parking saved us around 50 euros for the weekend. The staff was also excellent the entire time, and were very helpful with directions, etc. We did have one noisy person down the hall wake us in the middle of the night stumbling in. Overall, this was a great hotel with a very nice room and great location, and is also close to restaurants, bars and nightlife. However, because of that, it may not be the most peaceful.",4,2015,04,23
236,Elegance in the heart of Dublin,"Luxury hotel in the centre of Dublin only a few minutes walk from Trinity College (Book of Kells), the Ha'penny Bridge, Temple Bar etc and close to the airport express stop. Good sized room, not large but more than adequate and well maintained. There was a bit of street noise when the pubs closed but that's a trade-off for being in the heart of the city. Very friendly staff. Only minor gripes would be that there is a comfortable resident lounge but it didn't have coffee and tea facilities; and we arrived after an overnight trans-Atlantic flight and it would have been nice to have been able to check-in early. It was Friday evening and the hotel had advised that they couldn't guarentee early check-in so no false promises and we were able to leave our bags which they had taken to our room by the time we returned.",5,2015,04,22
236,"Good small hotel, great location","We arrived early and were met with a warm greeting and our luggage was put into storage.The hotel is small and all the better for it. The location is great for all Dublin has to offer, lots of restaurants and bars nearby. The rooms are well presented and quiet. All the staff we met were froendlya nd efficient. The breakfast buffet offers a wide choice along with the hot breakfast made to order. I would stay here again and hope to do so.",4,2015,04,22
236,Fantastic.,"Enjoyed a fantastic overnight stay last weekend. Thoroughly exceeded our expectations. The customer service was exceptional from pre-arrival to departure. 
We booked a standard room which was fabulous. We were pleasantly surprised to find a 'turn down' service without requesting it on our return on Saturday night - just another fantastic touch.
Breakfast was freshly cooked and delicious and the cold buffet, very plentiful.
The location was fantastic. We have been to Dublin a couple of times before and will not consider staying anywhere else again! Thank You for a great stay!",5,2015,04,21
236,Spacious room in City Centre,"We girls stayed at Brooks Hotel for three nights without breakfast. Room 116 is a classic room with a double bed.
There's enough storage space in the closet and also for two big sized suitcases. The bed is quite big and there's a pillow menu.
Bathroom with bath tub and also large storage room for two girl's toiletries.
The room is on the first floor, window towards Dury Street. And this is the only criticism I've got: we had to leave the window closed and yet, we could hear the noise comming from the Dury Street Car Park. Some noise insulation could be the key.
All in all; good value for money ",4,2015,04,21
236,Excellent Atmosphere and Location ,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights while visiting Dublin. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. The concierge will go beyond to help accommodate your needs and always remembered my name. 

The location was perfect to walk everywhere from Guiness Storehouse to Jameson and all the sites in between. Also a short walk to temple bar for a bit of night life. 

I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,04,19
236,Always the same always Excellent,"This was my second time staying at Brooks, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you get ‘good old Irish hospitality’ in every form.  

Reception staff are so welcoming and helpful, the breakfast…. an absolute treat and nothing is too much to ask, the rooms cozy, beautifully kept and the guarantee of a great nights rest so that you can continue to walk the wonderful streets of Dublin the next day.  

I will always say... see you the next time because in Dublin Brooks Hotel always makes you want to come back. I think that is true testimony to a hotel or any lodgings... do you want to come back here, Absolutely!",5,2015,04,17
236,Clean and efficient hotel,"Clean and pleasant hotel in city center...within walking distance to everything.   Requested a king bed and they gladly accommodated without charge.  Pleasant front desk staff.
Great breakfast with lots of good choices.",3,2015,04,14
236,wonderful stay,Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 8 nights from 4/3 until the 12th everything was great. We arrived early into Dublin and met our son who is studying at Trinity this semester figured we would try the hotel to see if we could get in early and had no problem getting a room at 9am. The room had a king bed and was plenty big for the 2 of us bathroom was clean and well appointed. We had breakfast in the hotel 3 times during our stay and excellent every time. The staff was extra friendly and attentive both in the hotel and the restaurant. The concierge Conor met us at the door at check in and remembered our names every time we ran into him with great recommendations and advice our cab was waiting downstairs upon our departure.. We would definitely stay again when in Dublin and the location is not to be beaten   Thanks,5,2015,04,14
236,Great Hotel!,"I stayed over the Easter weekend, great hotel, very central, spotless clean and really nice helpful staff. We stayed in a Deluxe room a little bit on the small side but well equipped. There is a car park opposite and over night parking is around 12euro but the only problem is that rate only applies after 5pm so if you arrive earlier you pay by the hour. The hotel is Directly behind the Gaiety Theatre which is perfect if you are catching a performance! I will most definitely be back and will recommend to friends...",4,2015,04,13
236,Excellent Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our mini honeymoon at the beginning of April. We chose the hotel as it looked luxury in the photos, and based on other reviews on here and we are so glad we did; it was perfect for our mini honeymoon break.
We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights which was just long enough to feel we had sufficiently enjoyed the city and the hotel was in such a good location for exploring. It is within walking distance of all of the major attractions - trinity college, dublin castle, the guinness storehouse, jameson whiskey distillery and temple bar.
The hotel itself was excellent - we paid extra for a deluxe room and we are so glad we did. It was spacious, clean, comfy and had a lovely bathroom. The shower was powerful  (although it did go through spells of being freezing and boiling but then thats to be expected in a hotel with many other guests using the water!). A deluxe room also comes with dressing gowns and a digital radio which were a nice touch and we loved the chocolates on our pillows at night.
The hotel has a wonderful bar area which we used twice - once for a very wonderfully tasty and well priced scone (with jam and cream) and tea and once for my husband to enjoy a whisky (once he had finally narrowed it down to one - they have a lot!)
The staff were also very friendly.
We loved our stay at the Brooks hotel and if we ever visit Dublin again we would stay at this hotel.",5,2015,04,11
236,Great location,"We thought that this was in a really nice area of Dublin. Lots of nice boutique shops in the area and plenty of restaurants and places to eat. My boyfriend is in a wheelchair and we had a disabled room. When we arrived there was no shower seat attached to the wall and only a small stool. When we called down to reception they managed to locate a shower chair that was perfect as it had brakes and arms that came up. 

There was debate as to whether we would get access to this chair as another room may have been using it. If all disabled rooms were occupied, this would have caused a problem, so the hotel either need to have a showerchair available for each room, or simply have shower seats attached to the wall which wouldn't be difficult. 

The other comment I would make, and most hotels are guilty of this, if you have a disabled room it's better to try and keep the room uncluttered from unnecessary furniture that just gets in the way. 

Breakfast was OK - really nice yoghurt and compote, sausages tasted processed and only got one slice of bacon!

Room was very noisy as it was over the back of some restaurants and there were loud fans going most of the night, plus I don't think the window seal was brilliant which made the sound worse. 

Overall when we had an issue, the staff were helpful. We did report the fan not working in the bathroom, but it was never fixed. Later we found that a technician had come round, but they were missing a specific part which is why it hadn't been fixed. To give the hotel their dues, they did send us a letter after we left our comments.",4,2015,04,11
236,Boutique Hotel-recommend fully!,"Great short break to this hotel!
Butler service when you arrive, opening doors, taking your bags etc
Receptionists really helpful, given that it was our first time to the city (4 girls away for a birthday) a map was provided and letting us know the best restaurants and bars to go too!
I had emailed the hotel in advance being it was my best friends birthday so asked for interconnecting rooms with our other friends, this was honoured along with a lovely surprise of 2 beautifully decorated cupcakes and in chocolate writing reading Happy Birthday.
Our last day here we sat in the bar area by the fireplace and had about 45 mins to spare before ou cab arrived, we both ordered a tea and a cheese board to share.
Both where very tasty and was a great finish to a perfect weekend.
Will be back soon-recommend fully!",5,2015,04,10
236,"Excellent location, great staff","my friend arrived hours before me. They got her a room early, which allowed her to rest and eat breakfast, and what a fabulous breakfast. We had it included and it was well worth it. The staff was so gracious and helpful.  It is within walking distance of major attractions, and they got us a very generous discount on parking.",5,2015,04,08
236,Worth every penny,"Me and my fiancé have just got back from spending four days here, the staff are so pleasant and nothing is too much  trouble for them, they even left little mini eggs on our pillows for us :)  The food is outstanding and so much choice. I would certainly stay here again ",5,2015,04,07
236,''Can we stay just one more night?'',"We chose to stay at the Brooks hotel this weekend just gone. A party of nine of us were celebrating my sisters 40th birthday with a weekend away in Dublin. 

From the minute we pulled up at the hotel the concierge, Conor, carried our luggage and made us feel so welcome without us having to lift a finger. He went on to advise us on the best nightlife, places and tips when in Ireland. He was also a true gentleman and a good laugh! In addition all of the staff went out of their way to help us in any way they could from locating shops to satisfying our hungover need for loads of toast! 

The food was incredible. Every morning a luxurious buffet was provided with the addition of a cooked breakfast or anything you wanted and needed. The waitresses were kind and very friendly and we felt very welcomed and also very full by the time we left! 

The rooms were immaculate down to the last chocolate on the pillow. I shared with two others in a room with three single beds. The rooms were clean, comfortable and a home away from home. 

The only criticism I could make was that the hairdryers were not powerful at all and our room as right next to the generator so there was a ticking noise constantly during the night which was slightly annoying. 

Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be near the city and also have a comfortable and relaxing stay.",4,2015,03,31
236,the best hotel in Dublin,stayed  at this great hotel for 4 day in the heart of Dublin we had a great time the hotel and staff was very good the hotel was very clean and comfortable if we go back to Dublin it well be my first hotel I will look at,5,2015,03,29
236,"Central location, great value for money and froendly staff","Stayed at this hotel on a weekend break to Dublin.  It is in a Central location but on a quiet side street with smallish, but very comfortable equipped bedroom.  Excellent breakfast with very friendly and helpful staff.  Great value for money",5,2015,03,28
236,Next time i will stay for much longer,"What a shame I had only time to spend one night in this extremely friendly hotel. The location is very central, just off Grafton Street and literally round the corner from the Gaiety Theatre. For a senior citizen, a taxi is necessary to go shopping in O'Connell and Henry Streets but a younger fitter person could easily walk. The area around the hotel has numerous bars and cafes, so the location is excellent.
The bedroom was well furnished and spotlessly clean and I was impressed by the toiletries, iron and board, trouser press, free wi-fiand tea and coffee making facilities. This hotel has obviously thought about the requirements of its guests. I was thrilled with the pillow menu whereby it is possible to choose a specific type of pillow to ensure a peaceful night's rest. The breakfast was lovely, wide variety for continental buffet and hot breakfast ordered fresh from the menu. No danger of the full cooked English sitting for a couple of hours! My crepe was delicious to eat and lovely to look at!  Decadence at its best. However the greatest aspect of Brooks Hotel is the staff to whom nothing seems a chore. They are happy and friendly and efficient, always willing to give helpful little tips  - so important for a visitor. As I said initially, I only stayed for one night but I left feeling refreshed and with a good feeling. Hopefully I will return again soon.",5,2015,03,26
236,Weekend Away w/o kids!! Definitely recommend this hotel.,"Hotel booked by my Husband as a belated birthday gift. Went with another couple and we all said how friendly the staff were, how clean the hotel was and how comfortable the rooms were. This was in fact my first ever hotel stay where I had very comfortable pillows!! Normally a bug bear when you stay in some hotels. The breakfast was more than adequate and the bar and dining area were great. There was a wonderful guests lounge on the lower floor which was a great little surprise. The location couldn't have been better, so much choice for drink and food right on your doorstep and far enough away from the livelier Temple Bar Area. Our room faced the Car Park and there was a small bar/pub on the corner but we never heard any noise from it, even though people were out on the street drinking. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would happily stay here again.",5,2015,03,24
236,Great Location and Welcoming Staff,"Background: Family of 3 including a very active 3 year old toddler boy. Toddler is well behaved although he can have his days. 

Location: The cab from the airport costed us 30EU. Perfect location in Dublin. Within walking distance to St. Stephen’s Green, good pubs, shopping district, adorable cafes and shops. No parking available on property — parking garage across the street. I believe the hotel offers a price deal. 

Hospitality: Staff at the front desk was happy, helpful and knowledgable. From check-in to check-out everyone greeted us with a smile. Connor and Marvin (concierges) were fantastic! Connor was especially attentive and nice towards my son. He made sure to talk to him every day and make him feel welcome. Connor was also happy to help us plan our day and even offered to give us bread to feed the ducks in St. Stephen’s Green (my son loved this). Marvin gave us excellent recommendations for places to dine in. He was meticulous in asking questions to offer the best advice. We loved every place he recommended. 

Breakfast: We opted for the Bed & Breakfast Option. When you arrive at the restaurant there is a buffet with home made breads, scones, muffins, etc. Everything was delicious. In addition, we could order one plate for each of us. The hot plates were very good, the service was great and we were in and out in a timely manner. 

Comfort: The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The view from our room was not the best (air conditioners), however, we did not care as we were barely in the room during our visit to Dublin. We stayed in the first floor facing the back of the hotel. At night, there was some noise in the hallways but it was people getting into their rooms. The noise would subside very quickly. 

Lounge/Seating room: The Brooks has a small seating area by the entrance, however, it would fill up pretty quickly making it a bit hard to hang out while waiting for tours. We did see a guest lounge sign, however, the guest lounge seemed to be downstairs underneath the reception area making it harder to wait for your tour.

Hair Dryer: Awful! Bring your own hair dryer and a converter! They have the old style hair drying machine that is hooked to the wall (the kind you find in cruise cabins) and that makes it eternal to dry your hair. 

Kid Friendly: Everyone was pleasant and went above and beyond to make our toddler feel at home. 

Additional Comments: Free Wi-fi but low signal in our room. 

Recommended? YES! We would definitely recommend to stay here. We plan to visit Dublin again and we will be staying at Brooks Hotel for sure.",4,2015,03,22
236,welcoming hotel,"Ideally located just off Grafton Street right in the centre of the city this is a 4 star hotel with a loyal following the rooms are various in size and spotless in every way it has a nice restaurant which serves dinner but we only take breakfast there because Dublin has a wide choice of restaurants to sample, the bar is small but with atmosphere not too keen on the pushy Polish barman that has been there for a few years.",4,2015,03,20
236,Wonderful stay,"Had a fantastic time at Brooks Hotel.Staff were very friendly and helpful.I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a 4 star hotel . The hotel is centrally located near to grafton street.
gillian",5,2015,03,18
236,Lovely,"Lovely hotel ticked all the boxes, comfortable good food and that little bit extra, you could choose even the pillows preferred.  Hair drier I blessed saved me carrying and the Staff were really welcoming would definitely go again.",5,2015,03,16
236,Very nice in city centre,"The room was very nice, the bed made for a good night's sleep and the shower had great pressure. My wife and me enjoyed a drink in the bar and really liked the atmosphere. This hotel is very central and close to many restaurants and pubs so it is a good base. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a great stay.",4,2015,03,13
236,Short and sweet,"Sadly my sampling of the delights of this wonderfully situated, boutique hotel was limited to an overnighter. However, the welcome was warm, the ambiance sophisticated and the customer service very nearly faultless. My in-room breakfast order was not collected, so I was offered a complimentary one in the restaurant, along with profuse apologies. The room was more than adequate, bathroom excellent with a top notch shower. I would welcome the chance for a longer stay.",4,2015,03,09
236,Excellent location,"A great spot in the centre of Dublin surrounded by some excellent eating places and shopping .
Booked three nights here with Small Luxury Hotels and were not disppointed though a few minor issues would not allow me to give them 5 .
Staff are friendly and welcoming ,though nobody bothered  to take us and our luggage to the room.
Room was fine ,comfortable but limited cupboard space .
Not sure if the staff have got the hang of gluten free.",4,2015,03,08
236,Good location.,"The staff were very efficient, friendly and helpful. Room was a little small but clean and tidy. Bed was comfortable. Ideally located for a city break. We complained about a small issue and it was dealt with immediately. Nothing was too much trouble. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,07
236,"A 4-star hotel that is centrally located, but nothing else","Good - comfortable room, adequately sized bathroom and amenities, nice breakfast, centrally located and easy access to restaurants
Bad - tv channels very limited (no sports or news - cnn, etc), asked for a room with a king-size bed but got a 3rd single bed in the room as well, very small corridors to rooms (can be an issue in case of an emergency), carpets and upholstery need to be changed especially in public areas, seating in reception is inappropriate, housekeeping does not clean the room before 2pm, daily newspaper in the room is provided only if asked everyday!",3,2015,03,05
236,Excellent location and staff,"Brooks hotel is situated in a convenient street close to all major Dublin attractions.
Our room was spacious and very comfortable, the only downside is that it was facing a car park, so not a great view!
The staff have been brilliant, very helpful and friendly without being too intrusive.
Breakfasts have been absolutely amazing.
Cannot fault them.",4,2015,03,04
236,"Good service, good food, but rooms a little small and tired","We visited Dublin for the the rugby and stayed at the Brooks for two nights. As with almost everyone we encountered the staff at the hotel could not have been better. Check in was fast and smooth and we were in our room before we new it.

The room was ok, but it was quite small and could have done with a re-furb. The bed was there for smaller than we were used to but comfy enough with an excellent pillow menu to choose from.

We ate breakfast at the hotel once which was superb. A really lovely choice and beautifully cooked.

The bar staff were also excellent. 

Location is also very good with easy access to the centre of Dublin",4,2015,03,03
236,PERFECT PLACE TO STAY!!,We stayed at this hotel in November on our family trip to Ireland.  This hotel was situated perfectly to get around Dublin!  The staff was wonderful!  Loved the doorman!!  The rooms looked exactly as they were pictured and were wonderful!  ,5,2015,03,03
236,Friendly elegant and ideally placed,In the heart of Dublin and close to the shopping area. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Rooms are elegant and very comfortable but especially the beds. Bathrooms larger than in most hotels with both a bath and shower. Great breakfast selection and excellent bar area which we used twice for lunch. Would definitely use this hotel again.,5,2015,03,03
236,Classic luxury hotel in central location,"Excellent courteous staff. Nice spacious comfortable rooms. Great breakfast with waiter service. Restaurant otherwise not availed of. Bar area/ lounge pleasantly comfortable, uncrowded and not noisy.  Overall, very good, if a bit pricy.",5,2015,03,01
236,"Stylish, comfortable with lovely staff","I love the bar area in this hotel, it is spacious, comfortable and a great place to meet for coffee and food with friends. The staff are really nice and helpful. Herbal teas are excellent and the food is really nice too.",5,2015,02,26
236,"Classy, cosy and central","Who knew?? Brooks Hotel in the heart of Dublin City is a clean, classy, comfortable, cosy hotel.  We spent a weekend there this month - the room was surprisingly elegant and comfortable.  Breakfast was delicious - the homemade marmalade and jams are super tasty! Perfect location for city mooching :)",5,2015,02,23
236,A little piece of heaven,"Stayed for two nights midweek, staff at reception very helpful and pleasant. The room on 3rd floor (Deluxe) was the little piece of ""heaven"" very comfortable and quiet, bed was huge I'm over 6ft so had no problem moving about. Breakfast was one of the tastiest we have had in any hotel for a long time. The only problem we had was the bar it was cold and the girl serving had no idea how to deal customers and as a Guinness drinker in Dublin the pint reminded of how they are served in a UK hotel,,,,,",5,2015,02,19
236,Not sure about it,"First visit to this hotel. Booked via booking.com and on check in receptionist tried to overcharge me by €140 for two night stay, luckily I had my booking confirmation and was able to prove my booking price, which was then agreed. Hotel was clean and tidy and in a good location. I would suggest the hotel is suitable for those who will be out and about most of the time as there is not much to do about the hotel. Breakfast was tasty although the staff could do with learning a bit more about customer interaction. All in all just not sure about it.",3,2015,02,17
236,a horrid stay,"First impressions - a large very dirty rug on entering reception.  There were never enough staff on duty at reception - often there was a queue as there  would be only one person on the desk - if the queue stretched to more than 5 people someone would come out from the office! 
The room was large and nicely decorated.  It was extremely clean but getting just a little tired.  The bed was very large but not very comfortable - too soft in the centre and then a hard edge that you had to ""climb"" over to get to the floor! There was only one plug to use - surely not enough in this age of technology.
Breakfast was very tasty. Service was efficient but completely lacking in any friendliness or charm - I never saw a member of breakfast staff smile at any customer.
Brooks hotel is perfectly nice but the main problem is the staff - I found none of them at all friendly and many were not even efficient.  My TV either did not work or had a blurry screen - staff had no interest in fixing this problem and treated me as if I was the problem. A truly horrible stay.
To put this review in context I often review on Trip advisor and have given a few 3 stars but mostly 4 or 5 stars. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2015,02,14
236,"Excellent location, cozy room","My partner and I just stayed at Brooks for our first stay in Dublin. The 2 best pros to the hotel are the staff and location. After a red eye flight from JFK, we arrived too early for check-in. We were extremely tired so I asked if they had a deluxe room available (we orginally booked a regular junior suite). They had a larger room available and provided us a discount for taking the upgrade. The staff is very welcoming and warm. Though small, the room itself was clean, quiet (we were on 6th) and very comfortable. We were very happy that we decided to opt for the deluxe. The location of the hotel is excellent, making everything in center city Dublin within walking distance. The farthest we walked was to the Tara train station, which took about 20 mins. The food at the resturant there was also surprising good - a break from pub food in the area. Though the pubs are great around there. We went to the Hairy Lemon, which is right around the corner. It's a better option than the louder, more toursity places at Temple Bar. Overall, we'd recommend staying at Brooks.",4,2015,02,11
236,Great find!,"A lovely hotel in a fabulous location.  Only minutes walk from some great shopping, Temple Bar and lots of amazing Restaurants. Pretty central to almost everything you want to do whilst in Dublin.  Despite hotel being almost fully booked we hardly saw anyone, very quiet and extremely helpful, polite staff. Very comfortable, beautifully decorated rooms and an amazing full Irish breakfast. Would definitely recommend a stay. ",5,2015,02,10
236,Best hotel I've ever stayed in!,I stayed in this hotel for one night on a short break to Dublin and we were all very impressed! Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help in any way they could. The hotel was centrally located and within easy walking distance to the bars and shops. Breakfast was lovely with a big choice. Rooms were beautifully decorated and the bed was the comfiest I've ever been in. There was even a pillow menu whereby you could choose your own pillow to suit your needs. Will definitely stay here again when we return back to Dublin. Thank you again! ,5,2015,02,09
236,Classy hotel...first class service,"Stayed for one night over the weekend and would absolutley recommend this hotel. The location is perfect, right in the centre of the city nestled in between lots of bustling little streets filled with restaurants, bars and shops and within 3 minutes walk of Dublin's main shopping area, Grafton street. The hotel itself is excellent, from the concierge, the front desk through to the bar, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Check in was quick with no fuss or waiting. Bags were promptly delivered to our room which was had been recently refurbished. The room itself was decorated very tastefully with luxurious wallpaper and beautiful soft furnishings. The bed was super kingsize and was extremely comfortable & the power shower was amazing. We stayed on the 2nd floor but I didn't notice any noise from the street below and it was a Saturday night so the streets were busy.
Multi story parking is available directly across the street from the hotel where there is a very good overnight rate available.
This hotel delivers on first class accomodation and service. Will definitley be back again",5,2015,02,09
236,"Excellent Location, Staff, Food and accomodations","I stayed 6 nights on a business / couple trip. The location is perfect, just in the center of everything: Landmarks, restaurants, malls, etc. The service is really good and helpful and the breakfasts are some you must definitely try.

The bed was particularly comfortable and the choice of pillows is a nice touch.

Internet is free and pretty good for almost every need.

Only thing I would make a note is the TV options, but that is something usual on almost every hotel.

I would definitely go back anytime and/or recommend this.",5,2015,02,03
236,Excellent location,We stayed here for two nights recently. The hotel has an excellent location in the city centre. Parking is directly across the street. The staff were very friendly. The only little issue was that the signal on the tv came and went a bit so it was difficult to watch a programme but we were out most of the time so it didn't bother us and it was snowing so that could have interfered with the signal. I would go back again.,4,2015,02,02
236,Can't wait to stay again ,"I have to say I really enjoyed every thing about this hotel highly recommend a stay at brooks hotel staff more that helpful, Connor is a gem of a man really nice man pleasure meeting him thanks Connor you made  my stay a very membmrol one .Breakfast was so tasty ate far to much. Looking forward to my next visit thanks to all the staff of brooks hotel, April.  
 ",5,2015,02,01
236,Delightful & Well Appointed Hotel with Wonderful Staff,"From the minute the engaging doorman greets you at the door, you know you have arrived in Dubln.  Beautifully decorated and well appointed hotel with great service.  Excellent breakfast. Great location.  Comfortable rooms",5,2015,01,31
236,"Location, Comfortable, Friendly, Satisfied","I don't often give 5 stars  but this hotel deserves it, it is a small hotel. But what it lacks in spas, swimming pools  etc., it makes up  for in the friendliness of its staff, quality of  the breakfast ,and its location,  close to  restaurants, shops, and some of  central Dublins attractions., a little gem in the heart of Dublin.",5,2015,01,30
236,Perfect city centre location,"Stayed at this hotel last Saturday night, the location is excellent right in the heart of the action, close to shops, bars and restaurants.  Our bedroom at the back of the hotel may not have had the best of views, but was lovely, bed was very comfortable and it was very quiet.
We ate in the restaurant with friends and really enjoyed the meal, service was very friendly and unrushed. 
Breakfast has a lovely choice of cold items including home made breads and delicious banana loaf, the hot food came fresh from the kitchen which i always prefer to the self serve hot food.
There is a car park just opposite the front door with special rates which is very handy. 
Will definitely be back next time I need a hotel in town.",5,2015,01,30
236,Great nights stay,"This hotel is really something the rooms are very well,appointmented. While it's dublin and the room isn't hugely spacious the rooms are not small either. You are in for a treat if you stay at this hotel the staff were superb from arrival until departure. Breakfast is also really nice and served in a nice open area. The reception and the doorman were both superb this hotel gives you that feel good. Really great stay would recommend and would return.
Location is superb to for shopping and visiting areas around dublin.",4,2015,01,29
236,Perfect location ,Great central location in Dublin for a weekend away . Drury St car park is just across the road . Service in reception was prompt and efficient . Breakfast was excellent and served at the table which is always a plus. Quality food on offer also. It can be on the pricey side given its location but it in walking distance of central Dublin   ,4,2015,01,22
236,"Unexpectedly brilliant, Described as hidden away in a quiet back street, turned out at the centre of Dublin's heart","Short break for a concert at Vicar Street made Brooks Hotel a handy and acceptable base for a long weekend in Dublin. Hotel is rated 4 star and exceeds all standards. Room on 5th floor spacious and very well appointed, no street noise as mentioned in other reviews. Full Irish breakfast well prepared, Staff including Connor very friendly and helpful. Would recommend to any discerning Temple Bar visitors.",4,2015,01,21
236,"Great location, friendly staff, watch the roots","Booked on recommendation of a colleague for a nearby Conference. Friendly reception and nice room with all the bits and pieces (soap, iron+ board, tea/ coffee, free wifi). Dinner reasonably priced and attentive service. Amused by the 'mixed vegetables' portions with my confit duck, which consisted of potato, parsnip, carrot and beetroot- back to my Irish roots :) Breakfast limited but reasonably priced. Friendly bar staff that kept the kitchen open for our late comers. Great location for Central Dublin. Sleep disruption from clanking on air conditioning when it started up from time to time, but reception keen to fix it when mentioned.",4,2015,01,20
236,Great place to begin our visit to Ireland,"This is a nice hotel in a very convenient location - we could easily walk to Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, and lots of good restaurants.  Also an easy walk to the airport bus and the hop on/hop off bus. The hotel has a guest lounge for those of us who arrive in the morning before the rooms are available.  We got good advice from the concierge about where to buy sim cards for our cell phones and it was a quick walk to Grafton Street to the O2 phone store.  The rooms were comfortable, although there was some water damagein the bathroom and the shower door didn't work very well so I almost got stuck inside. The breakfast was very good, with many choices available.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to Dublin travelers.",4,2015,01,19
236,A perfect choice,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Not often I have been to a hotel with such friendly and professional staff! From the people in the reception, to the them in the bar and them doing the cleaning.
We were 13 persons travelling together, and we all agreed in this.",5,2015,01,19
236,Great location,"Great location in the midddle of Dublin city centre-two minute walk from Grafton Street and surrounded by a huge choice of trendy bars, restaurants and shops. Very helpful and friendly staff. Comfortable , clean bedrooms with good showers. We went to a show in the Olympia Theatre- ideally located near here.",5,2015,01,16
236,Perfect location,"Excellent place for a stay in Dublin. We liked the atmosphere, the kindness of all members of staff, the cleanliness, and the comfort of the bed. At the reception, they are always ready to help you for any request. We spent there an excellent stay for New Year, and will certainly come back when in Dublin. Very good breakfast, and good wifi...",5,2015,01,15
236,A winner,"This hotel has everything going for it. Number one is definatly the location. Rooms are nice the beds are super comfy and it's quiet, we stayed New Years eve and slept like logs ( once we finally went to bed ) Breakfast is also good. We had a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2015,01,14
236,Gem in the City,"Perfect hotel if you want to be close to Stephen's Green/Grafton Street area. Great service, lovely room, really good breakfast! Also enjoyed Tapas in a place across the street - Fade Street Social! (Reservations would be a good idea to eat there though).",5,2015,01,13
236,Stayed for the holidays.,"Connor the concierge made our stay. He was very knowledgeable,friendly and made our stay feel special. A real gem!
The hotel is in the heart of town,so no need for a car. We had a car and the problem was parking is a hassle and expensive.
The breakfast was good,but took a good amount time to be served.
Overall a very pleasant stay!",5,2015,01,13
236,Lovely cosy atmosphere,Lovely reception area and bar.  Great cosy place for a drink or two or three before moving onto some other great bars in the area.  The staff are great and it's in a perfect location.  Highly recommended hotel!,4,2015,01,13
236,One Night Only,"It was a perfect location for a night out in Stephen's Green meeting friends after the holidays. I didn't have a chance to hit the shops since we arrived around 6pm and left the next day by noon. Nice hotel - booked the night before by phone although when we arrived no record of reservation until about 5 mins later then it showed up. Rooms were nice- clean, beds comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was tasty. Bit pricey for the night but I suppose it is the location you are paying. Not sure would I go back - probably book somewhere less money.",3,2015,01,13
236,Good location and friendly staff,"I stay at the Brooks Hotel whenever I visit my company's Dublin headquarters. Our office is located in Blanchardstown, but I make it a point to stay here because the location is perfect for dining in the evening. While the amenities are not on-PAR with many five-star hotels in the area, the hotel makes up for this by having a remarkable staff. An added bonus, the Brooks Hotel is one of the top hotels worldwide for Whiskey lovers. I've yet to try their Jasmine Bar's Whiskey Experience, but will do so when the opportunity presents itself.",5,2015,01,12
236,Great Hotel in a Good Location,"We stayed for three nights, had a nicely furnished room, with a decent bathroom - all clean and well kept.  Concierge was excellent. Hot breakfast was well served, and they managed to look after us very early on the day of departure.  Bar is open late, and is very comfortable.  The location is excellent, with many attractions and restaurants within easy walking distance.  Altogether a great place for a tourist wanting to investigate the city.",5,2015,01,11
236,Very enjoyable stay,"This hotel is in a great location. I stayed with my daughter on our trip to Dublin to check out Trinity College. As with most hotels, rooms are not ready until 2:00 p.m. which makes it difficult for travelers from the U.S. who arrive in the early morning jet-lagged. Wish hotels were able to do something about this, but know it's hard to have rooms available early. Loved the concierge; he was very helpful and nice. Only complaint was that the advertised special pillows never materialized, despite filling out the request form and then inquiring at the front desk. We were told they may not be available.",4,2015,01,10
236,Great hotel in good location.,Myself and my wife spent the first weekend after New Year at The Brooks Hotel whilst on a birthday weekend visit to Dublin. The hotel is located in a good spot between Grafton Street for shopping and Temple Bar for a quick beer and some food. The rooms were a good size and kept very clean. The bar downstairs is somewhere to chill out of an evening and it carries a good selection of whiskies...which I found a bonus!...would stay again when in town.,4,2015,01,08
236,Lovely Hotel,"Spent three lovely nights at the Brooks over the New Year.  The location was excellent, close to Temple Bar area but far enough away from the hustle and bustle. All the main attractions are within easy reach of the hotel.
Our room was large with a queen sized bed and was always kept spotless, they provide a turndown service each evening, with a nice little chocolate left on the pillow. The bathroom is large, well equipped with a bath and shower.
The bar is great with plenty of seating, there is the usual selection of beers and has a great selection of whiskies. Breakfast is definitely worth trying, the menus has enough to suit all tastes, but the full Irish cooked breakfast is recommended.  
All the staff were excellent and always on hand for any queries.  The only negative was the wifi and TV reception, this was very temperamental and we lost TV connectivity quite a few times at night.
Overall this is a really nice hotel and I would certainly stay there again.",4,2015,01,07
236,A Great Experience,"This small but perfectly formed boutique hotel sets the standard for others to follow. All the staff members we met were pleasant and helpful and not afraid to smile (take note pretentious 5 star establishments!!!).
The bedroom was very nice and contained all amenities required for a short city break and the addition of a “pillow menu” complimented the extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was well appointed and the toiletries were of a high standard.
Breakfast was swerved in a bright and welcoming room with plenty of hot and cold choices and plenty of breads also.
The hotel is located near to many shopping areas with Grafton Street and the Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre close by. The area is an alternative to the more well known Temple Bar with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Keep up the good work Brooks and we look forward to returning in the near future.",5,2015,01,06
236,Great all-round,"A great hotel experience.  Situated in a very good spot, relatively quiet given its location, good sized rooms, comfortable facilities, free (uncomplicated) wifi, a great breakfast and helpful, friendly staff.  I would recommend it and I would stay again.",4,2015,01,05
236,Very Central,Very pleasant and very central if you need to be in the midst of things in Dublin. The rooms were a good size and the twin beds requested were in the room. Whenever we had any queries prior to travelling they were always very prompt in replying.,4,2015,01,02
236,What an excellent hotel,Stayed at brooks hotel for nye and for my friends 30th birthday treat. It was just perfect. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We left for dinner shortly after we checked in and on return there was a birthday cupcake left in the room. I had asked for an upgrade- I assume that they gave us breakfast as I cannot remember booking a rooms with breakfast. We had it delivered to our room this morn exactly at the time we asked for. Breakfast was beautiful and the fry was the nicest I tasted. The room was gorgeous and the bed the most comfy I have slept in. It was the extra special touches that made it fab - evening service where the delivered chocolates to the room and even a pillow menu! Room equipped with a fridge tea and coffee facilities sky tv and a great shower. Only small problem was that we were right beside a lift and the lift ding dongs every time it arrived at a floor- just a tad annoying this morning esp during the breakfast rush. Apart from that rooms were sound proof and the hotel was so relaxing. Thank you brooks will def recommend it ,5,2015,01,01
236,"Fantastic hotel, very helpful and friendly staff.","Stayed at Brooks on the 28th December and from the minute we walked through the door to checking out we were impressed. Greeted by Connor who is warm, friendly and took the time to chat to us about where we were from our names (which he never forgot) and why we were on Ireland to the girls on reception who were courteous, professional and quick. The room was spacious and well equipped and spotless. The pillow menu is a great addition and its little things like this that make the difference. Pavel at the bar was warm and humorous and the drinks and food came quickly.all the young girls who served us at breakfast (which was delicious and hearty) were welcoming and happy. Based a short distance from Grafton street and St Patrick's cathedral, I'd recommend anyone travelling to Dublin to book The Brook Hotel. You won't be disappointed ",5,2014,12,29
236,Wonderful location and exceptional staff,"Stayed here at the beginning of a two week trip in Ireland and the location and staff were perfect. We were able to check in an hour early, which after a full 24 hours of traveling was much appreciated. The room was nice, the beds weren't super comfortable but it was much better than trying to sleep on the plane. The staff was very accommodating and super friendly. The bartenders in the bar downstairs were very helpful about what to do around Dublin. The room wasn't overly nice but for the price that we paid it was very reasonable. The staff and location are really what made this hotel great. ",5,2014,12,29
236,Great Location,"I stayed at this hotel on Thanksgiving night before heading down to Kilkenny.  It is in a wonderful location for a single female traveller, there are pubs around the corner and is very close to shopping.  If you're interested in taking a tour, the tour buses also meet within walking distance of the hotel.

The hotel itself is nothing spectacular, but I am a very frequent traveller so I can be a little harsh on hotels.  I can say I did not feel like I had to wear my shower shoes when I took a shower in the morning.  The staff is very friendly and the rooms are clean.  I had a great view of Dublin City in the morning.  I stayed one night and the check out time gave me ample time to run and shop before packing up.  The hotel also held my suitcase for the majority of the day until I had to catch my bus.

I definitely would stay there again if I were spending more than one night in Dublin City. Since it was my first time in Dublin I splurged on a luxury hotel but I wouldn't recommend staying for one night due to the price.

My best advice to travellers, this hotel is in a city so if you want peace and quiet stay in a B&B outside of Dublin City.  If you don't mind some ambient city noise then this hotel is perfect.  I live in a city so I did not notice any excessive noise as some of the other travellers reviewed.",3,2014,12,29
236,"Location very central, good service and would come back","We stayed here for three nights. Perfect location in the centre of Dublin. The room was not cheap, so were slightly disappointed by some of the other guests ... Drunk, shouting and very loud around 1-2am in the corridors.... Breakfast was very nice, but you have to be patient for your cooked breakfast: it could take easily up to 20 minutes. Rooms are clean and adequate, but not very spacious. We probably would come back, esp if they manage to their guests...",4,2014,12,28
236,Never fails to disappoint,"This hotel never fails to disappoint. It is situated near shops, theaters, restaurants a great location in the heart of Dublin, friendly and  efficient staff , lovely breakfast with nice choice, rooms are small but serve their purpose, another  enjoyable stay in Brooks ",4,2014,12,23
236,"Lovely stay, let down by poor after service ","We stayed in Brooks for our second time for an overnight stay and we were as happy with the hotel and location the second time around.

The room was comfortable and the breakfast was nice but there was no flexibility with orders or any special requests.

After we left I realised I had left some clothes behind. I rang and was told the items were there, they took my credit card details and told me they would be posted to me.

A week later I had to ring again as I still hadn't received the items. It took 4 calls in total to get the items to me and each time I rang no one knew anything about them.

After all that hassle I was charged for the postage and even the envelope used! 

That said, we would stay in the hotel again, but the after care service could be better. ",3,2014,12,21
236,Nice and cozy,"Stayed at the hotel a couple of times on business. Great location, back street so pretty quite, near to everything. Nice room and good breakfast, free internet. All you need for a pleasant stay in Dublin. Visit Hairy Lemon on the corner - a great pub with the largest onion rings you'll ever see. 
Windows can be opened for fresh air.",4,2014,12,21
236,Great stay!,"Had a fab stay in Brooks hotel .The staff were very helpful and friendly.we checked in and registered in the morning ,left our luggage and returned later in the day.Just collected key then  went straight to our room.
The room was nice ,very clean ,toiletries by the White Company in the bathroom and plenty of hot water.
We did not eat in the hotel preferring to eat out.The hotel is just minutes from Grafton street ,Temple Bar ,so plenty of bars and restaurants near by.
Had a great stay ,would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,12,20
236,A Gem in the heart of Dublin,"We arrived at Brooks at 9am having been up since 4am to catch our flight. We were cold and tired and knew we couldn't check in until 2pm. We were offered a hot drink and use of the lounge until we felt like going out of the hotel (no charge). A kindness we really appreciated but we came to realise that the Irish are good at such simple kindnesses.
Connor the concierge is a charming man and he checked every day with all the guests to see if they needed help with anything. He remembered everyone's name without fail. The restaurant staff were excellent. All the staff were friendly and helpful.
We loved the hotel, it is a bit quirky with real character. We hope to return.",5,2014,12,18
236,Great location,"Have stayed here twice in the last month. Handy location, decent rooms, parking nearby and reasonable value. This will be my new ""go-to"" hotel for nights out in Dublin. Similar pricing to a Jury's, but feels that bit more friendly and homely.",4,2014,12,15
236,The Brooks Hotel - A Fine Choice With A Few Flaws,"Location! Location! Location!

We arrived in Dublin at 9:00 a.m., and made our way from the airport to the Brooks by cab, arriving at about 10:45. We were reminded that check-in was not until 2:00 p.m., a policy that is, apparently, strictly enforced. Jet lagged but hungry, we went to the Metro for lunch ( a review in and of itself, elsewhere) and then took a short walk before returning to the Brooks. As it was still not 2pm, we were invited to relax in the guest lounge one floor below the lobby. Several hours later, our room was ready.

There is something refreshingly standard about twin rooms at hotels in Dublin. They are almost always the same square footage. The layout is always the same. And the views are either very nice or not nice at all. The Brooks was no exception in this regard. 

Where it was the exception was as regards the staff, the beds, the plumbing, and the location.
First, the good stuff.

The staff was extremely pleasant (even as regards the immovable 2:00 p.m. check-in). Always a pleasant hello. Always willing to assist. Attentive to the comings and goings of their guests. Servers in the lounge we're glad to greet, attentive and engaging.

The beds were the most commodious twin beds I've seen in a Dublin hotel (and we've stayed at a couple of others). Long enough for a tall fellow such as myself. Wide enough for a person of girth, such as myself. Such has not always been true at other establishments. Firm, thick mattresses gave ample support. The ""standard"" pillows however were a laugh. Bags of cotton balls would offer more support. I know, I know, the pillow menu is a nice touch. But really, I would think the ""standard"" would be midway between fluff and granite. But kudos to the Brooks for trying to accommodate in one of the most difficult of bedding issues.

The bathroom was large. And the water closet functioned as it should (again, not always true in other establishments - Jurys, are you listening?) flushing fully and refreshing quickly. The shower, however, was not exactly exceptional. A tub/shower combo, one needs to step up and in over the lip of the tub and finesse one's way in a very narrow space. But more on the shower later.

There is no better location, IMHO, to stay than at the Brooks. It is in the very heart of Dublin City Center, on a narrow, one-way street, across from a car park (ramp), hard upon some great places to drink, and to eat, and to experience the feel, the vibe of a great city. 

Less than a 10 minute walk North and you are in the heart of Temple Bar. Less than a ten minute walk South-east and you are at St. Stephen's Green, a Luas line and the foot of Grafton Street. Trinity College, home to the Book of Kells, is a 15 minute walk to the Northeast. Dublin Castle, the Chester Beatty Gallery and Christ Church, a 15 minute walk to the Northwest. St. Patrick's Cathedral and Marsh's Library, the same to the Southwest. the Tourist Information Office, O'Neils, Keogh's, The Old Stand, and other ""must visits"" are even closer. 

A call from the front desk brings a cab in moments. And both Connolly and Hueston (train) Stations are a brief cab ride away. I wish we'd discovered the Brooks on our first visit years ago. I doubt we'd have stayed anywhere else.

Now, sadly, the flaws.

The shower. Both of us are tall. Even a thin man, found it taxing to manuever in such tight quarters, unable to stand flat footed facing the shower head. a quest too obviously futile for me to even consider. I found it hysterically typical of every shower I'd ever experienced in a Dublin hotel. A space less than three feet wide but almost six foot long with a barely sufficient length curtain within which to shower. Adding to the experience was the fact that the shower head jutted out under an overhang that requires anyone over the height of 5' 10"" to hunch in order to shower. And the shower head itself was not a pleasant affair.

As is, sadly, the case at all the hotels I've stayed at in Dublin, the ""fit & finish"" of fixtures and vents, outlets and the like are, to one extent or another, somewhat not up to snuff. The Brooks suffers in this regard as well.

The pipe supplying water to the shower head was visible and showed corrosion. The escutcheon intended to conceal it, instead hung limply from it, showing some corrosion as well. As is typical of all bathrooms in Dublin hotels, there is woefully inadequate venting so that the mirrors steam and the paint peels or blisters, and the tiles become somewhat slick, even with the bathroom door propped full open. A divot missing from a floor tile, exposed plastic pipe under the sink and some yellowing of the grout made this an average Dublin hotel bathroom. Fully functional, but hardly exceptional.

The room. Slightly small for the price. Oddly accented by a dressmaker's (coat maker's?) mold. The heat vent and air returns showing signs of wear; yellowing and not fit tight to the ceiling. Again, an issue of ""fit & finish,""  & deferred maintenance. And then there is the location of the room.

It appears that the even numbered rooms face the street, while the odd numbered rooms face the rear or service court of the building. Ours was an odd numbered room on the first floor. As a consequence, there was the thrice nightly ritual cascade of empty bottles into the enormous bin-o-bottles and the incessant sporadic drip-drip-drip or tap-tap-tap just outside the window (or perhaps just within the outside wall - we couldn't be certain). the view was exceptionally ugly, i.e. the rear service court with garbage bins, service utilities, cctv cameras, exhaust vents, etc. Not pleasant. A word to the wise. Avoid Room 107.

Technology. The wifi in the room was impossible. Weak. Sporadic. Unreliable. The TV? A small flatscreen with some stations suffering periodic pixelation and lost signals. Both Sky and BBC had their Max Headroom moments (Google it) from time to time, as did one or two other channels.
Now I know. You're wondering if I complained; asked to have these problems addressed, fixed, solved. Not really. Only the wifi. Why? I can live with a limp pillow. I don't stay at city center hotels in Dublin for the view (there rarely is any). You don't come to Dublin to see the street from the hotel. Less than perfect fit & finish is the norm in Dublin hotels. Television glitches are equally common (why is it cable and dish are more prone to glitches than broadcast?). And the kind of dripping or knocking I heard is as much structural as anything else. They're not going to fix it all just for me. And were they able to fix the wifi issue in the room? No.

But all of that said, I rate the Brooks the highest of all the Dublin Hotels I've stayed at. The staff is fantastic. The location is magnificent. The bed was ideal. The lounge well appointed and the servers wonderful. It is easy to get to and easy to get from.

It was a fine choice, with a few flaws, and I'll most likely stay there again next time I'm in Dublin (just in an even numbered room on a higher floor with better wifi - I hope).",4,2014,12,13
236,It is always a pleasure,"Probably one of the best kept secrets in Dublin.  The Brooks is just one of those hotels where you feel totally at home.  The friendly and ever helpful staff, approachable management, nothing is too much.  From Connor at the door, the ladies on the front desk, house staff, bar service, fantastic.  Very reasonable if you suffer from a depressed currency.  Ideally situated within the city, walking distance to almost anywhere, plenty of wonderful restaurants and pubs in the area.
Probably my 7th stay and it gets better every time.  Congrats to the team, they have a winning formula.",4,2014,12,11
236,Why did I not hear about this great hotel before,"The location is ideal for Grafton Street/St Stephens Green area. We were welcomed by a very friendly receptionist. Our room was on the 5th floor street view, but even though it was a Saturday night, the noise level was very low. Our room was a little on the small side, some may say that the décor was dated, but it gave a cosy feel. Breakfast was very good and it was lovely to have someone hand you the cooked option of your breakfast instead of a scramble at the buffet.

Good parking just across from hotel. 

Only down side: We had a drink from residents bar in the early hours, when I went to settle account on check out, there was a bill from the bar for well over the price of a pint and a G&T. When queried  and the manager was called, I felt like I  being treated as Guilty until proved innocent, instead of the other way around, while I waited until first reception records then  till receipts  were checked. There was another receipt (unsigned)  attached to ours. On saying that it would not deter us from returning to this hotel, just check the bill !! 

  All in all a very happy guest. Thank you all at Brooks for a comfortable stay.",4,2014,12,10
236,Wonderful Location in the Heart of the City!,"A great place to stay while enjoying the sights and sounds of Ireland's great city!!  A sumptuous breakfast spread, wonderful, cozy rooms and a staff that goes out of their way to make you feel absolutely at home.  Enjoy the quiet of the guest lounge on the lower floor and take in the sights and sounds of the restaurant during the day and into the evening hours.  Overall, a lovely respite!!",5,2014,12,09
236,lovely stay,"Expensive, its in a great location, very friendly staff and the rooms were lovely and comfortable. the breakfast was fab. Dinner was a tad disappointing we were on the set menu and it wasn't great, even though it wouldn't put me off and I would love to stay again.",5,2014,12,09
236,Nice Stay!,"Pricey but really nice hotel in great location. Ellie at front desk was very nice (stood out) friendly and very helpful everything you want from reception staff concierge great also.
Smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in but spotless clean!
There is a pillow menu which is interesting!
Breakfast was just fabulous! Really enjoyed my Poached eggs with mushroom and tomato spot on! My wife's Irish Breakfast was a winner also but go early as it can get busy. Staff very attentive and pleasant at breakfast.
Lobby / Lounge was great nice bar. Nice atmosphere!",4,2014,12,08
236,What a treat!,"My two sisters and I had the pleasure of staying in Brooks Hotel on Saturday 29th November.
From the moment we stepped through the door we were greeted by lovely staff on the front desk/the concierge to the gentleman who fixed the slight problem we had with our shower!
The hotel is in a fantastic location just off Grafton Street where there are wonderful little shops/lovely bars and eateries.

After a brilliant night we then had a wonderful breakfast on the Sunday morning
Top Class! .
I will be recommending it to everyone I meet!

Just one question - what brand are your mattresses and pillows? I haven't had such a good nights sleep in years!!

Thank-you for a wonderful stay",5,2014,12,08
236,Another fantastic stay,"If visiting Dublin and looking for a place to stay that has excellent service, fantastic location, lovely rooms, amazing breakfast and excellent value, then stay at Brooks.  It is only a 3 min walk from Grafton street and Stephens green. You will be greeted by smiling staff who go out of their way to make your stay special. The spotless rooms are beautifully decorated and very.comfortable. The bar has a lovely atmosphere. Breakfast has a fantastic.selection of hot and cold food with lots of fresh bread and cakes to tempt you. 
We have stayed here several times for nights out in Dublin and will definitely be back. ",5,2014,12,07
236,Home away from Home,"This is a fantastic hotel right in the heart of Dublin, within walking distance of Grafton St and St Stephen's Green. My wife stays here all the time when on work trips and she calls it her 'home away from home'. The staff are extremely friendly, especially the concierge Conor who will brighten up your day and make you feel so welcome every time you walk through the door. They will go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect. The price may be expensive but for location and friendliness, it is worth it. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2014,12,04
236,Good ,"Great location, literally 2 minute walk from grafton street where all the shops are, 2 min walk to St Stephens park/ trinity college, 5 mins to temple bar/ castle/ city hall. 
Rooms are small but comfy and you do get a pillow menu! 
Food is average, we had lunch and breakfast but not dinner so can't comment on that. Prices are only slightly higher than surrounding area. 
Staff are very friendly, Connor is amazing! He will help with everything! 
Great stay and got a great deal on price so was good break away for us. Would recommend if you are staying in Dublin for a few days! Would be good for a business trip too. ",3,2014,12,03
236,Very Pleasant,"Lovely 4 star right in Dublin City Centre. Double Rooms are perfect in size.
Price mid week is good. There are some Double Rooms with single occupancy that are a bit small but facilities are good. Breakfast is very good.",4,2014,12,03
236,Too many hiccups ,"We accepted what is probably the smallest hotel room we've ever stayed in (room 502) due to last minute decision to stay another night in Dublin. 
Unfortunately we were not advised that we would have to endure a night of listening to loud vents outside/across from the building.
It was the worst sleep I've had in a hotel. 
Breakfast service was disorganised and lacking in quality for its price. 
Sausages and pudding are of poor quality. 
We never received the little milk, tea and coffee refills we requested for the room so did without. 

On the up side, it's spotless clean, the staff were very friendly and the lobby has a nice vibe. 

The manager understood our concerns and as a result we're going to return with the hope of a better experience in a deluxe room and hopefully better run breakfast service. 
I suggest a buffet for the full Irish would run more smoothly. 
I'll repost with our feed back next month. ",3,2014,11,29
236,"No water, lukewarm apology","I stayed at the hotel last week. Nice reception staff. Great location. Rooms smelled musty.
Problem was Thursday morning after the jog, I got back to the hotel and my room to find no running water. I was all sweaty after the run and had a 9AM meeting. Washed off with water from a bottle and went to breakfast. Front desk did not know when it would be fixed.  Checked at the desk after breakfast, still no ETA and they reluctantly gave me another bottle of cold water. .  Fixed by the time I returned.

The management left a note of apology and offered an upgrade when I returned.  A lukewarm effort at best. I left a comment card and told them at the desk when I checked out I was not satisfied.  I heard nothing from the hotel.

I would have expected a reduction in the rate or a free drink or something immediate.
To add to the insult, the hotel automatically convered my bill to dollars and charged a mark up on the conversion when I paid at check out.",2,2014,11,28
236,A wonderful night away at a lovely hotel!,"Brooks is quite simply one of the best hotels that I have had the pleasure of staying at. The welcome we received from Connor at the door was exceptional in that he was friendly and welcoming and amazed us by knowing our names within the first five minutes as well as impressing us with his vast amount of information regarding Dublin's bus routes and of course directions.

We had a classic room on the 6th floor with a bath/shower and it was perfect. It was a boutique style room which was impeccably clean and a decent size. The pillow menu was a bonus considering my allergies to feather pillows! We were not disturbed by any noise and overall we absolutely loved our room!

The reception staff were equally accommodating in helping us to organise various outings and also happily arranged a later check out for us. 

The lovely warm visitors lounge is a huge bonus. We were able to relax in it prior to heading back to the airport having exhausted ourselves by walking non stop for 48 hours!

As far as 4* hotels go, I really do believe that this little gem of a hotel could easily be a 5*. The atmosphere is welcoming, warm and romantic and it is the perfect hotel for a romantic couple's trip! Next time I intend to try the award winning restaurant in the hotel and we were told that all of the ingredients are sourced weekly by the restaurant staff from the Wicklow Mountains which sounds fabulous. I can not fault any part of the hotel or its staff and I will 100% be staying here next time go to Dublin. Absolutely fantastic!",5,2014,11,24
236,One last evening in Ireland,"Spend a quick night here before early morning flight home.... Nice hotel, great location, room are small but i would stay again and the rate was good too.  Really it about location... walking distance from trinity, temple bar, Grafton etc.",4,2014,11,21
236,Very chic city centre hotel,"We had a business meeting recently,  and  found  staff very help especially Conor the concierge. Food was good and its a great city centre location,  close to grafton Street shopping area and south William Street bars and restaurants. 
The hotel itself is very chic and a boutique hotel,  would be perfect for a city break for a couple or with friends. ",4,2014,11,19
236,Wonderful Stay,"Fantastic location with shops, bars and attractions all within walking distance. The rooms were
Immaculate with a large comfy bed and a selection of six different pillow types on request. The breakfast was excellent, and all the staff were exceptionally helpful and accommodating, particularly Connor O' Connell concierge extraordinaire, worth his weight in GOLD.",5,2014,11,18
236,Wonderful small boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin.,"You couldn't ask for a better location for this hotel. Blocks within the best shopping, eating, and tourist sites such as Trinity College, this hidden gem is to be recommended. The manager Connor was wonderful and took special care to acknowledge his guests and their birthdays. We also we were pleasantly pleased with the exuberance of the concierge, Connor, who took good care of helping us with general information as well as booking excursions. 

Rooms were small but well outfitted with a classic old beauty.

Only suggestion is to make it more clear about breakfast options because they don't have hot food available on the buffet but they will make it ready to order if you ask.",4,2014,11,17
236,Charming hotel in an excellent neighborhood,"This is a charming old building in a lively neighborhood full of restaurants and shops. The room was comfortable and clean. The wi-fi did not work when we arrived, but the staff promptly fixed it and sent someone up to make sure we were connected. The breakfast was excellent, with a buffet and a menu of additional choices included in the price (for example the full Irish breakfast). The scone were particularly good. The staff were particularly helpful (fixing the wi-fi, arranging a cab for the airport). We would make this our first choice the next time we get to Dublin.",5,2014,11,16
236,Another excellent stay,"Brooks has become our Dublin home for the annual pilgrimage down for the autumn tests matches.

The little details always are excellent with Brooks be it either the breakfast or the amazing concierge who remembers my mother in laws name.

Always a warm welcome; immaculate rooms and excellent bar service make Brooks a must.

The location is just right with close walk to Grafton Street with all the shops and bars.

Simply first class.
",5,2014,11,15
236,Perfect base for exploring Dublin,"Just a 2 minute walk from the airport bus drop off, Brooks hotel is perfectly located in Dublin city centre. Within easy level walking distance all the sights are readily accessible. The hotel itself is clean tidy with approachable, friendly and helpful staff. Our bags were dropped in out room without fuss and a map was given to us on our arrival. The room was smartly decorated and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room temperature just right. If I had to pick a fault it would be the lack of biscuits with the tea and coffee making facilities! 
Would I stay here again? Yes.
Would I recommend to others? Yes
Great value for money and a great base to explore a Magnificent warm welcoming city.",5,2014,11,15
236,"Great hotel, staff and location ","My boyfriend and I are just home from a night at Brooks hotel last night. We were celebrating my boyfriends birthday and as a surprise I booked the hotel for the night. The location drew me to it first as it is so central for pubs/reataurants/shops, all within walking distance. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise for both of us. The room was lovely and i think it was the biggest bed I have ever seen!! It was spotless and om returning to our room after being out for the night, there were chocolate mints left on our pilows!! The room was overlooking the street at the front of the hotel but it was very quiet and not noisy at all.  The bar was quiet but it was a thursday night and was comfy and pleasant. We did not have any food in the hotel so I cant comment on that but going by the menu it seemed to be a nice choice and reasonable value. All the staff were very friendly and pleasant at all times. All in all it was a great hotel we loved our stay from beginning to end. A special thanks to Lauren at reception who was so obliging and lovely to deal with and to Conor the manager who made us feel so welcome on arrival. We will definitely be back!!  ",5,2014,11,14
236,Perfect location for enjoying Dublin,"My 14-member family group began our Ireland trip with two nights at the Brooks in Dublin. 

Dublin is a walking city and the Brooks is ideally situated just steps from Grafton street.  All my family loved the friendly staff, the delicious breakfast, and the comfortable rooms.  We loved being able to walk to the restaurants, shops, and sightseeing venues.  We loved the quiet street on which the Brooks is located being so close to the nightlife of Dublin center.  

Thanks to Conor the concierge and the staff at the front desk and restaurant for such a warm welcome to Ireland.",5,2014,11,13
236,Friendly and central! What more could you want?,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the October half term. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the ever-friendly and helpful Conor O'Connell (there should be a competition as to who can spell his full name correctly -I would win! :)).  He advised us as to where we could visit and had learned all 4 of our names within minutes!
We were offered an upgrade on one of our rooms by the lovely Honorata and, as it wasn't quite ready, we were also treated to free drinks in the coffee lounge/bar.  Actually, it did take rather a long time for the room to be ready, but it was worth the wait!  We ended up with a 3 bedded room, rather than a twin.  It was all clean and pleasant, nice bathroom and free water, tea and coffee making facilities etc were provided.  Our luggage was brought up for us by Conor.  There was an iron and board in the wardrobe, a hairdryer in the bathroom and a TV.
We decided to eat in the restaurant that night and we had a treat! All of our meals were lovely and we were kept entertained by the lively and friendly Rogelio.
A good night's sleep was had by all, thanks to the very comfortable mattresses and pillows -I had chosen one from the pillow menu provided. (I always use ear plugs and eye mask when travelling, so if the fan from the kitchen was running, I didn't hear it!)
The next morning we spent several hours over breakfast! What a spread! There was everything you could want from the breakfast buffet, plus a full Irish cooked breakfast, which was lovely.  We continued our chat in the residents' lounge, downstairs from the restaurant.
The hotel is brilliantly situated, just off Grafton Street for the shoppping and Bewley's cafe and within a 10 minute walk from Trinity College (and the Book of Kells), St Stephen's Green, Halfpenny Bridge etc
.I would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay there again next time I visit Dublin!  Thanks to all the lovely staff there!",5,2014,11,13
236,The Brooks Hotel: Two Week Stay,"Stayed two weeks at the Brooks Hotel in October, 2014. The time spent gave me a good indication of the quality and service level of this hotel. The service provided was excellent, from the front desk staff to the restaurant and bar staff. Connor O'Connor, the Concierge, is very helpful, friendly and can tailor tourist sight suggestions to your needs. The food is very good. Breakfast was included in my stay and was lovely. A buffet is offered and you can also order off the menu. The hotel is central to everything in Dublin. All the museums and galleries are within a ten-fifteen minute walk from the hotel, and Shopping on Grafton Street is just a few minutes away. My room was charming and the Roberts Radio in the room was a hit with me, as I am not an avid TV fan. This hotel is a perfect match for an older female solo traveler. They will take good care of you!",5,2014,11,11
236,Perfect location but don't go for room service!!,"My wife decided to stay in a nice hotel in Dublin and Brooks has always been on our list of places to stay. It's only 5 minutes from most places we like to go in the city centre including shops, pubs & restaurants. The rooms are very good and the staff friendly.
However after a late night out we opted for breakfast in bed which turned out to be a huge mistake. It arrived to our room on time which is good but that's where it ended. The food was freezing which I believe was due to the fact that the plates were not warmed before the food was placed on it. We had both gone for scrambled egg which was tasteless and obviously done in a microwave.
We would stay in Brooks again however at the rate charged, €180 room only, the food would need to improve significantly.",4,2014,11,11
236,Service + location + Conor = Great! I will come back!,"There are a lot of good hotels around and Brooks is definitely one of them. I stayed 3 nights and enjoyed surroundings, beautiful room and tasty breakfast. But what makes Brooks hotel stand out is Conor, the concierge of the hotel. I left my bags in the reception at check in and moments later in the room the concierge knocks at my door to hand over the bags. He shakes my hand and wish me a great stay. Next day I did not meet him, but following day when I step out of the elevator I hear my name ""Good morning Sara"". I was just amazed that he remembered my name and I spoke to him for a moment that day and coming day. Conor is so passionate for his job and for persons. I´m in the service business and Conor made a real impression at me. 
And not to forget - there was a pillow menu at the room =) 
Next time I´m in Dublin, I´ll come back to Brooks and I hope to meet Conor again.",5,2014,11,10
236,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, TREATMENT LIKE A PIECE OF S.....","They gave us a room next to a huge NOISY  fan of their own restaurant. After several complaints about the noise (you cannot sleep at all), they told us the fan should stop at 21:00, and they cannot change us for another room since it was fully booked, furthermore the unbelievable manager said to us if we want to sleep we will have to wait until then, actually the fan stopped at 23:50. Only at 23:15 after more complaints they offered us a room change (apparently at this moment the rooms available), TOO LATE, we were already in bed. In addition to that they told us we could have free breakfast and late check out to compensate for the hassle, far away from the truth, they did not give us free breakfast and we left at 12;00. The FAN STARS at 07:30 AM, so you must wake up at that time. They LIE to us several times in order to not change the room and keep us in the same room until late, and they LIE about the compensation. They should not be allowed to sell the room, and they know it, the manager said sometimes clients complaint and others do not. The manager should be banned of the industry.
If you have any problem there, be prepared, you going to be treated as a piece of .........",1,2014,11,10
236,Overnight,"Overnight for a conference with my wife in the Royal College of Surgeons. Small boutique hotel just off St Stephens green. Best location, great breakfast. Very attentive and generous staff. Lovely decor in the rooms, and spacious modern rooms. Would use this city centre hotel again and again.",5,2014,11,09
236,Very Nice Hotel in the Centre of Dublin,"I stayed at the Brooks during the Web Summit, and had an excellent experience. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Its location is excellent, right in the city centre. My room was modern (apart from the ancient TV) and comfortable. Recommended.",4,2014,11,08
236,Excellent hotel & location,"Stayed 3 nights over a weekend at Brooks. Staff brilliant and helpful. Walking distance to all landmarks, fantastic choice of bars, cafes and restaurants on the door step. More expensive than some of the other central locations but when you factor in the location, the comfort and inclusive full breakfast, the price is excellent value for money.",5,2014,11,06
236,Great location,"Great location for touring Dublin, near to all of the areas to see. Room was fine, staff was friendly. Room amenities were standard. Breakfast was good. Would suggest staying here because of location near Temple Bar, Trinity, shopping, lots of restaurants.",4,2014,11,05
236,Great hotel,"This hotel was in an ideal location for exploring the delights of Dublin.  We had a very comfortable stay, the rooms were spotless and serviced everyday. The breakfast was well presented, plentiful and there was a wide choice of food available. The bar/lounge area was not very comfortable and lacked atmosphere. On the whole we would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2014,11,05
236,Location Location,"This is a perfectly located beautiful hotel in close vicinity to Temple Bar, Olympia Theatre and Grafton Street.  Perfect for a 2 night visit to this fantastic city.  Fiona on the desk was very helpful and deserves special mention.  When you stay here you will not struggle for places to eat and drink..they are endless.",5,2014,11,04
236,Value for money & Lovely Beds,"My husband and I stayed here during a recent visit to Dublin and it was a good price, in a great location with very comfy beds. 

We will definitely come back to Brooks and i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in Dublin :)",4,2014,11,04
236,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for a night recently in this really nice Dublin city centre hotel. Staff very friendly, room small but very comfortable, location great. Advantage of parking across the road and all in all well worth the money. Will stay again",4,2014,11,03
236,Lovely Hotel,We stayed here for one night as we needed somewhere central to stay in the city and it was the ideal location. The staff were all polite helpful and friendly. The breakfast was very tasty. Our room was on the small side as it was a corner one but it was spotlessly clean and nicely decorated. I would advise not to order room service as €15 was way overpriced for 2 bottles of water delivered to the room!! They also charge for car parking facilities which can work quite expensive if you arrive before 5.30pm as it is €3 per hour. All in all we would return Brooks as it is the perfect location in Dublin City.,4,2014,11,03
236,City Centre Excellence,"Brooks Hotel is in the centre of Dublin (with a good value Car Park opposite) and a short walk to most attractions.  The staff are welcoming and attentive and give that ""nothing is too much trouble feeling"".  The rooms are good and larger than in many hotels - I seem to have had a 'complimentary upgrade' each time I have stayed - with good facilities and comfortable beds.  As with any city centre hotel, the views are limited but you make up for it in convenience.  Rooms at the back will be quieter, but view-less and with the risk of air-conditioning noises.  The wifi can be slow.  The bar lounge is excellent, with the longest Irish whiskey list you will find anywhere, and comfortable sofas and chairs to relax in.  The breakfasts are excellent and cooked to order.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,11,03
236,Best Location Ever,"Very nice hotel. The location couldn't be better. It's very central, but still quite. The room is really clear and the bed is very comfortable. Great breakfast with a rich choice. WiFi is not the strongest, but it does the job. The only small problem is a shower. It doesn't always keep a constant temperature and there is no shower hose which is not very comfortable. But this doesn't ruin the experience. I a whole I would definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends.",5,2014,11,03
236,Great Hotel,This is a very nice centrally located hotel.  The concierge - Connor - is awesome!  He learned our names on the first day and greeted us by name every time we saw him.  He knows how to get you around Dublin!  We arrived before there were rooms available and they set us up in their library with coffee and cookies and we were able to rest until our room was ready.  The breakfasts were very good with a lot of options.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,4,2014,11,02
236,Amazing!,"Our first night in Ireland was at the Brooks Hotel, very comfortable place especially after a long flight. Very friendly staff, wonderful breakfast! The only challenge was parking, we had to pay for it while another hotel we stayed at covered the parking cost which saved us 40.00 for one night!!!",5,2014,11,02
236,"Great location, great staff... Not so great wifi","Spent 2 nights in brooks hotel and overall I'd a very positive experience. The reception staff were excellent and our room was spacious, clean and modern (admittedly it was a complimentary upgrade!). 

We had breakfast out each morning purely just to sample some local eateries nearby. However we did try some food and whiskey in the bar one evening which offered both an excellent menu and service. The bar man was very knowledgeable when we enquired about whiskey and it resulted in a very pleasant experience.

The only downside to our visit was the WiFi, which for me at least is a requirement not a nice to have. In summary the WiFi reception in our room (no. 415) wasn't adequate and more often then not dropped connection. There was several networks to try from but none of them offered a consistent and reliable connection. In the end I just used my mobile/cell phone data and tethered to my tablet. I raised this with reception and while it was dealt with professionally and some corrective action taken, and 4 phone calls to the room later (after fixing a cracked wire apparently) there wasn't any improvement in service. 

This is unacceptable for a luxury hotel charging luxury prices. Unfortunately that was left a somewhat negative experience. 

But overall its a great location in the heart of Dublin, between Grafton St and George's St.",3,2014,11,02
236,Nice but room for improvement,"We had a nice stay from Friday 31st Oct until 1st Nov.  Hotel is very nice, staff were helpful and polite, with very clean rooms, however a few niggles that if improved would have scored higher.

1) we stayed in room 207 which initially appeared to have a 6' bed, however it actually turned out to be two singles pushed together which resulted in a ""ridge"" in the middle which was most annoying.

2) The shower didn't keep a constant temperature and kept fluctuating between hot and cold.

3) Whilst the hotel provided complimentary water in the room both bottles where sparkling, whereas the norm would be one sparkling and one still.",4,2014,11,01
236,Amazing hotel & wonderful staff,I had the pleasure of staying in Brooks hotel on the night of my wedding after a reception close by. The hotel staff were wonderful and the room was fantastic! Highly recommend. The location is wonderful and the hotel is beautiful.,5,2014,10,31
236,Absolutely lovely,"This hotel is very centrally located and yet is quiet and peaceful.  The staff was warm, accommodating and welcoming.   Both concierges were helpful and went out of their way to help make our trip memorable.  The front desk staff was more than accommodating on all requests.  We had breakfast every day at the restaurant and the continental breakfast was more than adequate.  Couldn't have asked for a more positive stay.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2014,10,30
236,Brilliant! ,"Nothing a problem with their staff. Great breakfast selection and rooms superbly furnished and cleaned brilliantly each day. Will definitely be going back and will recommend to anyone!
Rooms equipped with kettle, hairdryer, iron and trouser press. Free safe to use and complementary bottle of water each day. ",5,2014,10,30
236,Very central,"The location is excellent, rooms small but clean and the only real downside to the hotel was the very uncomfortable bed and terrible pillows. There is a pillow menu to order from but you needed to get it to reception by 6pm?!?!

The room was beside a outside heating system / vent which was very noisy.",2,2014,10,29
236,Great central hotel,"We stayed in Brooks for 3 nights in September 2014. The room was well-sized and comfortably furnished. The gym, discount parking and friendly staff were all pluses but the best part was the location. Centrally located with more than a handful of top restaurants and cafes nearby. For coffee, we recommend Fallon & Byrne or Kaph, both very close. It's a short 5 minute walk to Temple Bar and the same to Trinity College and other sights. Highly recommended for your stay in Dublin!",4,2014,10,28
236,Beautiful hotel in a great location,The staff at the Brooks is extremely helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with a lovely window seat and nice bathroom. The location is very central - easy walking distance to anything you want to see or do in Dublin. Would definitely stay there again.,5,2014,10,28
236,Business trip in October,"I have stayed at Brooks only once but I am planning to stay there again in November. I can say that I have had positive impression at the first time. The hotel is located in a small street in city centre so it is close to all landmarks. The view from the windows is not great, but for 2-3 days it does not matter. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay. Robert",4,2014,10,28
236,Excellent Spot!,"On our second trip to Dublin, we chose the Brooks because of its location. We nailed it! 
Service was outstanding, and the room was quite comfortable. Loved the assortment of really comfy pillows! Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2014,10,28
236,Great hotel.,"The Brooks Hotel was really nice, the room a good size and beautifully decorated old world style. 
Lovely bathroom too. Breakfasts were lovely and the dinner in their restaurant was delicious.
It's in a great location in the city and in walking distance to louts of places.
The room had windows that opened which was nice although we were at the back so no outlook.
Nice place to stay, service very good.",5,2014,10,26
236,A nice classical hotel in the heart of the busy areas,"I stayed at Brooks already for the second time and I can say that the impressions remained at the same positive level as the first time. The hotel is in a smaller street, which slightly delays access by taxi and equally sometimes complicates getting out. But this is a minor inconvenience that just needs to be taken note of. Hotel provides classical rooms, which are well kept and appear to be quiet. There is wi-fi free of charge in the whole property but may vary in strength. For the continental traveller there are classical plugs fitted alongside the UK ones. Bathrooms are nice and well equipped. Breakfast was not included in my rate but it could be purchased for 10 EUR a day, which is a very convenient price given that the offer at breakfast is varied and a full breakfast is included in the price. Overall, a very pleasant experience, also with the staff at the reception, so I will gladly return.",4,2014,10,22
236,Much more than adequate but nothing really special.,"The Brooks Hotel is well located, close to Dublin's downtown sights, businesses and many many good restaurants.  The common areas (registration, lobby, restaurant and bar/lounge) are all quite pleasant.  And at least equally important, all staff members were professional, well trained, courteous and helpful--including the doorman, desk clerks, waitstaff, bartender and housekeeping personnel.  Room amenities and features were very adequate and our room was generally well decorated and comfortable.  Our only significant complaint was room size . . . almost as small as a typical room in Hong Kong or an older hotel on the continent.  Suggestion:  Upgrade to a larger ""Deluxe Room"" if you plan to spend much time in the room.",4,2014,10,21
236,Horrible staff,"I was traveling alone as a single woman and this was my last night in Ireland. I always stay at Kellys, however they don't have an elevator so I chose this one as it was in a good location- my suitcase was massively heavy and I wanted an elevator.  When I checked in concierge took my luggage.  I went up to the room& waited a few minutes & it never arrived so I ran out for coffee and to do a few things.  I came around 6pm and my luggage was not in my room! I went down to the desk and the guy looked for it/ found it in the basement & said he had no idea who it belonged to!!!  The front staff seemed out of it. Not friendly helpful or warm. The waiter at Breakfast was a jerk. When it was time to go I asked for a taxi to be arranged & he was late so I hailed one on my own. Before I left I wanted to run to the deli and asked could I leace my luggage in the lobby for a second. The concierge jumped in & insisted he put it in the basement.  Seriously?!  Enough already. Traveling is stressful enough and this place just heightened my stress factor.  I would never stay here again. I'd rather pull my luggage up a staircase any day and pay less and have a friendlier more professional staff.  ",1,2014,10,21
236,"Great location, excellent staff, nice rooms","The hotel is located right in the heart of what a local guide described as the ""party capital of Europe"": very close to restaurants, shopping as well as major attractions. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I had a very pleasant room that faced the front of the hotel -- but as is the issue with many urban hotel properties, that can be a somewhat noisy option.
The lobby is rather tiny so the guests have secure access to a lovely lounge in the basement. The business centre is located within the lounge, unfortunately the two computers there are rather dated and slow. I did need this service as I was travelling with an ipad and needed real computer access. The hotel would do well to update the technology in the business centre.",4,2014,10,20
236,First rate hotel in Dublin's Grafton St. area,"The Brooks is a fine hotel to begin or end a trip to Ireland.  A short walk from the Trinity College stop on the bus from the airport makes it convenient. It is close to a very nice shopping area and within walking distance of the major Dublin sights. The hotel rooms are large, quiet and very comfortable. Breakfast is amazing!",5,2014,10,20
236,Loved it. We would definitely stay there again.,"My wife and our two adult sons stayed at the Brooks Hotel in May of 2014.
We were very pleased with the staff and the accommodations. Having arrived very early the staff was most gracious and solicitious taking care of our luggage and providing a very nice lounge and restrooms for waiting. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. Daily breakfasts were exceptionally good with friendly servers.  Because we stayed there twice during our travels in Ireland we had a total of four rooms.  We had no complaints about any of them.  In fact, we had no complaints of any kind about the hotel or staff and it’s location was perfect for us. We certainly would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it.",5,2014,10,20
236,"clean, quiet and professionally run hotel","Great location right in the interesting heart of Dublin. I had a room on the 6th floor that was nicely decorated, a good size and with a big comfy bed. A good nights sleep and  a good breakfast topped off a good place to stay.
Oddly the UK ITV local station on the TV in the room was for the Channel Islands - not sure of the connection to Dublin!",4,2014,10,19
236,Below Average,"I stayed at the Brooks Hotel in October 2014 for a single night and was immensely disappointed. The check-in and check-out time were extremely long, and unlike any other SLH venue I have visited no drinks were offered during the process. 

The room (415) was very dated and tacky, albeit the bathroom was modern. I was also not able to receive WIFI signal since the room was at the very far end of the building. Despite the staff’s best effort (the guys assisting us were indeed very patient and tried their best) to resolve this problem we were not able to get complimentary internet at the end. The room we had was also facing the backside of the building which was very noisy due to some heavy ventilation equipment just outside of the window. It did quiet down during the evening, however it was far from optimal sleep condition. 

I asked for a late check-out the night before and was offered one for 1:00pm. The next day I received a call to my room just past 12:00 asking me if I needed a late check-out. I explained that this was already the case just to find room keeping knocking at my door 20 minutes later. 

While the hotel crew did try their best, there was a distinct lack of communication. There are far better options in Dublin and needless to say I will not be returning to the Brooks Hotel.",2,2014,10,18
236,Wonderful Staff,"The staff at Brooks Hotel are a credit to the management of this cosy home from home. Close to every amenity south of the Liffey. Lovely Bar food, great Bar, cosy modern room, fab breakfast. will will be back again and again.",5,2014,10,17
236,Fab hotel great service ,"Fabulous hotel lovely and clean. Helpful and curteous staff -gave us an upgrade . Room was spacious ,bed was comfy ,all amenities.Location spot on ! Access to hotel lounge whilst waiting for room as we arrived super early , much appreciated. Breakfast choice and service excellent , would definitely stay again and would recommend. Connor the concierge was very welcoming and gave us advice on what to see and do in Dublin . ",5,2014,10,12
236,Great stay,Out of the way but close to the heart of the city. Top hotel and good restaurant (Francesca's) that's close to Grafton Street and entertainment.  Recommended!  Friendly staff.  The breakfast food was excellent and they provide newspapers free.,5,2014,10,10
236,Short Mid Week Break,"First impressions is that it is down a back street across from a car park.  However the Hotel location is ideal, bang in the centre of Dublin.  The rooms were comfortable, meals (lunch and breakfast) were good.  Staff very friendly (the concierge if you were from North America he was all over you, very obvious).  The hotel close to many resturants and bars, the Gaitey theatre just round the corner, the theatre is worth a visit.
Thoroughly enjoyed our shortbreak and will be going returning to the Brooks.",5,2014,10,10
236,A Most Convenient Hotel,"Centrally located, walking distance to major attractions and shopping. Very comfortable room. Exceedingly well trained, helpful, pleasant and friendly staff, without exception. Warm and inviting bar with good variety of lighter fare. We did not dine in the restaurant but breakfasts were excellent.",4,2014,10,08
236,"Nice hotel, small rooms but good location!","Brooks Hotel is located centrally, we were able to walk to many excellent shops and restaurants. The rooms at the hotel are very small and at least the one we stayed in was quite outdated, old box tv. really, you cant afford to upgrade to LCD? I felt that if I was retired or an older couple it may have some charm, it seems like a hotel from the 60's or 70's...dont expect to see anything modern here. The man (connor) who met us when we arrived was the highlight of our stay, he was excellent! he helped us downstairs to a room where we could change and freshen up as our room was not available when we arrived. When we finally made it to the room, we were surprised how small the room was but that was ok as we only stayed a couple days.
I would try another hotel in Dublin before staying here again.",3,2014,10,05
236,"Location, Location","Lovely hotel, very comfortable and roomy. Not much on view but it is in middle of city, more like a New York feel.  The location was the biggest plus. We could walk almost everywhere and decided early we did not want to drive in Dublin.  As an American driving on the opposite side of the road would have been a nightmare in a busy city like Dublin.  The concierge was wonderful. Gave us all kinds of tips on where to go and where to eat.  A cute little coffee shop across the street was a great place a quick and wonderful breakfast.",4,2014,10,04
236,Best hotel stay ever,"We traveled to Europe for the first time ever in Sept. 2014.  We stayed in 6 different hotels over 13 days, and the Brooks Hotel was our best experience.  Very friendly and accommodating staff, great breakfast, great location, lovely room.  All around just great!!!!",5,2014,10,04
236,ABSOLUTE JOY,"Most of the staff were superb, concierge (Connor) especially.Rooms kept immaculate and breakfast set you up for the day. Only problem we encountered was extraction fan 24/7 which was raised with reception but never actioned, hence the poor sleep quality mark up.",5,2014,10,04
236,Agree with all the Excellent Reviews and More,"We chose Brooks for a long stay in Dublin because of the good reviews on TripAdvisor and were not disappointed. Our standard room had an in-room safe, a mini fridge and tea/coffee making facilities, which we now consider a must on vacation/business trips. There was also an iron and ironing board. There was no retractable clothesline in the bath, but as this is not a resort or hotel with pool, that can be excused. Also there are only about 9 to 10 coat hangers in the wardrobes which can be a problem on a long stay. I am trying to think of any more negatives and am nit- picking when I write they they do not provide umbrellas for guests to borrow.
The location is very central but the rooms are comfortably quiet at night especially when the windows are closed. 
Brooks is a the centre of tourist downtown Dublin, which is good , but  I would encourage visitors to Dublin to walk a little further afield after seeing the tourist sights to see some of the Dubliners' Dublin. Cross over the Liffey (15 minutes walk away) walk up O'Connell Street and enjoy North Dublin.
The Jasmine Bar is a  quiet and comfortable local to meet up with friends or for business.
The breakfasts are excellent with anything anyone might desire. 
And the dinners in the evening are also superb. There is a 10% discount if you eat before 7:00 pm. 
The hotel is well-managed with efficient caring staff.
Do enjoy the residents lounge in the basement. It is like the library in an Irish country ""big house"".
We paid 20 Euros for a cab to the hotel and 32 Euros when going to the airport at 10:00 am.
Cabs are easily hailed on Drury Street outside the hotel. They are metered and are very reasonable.
Walk toward Dame Street via George's Street through the little Mall in the old Victorian building for supermarkets such as SPAR, TESCO and Dunne's. They are good places to pick up good sandwiches wraps and fruit for picnics.
Brooks is definitely a Dublin hotel we would return to.",5,2014,10,03
236,It's all about location with this hotel,"Hotel was nice, not amazing. The room we received was a bit tired and could use a facelift. But overall, it was fine for the night we stayed. I don't think I would have stayed in the particular room we had for more than a night. The water temperature in the shower in the bathroom was constantly fluctuating between very hot and cold. There wasn't anything you could do to avoid that. Not very pleasant. The concierge was very helpful and attentive. This is a good hotel that is pretty central and walking distance to a lot of the action.",4,2014,10,03
236,"Loved this hotel- location, service, comfort","Before a tour of Ireland I spent several days on my own at the Brooks Hotel. What a great place! My room was so comfy - great sleep, choice of pillows was appreciated. Good breakfast, wonderful staff - so helpful about everything.  The location is amazing - I actually walked everywhere except to the Guinness plant.  I hope to return to Dublin over and over, and if I do I will return to the Brooks. Can't imagine going anywhere else. I really had great luck choosing right the first time! Room 116 was great - that was mine.",5,2014,10,01
236,Lovely Boutique Hotel.,"Our stay was delightful. The staff were friendly, warm and very helpful. Our room small but very clean and tidy, and we had a great view over the Dublin rooftops. Centrally located, many restaurants and sights are within walking distance. We had our first full Irish breakfast in the restaurant, which set us up for the day ahead. We will definitely stay at Brooks the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2014,09,29
236,High quality hotel.,"Good service - nice staff - quality venue - great location - what more could I ask?  Good food and bar service.
      
      
      
      
    A most enjoyable visit to this lovely hotel.   Central location with very
helpful staff - good breakfast.   I will certainly return again.  
      
      
      ",5,2014,09,29
236,Always fabulous,"Brooks is the best place to stay in Dublin by a long way.  I stay there every time I possibly can when I'm in the city and always enjoy it so much. The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of gorgeous Georgian Dublin, and it helps that some lovely eateries and hostelries have sprung up nearby (Drury Buildings, Fade St Social, Duck, No Name Bar) in recent years. One never has to go far for great eating options, a pint of stout in a friendly Dublin pub, or a delicious cocktail alongside the local hipsters. At the same time Brooks is always quiet and a great night's sleep is guaranteed especially when you choose from the lengthy Pillow Menu and other in-room relaxation treats.

Brooks has a great team of friendly staff and is clearly very well run. In the 10 years I have been staying I have never noticed the standards slip and that is some accomplishment of the management team. Over the years I have stayed in some of Dublin's 5 star hotels (The Merrion, Westbury, Westin) and Brooks beats them hands down for warmth, comfort, location and hospitality.",5,2014,09,28
236,Great location in Dublin!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in September after a week traveling around Ireland and staying in B&B's.  It was great to turn in our rental car and stay in a hotel within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see.  We had a huge king sized bed on the 2nd floor; the room was very clean and stylish, and the bathroom was modern with a nice big tub.  Breakfast was included in our hotel rate of approximately $235/euros/night.  Expensive but worth it.  Breakfast was a large variety of fruits, pastries, porridge (oatmeal) and of course your authentic 'Irish breakfast'.  The hotel also had an exercise room with treadmill, elliptical and weights.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a 4 star hotel in the center of Dublin.",4,2014,09,27
236,Brooks Hotel,"Our tour advisor had us booked at the Brooks Hotel for our first two nights in Dublin.  He did
a great job for us, because we were able to walk to every location that we were interested in visiting.  We had breakfast with our stay and each morning we enjoyed their restaurant.  Very good food and good service.  The rooms were nice and clean.  Very comfortable there.  The staff was excellent.  Very cordial and helpful.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,09,27
236,"Great hotel, friendly staff","We stayed at the Brooks for 2 nights on our arrival to Dublin.  We had a lovely suite and were impressed by the friendly, efficient staff, both in the hotel and the restaurant.  The location was close to everything.. Grafton St., Trinity College, and a short walk to the River Liffey. The very best part of our stay though was Connor, who was just wonderful to talk to about anything Irish (especially music) and gave great advice on restaurants, shopping, or anything you might need.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,09,20
236,"Great location, exceptional service!","My husband and I stayed at the Brooks hotel for one night in Dublin to start our week vacation in Ireland.  We were pleased with our choice and would definitely stay there again
Pros: The location was great, a short walk to Trinity College, St Patricks Cathedral, as well as all the food and night life.  Our room was clean and spacious. The service was the most memorable, the airline lost our luggage and the front desk took care of everything.  Even making calls while we were our touring!!! 
Cons: The beds were a little stiff, but I have definitely slept on worse. And make sure to bring a converter",4,2014,09,18
236,Wonderful stay,"Great location. An easy walk to a ton of major sites. Super friendly staff - especially Connor, the concierge. Would recommend nearby Stonehouse restaurant if you want dinner & live music at one place. Nice breakfast too.",5,2014,09,16
236,Charming Hotel,"We stayed in this charming hotel for six nights.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and Conner the Concierge was incredible. He always had great recommendations. The hotel is perfectly located surrounded by lots of pubs, restaurants, shopping and within walking to distance to ""many"" attractions.  The room was extremely comfortable and the bed/ pillow were amazing.  This is by far one of our favorite all time hotels.  Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,09,16
236,Convenient Location,Conveniently located within walking distance to various sites like Dublin Castle & Trinity College. Very clean hotel and nice staff. Had breakfast only once during 6 day stay at hotel. It was only fair and you can do better elsewhere. Came from airport and took the Air Coach for 7 euros. It was a five minute walk to hotel. The stop is Grafton Street.,5,2014,09,16
236,Staff was eager to assist ,We were at the Brooks hotel for 2 nights during our 6 days in Ireland  the hotel was in a great location within walking distance of lots of activity. The staff was a tremendous help and very gracious. Conner greeted us and remembered our names when we would come and go. Breakfast was very good. Especially the sausage.   Definitely would recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin. ,5,2014,09,15
236,Lovely overnight in Dublin!,"Our airline connections required an overnight in Dublin.  We selected this hotel based on other travelers reviews and we were certainly not disappointed!  We checked in late
 (and received and unexpected room upgrade) but we are certain that any room would have been very lovely in this stylish boutique hotel which is reminiscent of luxury travel in a time gone by!  The staff were friendly and accommodating and the facility charming with warm wood and traditional accents.  The room was well appointed. The bed was quite comfortable, and linens and bathroom amenities were higher in quality than normally expected. Check-in was seamless.  We asked for a recommendation to a ""local pub"" and were quickly given several within walking distance.  We had a delicious breakfast in the dining room and experienced good service and a wide variety of menu items to choose from.  The location was good for touring the downtown area. 

The cab cost from the airport was approx 25 euros..a standard fee for the area.  We would definitely return for a longer stay when our travel plans permit.",5,2014,09,15
236,Great Hotel,"An excellent hotel, well placed in Dublin near Grafton Street and a short walk from Temple Bar.
Everything about this hotel is great - area, staff, rooms, food, etc.
Would without doubt stay here again.",5,2014,09,15
236,Haven,"Centrally located amidst the bus sle of Dublin, the Brooks Hotel is a haven.  Sleek and modern public rooms and our room, on 5 th floor was recently renovated.  Quiet, spacious with a large comfortable bed and all the usual amenities including a continental socket!  Turn down service and choice of pillows, safe, iron and ironing board make this hotel an excellent 4*.  We arrived on a Saturday, so check in was a bit slow.  Unloading space outside and 24 hour car park moments away.  Breakfast good, buffet sysle with cooked breakfasts available to order.  Highly recommended hotel, at the heart of Dublin, yet quiet and peaceful.  Ask for a recently renovated room and a high floor (there are 6 floors)",5,2014,09,15
236,Location Location Location,"This hotel was abit pricey but for the location you cant complain to much.  Got a complimentary upgrade to a Junior suite and it was fabulous.  Staff were friendly and the breakfast was lovely, the turn down and chocolates left on our pillows was a nice touch too. Highly recommend this hotel.",4,2014,09,10
236,Typical big city hotel,"Great location in mostly pedestrian precinct of city centre.  Nice room.  Coffee in room.  Attractive lobby.  Parking across street.
     Like every hotel in downtown it is not that easy to find but this is a result of the traffic in a busy City.",4,2014,09,09
236,Traditional hotel in the right spot,"Brooks is a very good hotel! The atmosphere is tradition and comfort. The staff is very helpful. The rooms are nice and traditional with all the mod cons you may need. A very smooth stay! And the location! Right in the middle of party central Dublin. Fade st across the road! And enough good bars and restaurants within eyesight to keep you busy for a very long time! The Fitzwilliam has more distinct style, but the Brooks has the location.",4,2014,09,06
236,Great Stay,"Staff were fabulous and even upgraded us to a deluxe room! They were extremely efficient and helpful. The room was amazing and the bed was so comfortable! A really good shower that had really good water pressure (hard to find in a lot of hotels!!) The location was perfect! Situated on a quiet street just of Grafton Street so we had none of the noise but all of the accessibility we required! Didn't go into the bar or restaurant but we will definitely be back to try it! Whether you're from Ireland or abroad, this is a perfect spot that's close to all the major attractions that Dublin has to offer including Christ Church Cathedral, Dublinia and Trinity College and its also placed nicely beside all the regular local restaurants (rather than just the tourist-grabbing ones!). I will definitely back to stay another night!",5,2014,09,04
236,Great location for our Dublin stay,"We could not have been happier with our choice of the Brooks hotel for the final 4 nights of our Ireland vacation.  Location was very convenient for seeing the main attractions in Dublin but was quite and relaxing as well.  Rooms and hotel were well updated and maintained with very well run front desk and housekeeping services.  The bed was very comfortable and room was good size making for a good night sleep.  Make sure you try Sasha’s coffee across the street, amazing pastries and coffee as well as more substantial breakfast items and healthy juices.",5,2014,09,04
236,Must Stay At The Brooks Hotel,Location was perfect. We had 3 family in one room and it was very nice. Everyone was very helpful. Loved the breakfast . All the staff were so very helpful!  We would recommend this hotel to all traveling to Dublin!,5,2014,09,03
236,Chic and convenient,We all loved the Brooks Hotel. We walked everywhere from this wonderful boutique hotel! The complimentary full breakfast was outstanding.  The rooms were very nice and the service was excellent throughout the property.,5,2014,09,02
236,Very good Dublin Hotel,"We spent two nights there (in two rooms) five people, and had a great time.  The rooms were great and the service at the Hotel was top notch.  Conner, concierge/reception, was wonderful and helpful about all things Dublin.  And ""Roger"" in the restaurant was just the happy face and excellent service we needed to get our day started.  I would definitely recommend.",4,2014,09,02
236,"Great location, helpful friendly staff","I thought I knew Dublin hotels quite well but found this gem on trip advisor . Very good central location in Dublin, parking right across the street which is validated by the hotel to give you much better rates. Largest bed I think I have ever slept in, very comfy. Staff we're very efficient and friendly.  I never tried the restaurant in the evening  but the Saturday morning breakfast is served until 11:30, good breakfast it was too. Very close to Grafton Street for shopping and in easy walking distance to many of Dublin's attractions. I will certainly stay here again & would recommend it.",5,2014,09,02
236,Outstanding Irish charm.,"From the moment we arrived, my wife and I could tell this was going to be a great experience. The central location couldn't be better. It is close to everything:- St Stephen's Green, museums/galleries, shops, Trinity College, Temple Bar, all within easy walking distance.
Our check in experience was friendly and efficient.
The highlight of our arrival was the warm greeting from Connor the concierge. What an amazing man. Just so friendly, and willing to do anything for us. I really didn't think people like this existed any more in the service industry. We asked his advice on where to have a quick lunch, as we had just flown in from London, and he escorted us to a local pub, sat us down, and insisted to their wait staff that we be looked after. All with that wonderful Irish flare & humour.
After check in we were taken to our room, which was beautiful, old worldly, but functional. Not too small, but quaint and comfortable. Connor of course had the bags up in minutes, and made sure we had settled in! Good bathroom, lovely old radio quietly beating out some classical music.
This place is wonderful, and gets my vote against some of the more expensive places I have stayed in in Dublin.",5,2014,09,01
236,Fabulous location,We spent two nights in Dublin and had a fabulous stay here. The concierge service is the best that I have come across. The room was well appointed with unusual extras like a pillow menu. The turn down service with minted chocolates on the pillow was a nice surprise. All the things Dublin were in walking distance. A great two days I recommend the location of the Brooks ,5,2014,09,01
236,City Treat!,"When shopping for a place to stay in Dublin, the usual B&B lodgings that we like just weren't as apparent.  For a good stay, it appeared that a hotel was in order.  We looked at several possible places, compared prices and locations, and ultimately decided that the Brooks would be best.  The price was a little high, but comparable with other good hotels  It's totally accessible to just about any sights, museums, restaurants, and historical structures south of the River Liffey.  The Brooks is on a somewhat quieter street (Drury), and while there are a few questionable buildings or businesses in the area, it didn't feel unsafe.  We walked freely and undisturbed.  The Brooks was within close walking distance of Temple Bar and even closer to a 24-hour Spar, a marvelous convenience store where you could get just about anything--a great variety and delicious ""grab and go"" snacks.  The Brooks is a smaller, boutique-like hotel that focuses on providing the basics and doing it well.  Staff are trained well in every respect.  We found great service from the front desk to the assisting staff to the dining room service.  All were quite superior.  Our room was fun and a little funky (photos provided).  We enjoyed the decor and the comfy beds.  The main shortcoming was the size, particularly the bathroom (a bit tight for American standards), though it was very manageable for a short stay.  Our sleep was good and there was generally little noise or disruption.  In the morning, the meal service for breakfast was perhaps the most amazing we saw anywhere during our travels in Ireland.  We opted for the sit-down menu service combined with buffet.  Phenomenal.  After breakfast and prior to check out, we asked to have our luggage held while we took a walk around and caught a few more sights before taking a cab to the dock.  The staff was more than happy to oblige.  Needless to say, we were happy to have chosen the Brooks.  With a bit lower price and a slightly larger bathroom, I would easily offer five stars.  Wish Trip Advisor could accommodate a 4.5 rating.",4,2014,08,31
236,"Short, but sweet","We were supposed to be here for two nights, but we missed our connecting flight and lost a day in dublin.   Brooks was great at holding our reservation and having our room ready bright and early when we finally made it.  We had train reservations to galway the next day, which happened to be a train strike.  Again, brooks was so helpful in booking a direct bus to galway for us, printed our tickets and delivered them to our room.  Excellent location, friendly staff and beautiful, comfortable rooms.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  ",5,2014,08,31
236,Great hotel idealy situated,"From as soon as you check in this hotel delivers,  especialy the celebrity Conner (concierge). Would reconend the hairy lemon pub a few doors down and a visit to the prision. However the Guinness wharehouse . trip was not as expected,  more like a 6 floor museum built for Americans. The  Temple bar area is for stags and hen parties and Expensive ! The locals stay well away from it. All in all hotel spot one and Dublin worth a visit.",5,2014,08,30
236,"Nice hotel, convenient location","Brooks is a very nice hotel with thoroughly pleasant staff, nice comfortable rooms, lovely toiletries, comfortable beds and a nice breakfast.  i was on the 6th floor and was disappointed that the lights in the hall outside the lift were out which made it dark, plus there was a door open all the time to a very scruffy hall with equipment in it, it didn't feel secure.  Breakfast was very nice although some of the fruit was under-ripe.  On the whole, a lovely hotel.",4,2014,08,29
236,weekend in dublin,"4 of us stayed here during ireland's bank holiday weekend at the start of august. on arrival we were all upgraded to better rooms foc. the rooms were lovely, clean and well stocked with white company products in the bathroom. if you don't like noise you would be better to ask for a room at the back of the hotel as the street below is busy at times but for us it wasn't a problem. breakfast was great with plenty of choice of both cooked food and cold buffet style. the hotel is within easy walking distance of the the main areas to visit. fade street social is just over the road and is well worth a visit. can also recommend the green hen restaurant and you should also visit cafe en seine",5,2014,08,29
236,"Ideal location, friendly staff, great rooms.","We arrived early (9.00 hrs), and our room was being cleaned, so we went for a stroll. When we got back a friendly member of reception staff managed to find us a room that had been serviced; and we managed to get some sleep, as we were due at the theatre at 17.00 hrs. The concierge (Connor), was friendly and helpful; and we felt we could approach him with any request. Our room was great, the bed was large and comfortable, the furnishings were in good condition; the complimentary bathroom accessories were of good quality. The stay was memorable, hassle free and it was great to be able to walk to many attractions and shopping areas. Many thanks to the staff for an enjoyable stay, we would definitely stay again.",5,2014,08,27
236,Great Hotel Centrally Located,"Our group of 6 worked with Irishtourism.com in July 2014 to book our 8 night self drive trip through Southern Ireland.  The Brooks Hotel was our first stop for 2 nights in Dublin.  The hotel location is excellent to walk to the pub district known as Temple Bar, St. Patrick's Cathedral and the shopping district.  Hotel food and service was excellent.",5,2014,08,27
236,Perfect !!!,"Perfect for location.
Perfect for friendly staff.
Perfectly clean rooms.
Excellent breakfast.
Turn-down service - lot of laugh ! But yes, they do this ! It's a Mike McIntyre 'Choccie' experience !
Good value.
All types of breakfast accommodated. (Full Irish, continental etc)
If you arrive on a early flight, then take advantage of a breakfast there, it's only 10 Euro's but easily worth it !

Hair-dryers (x2)
Iron and ironing board
All the towels, cleaning and pampering products.
Bath and shower
TV with all channels
Wi-Fi free and very high speed at that with no passwords !!!
Pillow menu !!!!!
Massage and gym available.

Lovely hotel.",5,2014,08,26
236,Beautiful Centrally Located Hotel,"Wonderful and quiet hotel in walking distance to Temple Bar. We were pleasantly surprised how centrally located this hotel was.  The room was a good size with a very comfortable bed. The staff was professional, helpful and made us feel at home.  We only stayed one night.  Next time we will definitely stay longer.",5,2014,08,25
236,Ideal!,"Location was everything you would want for walking downtown and exploring.
Check-in was cordial and easy. Our concierge Connor O'Connor was waiting to service
the four of us in every way.
Arriving very early--He swept us into the dining room for our breakfast while our rooms
were being prepared and breakfast was delightful.
Out came the maps and info from Connor so We could instantly get our bearings for the
day.
Rooms were bright, roomy enough and nicely decorated. Turn-down was a surprise.
Very warm and cozy bar was available for as long as guests required.
Overall impression----Very good, and would certainly return when in Dublin
Thank you for two enjoyable days and  evenings BROOKS! .",4,2014,08,24
236,Great location!,"We stayed here for a couple of nights as a family of four……having never been to Dublin before, we thought this hotel was brilliantly placed for many of the city attractions, all within easy walking distance. It has a certain ""Covent Garden"" feel, as it sits within a hub of bustly eateries & bars. On arrival, we were ""upgraded"" to deluxe rooms - however, I would question this, as our window view was of air conditioning unit type stuff and our room was very close to the lift, which beeped every time it was used..I found that irritating and kept me awake! However, the rooms were attractive and clean. Breakfast had good service, but a little ""nouvelle cuisine"" for our taste and although tasty, was a little on the small side. My husband and I had a cocktail one night, which was fine, although we felt the bar lacked atmosphere (this was about 8.45pm on a sunday night though).On departure, the hotel granted us a late check-out extension, which was much appreciated.",4,2014,08,24
236,"Great location, great service","We stayed here for 2 nights.  Check-in was quick and friendly, and we were also given a map of Dublin with points of interest to us circled and explained.  Very helpful.  The room was nicely furnished and big enough.  We liked the evening turn down service with pillow chocolates.  We didn't eat at the hotel as there were many places to eat nearby.  The hotel was a very easy walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and Temple Bar.",5,2014,08,24
236,fantastic location,"Just returned from Ireland and began and ended our trip at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin. Comfortable, great location, staff went above and beyond. Marvin, the concierge, was fantastic Would definitely return!",4,2014,08,23
236,Great location,We stayed for 2 nights before heading north. The hotel is conveniently located and the staff are helpful. The rooms are good... A little dated... But you can live with that considering how close it is to everything. Breakfasts were pretty tasty - A lot of selection. I would definitely recommend staying here.,4,2014,08,21
236,Fine. Good enough.,"Stayed there last night. Felt good. Quiet. Nice and clean room . Excellent service. The food were not really good value. Too expensive. However, all over all it is good. I will be back to give it another chance. :-)Thank you anyway.",3,2014,08,20
236,"Great Location, Comfortable and Reasonable","We stayed here for the first two nights of our honeymoon and it was great. Loved the location, walking distance to just about everything. Friendly staff and loved the concierge. Cost of the room and breakfast was very reasonable for being in the city. Room was comfortable.",5,2014,08,20
236,Great location and value,"Stayed at Brooks weekend of August 15th, check in was very efficient and courteous.  The lady on desk anticipated every query.  The room was lovely, big for city centre hotel.  It was quite quirky and welcoming with an old fashioned radio and bust is the corner.  The decoration was lovely.  Wifi worked very well.  Water, tea and coffee was all available in the room.  The toiletries were very nice, great to see conditioner as hotels do not normally provide.  Nice touch!  The hotel is in a great location, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.
Two minor things I would have liked; a sheet along with duvet.  I just prefer a sheet.  And a few more outlets available, between two people with phones, cameras etc, we struggled to keep everything charged.",5,2014,08,17
236,"Good Location, comfotable and reasonable value for Dublin","This is one of the better Hotels in Dublin I have stayed in.  Very clean and good standard of Decor/furnishings. Room was not huge but was adequate for a couple of nights, standard was high.  Breakfast very good although service was quite slow (long wait for Coffee and toast after placing request).  Check in and check out were smooth and did not have to queue.  Free Wifi worked well with no issues.  No bottled water available in room which is always disappointing.. Temperature was reasonably comfortable in August.",4,2014,08,16
236,Delightful!,"We very much enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Brooks Hotel.  It is small and charming and extremely convenient to most things touristy in Dublin.  The rooms, while not large by any standard, were decorated beautifully.  It's the only hotel we have stayed at that offers a pillow bar - a choice from among many types of pillows.  The breakfast downstairs was amazing - a full buffet and made to order.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,16
236,Can't believe it's four stars,"When greeted at the reception desk, we filled in our information and gave our credit card imprint, at which point the lady at the desk was ready to send us away - without keys. When we pointed this out, she gave us the keys to one room until we reminded her that we had reserved two rooms. Upon getting to our rooms, we discovered the wife didn't work, and when someone came to check it out, the person very rudely pointed out that the problem was on our end because we had our phones on airplane mode - we had to point out several times that wifi can be turned on without removing our phones from airplane mode at which point he grudgingly agreed to talk to the manager about turning the router on and off. Four hours later, still no wifi. Next we discovered that the TV in the second room didn't work and neither did the air conditioning. When we pointed this out we were told by the front desk that they were aware of this problem and that the room was a maintenance issue. We requested a room change that was completed at 11 pm that night. The next day during breakfast, we took bets on how long it would take for one of the servers to make eye contact with us so that we could request more coffee - it took 10 minutes. Four stars is an overly generous rating for this hotel - there are better hotels out there at these prices. Don't bother staying here unless your expectations are low.",2,2014,08,14
236,Good Hotel and Great Location,"We stayed in Dublin for two nights at the Brooks. It is a small boutique hotel and very nice indeed. We checked in with no trouble and got a quiet room on the third floor. The receptionist seemed a bit green as she was not very knowledgeable about the surroundings, etc. I wanted to know where to get a sim card- she didn't know.. btw, there is a Stephen's Green shopping center with a meteor store for a sim card. The concierge apparently had gone home as it was a Sunday- I guess that is what you get if you stay in a small hotel.
The room was nice and spacious. We didn't get the breakfast package but paid 10 euros the next morning to try- it was good but nothing spectacular. We ate across the street the next day- a tiny little cafe serving yummy coffee and omelets.
The bar area was very nice, we sat and had a drink in the evening as it was raining and quite chilly…We went for a nice dinner around the corner to the hairy lemon one evening.
Overall it was a good experience. We took the airport coach in the morning from Dawson street which was a 7 minute walk from the hotel.",4,2014,08,13
236,"Nice Location, But a Bit Pricey","Very nice, warm hotel.  You couldn't ask for a better location to the City Center restaurants, Sights and Pubs.  All the staff was friendly and helpful.  Fresh coffee each morning was a favorite.  The rooms were clean and sizable.  Beds and pillows very comfortable.  However, no printer for the computer.  (You are supposed to email to the front desk.  Not good for this type of hotel, in my opinion.)  We took two wonderful tours through ""Irish Day Tours"" that met at The Old Stone Church on Suffolk Street.  This hotel is perfectly located for this little walk to meet the buses and there you will see the Molly Malone statue as well!.  I just thought this hotel had been a bit overpriced for the ""weekend"" rates.  What made me compare was that we had just been in London and stayed at The Montague on the Gardens - which was an exquisite hotel - and the Brooks Hotel is not quite up to those standards but yet charges more. I will still recommend it, though. There is a lot to enjoy!",4,2014,08,11
236,"Great location, great service, friendly staff","This hotel was in a great location, in easy walking distance of most everything we wanted to see.  Conner the greeter was a delight.  He was the hotel.  Very friendly, courteous and helpful.  We very much enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,08,11
236,Ideal Hotel; Ideal Location!,"Spent two days with family at the Brooks Hotel; greeted warmly by concierge, Connor who is a real treat and very helpful. When asked where the nearest good restaurant was located, he walked us down the block and introduced us to the owner. Room was very clean with necessary amenities. All staff were courteous and very helpful. Hotel is ideally located near shopping, pubbing and sight seeing - meaning just a few blocks. Breakfast is very good with plenty of choices. 
Highly recommend the Brooks if you are planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2014,08,10
236,Perfect spot for a visit to Dublin,"Cute hotel in great area perfect for us to explore Dublin with our teenagers in tow.Walk or short cab ride to everything. Well appointed rooms, great breakfast and  friendly  staff made for a great experience for our maiden voyage to Ireland. ",5,2014,08,07
236,Great location,"This Hotel has the perfect location for a day shopping or a night on the town 
Have stayed here a number of times and can't rate it highly enough
The staff are very friendly and welcoming and Conor is on hand to sort out any query you might have, always a pleasure chatting with him
The breakfast is amazing possibly the best I've had in an Irish Hotel
Look forward to a return visit in October",5,2014,08,06
236,Weekend with Friends,"Fantastic Hotel, we stayed for 3 nights in July, from the moment we stepped into the hotel the service was outstanding from the gentleman with the top hat at the door who gave us such a warm welcome, to the reception, bar and room service we could not have asked for anything else. The rooms were excellent and very comfortable, we had a couple of meals in the bar which were very nice, and the breakfast is outstanding.  The location is just right for visiting all the locations in Dublin, we look forward to returning and would not hesitate to stay anywhere else but at Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,08,06
236,Central location and friendly!,"Stayed here for 2 nights in July.  Excellent location, large, clean rooms, helpful concierge, great breakfast. The only downside was the room contains outlets for the various countries, but they didn't all work (american one didn't).",5,2014,08,05
236,Weekend with Family,"Absolutely top class hotel, fantastic locations, staff amazing, breakfast to die for.  All the little toilitries are The White Company so thats lovely.  Breakfast amazing, and added bonus is that breakfast is served until 11.30 at weekends, which makes it more of a bruch.

Would have not hesitation in recommending this hotel !!",5,2014,08,05
236,excellent,"I have been very very lucky with this hotel; I booked a superior double room without really knowing what kind of hotel or room it will be. I was delighted to come to very big room, with sitting room, super big king size bed and wonderful bath. The location is excellent, we could walk to most places we wanted to see. The hotel doesn't have a parking space which was the only problem; there is a garage just across the street, but it's not cheap. The restaurant also was very good.",5,2014,08,03
236,Lovely stay to start our journey!,"Brooks was in a great location in Dublin.  We were able to walk to most of the landmarks, sights in Dublin. The staff was very friendly - even the chef was greeting guests. 

Breakfast was well appointed with a buffet & prepared options. 

Would stay at Brooks again for sure!",5,2014,08,03
236,First time in Ireland ,Arriving at the Brooks Hotel was a nice welcome to Ireland. The friendly staff and amazingly attentive concierge have us wonderful tips of the area. If you want to be in the middle of the best part of Dublin to shop and eat then the Brooks is for you as this location is the bomb dot com!,5,2014,07,31
236,Excellent boutique hôtel,"Very nice hotel,modern, excellent city center location.  Conner is the daytime concierge and he is a treasure!  Great advice and stories.  Can't comment on breakfast…we got hooked on a cafe around the corner…but that's part of it's excellent location.",4,2014,07,30
236,Don't believe the rave reviews - especially for the price,"I booked this hotel quite far ahead of my traveling. It was the most expensive hotel I stayed at in Ireland. I had a room on the second floor overlooking the airconditioning units. Which were loud. And a vacant office building. It was darkish and depressing. The room itself was clean but the old style is not charming. The bathroom needs updating. There was some old potpourri on the counter - really? Like I'm staying at my great aunt's place. The bed was comfortable. They have a ""pillow menu"" to choose your pillow. I followed the instructions but was never brought another pillow. The one on the bed was okay though. Breakfast was included for me and was fine. I was told after the fact that breakfast also included anything on the menu (not just the buffet). The location of this hotel is great - you can walk to everything. When I complained about my room (noise, etc) the management was very very responsive and attempted to find me another room (but basically all were same situation so it was not worth moving). I gave the hotel a higher rating for this bit of customer service.",3,2014,07,30
236,Started out our trip in Ireland on a very positive note,Everything about our room was first rate. Our room and hall very quiet. Staff extremely helpful. Hotel location a real advantage. Not being in Temple Bar weekend noise and crowds most welcome. One oddity: no printer for the two computers (tho one didn't work) available to guests. ,5,2014,07,29
236,Excellent stay,"We were first greeted by the head concierge who introduced himself as Conner. He's amazing. He's everywhere about the hotel greeting guests by name and bantering about the day, what to do and his Irish-ness. The room had all the amenities and extras. Thin walls and slamming hallway doors but a comfortable stay. ",5,2014,07,26
236,Great place for a great weekend!,"This was our first time staying at the Brooks hotel, but it won't be our last. From the moment we walked in to the time we left we were so well looked after. All the staff were so helpful and courteous. From the wonderful breakfast to the great bedroom with everything you need, it was a great hotel.  On the better side of Dublin to stay its a great location for shops and public transport, restaurants and bars, away from the tourist attraction of Temple Bar area.",5,2014,07,22
236,Great boutique hotel in Dublin,"Recently stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin . The rooms were spacious and well appointed. Wifi included. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. Breakfast was included in our package and included both a very nice buffet and an order what you want menu. Try the oatmeal, it's divine. You are a few minutes walk from Grafton St. And lots of great restaurants and pubs. The bar in the hotel is nice too. I would definitely stay there again.",4,2014,07,21
236,Wonderful stay,Great hotel.  Staff and service was wonderful.  Close to everything in the city.  Breakfast was incredible.  Great traditional Irish breakfast.  Room was perfect and very clean.  Definitely would recommend this hotel.,5,2014,07,19
236,Good hotel,"Our room was fantastic. Our view was of the trash bins...The gym was one treadmill and a set of free weights, but it was a standard hotel. The location was fantastic and the staff at the front desk were very helpful.",3,2014,07,17
236,Perfect location,"Stayed here for one night with my husband, and from check in to checking out everything was perfect. Staff lovely and friendly, food great and lovely room. The location was perfect for us as we wanted to spend our day around st Stephens green. There is also parking directly across from hotel. Can't wait to get back for another stay.",5,2014,07,15
236,Wonderful Staff,"This is a great hotel with an outstanding staff.  The property is very well appointed with an excellent bar and restaurant.  As other reviewers have noted the location cannot be beat with easy access to all of the great areas of Dublin. The rooms are cozy with excellent beds and very nice bathrooms. I also recommend including breakfast with your stay, it is an excellent value.

The thing that really separates this hotel is the staff which is really saying something in a country where service is generally excellent and people are exceptionally friendly.  This will definitely be our place to stay on any future trips to Dublin.",5,2014,07,14
236,The absolutely best,"This place had the perfect location being near to public transportation, stores, multiple eating facilities and even walking distance to assorted sites.  My 87yo Mother and I could not have chosen a better place to stay.  If you want somewhere that isn't a ""chain"", is smaller and so much more friendly - treats you like royalty - then you should seriously consider the Brooks !  We arrived earlier than check-in so they had us stay in a cozy quiet guest area with free internet access - after a 9hr night trip it was a welcome place to unwind.  The concierge service and front desk staff are exceptional taking care of you and suggesting outings - would return here in a heart beat.  Oh, and the breakfast menu is out of this world . . . the staff even remembered some of our preferences!!   The room and facilities very comfortable . . . we didn't really spend a lot of time just sitting in the room anyway, there was too much to explore and experience.   I don't think we can say enough about the hotel, their staff, and how thankful we are to have had the opportunity to stay with them - it was luck picking a place that made our whole trip memorable.",5,2014,07,13
236,Lovely Hotel,Great little hotel with perfect location. Only a few minutes to Trinity college or Temple Bar.  There are tons of pubs close by and a grocery store a block away if you want to get some snacks. The Air coach bus stop is only 3 minutes down the road so it is easy to get to the airport for E7.00. The staff is extremely helpful as well.  We had breakfast there and it was plentiful with a good variety of hot and cold items.  The beds were comfy and the room updated and spacious.  Would recommend!,5,2014,07,13
236,Weekend break and Show with my Wife,"A Great hotel we were made feel at home from the moment we arrived at the door of this Hotel and it just got better from there on,after we were booked in and shown to our room. Within five minutes a small gift was delivered to the room me to wish me Happy Birthday it was a lovely touch and it was just the start of a brilliant weekend in this lovely City Center hotel. the staff were just so nice and could not do enough to make your stay as pleasant  as possible from the Reception to the waiting and room staff to the concierge Connor. as were were up for a show in the Gaiety it was ideal as it was just five minutes walk away from it ,,, Will stay again when we go to our next show in Dublin.",5,2014,07,12
236,Superb stay in Dublin!,"If you like being treated like you matter, this is your hotel.  After a very early 4:30 am departure from Paris, we arrived at The Brooks Hotel on a Sunday.  While is does not look like much on the outside, inside is everything you would want.  We were greeted at the door by the nicest, most personable concierge, Connor.  He guided us to the desk and after we found out our room was not yet available suggested we have a cup of coffee/tea in the restaurant to unwind. He stored our bags and gave us some safety tips about the area. (""Mind your handbags and wallets.  Do not take your passports with you. Leave them in the room safe.  Beware of Pickpockets!!)  He then gave us a quick ""what to see"" of the area including church service times.  The desk staff was very helpful, supplied a map of the area and gave us a key to their ""residents lounge"" where we could relax and even sleep until our room was ready. The lounge itself was like a large living room from a grand estate, supplies with puffy, comfy chairs and couches and walls of books and other reading materials.  Our room was outfitted with 2 queen beds and all amenities you would expect in the States, including a ""pillow menu""!! The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet.  The hotel is located on Drury Street which is withing a very short walking distance of all the pubs, shops and restaurants.  It was a GREAT stay!!!",5,2014,07,10
236,Perfectly situated. Elegant. Friendly.,"Attentive cheerful staff. One of the best concierge in Dublin. Superb breakfast. Rooms comfortable and roomy for city center. Impeccably clean. Nice touches like music on radio in room to greet us. Easy walk to Trinity, St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar.",5,2014,07,09
236,"Wonderful Rooms, Location, and Service","Location in the heart of things, but on a quieter street.  Rooms large and spotless, very comfortable with temperature control, high grade toiletries, even a pillow menu!  And so quiet both from interior and exterior noise, we slept very well in the comfortable bed.  Terrific service with individual attention, helping with maps, things to see, even arranging taxi for airport.  Good breakfast, and they will even bring it to the room.  Had everything I needed, including hair dryer, but no alarm clock at any hotel in Ireland, so bring your own, though they provide wake up calls.
Pricey, but worth it.",5,2014,07,09
236,"Not bad, had better but great location","This was a bit of a splurge for the hubby's 40th birthday night in the city and for what I had spent, I was hoping for better.  We were apparently ""upgraded"" to a Junior Suite on the 5th floor but I'm not sure that was a good thing as the only difference with the room that I could spot was that there was a tiny balcony overlooking the street and with that came a noise problem. Not totally unexpected with a city centre hotel but disappointing as there must be plenty of rooms not overlooking the street and I had specifically asked for as quiet a location as possible.  The JCB digger working on the street Sunday morning would have been a problem if we were booked in another night.  

As it was, the room was an okay size (but not a suite by my definition- shouldn't there be a small sofa or a chaise or a seating area?!), nicely and comfortably furnished and very clean.  

The bathroom was magnificent and I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to take advantage of the oversized bath.  The separate walk-in shower was excellent, great pressure and plenty of fluffy towels to hand.  

The breakfast next morning was available until after 11am I believe, and was most welcome. A very good buffet spread with several cooked options available. 

Best thing about the hotel was the location, which suited our needs for the day and the dinner plans we had arranged elsewhere. Other times we'd go out of our way to avoid city centre locations.  All in all, the hotel really was just a place to get dressed up and crash later on but we wanted the extra comfort. 

It was nice, but not sure I'd pay the money to stay there again, particularly when I know there's better value to be had elsewhere. We thought we'd try it out though!",3,2014,07,09
236,A really nice hotel right in the middle of everything,"This is a really nice hotel.  If you have not traveled to Europe before be prepared for some differences, but the rooms are very nice and large by European standards.  The staff is excellent and very helpful.  When we arrived late morning from our overnight flight, we could not check in due to the time, but they did all the paperwork, took our luggage, and escorted us to a beautiful lounge with some drinks and PC's to e-mail safe arrival.  The breakfast was included and they were very good about finding food for our grand-daughter who has a food allergy.  The best part is it's location.  Two blocks to Temple Bar, four to Trinity College and the book of Kells.  close to shopping, St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Tourist Info center, and the hop on-hop off bus.",4,2014,07,07
236,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel and very welcoming. Rooms were a good size , bathroom spotless. Everybody I came into contact with were very friendly. Would stay here again.Breakfast was very good with a nice selection of both hot and cold dishes.",5,2014,07,07
236,Great Dublin hotel,"Upon arrival at the Brooks Hotel, the staff greeted me warmly and were courteous and helpful.  Clean and neat rooms, travel sized must-haves in the bathroom, and a well-stocked breakfast in the morning.  Good location in the city.",5,2014,07,06
236,Agree with all other Reviews CONOR is fabulous!!,"2nd stay at Brooks Hotel Dublin June 2014 and just a great as 1st stay in April 2012. Staff could not do more to extend a great welcome. Concierge Conor stands out - warm, friendly,  - a great character and ambassador to the hotel and Dublin. HIGHLY recommend - right in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to everything you are likely to want to see.",5,2014,07,06
236,Great location,"Wonderful location right in the centre of the shopping area, surrounded by good bars and restaurants. The staff on reception and the doorman could not have been friendlier and more helpful. 
I checked in early because I'd had a morning flight and they found a room for me very quickly, although the website says 2 pm got check in.
The room was fine, not out of the ordinary, not massive but room for the furniture including a large bed, comfy chair and table and a dressing table and chair. The bath was a little on the small side, the toiletries were from the White Company so lovely, not cheap! 
All in all a great stay and I will definitely return, ",4,2014,07,05
236,"Location, Product, People = Perfect !","You probably cannot find better location in Dublin. Just off the busy streets. Walk to everything . Temple Bar for noise and action, 8 mins. ! Lots of good restaurants very close. The hotel- spotless, great reception area hosted by professional , kind and helpful staff. Connor, the lobby ambassador, is a great resource and a go to guy for taxies, restaurants and the like.Our room was very spacious with good bed, toiletries, and seating area. Unfortunately, a slight glitch with the AC resulted in an example of how the staff handle customer service. Within 10 minutes , two staff, Zolton and Shawn, helped us relocate to another room literally carrying our toothbrushes and all in what had to be record time!
Somebody has set a very high bar for service and later that evening I think I found that person circulating the lobby and bar area, welcoming guests . What impressed me was she did not announce her position as hotel manager, but introduced herself as Ann and sincerely inquired about our travel plans and home country. Have travelled extensively and usually find management invisible . Good touch and I hope the ownership group acknowledge her accordingly. No, I'm not a relative! Actually was at curbside when we departed with hugs and dining suggestions in our next destination.
Great breakfast room with no shortage of efficient staff. 
When in Dubin, do the Brooks.",5,2014,07,04
236,Three Words: Concierge Conor O'Connell,"My husband and I just returned from a much-too brief first trip to Ireland. I enjoy planning our journeys, but I didn't have time to plan this quick trip myself and relied on Exploring Ireland which booked us at The Brooks for our first and last nights. This is a delightful hotel which is perfectly located and convenient for walking to all of the sites in Dublin. It has features of the boutique, luxury hotel that it is (e.g. pillow menu, turn-down service, complimentary bottled water, a residents' lounge), but is also warm and friendly. 

My primary reason for writing this review is to give a shout-out to the amazing concierge Conor O'Connell. He is the kind of person who can ""make"" any business. He makes you feel so welcome and comfortable. He appears to make a point of remembering names of all the guests, even when you return to the hotel days later. He is ready with tips and advice.

When we return to Dublin, we will book again at the Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,07,04
236,Great Service,"This hotel has the best customer service I have ever experienced.  On arrival, as well as all during our stay, they could not do enough for us.  I had some concern over my room shortly after arrival because the view wasn't great - the manager was up in a flash to talk to me and give me options.  I ended up staying in my room and was quite happy with it.  The breakfast was great, a wide selection of buffet as well as items from the kitchen.  Their porridge with cream and whiskey was out of this world.  Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again.  The views are not particularly good, because of its location, but if you're not looking for a view (why would you in Dublin), this is the absolutely best place to be - short walk to Trinity College and shopping, yet not boisterous as in the Temple Bar area.  Was quite sad to leave Dublin, in part because I didn't want to leave the hotel - really superb!",5,2014,07,02
236,Great place,"All I heard were great comments from the 13 people in our group. This was our first trip to Dublin and most were very tired after arriving from the US. We were able to get a couple of rooms to check in early so some could rest, but they also had a nice room in a lower level with couches you could take a quick nap in that was secure. The location was great, rooms and service excellent. The only thing I wish is that we had stayed longer.",5,2014,06,29
236,Perfect location & great staff!,"We have stayed at Brooks Hotel in Dublin at least 10 times. It has the perfect location downtown with walking distance to almost everything. When you arrive at the hotel there is a very welcoming atmosphere. The staff is the best, our favourite is their concierge Connor, the most helpful guy in the world and he makes sure that you have a nice stay.
The bar is a very relaxing area in the hotel and they serve snacks and light meals. The bartenders are often giving us tips on how to make a certain drink when at home again.  In the restaurant they serve delicious meals using local products (for example from the Dublin Bay area).
The rooms are quiet and clean. maybe not the biggest but big enough since we do not spend so much time in the room during our stays. If you come to Dublin a busy weekend (for example Arthur Guinness Day) you should ask for a room away from the street since it can be noisy then, but most of the times it is very quiet. 
Their Irish breakfast is tasty and has everything you need. It is a trifle, but I will write it anyway; we always ask for stronger coffee than the ordinary served. I think that is the only negative thing I can come up with! 
Brooks might not be the cheapest hotel, but I do not think that you will be dissapointed if you decide to stay there!",5,2014,06,29
236,Perfect location,"Great hotel in the heart of Dublin. Ideal for exploring the city because everything is accessible on foot. Room was clean and well proportioned with comfy bed and down covers. Breakfast really really good with individual servings besides the buffets. We hired a car from the airport and were concerned about parking, but there's a big garage right across the street which is perfect.",5,2014,06,28
236,Great central location,"This is a great central location as you can walk to almost anything.  They have added a second layer of windows to keep out noise.  Very helpful.  The room is larger than most, the bathroom is average size and has a combined tub and shower.  Wi-Fi worked well but is unsecured.   The staff is well-trained and helpful.  We would definitely choose this place another time.",5,2014,06,25
236,Peaceful oasis in a busy city,"Convenient to the restaurants, pubs, shops and attractions in the center of Dublin, the hotel is a quiet, gem with attentive staff, very pleasant accommodations and a good restaurant. Discounted rate parking is available a block away, but one can load/ unload directly outside the hotel. It was a great base from which to walk around the city for a day before heading out to the south west. We would certainly have been happy to stay longer.",5,2014,06,24
236,Excellent location in the middle of shopping and sightseeing for a fair price,"Very helpful and competent employees in a nice hotel.
Nice design features and contemporary architecture.
Minor maintenance issues (wooden front cover of bath tub needs some repair due to water dripping out of the shower; wooden floor in front of bathroom needs some repair in room 114)",5,2014,06,24
236,Favorite Hotel In Ireland,"My husband and I stayed here for our fist two nights in Ireland. It was truly the best hotel experience. The breakfasts and dinner we amazingly delicious. For breakfast you have a selection of fresh bread, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits, juices and/or a full Irish breakfast.  We had our best breakfast experience at the Books Hotel. We tried the Guinness Beef Stew and it was so tasty. One of the best. The atmosphere was relaxed. We were able to go down to the dining area in the evening and lounge and plan our vacation days ahead of us while having a drink. The decor is great. The hotel room itself was a great size and clean. The towels were soft. The staff was friendly and Connor the concierge was very helpful. There are so many shops, restaurants, pubs, museums, etc within walking distance. Such a great location. We highly recommend a stay at Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,06,24
236,Review Of Brooks Hotel - Dublin,"This hotel was EXCELLENT!  The staff couldn't have been more helpful, courteous and attentive - customer service was fantastic.  The facilities were first class, the hotel was clean and the bathroom was large and modern.  In short, the accommodations exceeded all our expectations, and our stay at the Brooks was wonderful.  It was nice to stay in a hotel on a quiet side street, which was right in the heart of Dublin, close to all the tourist attractions.  Would recommend this facility to anyone.",5,2014,06,22
236,Wonderful Dublin Stay!,"The perfect hotel located just right! Took the bus from the airport to the city center and the stroll to the hotel was a delightful introduction to Dublin. The staff was friendly, accommodating and so helpful. Every need was attended to with lovely Irish hospitality and no request was too much. I would particularly like to give kudos to Connor the concierge. Incredible attention to detail! Very comfortable room and our request for the top floor was honored without hesitation. If I ever find my way back to Dublin this is my choice for lodging!",5,2014,06,22
236,Great stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2014.  The hotel is in a great location - quiet but within walking distance to restaurants, pubs, shopping, museums, parks - everything we wanted to do.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  We opted for the breakfast included with the room - they had good buffet selection and cooked-to-order, good food.  We didn't dine in the restaurant, but did try their seafood chowder one night which was delicious.  I would definitely recommend the Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,06,22
236,Great location in Dublin,"We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2014.  This hotel is very clean and our room and bathroom were large and modern.  They are in a quiet location on a street close to St. Stephens Green and Trinity College.  The concierge was helpful with travel arrangements to the airport and with directions for sightseeing and dinner.  There are many good restaurants/pubs close by, and there is a market just down the street.  (Try the “Hairy Lemon” pub right around the corner from the hotel for lunch.)  We walked everyplace we wanted to visit in Dublin—St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin Castle, the Temple Bar area, National Museum, Nation Gallery of Ireland, etc.  Breakfast was delicious—a large buffet with the option of also ordering hot items, the full Irish breakfast, etc.  We highly recommend the Brooks Hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,06,21
236,Full service hotel in an excellent location.,"Lovely accommodations with excellent customer service.  Rooms are large and extremely comfortable.  After a long day of touring Dublin, it was great to return to this oasis in the heart of the city.   Kudos to Conner and Rodger for making us feel at home.",5,2014,06,20
236,Lovely Hotel in an excellent location close to Grafton St.,"We had a wonderful stay here last weekend in Dublin. It is ideally located for those of you who wish to visit the city and roam the shopping district and restaurant districts of Dublin. Check in was easy and very friendly, our room was comfortable and well located away above the street so noise was not an issue. Connor looked after us at the concierge desk recommended some lovely bars and restaurants nearby. The food served was well prepared and the cocktails at the house bar were fantastic. I would have no qualms about staying here on my next trip to Dublin!",4,2014,06,16
236,Loved this place.  Perfect location.,"When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by Conner as well as the front desk staff.  Our bags were taken care of and we embarked on our first Dublin adventure, lunch at The Hairy Lemon.  When we returned our rooms were ready.

Our room was very quiet and well appointed.  Cannot find fault with anything.  Conner helped us find an excellent tour to Newgrange (led by an archaeologist).  Other staff helped us with dinner suggestions and reservations.  Breakfast was excellent with many options.  Service at breakfast was outstanding.  

Location was great. Just a wonderful stay.",5,2014,06,10
236,Great Hotel,"All of the staff were extremely patient and helpful.  The hotel was spotless and the room was neat, clean and very comfortable.  The breakfast was excellent and the servers were friendly.  One of the concierges, Connor, went above and beyond in helping us with our car rental agency.  I would stay there again.",5,2014,06,09
236,"Great central location, excellent service","I chose this for the start of our recent trip to Ireland.  It was a great choice.  The hotel is ideally located in central Dublin, convenient to St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, the Temple Bar district, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.  We were able to walk of use the buses to get everywhere.  Most of the bus stops were within a 2-5 minute walk.   Breakfast was very good, a buffet plus the choice of a hot breakfast in addition to the buffet.   The staff was extremely helpful, and eager to be of service.  Each time we passed through the lobby it seemed as if we were asked if we needed anything.   I messed up and brought the wrong power adapters, but that was no issue as the front desk has them to loan or purchase.    When we were ready to leave for our walk of the Wicklow Way the hotel was just around the corner from the stop for the #16 bus to Marlay Park, very convenient.  Definitely a place I would return on future visits.",5,2014,06,05
236,Very good :),"Our first visit to Ireland started well with a couple of nights in the Brooks Hotel. Great central location within walking distance to pubs (try the Hairy Lemon down the street!), shops, cafes and attractions. 

Reception and bar area is lovely, hotel room clean and nice and comfy with free wifi and facilities etc. Aircon in our room was a bit weak but not all that necessary in Dublins mild climate.

The concierge was lovely, so funny and very helpful! 

Would stay again! ",5,2014,06,05
236,Love it!,"We were first timers to Dublin during our recent trip and couldn’t have been happier having chosen the Brooks Hotel.
Centrally located the hotel is very close to Temple Bar and lots and lots of restaurants and bars.
The hotel is also a comfortable 10 min walk, with luggage, from where the air link 747 bus  stops.
The interiors of this hotel is fantastic, such a welcoming homely feeling, while it still has a bit of an ‘old world’ charm about it.
While it is a strange thing to write in a review, it is by the far the cleanest smelling hotel I have ever stayed in!!
The guest rooms are very plush indeed, big comfortable beds and very nice décor.  The old school radio that is playing in the room as you enter in a nice touch.  The bathroom is well stocked with good quality toiletries.
Our room rate included breakfast each morning.  There is a plentiful buffet of cold options and you can pick one item from the a la carte menu.  The first morning I chose the Irish Breakfast, which was fantastic.  The scrambled egg the next morning was not quite so great.
My one negative with this hotel was that a few requests made of staff in the restaurant at breakfast took quite a long time to be attended to. 
Other than that minor issue, the staff throughout the hotel were polite and friendly and other requests were attended to very quickly.
Overall, if you are visiting Dublin, I would highly recommend the Brooks hotel.  I know that if we find ourselves in the fair city again, we will seek out the Brooks hotel a second time.",5,2014,06,04
236,Very comfortable and quiet,"This is a great location and surprisingly quiet. You can walk everywhere. Check in was a bit of a mess. She actually asked us if we were sure we had the right hotel....then she found our information..they had keyed in our last name incorrectly. This happened to every other couple checking in as well....so this is something they need to work on.

Connor is great and everything about this hotel is nice and comfortable.

Breakfast is good...however if you go close to the end of breakfast...you will have a very difficult time with getting service.

Keep in mind...this hotel does not give umbrellas to their guests when it rains and it rains often.",4,2014,06,04
236,Home Away From Home,"We stayed in the Brooks Hotel for three nights. From the moment we arrived we felt right at home. We arrived early but checking in early was no problem. The staff we encountered were so very helpful. Connor got to know us and took the time to recommend sights and orientate us in the city. 

The room was ideal. Very clean and quiet despite being very centrally located in the city centre. 

Breakfast was the only meal we ate in the hotel however it was consistently perfect. Great choices at the buffet and the al a carte selections were broad. The staff in Francesca's Restaurant and Cafe Lounge were very welcoming. 

The hotel is in a great location. Five minutes to Grafton Street for shopping and dining, and not much further to Temple Bar. 

Could not recommend this place more. Great value for money, awesome location and very friendly and helpful staff.",5,2014,06,02
236,Lovely Gesture.,"Our review is actually short. On our way to our meal at another restaurant, we walked past this hotel and they have a bar named The Jasmine Bar, and Jasmine just happens to be our Daughter's name. So, we came back here for a coffee before going home. We sat down in the Jasmine Bar and ordered coffee for me, hot chocolate for our Daughter and my OH had a lemon cake with sorbet & cool drink. We were talking to the Barman and explaining why we were here, and He laughed. When we went to pay the bill, they gave us the hot chocolate and coffee FOC as a mark of gesture. We were really touched by this and we will go back, maybe not for the hotel, but most certainly for the food. REALLY touched by this. and a BIG thank You Staff of The Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,06,01
236,Great location for a stay in Dublin.,"We loved our stay at Brooks Hotel. 
Our room was lovely, breakfast was great.  We didn't have dinner in the hotel, but the bar staff were very friendly. 
Best thing about this hotel is it's location, if your visiting Dublin City the location is perfect. 
I would ",5,2014,05,31
236,Very Nice-Good Choice,"May 2014-  The Brooks was our first hotel on our trip.  The location is right in the middle of everything-easy walking distance to eat and shop. The rooms were very clean and the staff very helpful and pleasant.  Recommend!
Fade St Social restaurant is right across the street.  Mmmm.",4,2014,05,29
236,Wonder full place,What a lovely hotel. We stayed for one night. It was just wonderful. The Staff were superb very friendly and couldn't do enough to help. Food fantastic. Would strongly recommended. A place to relax in the centre of Dublin and make sure you ask for the complementrey foot spa brought to ur room after a hard day shopping ,5,2014,05,29
236,Perfect Customer Service,"We traveled to Ireland for our anniversary staying in Dublin two nights on the front end and one night on the back end at the Brooks Hotel. It is nestled along a quiet street with plenty of night life and shopping a few blocks away. The desk staff was quite helpful regarding all aspects of our stay. The rooms are large by European standards with comfortable beds/pillows. The bathroom is clean and sizable with plenty of counter space. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom as well as one in the desk drawer in the living space which was nice. On our return night we had dessert waiting in our room as a ""welcome back"" treat. We did have a slight issue with the temperature of the room that night but everything possible was done to rectify the situation along with follow-up phone calls to check on us.  I look forward to staying in this lovely property again very soon!",5,2014,05,29
236,"Location, location, location and location","We stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 night and loved each night better than the last. when we were checked in we were greeted by very polite and efficient staff. since we arrived around noon we expected not to have our room ready and they could hold our luggage but it was and we went up and dropped off our stuff. we we reviewed our room and found a few stuff not up to snuff. some areas were not clean and the sheets had some stains. the next day when we left for the day my wife mentioned what was array. when we came back that night everything we talked about was fixed and it looks like they did some more stuff. we had a letter saying they were sorry, and a bowl of fruit. this was totally above the call of duty but much appreciated. all the staff we interacted with extremely polite and friendly which just added to our experience.
as for the location we took the airlink bus in from the airport and the hotel was a 3 min walk away from the bus stop. there are several restaurants with in a minutes and several every minute you walk out. this place is close to everything if you are a tourist or on business. we got a great deal for air and hotel from a web site and when we come again will try to stay here first and even if it is not the cheapest might stay again. 
 our room was a bit bigger than we expected for Europe and was very quiet on the first floor right over the main entrance. we only hear the occasional horn during night time traffic.",5,2014,05,29
236,a very comfortable place,The Brooks is a wonderful hotel near many of Dublins top sites. A super staff that is sooo helpful.Great bar and restaurant also! On my next trip to Dublin I am definitely  going to stay there! You should too!!,5,2014,05,29
236,LOVE IT!!!,"The staff is very pleasant and helpful. The Location is Great -  close to several Pubs, restaurants, downtown area and sightseing buses.
The room and bathroom are comfortable and the breakfast  is good and the price is ok.",5,2014,05,28
236,"Great location, wonderful service","We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brooks.  Connor, the concierge, is one of a kind.  He got us on to a sold out tour and made some grat recommendations for places to eat.  The breakfast is awesome, it includes a buffet or made to order.  You can really fill up if you have a mind to and everything was delicious.  The staff are super courteous and helpful.  My family highly recommends the Brooks.",5,2014,05,28
236,First trip to Dublin could not have been better!,"Brooks Hotel has a wonderful location!  Truth be told, Dublin is a small city and everything is somewhat close, but Brooks was very close to most everything I wanted to see.  Just a few minutes from Trinity College, river, shopping district, Temple Bar, fabulous restaurants!

Best thing?  If I HAD to pick, I'd say it was the wonderful breakfast (included).  Not only continental favorites: fresh baked breads, local cheeses, compotes, fresh fruits, fresh yogurts, all the cooked to order was included as well.  Still not sure what a kipper is, and I've never had porridge with cream and Jameson's before but good God, everything was delicious.

Our king bed was comfy and warm.  Nothing like European bedsheets!  Expect a tinier bathroom if you're a Yank like myself, but good water pressure and plenty of hot water.

Service is terrific.  they fall over themselves to make sure you are taken care of.

Love this place!",5,2014,05,28
236,"Wonderful, charming hotel","The Brooks Hotel is the perfect hotel to stay in Dublin if you want genuine old world charm and excellent service without sacrificing conveniences and comfort.  The rooms (including bathrooms) are comfortable and modern, and the lobby, restaurant and bar retain the dark wood and appurtenances characteristic of a old hotel.  The staff are very cordial and helpful.  The hotel is very well located to get to major cultural attractions and shops.  We recommend it highly and will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,05,27
236,Great location & professional service,"We stayed as two couples at the Brooks for two nights at the end of our Ireland holiday. We checked in early, but the hotel stored our luggage for us till our rooms were ready so we were free to do other things. When we got our rooms we were disappointed that they weren't close to each other, but as it turned out the front desk staff had made a mistake and one couple got a higher-end room than we actually paid for, so we weren't complaining. We only found out when another couple opened our door while we were inside. After confused apologies on both sides, the other couple backed out, and moments later we got an apologetic call from the front desk; they simply asked to confirm our last name so that their records would be correct. It meant that our room had more space for the four of us to gather to relax for a bit before dinner, etc. At all times we found all staff (front desk, restaurant servers, bartender, concierge) very friendly but professional. The rooms were very clean, and the turndown service was a welcome touch. We had no problems with wifi or street noise, as some others have mentioned. The location was excellent, as it was on the southern end of the Temple Bar area and a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, O'Connell Street and stops for the Hop On Hop Off bus. Breakfast was delicious and ample (with cold buffet and choice of hot cooked), and both the men tried and liked the oatmeal with a dash of Jameson's.",5,2014,05,26
236,Location Location,We stayed here for 4 nights. The location is close to the downtown area and there are lots of restaurants and places to visit. Our room on the fifth floor was clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was good and the price at 10 E was fair. The only negative for me was the wifi which lacked bandwidth and was slow when you had to get to more advanced sites.,4,2014,05,24
236,Very Nice,"We just stayed there 3 nights and it was very good.  The service by front desk and housekeeping excellent.  But the real gem is the concierge Conner who meets you as you check in and makes you sit down with him to go over your plans for your stay in Dublin.  He gives wonderful advice and also suggestions on restaurants, and even goes ahead to make reservations for you.  He is absolutely great and passionate about his job and making your stay special.  The rooms are good size and bathrooms fine. Beds were great also.  We stayed on 5th floor in rooms 510 and 512.  They had breakfast in morning which was very good at E 10.00 per person.  There is a restaurant there but we did not eat dinner there.  There also is a very nice lounge in basement which we did use one late afternoon to drink our bottle of wine in and have some cheese that we bought at a nearby store.  Very good location to restaurants such as Hairy Lemon and Darwins. 
Hop On and Hop Off is close also and this is great way to see city.  WiFi worked fine also.",4,2014,05,23
236,Great Location,"Spent our first three days on a recent trip to Ireland at the Brooks Hotel. From our first greeting by Connor to the end of our stay it was wonderful. The rooms were clean and very well appointed. Breakfast each morning was excellent and served by a very attentive staff. The location is centrally located - great for seeing the sites, shopping and dining. Thanks to all the staff at the Brooks and especially Connor for a great start to our vacation!",5,2014,05,22
236,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks for 5 nights altogether, bookended on to our 2 week tour of Ireland.  We found the Brooks Hotel a great place to stay. It is centrally located but on a relatively quiet side street. The staff is very nice, helpful and professional.  Whether it was staff at the front desk, the restaurant or taking care of our room, they were always a pleasure to deal with.  We stayed in two different rooms, one on the 6th floor and one on the 3rd.  Both rooms were clean,  pleasantly decorated and of a decent size. We preferred our 6th floor room only because it was a bit quieter, the view was of Dublin rooftops and we found the bird life we could see from there entertaining.  The breakfast offered with the our stay was exceptional. We highly recommend the Brooks Hotel.",5,2014,05,20
236,Super located hotel,"My wife and i had this Hotel Booked for us by family during a recent trip to Dublin.WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! It's in a great location,the room was spotless with lovely character about it and the staff and i mean ALL of them were so friendly and couldn't do enough for you.We also dined in the hotel on the Saturday night from the set menu and although the choice was rather limited the Quality of the food could not be faltered.One point about the Breakfast,the Whiskey porridge is a must to try!! Overall my Review of this hotel is that it was EXCELLENT.We will be returning!!",5,2014,05,20
236,Best Location,"Perfect location to enjoy all the sites of Dublin.  Grafton Street, Trinity College are around the corner and Temple Bar area is just 2 blocks south.  Located on a quiet street with pubs all around.  The staff was efficient and helpful.  They offered a 10 Euro full breakfast which was a huge bargain and it was delicious.  I would definitely stay here again when I return to Dublin",5,2014,05,18
236,Friendly Hotel in the Centre of a Major City,"We only spent one night in the Brooks prior to leaving Ireland. The hotel is clean, well decorated and comfortable. Despite being in the centre of Dublin, we had a good nights sleep. We were treated well on check in. We were there before check in time and they checked our bags and the bell staff recommended a local pub for lunch that was fantastic. We had a problem with the TV and they immediately sent someone up to take care of it. We needed some extra help sending a package by mail and they made it simple and handled it immediately as well.

The best part of the stay was the whiskey tasting. They offer a tasting of several Irish whiskeys if you book in advance. It was informative and the whiskey was delicious. I recommend it strongly.

We booked the breakfast with our stay and it was tasty, and the servers were efficient and friendly. I will point out that it wasn't as good as the bed and breakfasts we had stayed at but that is only saying the breakfast was great as opposed to excellent.

If you want a quiet room in downtown Dublin with service that feels like a smaller hotel in a smaller city, this is your choice.",4,2014,05,18
236,Excellent location lovely residents lounge,"Another stay here and again just what a Dublin hotel should be -accommodating, friendly and comfortable. Room was not great upon arrival as it overlooked air con fans which were a bit noisy and I thought this might be a problem later at night.  asked for a change and was moved right away which I did not expect as I booked last minute Friday! The staff are pleasant throughout this hotel. The gem is the residents parlour such a pleasure to sit in olde worlde with a home from home feel could not call this an ordinary residents lounge -  games,  books, interesting items everywhere even a selection of reading glasses such a lovely touch will look forward to another wee! Trip.",4,2014,05,16
236,"Wonderful staff, great location","There are a few things I look for in a hotel:

- Location: check! This hotel is very centrally located, an easy walk to Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, and the Temple Bar area. On a side street, though, so fairly quiet. No complaints!

- Clean/comfortable: check! Our room was quite clean and the beds were very comfortable. There was ample space for two suitcases. The bathroom was clean. No complaints!

- Friendly staff: check and CHECK! Everyone was quite helpful and friendly. Conor, the head concierge, really stands out in terms of helpfulness. When he found out we were having issues with our rental car reservation (having been told we could have a GPS unit and then being told we couldn't), he personally called the car rental company and somehow worked some magic to get a guy at the car place to hide a GPS unit for us. It really made the rest of our trip so much better/less stressful and we have Conor to thank!

So really, this hotel lived up to all my expectations and more. Would definitely stay here again!!",5,2014,05,15
236,Good Hotel In Best Location,"A great hotel in a good central position with helpfull staff. Best is the concierge, very friendly and ready to help quickly with everything. Rooms are good, the classic rooms not so big but ok. The breakfast buffet offered everything you need in a nice atmosphere.

I will come back.",4,2014,05,13
236,Fantastic in all resepcts,"Just got back from a long weekend.  What a brilliant hotel.  I travel on business throughout Europe and how I wish all hotels were as good as the Brooks.  From the minute you arrive the staff are genuinely caring and attentive.  Connor the Consiege was brilliant with is tips and advice.
The rooms are decorated in a high class traditional style.  The bed and bedding was as good as any in the World and the guest lounge downstairs was somewhere we could have spent hours if there wasn't so much to see and do in town. 
The hotel is perfectly placed to be quiet but at the same time be a pleasant stroll from the shopping and the bars.
The full breakfast is to die for and even the hungriest of guests wont go hungry.  The quality of the food, as with everything in the Brooks is just that bit better to make it special.   
We got the air coach from the airport (every 15 mins and great value for money and other than Temple Bar for the crack we visited Guinness, the gaol, the little museum of Dublin, the parks and Graften Street.  All were excellent and thoroughly recommended.
If you want a Hotel and a City that's impersonal and unfriendly then give Dublin a miss.  Its the happiest, friendliest, warmest and down right fun city in the World.....and the Brooks Hotel is the perfect base.  Many thanks to Connor and the whole team at the Brooks.  We will be back
Carl and Louise Brown",5,2014,05,13
236,Wonderful hotel!,Really enjoyed this hotel. Very good pleasant service from all  hotel personnel. Breakfast offerings varied and very tasty. No complaints whatsoever. Would most definitely stay here again and would highly recommend hotel to friends.,5,2014,05,10
236,Great visit,"My husband and I just spent two nights in the Brooks Hotel. We had a great stay, with absolutely no problems or complaints at all. We were both especially impressed with the varied breakfast offerings and all the service offered by the front desk. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. There is shopping nearby in the Grafton Street area. Trinity College with the Book of Kells is also nearby. Of course, there are a lot of great pubs in the area. The Temple Bar area is within 5 minutes walking. I would and will stay there again. Good value in a great hotel.",5,2014,05,07
236,Terrific hotel,"We were recommended to stay at Brooks Hotel from Irish friends and we followed their tip. They were so right, a great hotel in the middle of the busy Dublin. We actually stayed in the hotel twice during a week, returning to the hotel from a trip to the countryside. Actually I do not have any complaints at all. The rooms were excellent, the service teriffic, the bar was calm and cosy and the breakfast was top-notch. All in all, very good value for money  We will return to Brooks Hotel the next time we come to Dublin.",5,2014,05,06
236,Excellent central hotel,"If you want a hotel really central in the middle of all the shops and about a 4 minute walk to temple bar then this is it.  Great service at breakfast.  Couldn't do enough for us.  Bars, restaurants and shops all around the hotel. Loads of little restaurants and bars with people sat out.  Paper shop round the corner.  Rooms really nice with hairdryer and shampoos, conditioner etc.  Breakfast lovely.  Was going to book the Morgan hotel which is slap bang in the middle of temple bar facing Oliver St Johns and next door to Hard Rock and TGI's but glad we booked this hotel as I suspect it could be pretty noisy in the Morgan.  Was going to book a 5star then thought it silly as we only get changed there, sleep there then go out for the day but it was fab.  Would highly recommend and stay again when back in Dublin.",5,2014,05,06
236,Unexpected Treasure,I went to Dublin to attend a conference and was originally disappointed to discover that the conference hotel was completely booked. A friend recommended the Brooks Hotel and I am glad they did. The rooms are great and the service amazing. Add that to a terrific location in City Centre and you have a hotel that is now on my list of favorites.,5,2014,05,01
236,home from home,We visit Dublin for a few days at least twice a year and have been doing this for about ten years. The welcome is so great it really is just like visiting friends. Everything about he hotel is first class - even down to the provision of expensive toiletries!  We never consider staying anywhere else and if the hotel is not available we just change our plans - A great hotel in a good location with a real Irish welcome!,5,2014,05,01
236,Fantastic stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for our Honeymoon in October 2013. The entire staff was wonderful and extremely helpful in getting us around the city. When they found out it was our honeymoon they made a heart out of rose petals on our bed. Breakfasts there were delicious.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone and we would stay again when we go back to Dublin.",5,2014,04,30
236,Boutique Hotel in Center of town!,Although a little pricey the location was great to walk to city center and temple bar area....5-10 minute walk to all sites including Dublinia and Christ Church...many pubs and restaurants close by...the breakfast in the mornings was very good...the rooms were comfortable,4,2014,04,26
236,"Friendly place, good location","This hotel has a good location and is relatively clean.  Conor, the concierge is very friendly along with the rest of the staff.  The first night we stayed, we had a quiet room.  A week later, we stayed again and had a noisy room (room 111) which overlooked the back door to a restaurant and heard their workers late into the Saturday night.  The hot water kettle in that room was also rusty and dirty and I felt grossed out and that I needed to wash all the glasses we used for drinking because of it.  Not a good feeling.",3,2014,04,23
236,Lovely hotel ,"Just stayed here on Easter Saturday what a great hotel . No complaints whatsoever, lovely clean rooms , huge comfy bed. The reception staff were brilliant and helpful and the breakfast was delicious . Location on the nicer side of town in my opinion with plenty places to eat and drink nearby .. Shop around on the internet for prices I got a great deal with breakfast included .. So got a fab 4star  hotel at a very reasonable price ..( more money to spend on shoes ) . ",5,2014,04,21
236,"Great service, location and very friendly and efficient staff.","The views are not scenic, but it's location is very convenient for Dublin fun.  If you want scenic you must go to the country. The staff is efficient and friendly.  They all go above and beyond to make sure your stay is fabulous. The Brooks Hotel has plenty of old world charm but still has the modern conveniences we all love and it was spotless.  We only had breakfast there, but it was top notch.  The Brooks Hotel is simply amazing.",5,2014,04,21
236,Comfy hotel in the heart of it all,"I booked this hotel primarily due to its location, right in the centre of Dublin,  While the views from the bedroom weren't wonderful (don't expect seascapes or rolling hills!!!) everything else was wonderful.  Helpful, friendly staff, brilliant breakfast at a great rate and a very relaxing atmosphere, I will definitely be returning for a longer break when I can!",4,2014,04,15
236,We stayed here for one night before leaving Ireland,"We chose this hotel because of reviews on Tripadvisor. We arrived after 7pm on Sunday night. We had read that parking was available across the road from the hotel and this was a consideration for us in choosing this particular Dublin hotel. When we arrived at reception they informed us that the parking station across the road closed at 7pm on Sundays so we couldn't park there. They gave us directions to a parking station about two blocks away. Staff helped us unload our bags from the car before we drove to the parking. It was not particularly easy to find driving or when walking back to the hotel. It also felt a bit tedious after a long day of driving from Waterford to Dublin we just wanted to check into our hotel and relax before our flight the next day.

The hotel was nicely appointed. The standard rooms were comfortable and well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The breakfast was of a good standard. It is also situated close to all the main attractions and had we been able to park close to the hotel would have been a perfect stay for us.",4,2014,04,11
236,Fabulous,This hotel is really tops!! It has an awesome location.  It is spotless. The breakfast was fabulous with lots to choose from.  We also had dinner there and everything was delicious.  The staff is superb.,5,2014,04,10
236,Perfect stay for a Dublin city break,"I loved my stay in Brooks Hotel. First of all it is very central. If it is your first visit in Dublin, it is the perfect place for you: you won’t need public transport. It is located in a nice street with lovely shops and restaurants. You’ll be in Grafton street in no time.
The staff was very friendly. The room (614) was faultless. On the first night the turn down service left a home made biscuit in the room which was absolutely delicious.
The products in the bathroom come from the White Company.
The breakfast is vey nice. You have a great choice with the traditional Irish breakfast and the buffet. The bar at lobby level has a great selection of Irish whiskeys as well as world whiskys.
I will definitely come back on my next stay in the fair city.",5,2014,04,08
236,"Location, Location, Location","This is a great base to explore all of Dublin.  You are walking distance to all the major attractions:  Temple Bar, The Guinness Storehouse and Grafton Street.  This hotel has a chic and modern appearance with a great friendly staff.  The restaurant serves great food and the bar has an extensive whiskey menu.  Could not have asked for a better location within Dublin!",5,2014,04,07
236,Wonderful stay!!!,"Very attentive front desk staff.  The concierge Conner was an absolute joy, very helpful with suggestions & memorized our names from the beginning of our stay.  Excellent location with all the Dublin sights within walking distance.  Good breakfast.  Nice rooms.",5,2014,04,06
236,Good solid business  hotel.,"This is mostly a business hotel  with good  facilities and a great location.
Room was nicely furnished but not exceptional, breakfast was excellent and the staff helpful.
I thought it was expensive and I would only go back if I got a good offer.
Great place to stay if you are new to Dublin as it is so central.",4,2014,04,06
236,Perfect location and very comfortable,"I spent a LOT of time looking at places to stay in Dublin, B&B versus Hotel etc, using Tripadvisor. Brooks is a great choice because it is a small boutique hotel that feels personable, quaint offers breakfast for most choices. And, the location is outstanding: near most of the greats sites, restaurants, pubs and shopping. I am a bit nervous selecting a place to stay in a new city but this was an excellent choice.",5,2014,04,05
236,Wonderful Stay! Great location!,"We recently stayed over St. Patrick's Day weekend and were very pleased with our stay. We booked through the www.slh.com website which is worth checking out for good discounts. We arrived on the red eye early from Boston and were pleasantly surprised to learn our room was ready. The staff was greatly accomodating and if your room is not ready there is a sitting area in the basement to relax. The location is phenominal on a quiet street but close enough to walk to all the major attractions/bars/shopping. The hallways seem small and narrow but the rooms were a very good size with a nice bathroom. The breakfast was delicious as well as the lunch menu. We did not eat there for dinner but breakfast and lunch were great. We did not park there as we did not rent a car in Dublin, it really isn't necessary. 
I would highly recommend! Connor was of great assistance in the concierge, you can truly tell when someone loves their job and Connor certainly did and it showed.
If we ever return to Dublin the Brooks will be a must!",5,2014,03,31
236,Great hotel but with one drawback.,"Booked a one night stay for myself and my husband.  We stayed on a Saturday night in a deluxe room with Breakfast.  The hotel site gave quite good instructions to find it as it is a city centre hotel.  We arrived to a very warm welcome and the hotel had an immediate feel of comfort and very tastefully decorated.  Our room was lovely again very warm and welcoming and very clean.  However our stay did have one drawback and I review this not so much as a complaint but more to make people aware before they go and book.  The hotel itself has no parking facilities but according to the website there is multi storey carpark directly opposite hotel in which guests can park - the hotel states that they have negotiated rates for hotel guests.  We arrived approx 3pm to a sign on front of carpark saying it was full.  I rang the hotel to explain this and they informed me that there were other carparks nearby.  Ok if you only have a wheely bag (or if its not lashing rain).  After driving round the one way system deciding what to do we opted to go into the carpark and wait to see if a car would leave, we got a space about 20 mins later, a bit annoying but heyho we are not on a clock.  However the most annoying part was finding out when entering the hotel that there is actually no negotiated rate and the fact that we parked the car in there before 5.30pm  we were charged the weekend rate even though we were only staying one night. It cost 15.00 euros which I have to admit made me mad paying that on top of 229.00 for the hotel.  Also be aware if you do stay Saturday night and park in there the carpark does,nt open until 11.00am so if you needed to leave early youre snookered.  Still had a lovely night in this hotel it really is lovely but could have done without the extra expense for parking.",4,2014,03,30
236,Great Dublin Location,"We enjoyed this hotel mostly because of its location. It is close to Trinity College, scores of pubs, nice shops, and cafes and restaurants.

The room windows open so you can easily get fresh air, there is a safe in the room, and ample closet space.

The staff was efficient, friendly, and always available to assist us. We eschewed the hotel breakfast because of the price. There are many coffee/breakfast choices available near the hotel. 

Just down the street there is a great ""slow"" food place called Blazing Salads that has excellent organic salads, main dishes, and desserts; they serve coffee and tea, too. The Thomas Brown department store is close, as is a great pen store. Trinity Bar area is nearby too.

I'd stay at the Brooks again.",4,2014,03,29
236,Comfortable hotel,"Was delighted with our stay in this hotel. My wife and I stayed on a Saturday night and could not fault it. The rooms are very comfortable and the decor is nice. The bed is very comforatble and they have a pillow menu if you like the option. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean.

The bar for pre-dinner drinks though is a wonderful location providing a relaxing comfortable experience. The piano playing in the foyet is just superb and the seating is wonderful.

The location is excellent for exploring the plush Grafton street area, but the experience of this hotel is wonderful",5,2014,03,24
236,A nice stay,"Good reception greeting on arrival with a free upgrade. The room was huge and really comfy beds, loved the pillow menu but didnt use it as mine were fine.
Bottle water in the room was useful and so was the trouser press but no iron. Breakfast was a bit hit and miss, it took ages for the waitress to come over so I had to go adn find her after 10 minutes to get a coffee and order my full irish, the poached eggs were over done but it was all nice and loved the banana bread and irish scones.
great location for central Dublin",4,2014,03,21
236,Only place to stay in Dublin,"Connor the Doorman welcomes you and becomes your personal guide.  We stayed here last year, and have stayed at other hotels in Dublin.  We will not stay anywhere else when we go back!  Rooms are adorable, they give you a pillow selection form to fill out, turn down service includes chocolate and the location cannot be beat.  Centrally located, short walk in any direction takes you to anywhere you want to go.  The breakfast is decent, many choices and pastry buffet is ample.  We took advantage of a whiskey tasting at the bar, and it was wonderful.  We have tried many Irish whiskeys, but were introduced to a few that we had never heard of. The whiskey sommelier, whose name I cannot remember, was very informative and humourous.  We love this place....and the Hairy Lemon is just a few steps from the front door!",5,2014,03,21
236,Lovely hotel in a great location,"I think this is a perfectly lovely hotel.  The check in was efficient and friendly and the clerk and the concierge (Marvin) were both incredibly helpful.  The location is really convenient for Temple Bar and the area is very pleasant with shops and restaurants of all types in the vicinity.  

My room was very attractive with a large bed and comfortable chairs.  The standard of cleanliness was excellent and the bathroom had a large and powerful shower and White Company toiletries which smelt really nice.  The only thing I'd have liked but didn't have would be a more powerful hairdryer.   I slept really well and there was very little noise or disturbance.  I liked the man coming around in the evening with chocolate to check everything is alright.  I thought that was a lovely touch. 

The breakfast was good, plentiful and with one of the best fresh cooked breakfasts I've had in a while.  I love it when everything is done to order. 

I think I would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Dublin.",5,2014,03,20
236,Return trip matched the first visit,"Just spent two weekend nights here after previously staying here 7 years earlier.  Nothing has changed.  Still great service - efficient, friendly checkin (bags held until rooms ready as we arrived early), concierge made pointed effort to learn all our names; comfortable rooms.  The location is why I originally stayed at the Brooks and why I returned.  It's extremely central to everything but on a quiet side street that made for no late night disturbances.  My first visit we used the hop on/hop off bus to get around.  This trip we took cabs part of the first day but quickly realized we could walk to most places we wanted to visit.  It gave us a much better feel of Dublin.  We would not hesitate to return or recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2014,03,17
236,Great Location and friendly staff,"Great location and rather easy to find. The hotel staff is great, many of them remembered our name (we were only there 3 nights). Worth the price if you are looking in this range.  Rooms were a bit same, but clean.",4,2014,03,14
236,Wonderful Staff,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel this month for 2 nights.  We booked the hotel because of its location, it is right beside a Bikram Yoga Studio and in a great area of Dublin.  Check in was very efficient and friendly and although we stayed during a very busy period in Dublin I never saw a queue at reception.  We had booked a deluxe king room and we were allocated room 215.  This is near the back of the hotel and away from the lift which suited us perfectly but would not suit anyone who wanted a view. 

The room was nicely decorated and I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom had a separate shower and bath.  There were plenty of towels and toiletries and they also provided extra towels when we needed very quickly.  There was one bathrobe in the room upon arrival and when I requested a further robe it was also brought to the room quickly.  The bed was excellent and we both slept very soundly, they have a pillow menu so a good nights sleep is obviously something they are keen to promote.  A turndown service is provided and they leave a small chocolate on your pillow.  Storage space was good and the room has a iron and ironing board.

Two small bottles of mineral water were supplied daily.  A great feature was the fact that the mini-bar is empty upon your arrival and you have the choice to have it stocked or you can leave it empty for your own use.  Although the fridge is small it did mean that we could keep any drinks that we bought cool.  There was a kettle and selection of tea and coffee.

The room had a flat screen TV but the signal quality was not great and some channels were not available.  A digital radio was in the room but we never used and a DVD player was also available which we never used.  You can rent DVDs from a local rental store and they will deliver to your room.  The hairdryer was not great and my wife would recommend any female visitors to bring their own hairdryer.  There were 2 plug sockets near the mirror and the room also had a European and USA plug socket which I thought was a great idea.

We had booked a room only rate but decided to have breakfast in the hotel and they only charged ten euro per person which I thought was great.  Breakfast was excellent and I recommend that if you have a room only deal that you ask reception if they can offer you a discount on the normal breakfast rate.  We also had dinner in the restaurant and this was very good and although the dining room was quiet this suited us perfectly.

The best thing about the hotel, however, is the staff.  They are extremely friendly and helpful.  Everyone says hello as you are going past and the staff even take the time to stop and have a chat to ask how your day is going.  If I was rating the hotel just on the facilities I would be giving it a 4 out of 5 but the staff make this a 5.  I have already booked for another trip at the end of May. Well done Brooks!",5,2014,03,12
236,Excellent Hotel,"Great location , ( with parking across the street ) , super friendly staff , rooms very comfortable .. best value Dublin city center hotel I have visited for some time, highly recommended .walking distance to a great variety of bars , restaurants , shops ...",5,2014,03,10
236,Rooms are amazing :) we will be back,"Stayed here the weekend of the 22nd feb! Arrived early & our room was ready. We were upgraded to a deluxe room (303) it was amazing, so nicely decorated and it was the little extras that made it - pillow menu, water, bathrobes & the old style radio playing! We were very impressed... Breakfast ran until 11.30 and we enjoyed it! We were only there one night and our plans were to head out with friends so we didn't get to experience the room or bar enough. Thank you to Lesley for booking the room you were great! We will definitely be returning for more than one night next time. 

Diane :)",5,2014,03,07
236,Great nights sleep.,"The city centre location is just perfect here. Although it's never going to be peace and quiet outside, the hotel operation itself is so well organised that you can't fail to find it relaxing. Check in was really friendly, informative and efficient. Room was spotlessly clean and quite modern with good wifi. When I requested feather free pillows etc  within minutes housekeeping had attended to this. I didn't have to rise early so left the do not disturb on the door, slept until 11.15 am without any disturbance. I'll definitely be returning here in the future.",5,2014,03,06
236,"Great hotel, will definitely stay again when next in Dublin","Central location. Good bars and restaurants close by. Staff were courteous, rooms were comfortable (mind you the bathroom in my room could have used some modernisation but wasn't a problem for me) and the selection at breakfast was unbelievable.  Best hotel breakfast I've ever had. Top tip: get the porridge. Yum.",5,2014,03,01
236,Perfect location for exploring Dublin,"Enjoyed 1 night stay at Brooks hotel Dublin during a brief business trip to Ireland. The hotel is located in the heart of the back streets of the city, with parking via a third party carpark right next door. You're in easy walking distance to many restaurants, pubs and shops.

The check in in process was easy, with friendly staff (all the staff encountered during the stay were extremely courteous), and we were off to our rooms.

Upon entering the room, the first thing which struck me was the music from the Roberts retro analogue radio, with all the hiss and distortion, a really nice touch (if you’re into your audio equipment!).

The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and had a warm powerful shower. If you’re particularly picky on your pillow choice there is a pillow menu to choose various fillings.

Breakfast the following morning was the perfect start to the day, with a range of cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, juices, and a vast selection of cooked options. I opted for the full Irish, and wasn’t disappointed.

This isn’t a low cost stay, but the location, quality of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff make it worthwhile, and would make an ideal weekend break hotel if you’re off to enjoy Dublin.",4,2014,02,19
236,"Brother's 50th & 60th Birthday at Brooks, Dublin!","Just returned from an amazing long weekend in Dublin. Enjoyed the sights, atmosphere, & variety Dublin has to offer, celebrating my husbands & Brother in Laws special birthdays. What a great location, Brooks is central & within walking distance to most attractions. Our deluxe rooms were everything & more, extra large beds & lovely pillows, clean, fresh  & equipped with everything you need while away from home. Brooks staff were friendly, polite, helpful & we will  not hesitate to stay at Brooks when we return to Dublin! Great memories!",4,2014,02,18
236,The marmalade,"In October 2013 I visited Ireland for the first time.  Dublin is a wonderful city. The proximity of Brooks Hotel to the city centre means that many places of interest, including St. Teresa's Carmelite Church in Clarendon Street (very close) and The Dublin Writers Museum in Parnell Square (a bit further), are within walking distance. The staff at Brooks Hotel are polite and efficent and the rooms are well maintained.  At breakfast try the marmalade which is made in the hotel kitchen.  It is delicious.

236,Great hotel,I like the location of this hotel but not much of a view from the rooms. Really nicely furnished rooms and a real cosy feel to the hotel in general. No hotel parking which adds to the cost but don't let that put you off.,5,2014,02,14
236,2 night stay,"Just back from a weekend break in Dublin and stayed for 2 nights in Brooks. I come from a customer focused line of work stay in hotels regularly and was very impressed with the staff here. The location, hotel itself and food are all excellent but genuinely I couldn't get over the level of service from the staff. They are quite simply excellent. Keep it up ill defiantly be back.   Mick H",5,2014,02,11
236,Perfect hotel,"Spent 3 nights here last weekend.  Very friendly welcome from a helpful receptionist, nice quiet room (liked pillow choice and worth asking for a room at the quieter back of the hotel), excellent cooked breakfast and great location.  The price for the room and drinks in the hotel were very fair, given the proximity of the hotel to Grafton Street (for shopping) and Temple Bar (for drinking).
All in all, highly recommended.",5,2014,02,10
236,Rugby Weekend,"We have just returned from a great weekend in Dublin.  I emailed to ask if we could check in early but didn't quite believe it when our room was ready at 9:30am! We had a deluxe room which was lovely.  Big room and the bathroom was gorgeous.

Location is perfect!  

After a long day we decided to order breakfast in our room.  At 3 Euros extra it was a bargain!  It was delicious.  Also, as check out wasn't until noon we could really relax and recover before heading out!

We'll be back for next year's 6 Nations and will be staying for two nights as it was so good!

I didn't notice until the next morning that you could have a foot spa brought up to your room!  I'll definitely be doing that next year.",5,2014,02,10
236,Central but not lacking in quality,"We stayed while attending a business function, the rooms are very pleasant with a pillow menu to choose from
Breakfast was very tasty,
The bar does lack atmosphere 
But loved it otherwise. Very close to shopping and cool bars",5,2014,02,08
236,Solid but Not Remarkable Choice,"After a few hotels across the river, the Brooks Hotelwas a safe, solid, respectable choice. Very helppful reception and delightful breakfast. But room was a very small in the corner, TV didn't work and it had these strange bedside tables & lamps that were so large I couldn't move in the room - literally. Couldn't get in the closet. But the bathroom was sizeable with lovely big tub - in fact, I think the bathroom was equipped for the handicapped, though a wheelchair couldn not have fit through room door. So hotel decor soothing, nice reception, great location for walkers but odd room. Gym needs to be updated and so does business center for today's travelers.",3,2014,02,05
236,Great location,Stayed here in mid January 2014. Very central location. Had lunch one afternoon- very nice food. Polite friendly staff. Didn't get to try the restaurant. Quiet and peaceful (stayed during mid-week). Room was clean and quiet. Complimentary bottled water and fruit basket was a nice touch.,4,2014,02,03
236,Excellent hotel!,"I loved the decoration of the rooms and public areas, modern, stylish but very comfortable and warm. I loved the great bed and comfy pillows and good nights sleep in a quiet room. I loved the perfumed air fresheners on all the corridoors creating a lovely ambience. I loved the restaurant and the amazing food from a talented chef. I loved the evening atmosphere in the bar with its eclectic mix of people. I loved the friendly staff and the very available and attentive manager. In fact I loved everything about this hotel!",5,2014,01,28
236,Superb!,What a fab bolt hole in the middle of the city. So central & yet quiet. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Really comfortable bed. This will be the first hotel we check out when returning to Dublin.,5,2014,01,26
236,Perfect location,"Stayed for four nights. Perfect location to experience all the pubs, restaurants, and attractions. We used it as a home base. 
We had a room on the second floor overlooking the street and we enjoyed having the windows open and people watching. Some of the revelers can get loud so if you are light sleepers you may want to avoid street side.
The room was very spacious, clean and equipped with everything you would need away from home.The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.
We enjoyed the restaurant and especially the breakfasts.
We took a transfer from the airport and were let off several blocks from the hotel. We got turned around several times but people took pity on us dragging our luggage and kindly pointed us in the right direction. The hotel's sign was not very visible from the street.",4,2014,01,22
236,Noisy but nice ,"I stayed for a single night, as the Radisson down the road was full with a conference. I booked a deluxe room which included breakfast.

The hotel is very well positioned in a super-central location and it would be ideal for a weekend stay where I didn't have to get up to go to work instead. I was more interested in a good nights sleep which was harder to deliver on....

My first room was bang next to the very noisy lift, and on asking I was immediately moved to another room further away. Unfortunately the heating systems are old and I was still woken every 30 minutes as the thermostat kicked in (it was like a dull whistle going off) or the kitchen hands from the back of the restaurants outside my window gathered for a cigarette break throughout the night. Not much sound-proofing either.

Breakfast was excellent though and the service spot on. It was just a shame about the noise as after all a hotel has to work for sleeping...",3,2014,01,22
236,Clean & great location,"I stayed at Brooks for 2 nights for business. The Hotel is perfectly located at walk disctance to Grafton streets and the surrounding area is full of pubs and restaurants. 
The hotel is clean and rooms are pretty big and cosy. I had a standard room with a king size bed and a ok bathroom with bath/shower. 
Staff was kind in giving me hints and being ready in booking my taxis. 
Breakfast was included in the price and had different choice of food.",4,2014,01,20
236,Good hotel in a great central location,"The hotel is very well located and I felt safe by walking by myself around. The staff is professional and helpful. My room was good, clean and had a kettle for tea or coffee which is a detail I appreciate in hotels.
Breakfast is good. You have a good choice and you can order warm dishes with the waiter as well. When checking out, my bill was missing the breakfast, I told the receptionist who said that it was all right and didn't need to pay for it!",4,2014,01,18
236,Great Hotel in Great City,"This is a great hotel right in the heart of Dublin City. Ideally located for Temple Bar and Grafton Street. We had a lovely time. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are well furnished and equipped. Best of all they are exceptionally clean and the housekeeping staff do a great job.
We had a free upgrade on arrival. Bottled water and tea, coffee etc is re stocked every day.
The restaurant is priced the same as any local establishment. The food was good, the breakfast, both continental and full Irish was really nice.
The concierge is a really nice gentleman who took time to chat and remember our names.
We were there for 4 days and will be returning later this year. You can't see that much of Dublin in 4 days but we visited the Zoo, Kilmainham Gaol and numerous bars. Would recommend the Green hop on hop off tour bus. You get the second day free. 
Temple Bar itself was great. Lovely atmosphere, both day and night. Lots of different nationalities all enjoying themselves. Live music in most traditional bars.",5,2014,01,15
236,Possibly my all time favourite,"I must first of all say that I have purposefully returned to Dublin and insisted on staying at the Brooks hotel again. It was 10 years ago, so ignore my review date. I just saw some of the photos and i must say, the more I travel, the more I believe it was the best place I have stayed. Perhaps it is because I loved Dublin, but this is such a homely place with a wonderful atmosphere and lovely furnishings around the foyer and lounges. From here I explored Trinity College, St Stephens's Green, the river and so many cute shops and pubs starting with the alley/lane right near the hotel. We never has social media then, but it seems they are as excellent as ever. I would certainly love to revisit this place with my family. Oh yes - the dining room downstairs is lovely and very traditional - great food. Rooms are a little small, but that's the UK for you, especially on business travel. Check the pictures.",5,2014,01,14
236,great time,"we had a very nice post christmas time at this hotel, very well made cocktails (albeit expensive), first class food from the bar in a warm relaxed surrounding, a very well ran hotel. rooms a very plush although a bit on the small side. breakfast is excellent. will definitly return",5,2014,01,09
236,Classy hotel with a great location,"The staff here makes the stay memorable. The rooms a very clean and modern. The hotel does have a snug feel, but the lobby and bar are spacious. The breakfasts are excellent as well. Try the scones and homemade bread. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to Dublin.",5,2014,01,08
236,"Excellent choice, not just for its central location either.","Truly pleased we picked this hotel, i knew we would be happy for its location but it was its own style that made it more special. Being a boutique hotel we were not disappointed with our rooms either, it was spacious and comfortable. Liked the little extras in the room for added comfort if required it, like the pillow menu ( for a better sleep if you have a pillow preference). We even had some cookies waiting on the table for our arrival. 
Breakfast was great with both hot or cold food to decide from and the staff were very attentive in making sure you had everything you wanted for breakfast.

The hotel is literally 2 minutes away from Temple bar area and Trinity Collage, which is why we booked the hotel and there are plenty of shops around the hotel as well. Really could not pick a fault with the hotel and would happily recommend or return should I re-vist Dublin in the future.",4,2014,01,06
236,Snug,"Beautiful clean and very cheerful lobby/reception, i reckon the christmas tree added to the nostalgic feeling.  The room we were in was quite small but very comfortable and clean.  we were on the 6th floor and the view although near the centre of town was lovely, roof tops adorned with sparking lights.  the room was very quiet and the bathroom was spacious considering the room size.  the staff were very helpful and friendly.",4,2014,01,06
236,Convenient for shopping...,"Check-in was efficient and speedy, even if it did appear that it was the doorman who was checking us in. 
We arrived at around 11pm, and had to park at Stephens Green Parking, which is perhaps a 10minute walk to the hotel with luggage. 
The room was pleasant, though the décor seems a little dark. It's a city centre hotel, so I can cope with the view of the car park opposite. 
We weren't disturbed by any noise from the revellers on the street below nor from within the hotel. 
Breakfast was perfectly nice. 
Check-out was speedy. 
The hotel was fine. It would have been nice I guess if the reception staff had asked if I needed any assistance with luggage but it felt like once I had handed over that keycard, that was that. 

The Positives: Location for the city centre
                       Clean and pleasant rooms
                        Enjoyable breakfast and pleasant waiting staff

The Negatives: Parking (though I realise there is a car park on the same street but it's not open 24hours and the rates are higher)
                         The day reception staff could have appeared to be a little more interested. There wasn't any query regarding our stay. Perhaps the assumption is that if we don't complain, all is well? Maybe I'm being too fussy? 

Would I stay here again? I wouldn't not stay here again, but I'd prefer the Radisson.",3,2014,01,04
236,The perfect example of great customer service,"I can honestly say that we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Myself & a friend stayed here on New Year's Eve. We arrived early & the staff made us feel welcome by looking after our bags, getting us signed in & offering us complimentary tea & coffee after our early flight. 

The concierge ""Connor"" was very helpful, shook our hands and remembered our names throughout our stay, gave us information, maps & directions when needed, even called us in the room to give us further information. The breakfast team were very efficient, always asking if we'd like tea, coffee toast etc & remembered us from the morning before. The young lady on the bar was friendly as we're the reception team. We even had a knock on the door in the evening to check that everything was ok with the room. 

The hotel is ideally located, you can walk to Grafton st, Temple bar, O Connell St etc. 

Breakfast was lovely. Freshly cooked hot options as well as a huge choice of continental options and endless supply of fresh toast &  hot drinks. The flapjacks were a favourite of ours. 

We ordered room service in the evening, the club sandwich was huge. Sunshine pasta had a lot of garlic yet very light & tasty. We also had a sandwich later that evening from the 24 hour room service menu, the service was very quick. I would say the prosecco was over priced at 52 euros & a large bottle of sparkling water was 7 euros, however maybe that's what we should expect for a city centre hotel. 

We found a lovely Thai restaurant just around the corner called Saba, nice freshly cooked food & reasonably priced. We went back twice & would recommend.  

Overall I would say the service at this hotel was great and made our stay. Thank you Brooks hotel. ",5,2014,01,03
236,"Great hospitality, too notch food, superb location","We stayed here on New Year's Eve. The hotel was very busy, to be expected, but nonetheless, we arrived to a warm, relaxed and friendly welcome! It also came up that I was celebrating my birthday and later on in the afternoon, two gorgeous cupcakes were left into the room for us! We had a bite to eat for lunch - pasta and a goats cheese sandwich. The hotel is a member of good food Ireland and the food was delicious and of very high quality. Breakfast the next morning also had ample choice and was very tasty. The location is with minutes walk of Grafton street, Stephen's Green etc. so there is an abundance of lovely bars and restaurants and sightseeing opportunities in the area. It is a perfect choice for a city break and I look forward to returning!",5,2014,01,02
236,"Good, not great.","Stayed with my wife for 1 night at the beginning of December. 
First the good points:
Well located close to Grafton Street and St, Stephens Green
Nice cosy friendly bar
Clean and comfortable rooms

However:
Upon arrival we were initially told that out guaranteed upgrade was not available as the hotel was full. After some consultation between the receptionist and the duty manager we eventually got our upgrade, although not really convinced it was much of an upgrade as we didn't see any other rooms ago compare AND we had been told the hotel was FULL?
Room was at the front of the hotel above the street and as such was noisy when's he bars emptied.
An alarm sounded ALL night until 11am from a nearby building which kept us awake. Admittedly this was despite efforts from the hotel and apparently the Garda/police to raise the key holder. I don't blame the hotel for this but it didn't help.
It took over one hour for our room service order for breakfast to arrive and this was only after a follow up phone call.

We enjoyed our stay and the convenience of the hotel was good, but the initially problem at check in and again with the breakfast I feel calls into question the attitude towards service of the hotel.",3,2013,12,30
236,lovely hotel with friendly and efficient staff,"My wife and I spent one night here in October. I couldn't fault it and would have no hesitation in recommending it to my friends. The room was lovely and the staff couldn't have been nicer.
Breakfast was very good and the location was perfect.
We hope to stay again soon.",5,2013,12,29
236,Exceptional hotel in Central Dublin,"This really is an exceptional hotel in a lovely quiet part of Central Dublin. We wouldn't stay anywhere else. The rooms, service and breakfast are all top class. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin.",5,2013,12,27
236,central hub,"Have stayed here now a number of times and everytime the service, hospitality and ambience is always outstanding! Near to everything worth seeing and doing in Dublin, good value, great food and fantastic staff. My only quibble? They should have a health warning on the breakfast room, its that damn good!",5,2013,12,27
236,Christmas Delight,"We have just come back from 2 nights in Brooks for Christmas and both me and my Partner were not disappointed. The Staff are extremely welcoming and friendly, they took interest in everyone and the whole experience had a wonderfully personal touch to it.
The Hotel is very central with Grafton street around the corner, but its secluded from bars so we did not have any issue with outside noise.
On Christmas day we got breakfast in Bed and the Staff gave each of us a very personal Christmas gift, the thought that had gone into this was truly amazing and made the experience very special.
The food was outstanding with great service from all the staff. Lovely wine selection. 
We did not watch any films but the cinema was open playing christmas films and was lovely to see. 
There was a pianist playing christmas songs and everyone was friendly throughout our stay. The Hotel room (deluxe Room) was spacious and had a huge Bed! it was contemporary with a touch of Retro Style. 
We would highly recommend this Hotel to Friends and Family and are already thinking of excuses to go Back!
I would like to thank the Staff at the Hotel for making our experience and Christmas so nice.",5,2013,12,26
236,"still good, but...","Have stayed here a few times when in Dublin on business.  Its very centrally located near St. Stephens Green, Trinity College and the Temple Bar area but on a quiet street.  This time I was a bit disappointed with a few things, such as the wifi not working in my room and the breakfast service being rather abrupt, bordering on rude (but the food was very good).  The bar is terrific - very comfortable, generally quiet and a nice place in the evening to have a drink and catch up on some work.  Front desk and concierge staff very helpful.",4,2013,12,23
236,"Fantastic , central hotel!","We stayed here recently for a girlie catch up! A perfect city centre hotel; friendly staff and a great breakfast. The rooms are well appointed and equipped with everything you need for an overnight/weekend break in Dublin. The holiday have a parking arrangement with Drury Street Car Park and St Stephen's Green Car Park - discount rate for hotel guests. We dined in the nearby Rustic Stone, which was excellent and finished  the night in The Market Bar - very handy stroll back to the hotel!",5,2013,12,21
236,great location and staff,"Great location.... Note that the location is not exactly as showed in the map in the site of Trip Advisor, but the location is great anyway. Close to all attractions of Dublin in walking distance. The breakfast is not good, few options and you need to pay additional charge to have basic stuffs, such as eggs, bacon, etc..... Good option for people that are planning few days to visit Dublin.",4,2013,12,09
236,pick this hotel for its marvellous location,"Location is just great for any type of visitor: just in the heart of night-life, in the heart of shopping district, in the heart of the city indeed.
Breakfast is lovely, plenty of choices. Hot selections are served to your table.
Rooms are between poor and average for the amount you pay (like 130€ per night):
Only 1-2 channels had signal, very old small tv with ancient antenna.
Very small room, however sleep quality is alright and air condition is great.
I could stay there again but it is worth to check on the map for nearby hotels. Maybe they provide better rooms.
Staff is friendly and helpfull, I can not forget all the help they provided.",5,2013,12,08
236,Great Location,"Nice hotel in a great spot,all the staff were friendly .the rooms are small but its city centre so thats to be expected ,Would stay here again no problem,There was a really bad storm the night i stayed but the room was cosy and you could hardly hear the wind,",5,2013,12,08
236,Nice hotel,"This was a lovely hotel and its location in central Dublin was perfect.  Its not the cheapest option but worth the extra. Rooms were clean and well presented, the only drawback was that I couldn't access the wifi from my room as the signal simply wasn't strong enough. 
Breakfast was excellent (cooked to order rather than a buffett style affair which I prefer provides there's time!) 

I'll certainly stay here again on my next dublin trip.",4,2013,12,06
236,Aidan Hennessey - A Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I have stayed in Brooks on a number of occasions and I felt I need to say thank you and well done to all. The staff are extremely friendly, in particular the concierge Connor who recognises and acknowledges frequent guests by their first name. The bar staff are friendly and engaging while not intrusive. The service throughout is 5*, professional and friendly. The food is delicious, the deluxe rooms are beautiful and the location near the centre of Dublin is second to none. I look forward to my next stay.",5,2013,12,05
236,Brooks Hotel,"Top notch hotel, we only stayed one night, wish it could have been longer.  Really lovely.  It had a beautiful lounge area, the staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful and always very courteous.  The hotel is close to shopping areas and not far from the Temple Bar area.  Good location.",5,2013,11,28
236,Nice hotel with a very good location,"Location: this nice hotel has a very good location, in the centre of Dublin. All restaurants, shops, information centre and bus stops are around the hotel.

Hotel: nice, pleasant, calm. Hotel has own restaurant, bar, fitness centre, conference room.

Accomodation: is nice, clean, pleasant. 

Breakfast: buffet style. There´s cold buffet wit cereals, cheese, ham, fresh fruits and juices and also hot buffet with eggs, bacon, etc. You can order full Irish breakfast and it´s a really tasty.

Food: in the hotel, we had only breakfast, so I can´t say anything about the dinner.

Drinks: you can have drinks in the bar and in the restaurant. 

Service: really good and without any problems. We had a small problem in the bathroom with the washbasin and the serviceman came immediately.

Advantages of this hotel:
- nice hotel with calm atmosphere, but directly in the centre
- comfortable and clean accomodation 
- good service and attitude of the staff

Disadvantages of this hotel:
- rooms are very nice and pleasant, but rooms need some repair
- quite expensive - we had two glasses of Prosecco in the bar for 22 eur. But high prices are in all city.

What you can do there:
- trips in the city
- shopping

Our opinion: nice hotel directly in the city centre. It has a really good poistion, beause everything is near, but you have your own comfort and calm. There are no bars or noise around the hotel. So, I trully recommend this hotel for everyone, who would like to stay directly in the centre.",4,2013,11,22
236,Good Hotel with a lovely atmosphere,"This hotel is absolutely perfectly placed to enjoy Dublin.,a few minutes walk from the Airbus stop at Trinity College. Lots of old world charm for an up to date Hotel.The staff were all polite and very willing Connor the consierge was charm personifide, nothing to much trouble.This was true for all the staff. Lovely bedroom 612 sound Guiness induced sleep on a comfortable bed.street view from opening window. Air-conditioning that didn't announce itself. White Company soaps etc. Great value for money will definately stay again.

236,Really wanted to like Brooks Hotel but disappointed with room,"After much research and reading all the Trip Advisor reviews I went ahead and booked this hotel. The location was amazing, the lobby was nice, staff very friendly and breakfast was great but the room was such a disappointment. We paid over $400 Canadian for two nights. We were given a room on the second floor and it was definitely worn down. The floors were dirty and bathrooms walls were stained. The bed, however, was comfortable. The room was tiny which was too be expected but the bulky old furniture and television took up way too much space and not all the furniture was necessary. The photos on the website were very different than the room we received. Perhaps those photos on the website are of more expensive suites as we just had a standard room.",2,2013,11,12
236,A hotel where you are made to feel welcome!,"As we were only visiting for a weekend, we were seeking a hotel that was located in the centre of Dublin in order to allow us to visit many of the key landmarks and restaurants and pubs. Brooks seemed to fit the bill. When we arrived the staff were very welcoming and we were more than happy with the standard of the room and the hotel facilities. We had planned on a number of specific places we wanted to see and were directed to the concierge for help. The concierge, Connor, could not have been more helpful. He asked our names on this occasion and for the rest of our stay he would come over on seeing us and ask how things were and how the different visits had gone - a true asset for the hotel! The hotel bar has a splendid collection of whiskies and some very unique cocktails. The location is brilliant with easy access to many of the key attrCtions in Dublin.",5,2013,11,10
236,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in this hotel and loved it.Every member of staff was really helpful and nothing was too much trouble.The concierge was especially welcoming and kind  and I loved the way he walked around chatting to people and opening and closing doors in the foyer.He is a treasure.The room we were in was fabulous and really quiet,you wouldn't think you were in the city at all.Beds really comfy too.Breakfast was fab and service was excellent.I couldn't fault this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I wanted to stay in the city-very near Grafton street,the  gaiety theatre Stevens Green,Luas stop etc.Lovely hotel.",5,2013,11,10
236,very nice hotle close to the center,"Very good hotel, central location, close to all the main shopping area on the southside. Rooms were lovely and comfortable, a little bit small.
The breakfast is excellent and the service great thank to Connor at the concierge who gave us perfect tips and treated us in a very friendly way.",4,2013,11,10
236,Dublin Gem,We were just in Dublin and stayed in this hotel it was wonderful the beds are so comfortable and the staff is amazing. I would stay again. Conner greets you as you come from your cab he ask your name and introduces himself  and he will remember your name for you whole stay. It is in a great location close to a lot.,5,2013,11,01
236,relaxing trip,"Excellent hotel, location wise, very central close to all the main shopping area on the southside, plus the back streets where there are many and varied one off interesting shops and restaurants.
Rooms were lovely and comfortable, put we had upgraded to the deluxe as we had read previous reviews saying other rooms could be a little small and we weren't dissapointed.
all in all a lovely stay with attentive staff.",4,2013,10,29
236,Comfort and Charm,My husband and I stayed for a second year in a row at this charming and comfortable hotel which is in an excellent location for shopping and sight seeing. Both times we have been greeted with a warm welcome and treated as such during our stay. Our breakfasts were delicious and there is a nice space for a coffee or a drink after being out and about. We have quite confidently recommended Brooks Hotel to our friends.,5,2013,10,28
236,Dublin visit,"My wife and I recently spent 7days in Dublin and stayed at the Brooks Hotel, Drury Street, Dublin.
We would thoroughly recommend the Brooks Hotel, the accommodation was excellent, prices reasonable and the warm and friendly staff made our stay very enjoyable. We would  stay at the hotel again",5,2013,10,26
236,Thumbs Up!,"Location is excellent. Check in was painless and smooth although a wee bit cold and indifferent were the vibes we got from the front desk lady. No big deal. Stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much. Room was very clean and comfortable. Toiletries were more than adequate. The cleaning staff and crew are very efficient. Kudos to Marvin the Concierge...he was very helpful indeed in passing along information and directions to wherever! 

The breakfast lacks punch. We have been through lots of B & B's & Hotels during our 3 week stay and I must say that their Full Irish Traditional Breakfast offering rates close to the bottom. Service is good but loads of room for improvement.

Jasmine bar is nicely laid out. Lots of elbow room. Lacks the atmosphere that most Irish pubs have...but great for a quick couple of pints before retiring. Service is also good but can be improved.

If you are staying over and for the weekend the rooms overlooking Drury Street can be susceptible to cacophony emanating from the bars and pubs in close proximity on Friday and Saturday nights. We didn't mind it as that's part and parcel of downtown exposure.

Good value for the buck considering the location of the establishment....in the heart of downtown. 

Most of the daily tours has their pick up point at Suffolk Street, opposite O'Neill's Pub, about a 5 minute walk away.

We would stay here again when we're back Dublin way...for sure! A very recommended stay!",4,2013,10,25
236,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel, great location and tremendous staff. Stayed 2 nights in October 2013 with my wife and 2 other couples.  The only negative comment on the room was the lack of available outlets to recharge phones and other electronics.  Everyone enjoyed the property and would stay there again.",5,2013,10,20
236,Slightly disappointed .,"Booked a number of rooms for a wedding. Rooms were nice but expensive ,you are paying for the location.Breakfast was very nice and staff friendly.However the residents bar closes at midnight, one of our guests had his booking lost twice and  some of our guests were charged for drinks to their rooms which were never ordered. For the money we paid we where slightly disappointed.",3,2013,10,20
236,Really Enjoyed Our Stay,"Really nice hotel that is well located. Very comfortable, well-appointed rooms. The staff couldn't have been any more helpful or accommodating. Very warm and friendly. We left something in our room when we checked out and the staff were extremely responsive coordinating sending the items to us -- we were really appreciative and impressed.",4,2013,10,18
236,Great value,Moved into The Brooks after returning from Edinburgh.It is a very central location for all sight seeing and shopping.Grafton street mall is around the corner.It was by far the best breakfast since our arrival.The room was clean and fairly large.They have a residents lounge and a great bar for an evening drink.Free WiFi included which we did not get in the 5 star hotels.,5,2013,10,17
236,Glad we stayed at the Brooks,"When you look on a map you can see that this hotel is in a very good location. It was easy to walk to the major sights, and the Hop On bus is just a few blocks away. We had a top floor room that was modern and very clean. No view out the front window, but the hotel is on a quiet street. No need to go out for dinner. We ate in the restaurant and it was excellent. Our waiter made the meal even better.",4,2013,10,16
236,Fantastic city break hotel,"I recently stayed in the Brooks Hotel for a 3 night stay with my boyfriend. The hotel is in a fantastic location, just 5-10 minutes away from the lively Temple Bar area and situated in the Grafton Street shopping district. This area of Dublin is a little more up-market than others, so there is some fantastic shopping to be done (Brown Thomas, a department store just down the road, is full of designer clothes etc.) 

The room itself was very comfortable, with brilliant extras such as a free pillow menu and chocolates placed on pillows every evening. The standard of the furniture and cleanliness was excellent. 

Staff are brilliant - very friendly and were v. helpful in advising how to get to certain attractions. Had a nightmare with Ryanair where they lost my case, but the staff at Brooks were more than happy to offer advice and placed my case in my room once it was eventually delivered. 

Breakfasts are gorgeous (make sure you try the Irish potato bread) and although we didn't eat at the hotel the menu looked great. 

Would definitely return!",5,2013,10,16
236,"Great location, great find.","This hotel is fantastic. Dublin is so expensive and having stayed here a few times you find that hotels that are the same price as this one do not offer the facilities, the staff or any other detail that this one does. The staff went out of their way to help us, the breakfast in the morning was one of the best I have ever had with friendly staff, homemade bread/pastries and just generally good all round. The beds were exceptionally comfortable, the shower excellent with power shower and White Company products and lovely touches like a digital radio playing classical music when we got in the room. They also turned down the bed and placed a chocolate on the pillow!
The hotel is in the best area to eat, drink and shop in central Dublin, 2 minutes in either direction and you're where you need to be. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.",4,2013,10,16
236,Great place to stay.,Brooks Hotel was extremely nice with a great location that was an easy walk to anywhere you would want to go in the city. The staff was always very nice and helpful. I would not hesitate to stay there again. The hotel even had travel adaptors for those in need.,5,2013,10,15
236,Brooks Hotel,Brooks Hotel is very well situated and is a great place to stay.  The hotel facilities and restaurant are excellent and the staff is most pleasant and helpful.  I would not hesitate to go back. The rooms were clean and comfortable.,5,2013,10,14
236,Great little hotel in perfect spot with a personal touch,"What a great find! The brooks hotel is ideally situated in central Dublin so you can walk to nearly everything. Trinity Collge, Grafton St shopping, St Stephens Green, Christ Church Cathedral, Powerscourt Townhouse and of course temple bar are all close by. The rooms are quaint and cozy and the service was outstanding. Colin the concierge was the best Irish host. Great breakfast in the restaurant as well. Highly recommended. ",5,2013,10,14
236,October2013,"This was our first visit to Brooks Hotel, but not to Dublin. The hotel is very well located within the city, convenient to all the main attractions. The staff are very helpful and pleasant, and the rooms comfortable and quite well appointed. The only drawback was the shower within the bath, whereby the plastic curtain insisted on wrapping itself around you. The food and service in the restaurant were very good and it was very surprising to find ourselves the only diners on a Thursday evening, indeed it was little better on the following two nights. However non of this mattered to us, the ambience  was fine and as I say the food and service very good.",4,2013,10,14
236,Best boutique hotel in Dublin,"Not a cheap option but definitely worth the extra for a special occasion. Service is excellent, rooms are very chic, restaurant and bar are top class (though, again, not cheap options). Location is unbeatable, short walk from Grafton St but not busy- can be tricky to get to if you're not used to the streets system but well worth the trouble once you arrive. Have stayed a couple of times and will return in future. Excellent luxury option.",5,2013,10,11
236,"Location, location, location","We loved this hotel so much we've booked it for the night before our flight back to Australia at the end of October.  We spent 4 nights here before travelling to Cork, and absolutely loved the hotel. 

 Connor the concierge is a fountain of knowledge as our the reception staff...always helpful with maps and directions.   Sure, breakfast can be a bit on the slow side on some days, but for us that wasn't a big deal.  Buy a one day deal on the hop on/off bus, because once you've found your bearings, the fantastic location of the hotel will enable you to walk everywhere very easily.  We were travelling in a small family group including an 8 year of child, and 68 year old grandmother, and found the walking around Dublin very easy going.  

When we arrived, we'd been travelling for 36 hours and so decided on a quick dinner in the bar area.  Well Noel couldn't have been more accommodating.  Within minutes a table was set, we had drinks in front of us and dinner was ordered...all in a very friendly and efficient fashion...much appreciated by weary travellers.

The second best thing about this hotel for me was the Gluten Free bread/toast...it is simply the best gluten free bread I have ever tasted.  The hotel staff even directed us to the bakery where we could buy it.

On short,you won't go wrong with this hotel.",5,2013,10,07
236,"hotel review, Ireland","The hotel staff were attentive and very efficient, quickly responding to any request or question.  Room was elegant and comfortable.  It was within walking distance to most attractions.  The restaurant and bar was very good and the food we sampled in the lounge and for breakfast was good.",4,2013,10,06
236,Great stay at the Brooks hotel,"We just returned from a great tip to Ireland and stayed at the Brooks hotel for three nights while in Dublin.  The service at the hotel was terrific, it is in a great location close to great restaurants, pubs, and shopping.  Close to Grafton Street and walking distance to Temple Bar.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2013,10,06
236,Fantastic location,Second time we have stayed here and both times we have loved it. 5 mins walk from Grafton Street and 10 mins from Temple Bar etc - perfect location. It's a small hotel but so quiet. We would recommend the breakfast but it can sometimes be a bit slow. We never went to the restaurant so can't comment. The reception staff were always very helpful. The Hairy Lemon pub next door is great and there are loads of others nearby.   If we ever go back to Dublin this is where we shall stay.,5,2013,10,03
236,Great place,"We stayed two nights here in Sept. of 2013...the location is exceptional.  We could walk to more places than the two days to see them all.  We didn't have a car so I can't comment on that but I can say public transportation in Dublin is excellent and the staff is very knowledgeable on how to get you from pt. A to B in a pleasant manner.  The room was very comfortable.  The beds were comfortable - the bathroom was a great size - the water pressure was, like the rest of Ireland, exceptional.  The hotel prides itself on being upscale so when I was asked to take my foot of the table it was because of that - I took it in stride - it is a lovely place and they want to keep it that way.   The one time we needed help - we had staff at the door in under 5 minutes.  Again - location, location, location - it was great!  ps. if you don't want the full breakfast in the morning and just want something super fast - the little coffee shop across the street was whipping up some mighty fine spinach and egg sandwiches....oh and they have milk alternatives (soy, coconut and almond - yes!).",5,2013,10,03
236,Fantastic hotel!,"Beautiful place, great staff and perfect location! Would strongly recommend!! The breakfast was unreal and the bar was a great place for a night cap. 

If I am ever in Dublin again this is the place I will stay ",5,2013,10,02
236,Loved the Brooks Hotel,"Unfortunately we were only able to spend one night at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin, but we were very, very pleased with our choice of this hotel. It was very stylish yet had a very warm feeling to it, as the staff were super nice... with a special thanks to Connor, the wonderful concierge! We were welcomed there right away, our luggage was stored (as we got into the city early in the morning, long before check-in time) and we were given a key to a nice lounge area downstairs where we could rest and recuperate from our trip. When we were able to move into our room, we found it to be very cozy and nicely decorated, somewhat small by U.S. standards but perfectly adequate, with a nice modern bathroom and a window that looked out onto the street. The beds were extremely comfortable. The location of the Brooks was perfect for us, on a nice quiet side street (we almost made the mistake of staying in a hotel on O'Connell Street, which we definitely would have regretted...way too busy and too noisy) but within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. We had dinner in the whiskey bar downstairs, where we had the best fish and chips we have ever had in our lives. The breakfast buffet was just wonderful, not free but deeply discounted for the hotel guests, with delicious pastries, lots of fresh fruit, all sorts of breads and jams, cereals of all types. etc. A very nice buffet, indeed. All in all this hotel was perfect for us, and we have no complaints whatsoever. If we get the chance to go back to Dublin we would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,09,30
236,Great hotel,"This hotel is quiet, very nice and the staff are friendly. It it across the millennium beige from temple bar. It is easy access to most areas and close to the hop on hop off stop. Loved our stay. Would recommend to others",5,2013,09,30
236,Perfect location!,"The Brooks Hotel is in the perfect location to explore Dublin! The room was clean and very nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only problem we had was that there were only two outlets in the room and one wasnt working, which made charging our devices difficult.",5,2013,09,27
236,Nice small hotel,"We booked this hotel via Touring Ireland when we needed to be close to public transportation when arriving to Dublin.  It was raining but the hotel was within blocks of Trinity College and AirCoach bus drop off.  Very nice room, bathroom sink wouldn't drain but they sent someone right up to correct it.  Room was facing the street and some delivery truck in middle of night parked (with engine running) right under our window and that was annoying since I am a light sleeper.  Ask for room away from busy street.  Breakfast was wonderful and white linen affair.  Excellent food and service.  It came with our reservation.  Would highly recommend.",4,2013,09,26
236,Great hotel right in the heart of the city.,"The Brooks Hotel is charming, chic and centrally located.  Within walking distance of great shops and restaurants, yet slightly off the main streets to give you a place to unwind and relax after a busy day.  The rooms were nice size (we had a standard room with two queen beds).  Our doorman was always so helpful and went out of his way to make us feel welcome - he even remembered our names when greeting us every day.  My friend and I were traveling together and we always felt safe at this hotel.  A true gem and I think an amazing value in the heart of Dublin.",4,2013,09,23
236,Wonderful Hotel/great location,"We were very happy with our room at Brooks.  The décor was tasteful and the room had adequate space.  The bathroom was great.  The location was excellent for sightseeing in Dublin.  Many restaurants nearby.  The breakfast at the hotel was excellent as well.  Lots of food and very tasty.  It does get noisy on the weekends, so time your trip well or bring earplugs.
Just a note, our friends had a similar room but the décor wasn't as nice.  So I guess not all rooms are the same (even tho' we all paid the same amount).",4,2013,09,22
236,Perfect location,"Brooks is a very stylish hotel in the heart of the tourist, government, and business area. 

They cater to business and tour groups. The go out of there way to keep the tourist away from the business folk. Like not invite you to hotel welcome functions.

Over all the staff is excellent. The rooms are first class although as part of a tour group your room will be a third smaller than the business crowd. ",5,2013,09,20
236,Great location and helpful staff in Dublin,"We are members of the Club of Small Luxury Hotels of the World, and the Brooks Hotel is a member of this group of hotels.  As a club member we received better rates and included breakfast.  Given its ideal location, we chose this hotel.  Overall, I can recommend the hotel without reservations.  It is fairly modern with very comfortable rooms.  The included breakfast was varied and tasty.  They also make a very good latte.  We had one problem with the room (the AC fan would only run on high speed and blast out very cold air), which we reported to the front desk the first morning.  We realized after the second night the problem had not been addressed, so we had a follow-up conversation with the desk manager the next day.  Unfortunately, this was over a weekend and the hotel was unable to get the problem resolved.  They offered us another room for our third night (and last night - we flew out early the next morning), but with packing and all it was more inconvenient to change rooms than to stay.  They did put a fan (a quiet one) in our and this helped.  The hotel staff was very apologetic about their inability to fix the AC problem, and the hotel general manager called me after we returned to apologize again for the experience we had.  Sometimes mechanical issues do occur, and since the hotel was otherwise well maintained, I can not fault them to much for this.  When we return to Dublin, we do plan on staying at the Brooks Hotel again, and I do recommend it.",5,2013,09,19
236,"Lovely hotel, great location","Stayed here for a long weekend.  Usually stay in Buswells, which we still love, but we were lucky enough to win a free stay.

Great location and our rooms were quiet.  Rooms and public area very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished.  Really enjoyed the breakfasts and the room service meal.  Huge beds and a good choice of pillows.  Slept like a log!",5,2013,09,19
236,Lovely boutique hotel in excellent location,We stayed our first two nights in Ireland at the Brooks.  It is a lovely  newer boutique hotel that is in a very convenient location.   The hotel was quiet but close to many things. The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed.  We had an excellent breakfast and drinks in a comfortable bar area.  It also has a living room type area with couches and chairs  in a very quiet area of the hotel.  We found  the staff to be very accommodating and their concierge was a very nice man who made everyone feel at home and remembered everyone's name.  This was a great pace to start our trip and I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2013,09,15
236,"Comfortable, charming and convenient hotel","Very comfortable and quiet hotel.  Wonderful breakfast with homemade jams and breads, fruits, yogurts, cereals, breakfast meats, wonderful Irish cheeses, as well as eggs anyway you could want them and, of course, the traditional full Irish breakfast. My wife loved the porridge (oatmeal) that has a hint of Irish whisky added.  Very well located and within easy walking distance to many attractions. The hotel staff was charming and professionally attentive. Enjoy the bar for an after dinner Irish coffee (decaf if you want to sleep). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2013,09,15
236,Great city centre location and really nice hotel,"A really nice hotel, in a great city centre location. Only a two minute walk to Grafton street. We stayed on the day the Republic of Ireland played Sweden and the hotel was buzzing with activity. The Aviva stadium was only a 15-20 min walk away.

Great service and food. Staff extremely friendly and helpful.",4,2013,09,15

Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2013,09,12
236,"Charming and convenient hotel with friendly, helpful staff","This small hotel has been beautifully restored, and is a great value for its central yet quiet location   just off Grafton street. We could walk  everywhere, to the Abbey Theater, the Temple Bar area, the Guinness Storehouse. The complimentary Irish breakfast in the hotel restaurant is a splendid feast, that even offers house-made jams and conserves, along with all components of the traditional Irish breakfast cooked to order.   Restaurants, pubs, and shops of all kinds are close by. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We arrived in the morning after an overnight transatlantic flight, before our room was available for checkin. The staff took our bags and directed us to the guests' library, where we could sit down and rest.  I would love to stay here again next time I visit Dublin.",5,2013,09,11
236,City Hotel,"Our group was on a 13 day golf trip around Ireland and had just 2 days in Dublin.  We didn't expect much from this hotel as it hadn't gotten rave reviews, but it was wonderful.

236,Highly recommend,Rooms are clean quiet and AC was excellent.  Breakfast was very good.  Well located for walking the heart of Dublin.  You may pay more but to be minutes from the action of the temple bar is well worth it.  staff were as friendly as you will find anywhere in the world.  Would stay there again when in Dublin,4,2013,09,10
236,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location, Friendly Staff","Great location in city center. Wonderful service, staff very friendly and helpful.  Concierge was exceptional from the moment we walked into the hotel, the concierge welcomed us and sat us down to review our plans.  He pulled out a city map and marked all of the events we wanted to attend during St. Patrick's Festival 2013.  He was very knowledgeable of the entire city and recommended to different restaurants.  He was also able to get us on a last minute day tour to Kilkenny.  I could not have been more impressed with his service.

236,Lovely Stay in Dublin,"After reading dozens of reviews on TripAdvisor, we chose Brooks Hotel for a stay at the beginning and end of our three week trip to Ireland.

The Brooks is located in a wonderful part of Dublin, quiet and close to everything you could want or need. 

The staff is kind, professional, helpful and abundant.  We arrived early am, and by the time we got back from breakfast our two rooms were ready. 

The rooms are large enough, with Air conditioning & mini fridge, not always in every hotel in Ireland as we found out during the rest of our tour. A note on the AC, it's not that it's so hot you need it, but depending on the days humidity it's hard to get enough air in there without it being stuffy. The Brooks AC worked great in August! 

The breakfast buffet had a variety of things to get you started, and the coffee was amazing.

Things you could quibble over:

We were traveling with my 87 year old Mother in Law, and found almost everything just perfect for her except the very tall tubs. It's not easy to climb in and out of them if you are not up to that. I'm not 87 and I found them to be a bit much. 

One or two more plugs near the desk area also would have been helpful. We had to unplug a lamp to plug in a extension cord( we bring our own these days) to recharge phones, camera's, laptops, tablets.  I would think most folks would need to do this as well.",5,2013,09,08
236,"Great rooms, service, and location","This is my favourite hotel in Dublin. Every time we stay here we have a good time because it is perfectly located and is good value if you get it at the right item with rooms that are spacious and comfortable. I love to walk out the door and turn a corner and being on Grafton St or South William St were there are many many great bars, cafes and restaurants. On our last stay we were lucky enough to have a small suite and it has to be said it was one of the greatest hotel stays I've enjoyed. At times the hotel can be expensive but if you time it correctly, staying in Brooks can be a complete pleasure.",5,2013,09,06
236,Personal touch- the concierge makes you feel welcome,"We had a wonderful break in Dublin. Warm, friendly people, especially the Brooks concierge, who was so welcoming! Rooms are tiny but super clean. They even have apillow menu but sine the pillows they gave were so good I was not tempted to try it out.
We arrived early in the morning, and as expected, the room was not ready. They have a lovely, old-world residents’ lounge which is like the library in a stately home. Was so engrossed in a beautiful coffee table book, I almost felt sorry when the room got ready. The breakfast buffet is also extensive and tasty. The hotel is located a short stroll from everywhere. It is not right on Grafton street – so you avoid the noise and crowrs, but is just close enough so you can walk down at any time of day or night. I took in a play at the Abbey theatre, and even alone late at night you feel safe strolling across O’Connelly bridge back to the hotel.
 We had a lovely local, atmospheric free walking tour with Brian at Sandman tours and  took a trip to Slane with Jim Farrrelly the cabbie who gave us inside insights into Ireland.  And to top it all, we had great weather!",5,2013,09,06
236,Beautiful hotel and great location,"The Brooks Hotel is one of the most best hotels I've ever stayed in. Beautiful lobby and friendly staff. Usually the rooms aren't as nice as the lobbies, but this is different-- the rooms are amazing and very comfortable. I loved all the decor and found them homey and inviting,  yet sophisticated. Rooms are a bit small in size, but not uncomfortably. The location is perfect for exploring the best of Dublin- walk out to shops, restaurants, Trinity, St. Stephens Green etc.",5,2013,09,05
236,Good Property,"Great location, walking distance to everything you need. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Celebrated our honeymoon there and they went out of there way to make us feel welcome.

236,Great Location and Staff,"My husband and I try to travel outside the US at least one trip a year.  We do extensive research on hotel location and accomodations.  The Brooks Hotel did not disappoint.  The location was awesome!  It was located within easy walking distance of 7 of the top 10 places to visit.  Places 8, 9 and 10 were an easy bus ride.  It is also located in an area with great restaurants - one of which is directly across the street - the Fade Street Social gastropbub (that's my next review).  The staff were very attentive and arranged taxis for us without fail.  We would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,09,04
236,Excellent Hotel and location,"My wife and I stayed at the Brooks in Dublin on May 2012, although I was going to write a review once I got back but unfortunately it was one of those things that fell through the crack. Although it was a year ago but this hotel needs to recognize because they really have an excellent staff and location. The Front Counter was extremely helpful and they comply with every request with pleasure, the restaurant staff was also extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location all our tours were just three blocks away, Trinity College just a couple of blocks and the hop-on-hop-off stop was just in front of the college. The Pedestrian streets with all the stores are also a couple of blocks away and at night within a couple of blocks there are plenty of different good restaurants. The taxi we used was from and to the airport everything else was short walks. A couple times our tour was very early and we had to be out of the hotel before 6:30 a.m. since brekafast was included and the restaurant is not open at that time we were told that our breakfasts will be deliver to our room it was deliver on time and it was a good breakfast. This was done without us asking for it it was the Front Counter that did everything for us. Overlall this hotel is excellent in service and location, since we had such a great time in Ireland we are planning to visit it again in the near future and for us we won't look at another hotel we are staying at The Brooks. Already has recommend it to a numerous friends.",5,2013,09,03
236,Couldn't be be better,"This Hotel was a gem as we embarked on the first leg of our Ireland tour. This is a boutique hotel located in a perfect part of Dublin; close to shopping, restaurants, sights and nightlife.  We were a group of 5 who had two rooms (not on the same floors, so remember to ask ahead for that). Rooms were very nice, the beds were super comfortable and the pillows were awesome!  Breakfast which was included with our stay was wonderful.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Be sure to do the Hop on - Hop off bus tour which is well worth the $. Dublin is a lovely city and this hotel is perfect for couples and families.  It also has air conditioning, which we Americans are quite used to ! I would highly recommend Brooks Hotel when you are visiting Dublin.",5,2013,09,03

236,Perfect - Everything,"We stayed 3 nights at the Brooks and we have nothing but good things to say.  The hotel is in the perfect location for getting around the city, we only took a taxi to/from the airport.  The concerige was also INCREDIBLE, he spend a great deal of time with us every morning giving us the in's and out's of the city and was incredibly friendly when we arrived with our luggage and getting our room early.  The front desk was always professional and friendly.  The rooms was a perfect size and very quiet.  The breakfast was great and had plenty of selections for my gluten free wife.  Thank you Brooks, hope to be back soon.",5,2013,09,03
236,Perfect Location,"Traveling in Ireland with Dublin as first stop, Brooks Hotel made us feel like we had made the right choice in staying with them.  Staff is helpful, but not intrusive. Hotel is situated in a great position for walking to St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street and environs.

Brooks offers a restaurant, bar, small gym and lovely quiet library room.  I felt it was quite sufficient for all our needs.  The concierge desk is never without an answer to questions large or small. I would also note that I felt the value was solid for what can be an expensive city.

We would gladly return.",4,2013,09,03

They have a very busy front desk, but they were able to help with questions. Room very clean and had a refrigerator. Would definitely request a room in the back next time because as others have said the noise factor from people leaving the nearby bars can be loud.  Very convenient to everything.",5,2013,09,02
236,Superb!,"A wonderful stay! Arrived very early so our room was not ready-explained that we took an overnight flight and were very tired. The concierge could not have been more accommodating. They offered the Library/Residence Room to rest.  By the time we settled into the Library Room, our own room was ready!  Beautiful room with a selection of pillows and comfortable bed.  The hotel is within walking distance of shops and pubs.  The Hairy Lemon up the street was a great traditional pub. The breakfast was lovely with an excellent variety of food choices.  Highly recommend this hote!!",5,2013,09,01
236,exceptional,"Spent 3 days in Dublin and the Brooks Hotel was a lovely start to our touring holiday in Ireland. The location was perfect, the rooms were spacious and very comfortable, beautiful breakfast buffet and library, even a pillow menu. But it really was the staff that made our stay exceptional - from the breakfast staff to front desk to room service, nothing was too difficult (and we were a challenging group with two toddlers and special meal requirements). I cant recall being made to feel so welcome and well-looked after. Really a remembrance of ""things past"" in the very best way. Wish more hotels would cultivate the art of hospitality.",5,2013,08,28
236,Amazing location!,"Could not have asked for a better location - right in the middle of all the cafes/pubs/bistro's etc - and a short walk from everything! Would recommend The Hairy Lemon at the top of the road for a nice pub meal!

Rooms are nicely-appointed, but bathrooms a little tired. Loved their White Company amenities! We were on the fourth floor and found it very quiet. 

Breakfast good, with attentive staff.......we didn't have any other meals here with so much choice in the city.

Only annoyance was having to wait almost 2 hours for our cases to come up.....we even went down to get them ourselves to be told that the Concierge had gone walkabout with the luggage room key! As we only had 2 nights and one full day in the city we were keen to get out and about, not wait for our cases!",4,2013,08,28
236,Great weekend in Dublin,"Just returned from a lovely weekend in Dublin staying at the Brooks Hotel. We didn't know what to expect all I can say is it was 1st class from arrival to leaving, all the staff were very professional and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was situated in the heart of Dublin a short walk from the shops and bars. A special thank you to  Roger in the lounge bar who made us feel very welcome .
We were surprised how big the classic double was and the facilities in the room, lots of tea and coffee available and to put the icing on the cake so to speak the bathroom was lovely ,had a great time a big thank you to all at the Brooks hotel will visit again when possible.",5,2013,08,26
236,Very central location and nice rooms.,"This hotel is very close to temple bar and grafton street so a great location. The rooms are nice enough and very clean, decor and especially bathrooms slightly dated. There were 2 unfortunate let downs for us, first trip advisor had the location incorrect on their city guide app so it took us 4 times a long to find the place as it should have. Secondly breakfast wasn't quite up to scratch, the poached eggs were hard all the way through and served on the tiniest piece of dry toast, there was more toast when we asked but by then I'd realised I didn't need it to mop up the runny yolk. Great location to stay in for a quick stop over in Dublin though.",3,2013,08,26
236,Top Notch Hotel,"For a first time in Dublin, I had trouble finding the hotel on my own, with a GPS and took a cab. However, on arrival, the staff took care of all my needs. My luggage was transferred from the cab to my room. The concierge provided us with a map of the area, suggestions for restaurants, and  for things to do. The staff made all calls and arrangements for our excursions so we felt more than pampered. I would stay at the Brooks Hotel again.",5,2013,08,24
236,Warm and helpful reception,"The staff at the Brooks couldn't have been more sweet, friendly and helpful. I arrived in Dublin to find my luggage was MIA so it would take a lot to cheer me up when I checked into the hotel but their bubbly manner was all I needed. There was a problem with the AC in my room when i first atrived and it required a couple of room changes to rectify it but it was taken care of efficiently and an offer of a complimentary cocktail or bottle of wine. The  location was perfect and staff was helpful booking our day tours, busses, and evening attractions. Loved our stay there!",5,2013,08,21
236,Great Hotel,"A pricey, but outstanding hotel for a good, quiet, central location. The service is excellent, the personnel very helpful. The rooms spacious, clean, well functioning. One of the best restaurants, Fade St. Social, is across the street.We would definitely return to this hotel again if we came to Dublin.",5,2013,08,20
236,Fantastic Location,"This was a great little hotel very central in Dublin especially for the Temple Bar area which is just a short walk away. Staff were very friendly, food was good and the location just meant everything from shopping to site seeing was only minutes away.

Also there are loads of great little restaurants in the area so it made having dinner out so much easier.",4,2013,08,20
236,Good  hotel.,"Stayed for 3 nights in this hotel, when we arrived our room wasn't ready so we just went to the bar and had a small meal.We have eaten in this restaurant and the food has been always good. The room was a bit noise from outside noises, next time we will  choose one facing the back. The breakfast was very good with a very good variety of cereals, breads etc. The cooked breakfast was very good with a good selection on the menu.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I will most definetly return, as in my opinion is a well situated  hotel.",4,2013,08,20
236,Poor welcome + Fawlty service taint great location & classy decor...,"First impressions may not be everything, but they matter a lot - especially when you're arriving at a venue which prides itself on being ""a 4* designer boutique hotel for those who value difference and for whom ambience, decor and quality of service are important"" and, more significantly for us, has been well-recommended by many Trip Advisor Reviewers. Sadly, the ""handling"" we experienced on arrival at Brooks conveyed a cold, uncaring, un-listening, robotic attitude towards guests - treatment which undoubtedly coloured our view on all that followed...

Let's just say (with considerable restraint) that our ""check-in"" experience was extremely unimpressive (you might say we got the wrong person on a bad day, but keeping our ears tuned throughout our stay, our experience was not unique). There was NO ""welcome""- we got an unintelligible recitation about something or other, no ""listening"" until our 3rd attempt to say something, and (for the first time in our lives) no offer whatsoever to help ourselves or our luggage get to the room allocated to us, for which directions were, putting it mildly, minimal. ""Designer boutique hotel"" eh?

We struggled to our destination on the 4th Floor (we had requested the 6th, but no mention was made of this) and found ourselves in a room which was very satisfactory in terms of facilities, comfort and decor. Still somewhat bemused at our ""treatment"", we decided the best thing to do was to dump our bags, and meander towards the very adjacent shopping areas - we visited Arnotts on Henry Street first, returning to the Grafton Street area, and we greatly enjoyed the experience on both sides of the Liffey. We dined later at the consistently excellent ""Il Vicoletto"", just off Dame Street.

Our next ""Brooks' experience"" was breakfast - it's my favourite meal when we go away. Let's say it was ""so-so"". There was a quite good Buffet selection, but it could have been displayed better. Understanding what the first waiter was saying was a major challenge, and the second guy was not exactly delicate in his movements - the toast-rack almost ended-up in ""my better half's"" lap, but he didn't even notice! Ah yes, we said to each other, savour the ""quality of service"". (The cooked breakfast, by the way, was adequate, if not outstanding).

Fast-forward through the remainder of our 2 night stay. With one notable exception (see below) Reception staff appeared uninterested in interacting with guests (avoidance was a common tactic). Lounge staff were pleasant enough, but you almost felt guilty interrupting their conversations with each other or with attractive women...

Sunday Breakfast was a bit chaotic - enough staff on duty, but no co-ordination : juice glasses not available, knife/fork/spoons all coming together just too much to handle, hot breakfast order mislaid/forgotten. Again, ""quality of service"" a bad joke !

Our checking-out brought a major positive : we got (for Brooks) an untypical Receptionist - efficient, friendly, interactive, listening, responsive - sadly we couldn't read her name badge, but we hope she survives!

Our weekend @ Brooks revolved around celebrating a major Birthday, but deliberately doing it in our own City - we enjoyed all the bits away from the hotel. Okay, we might consider giving Brooks another try, but we would hope that for everyones' sake it can get its act together - in the year of ""The Gathering""....",3,2013,08,18
236,Good choice in Dublin,"I stayed here w a group in May.  I had never heard of the hotel but loved it.  Great location and friendly staff.  I had a single room and felt very, safe.  The food was good and the bar relaxing.   Would definitely recommend  to Dublin visitors.",5,2013,08,18
236,Great spot and great location,"We stayed here twice, both before and after our Vagabond Tour. It's a beautiful hotel and our room was perfect --- on the second visit.  I think we were upgraded since we were ""return"" customers.  Not to say the first room was bad, it was just smaller and had a much older tv. The service here is great, too.  They let us email our boarding passes to the front desk to be printed out for the trip home.  And the breakfast is delicious and served in a beautiful eating area.  Oh, and the location is great, too.  Hope to come back to Dublin, and would definitely chose Brooks Hotel again.",5,2013,08,17
236,"""Best Yet""","We had a pleasant stay in this Hotel at the start of August 2013. Arrival was sure footed and welcoming. Porter service. Initial walk into the room was 5*. Lovely room, well decorated. Clean and a good Bed. Pillow menu..excellent!.. We had breakfast at the Hotel on both Mornings and was excellent and well served by staff, Saturday Noel and Sean arranged a special Anniversary Meal and surprise for My wife, Flowers cookies and Card in the room from Management. The meal was Excellent and well priced for a hotel of this quality. With a Piano player!!. Service is great, Bar staff friendly and knowledgeable. Reception helpfull. Cleaning very good. Overall well done Brooks Hotel !!!. We are now thinking of a revisit..and moving onto the sister Hotel in Galway for the Galway races later!!.",5,2013,08,17
236,Boutique charm,"This is a really charming place with excellent service. The staff was super attentive. We had been given a double room instead if a twin and they gave us tea while they fixed the error. They provided gluten free toast and other options at breakfast and went out of their way helping us arrange travel to a Springsteen Concert in Kilkenny. The location is the best. Tons if restaurants & pubs, nearby Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green & Temple Bar. ",5,2013,08,17
236,Nice room but poor service,"On the day of our departure, we went to Howth and left the luggage in the luggage room. Unfortunately there was a problem with the DART on the way back and rail service was stopped. We were lucky to find a taxi after a while and the plan was to go back to the hotel, wait for the taxi outside, pick up the luggage and head to the airport. However once at the hotem I was told at the reception that the guy in charge of the room was not there, I had to wait ! I was surprised that the reception desk was not able to contact him. Eventually my girfriend intervened and by magic a manager came and opened the door for us. Our taxi driver, a very nice guy by the way, used all his tricks to take us in time to the airport. Actually we were the last to board the plane. We were happy with the hotel. The room was big, clean, the breakfast great and what we really like is that the hotel while in the city center was very quiet. So the lack of support from reception desk came as a major disapointment. So if you're looking for a nice room, quiet and well located, it is the place to go. If you are looking for good quality of service, you may want to go elsewhere !",3,2013,08,16
236,Connor IS Irish hospitality!,"Wonderful boutique hotel in a great part of Dublin!  Right around the corner to Grafton Street and very close to Trinity College, we were able to walk to pretty much everywhere.  It’s a pretty quiet street and has a mini mart close by that we used to stock up on water and pop to take back to the room.  We were here for 2 nights and enjoyed it very much.  The rooms were nice and a good size for European standards.  We didn’t have a package that included breakfast so I can’t comment on that.  

One of the most memorable pieces of our stay at the Brooks hotel was Connor.  He is what Irish hospitality is all about!  On arrival, our room wasn’t ready but Connor, the concierge, took care of our luggage and gave us a great recommendation for lunch.  He didn’t only recommend an awesome pub (The Hairy Lemon) but he actually walked us over there and requested a table to us!  If that’s not customer service, I don’t know what is!! He remembered all four of our names every time he saw us and also remembered where we were from.  He and my dad talked about music a lot.  He always made sure we knew how to get to wherever we were going and gave us recommendations when we weren’t sure where to head to next.  He is a very special man and I’ve never had customer service like that before.  What a wonderful asset he is to the Brooks hotel!  

Overall, a wonderful boutique hotel in a great location!  Brooks hotel and Connor, we will see you again next time we head to Dublin!",5,2013,08,16
236,"Good Hotel, in a very nice location","It is a boutique hotel, located near the Dublin Castle, Temple Bar and other tourist sites.
Breakfast is not the best I've ever had, must be improved.
Room very nice, spacious, but needs a paint on the walls, they looked dirty and unmaintained.
Bathroom is very good, large with separate bath and shower. Looked recently refurbished.
In an overhall, I recommend this place.",4,2013,08,16
236,Customer service at its best,"Lovely hotel albeit slightly dated and rather small rooms.  The room is lacking a few amenities that are such as a proper ironing board / iron in the room and mini bar. The iron that was brought from housekeeping was ancient, with no steam capability.  

That said, the customer service is excellent - when I got sick in the middle of the night and needed a few things brought to the room, the night manager went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. 

Beware of asking for add'l bottles of water, as I thought they were complimentary but only the two bottles in your room are free - add'l (tiny!) bottles of water cost 3EUR each !",4,2013,08,15
236,Best Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is very special in which I insist on staying when I am in Dublin. Its a boutique hotel that has a special ambiance that I love, The great thing about the hotel its in the central to Grafton Street for shopping and Temple Bar for a few drinks. Also the rooms are spacious with all the requirements needed for a short break. In the morning you will be served a delicious breakfast ready for your day in Dublin. Thank you Brooks another lovely stay see you next year!",5,2013,08,14
236,Fine Choice,"Very impressed with this hotel during our one night recent stay. Nice room with comfy beds and extremely pleasant staff. Great location with plenty of dining options plus Grafton Street is nearby. 
Breakfast was nice with plenty of choices at the buffet, a bit pricey but we were in at the height of the summer. A fine choice among many spectacular hotels in Dublin, our first choice was unavailable but this never felt like a second.",4,2013,08,13
236,AT LAST MANAGED TO STAY AT BROOKS HOTEL,"Been going to the Dublin Horse Show every year for the last 33 years in the past few years friends of ours have stayed at the Brooks and have raved about it. On our arrival we are met with the friendly face of Connor the doorman who is a well known character, the room was very nice and the air-con was working perfectly as it was a warm spell Dublin was having, breakfast was very good and you can basically get what you want, all the staff were very well dressed and doing their jobs to a very high standard as well as smiling and being very accommodating. The hotel is perfectly situated within walking distance of Graften Street and nice restaurants, we will stay there from now on and its good value for money.",5,2013,08,13
236,"Phenomenal hospitality, location and accommodations","We arrived very early from our very long international flights. We arrived at brooks just hoping to leave our luggage but we were welcomed in and given a comfy parlor to wait in until a room became available. Once we got in a room, very early, it was welcoming and cozy. 
In addition to the extraordinary welcome and accommodations the the location was ideal just a block off graffton street. Another highlight of this fabulous find is the over the top breakfast buffet with full irish breakfast.  What can I say?  What could be better?",5,2013,08,10
236,Nice hotel in great location,"Stayed for two nights in August 2013. Great location in the centre, very close to the pedestrian area,Temple Bar and the major attractions. Very little street noise, possible to sleep with the window open. Has A/C, but I did not need it. WiFi worked well. Good selection of food at breakfast, price 10 euros. Friendly staff.",4,2013,08,10
236,Absolutely fantastic hotel!,"There are so many wonderful things to say about this hotel, I'm not sure where to start!  The customer service is exceptional.  Every single person associated with this hotel is excellent at their job, polite, friendly, smiling.  The beds are very comfortable, the showers are hot with fantastic water pressure!  The A/C makes the rooms very comfortable.  The location within Dublin is absolutely unbeatable.  Everything was within easy walking distance.  

We stayed in two different rooms at the hotel.  They were both Classic rooms.  The first was an unrenovated Classic.  It was small with outdated furniture (a bit like a college dormitory).  There was not much storage.  However, it did have coziness & charm.  There were huge, wonderful windows that opened onto the street & let in a lot of the atmosphere of the city.  Our room happened to be across the street from a restaurant/pub that could be quite loud if the window was open.  However, the soundproofing in the unrenovated room was stunning!  100% of all the noise was blocked from that room with the window closed.  The curtains also blocked out all light.  As well, we stayed in a renovated Classic room.  The renovated room was very large & roomy and updated quite nicely.  There was a lot of closet and drawer space.  The soundproofing and light blockage from the curtains were very good- well within and above acceptable standards- but they did not block the light or sound at 100%  as they did in the unrenovated room.  

We feel we lucked out by having chosen this hotel.  It met or exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be returning to this hotel on our next trip to Dublin!",4,2013,08,08
236,A Night away,"What a wonderful stay we had at Brooks, right in the heart of Dublin, the streets nearby so vibrant with Dublin city life and a sound night sleep to boot. After beating the streets of Dublin we had a foot spa delivered to our room just to revitalise our tired feet. Our thanks to all the friendly staff that made our stay so enjoyable. We'll be back",5,2013,08,06
236,outstanding staff and super location,"The entire staff are helpful and friendly. Breakfast is excellent. The location is perfect for touring Dublin. We were able to use the bus to and from the airport as the stops are quite near. Request a room in  the back side if street noise would be a problem for you.It can be noisy (we were there on week-end nights) Be advised, rooms in the back do cost more. We would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,08,05
236,Great staff but make sure the AC works,"I arrived early and my room wasn't ready.  No problem, I was able to store my bag and I figured I didn't need to check the room first.  Rookie mistake.  When I returned at midnight and entered my room it was like walking into a blast furnace.  The air conditioning was blowing out hot air and undoubtably had been doing so all day and all night until I opened the door. 

I went back down to the front desk and they said that they didn't have any more suites available but that they would send up a fan.  I went back to my room, opened the sliding doors and waited.  30 minutes later, no fan.  I packed up my things and went back to reception.  They said they couldn't find a fan.  I was pretty tired and frustrated at this point so I asked to be put in any room that had air conditioning.  They moved me to a standard room that was wonderfully cool and perfectly acceptable and I belatedly got to sleep.

The staff were very pleasant through all this and refunded the difference in price between the rooms but it was still an inconvenience I didn't need after a really hard day.

As other reviewers note, the hotel is in the middle of town.  In the middle of the pub and party district to be exact so if you want to get any sleep at all on a Friday or Saturday night you had best bring earplugs or get a room facing away from the street.  Sirens and loud drunks are the night-time symphony.",3,2013,08,04
236,Superb service and location,"The staff at Brooks Hotel particularly the front desk are very courteous, friendly and most helpful. Their hospitality is exceptional compared to other hotels we have stayed at. Our room was delightful, spacious and very clean with many convenient amenities. The breakfast was also outstanding. The location is perfect for walking about Dublin. If we were to return to Dublin, this would be our first choice of hotel. Commendation to the entire staff. ",5,2013,08,01
236,A haven of calm in a buzzing city,"We arrived at Brook's Hotel quite early from another city centre hotel...being a receptionist I feared the reaction of the girl behind the desk as I requested to check-in far earlier than the normal check-in time!I think her name may have been Eve?A very pleasant young lady who immediately checked to see if there was a room available...hey presto our room was ready and she informed us that we availed of an exceptional upgrade which we really appreciate.We were offered information on the city with a map indicating all the streets and monuments to be seen...we were shown the way to our room which was beautiful,chic and modern yet with lots of characterizing traditional antiques...the bathroom was a touch of class with a tv built into the bath walls (I would pay the supplement for this type of room for that alone!)the beds were lovely and high with a superior quality of linen to guarantee a good night's sleep...(there was also a pillow menu to meet everybody's needs)the freshly cut fruit and yoghurt as well as delicious pastries were a delight in the morning...I'm looking forward to my next trip to Dublin to stay in this city centre gem!Satisfaction guaranteed!",5,2013,07,31
236,Brooks Hotel in Dublin - In the center of it all,"The hotel is in the middle of everything. Close to the bus, rail and tram lines.  The hotel is around the corner from the pedestrian mall.  The restaurant serves typical Irish food and it is very good.  The staff is great.  The rooms are very well kept and the hotel staff will assist with every need.  We had a special situation and it was well taken care of.  If I were in Dublin again this hotel would be my first choice.  The concierge (both of them) were great as were the desk clerks.",5,2013,07,31
236,"Great, Quiet Location and Efficient Service","My mother and I arrived desperately jetlagged at 9a.m., which unfortunately was far too early to check in. I had emailed in advance to see if it would be possible and they couldn't guarantee it, and alas it wasn't. However, the concierge was beyond helpful and friendly. He stored our bags, gave us a map pointing out items of interest and directed us to the lounge to refresh and recoup. We ventured out to explore Dublin, returning deliriously exhausted around 1:30p.m., and even though it was still early to check in, a quiet room was made ready.

Unfortunately Ireland was experiencing an unprecedented heatwave and the AC just couldn't handle it. The hotel provided a fan and then eventually moved us to another much cooler room. Their suggestion, not mine! When we arrived to the new room, the concierge had our bags, I had the fan, and three members of housekeeping (including the supervisor) were in the room outfitting the beds to our specifications (no feathers and no wool blankets.) Just exceptional. 

We ordered room service: Guinness Stew, Seafood Chowder and a dessert from the restaurant menu (not the room service menu). All was delicious and Mom declared at the end of the trip that The Brooks' chowder was the best she had in Ireland. Not ""hotel"" food at all.

The only quibble I have is that they charged me a portage fee for moving rooms. Given that I had already tipped the concierge, this seemed duplicative and unnecessary. Overall, I highly recommend this centrally-located hotel and its friendly, efficient staff.",4,2013,07,30
236,Brooks Hotel.   A Perfect Place To Stay.,"Just spent a week end in this lovely boutique hotel,  Very central for shopping and sighseeing in dublin city. Stayed here  before and deceided to pay another visit,  as we were very impresed with the service we received on our last visit. The staff are fantastic and very profesional. Food is amazing and rooms are great, priced to suit all budgets just great value for money. Car park across from front entance with reduced rates for guests. Its a member of [Small Luxuary Hotels Of The World] Give it a try you wont be disapointed. 

                                  Gena.",5,2013,07,29
236,Perfect location and nice friendly service,"Very short trip so we wanted to make the most of it, this friendly hotel right near Grafton and all the action. Rooms small but nicely appointed and clean. Mostly friendly staff some more knowledgable than others. Would go back.",5,2013,07,22
236,Great Hotel for Families.,We loved our stay at the Brooks hotel. Very good location for seeing all the sites in the central city. You have to email the hotel if you want to book a room for families (with a separate twin bed). The staff were great and the hotel is a real gem.  I highly recommend.,5,2013,07,22
236,A Gem in Downtown Dublin With Amazing Staff,"An elegant boutique style hotel in downtown Dublin within walking distance to all the sites, shopping on Grafton Street, the Temple Bar pubs, the Guinness Factory and the Train station. The rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and immaculate. The dining area is first class and the breakfasts are excellent with many choices of hot and cold. What really made our stay at The Brooks was the friendly helpful staff. From the front desk staff who were efficient and made you feel very welcome to the dining room staff who made every effort to ensure everything was perfect to Connor, the elegant Concierge dressed in tails who made our stay even more personalized by remembering our names and knowing many things about Canada. The Brooks was our base for our travels around Ireland. I highly recommend The Brooks and will definitely stay again when we are next in Dublin.",5,2013,07,21
236,Super Little Hotel,"In a first class location, in a really nice part of the city this hotel is a quiet unassuming quite luxurious surprise. My room was an exec room with some nice little touches - wives would definitely like the decor. It is very classy but feminine which is a nice break from the corporate boxes i usually stay in. My bathroom was a little tired but it was spotless and the products were 5 star which is something a lot of hotels have started scrimping on lately. The hotel has a classy bar and what looks to be a really busy restaurant which given all the local options is obviously a good sign. Breakfast was absolutely first class. Bricher muesli and my usual tester of two poached eggs was a joy - cooked perfectly. Genuinely the breakfast set up is as good as say the Ritz Carlton or Aghadoe Heights ( which are the best of the best IMHO ). Additional bits like excellent free wifi, ice box like in room AC and a good deal with the carpark across the road make this hotel a must visit for the clever traveller.",5,2013,07,21
236,Impossible to sleep,"The pubs and clubs nearby make it impossible to sleep. The music and shouting went on until after 2 am and then the drunks continued to make noise until 3 am. It is a shame because the hotel itself is lovely and the staff is very nice but the lack of sleep totally ruined my stay.,I will not stay here again and I cannot recommend this hotel.",2,2013,07,21
236,Top marks,"Perfect location for shopping, restaurants, pubs etc. excellent breakfast. Staff very friendly. Nice welcoming, relaxing hotel in the heart of Dublin. Parking directly accross the street. Would recommend. ",5,2013,07,20
236,A great hotel in a great location,"We were very happy staying at the Brooks on a recent visit to Dublin. Our hotel room was very comfortable, and nicely decorated. The staff at the Brooks were to a person very pleasant and helpful. The hotel was small and felt cozy, but had all the amenities we desired. The breakfasts were excellent, especially the homemade brown bread (and they will give you the recipe). The location is excellent as the hotel is near all kinds of attractions, but tucked away on a side street where things are a bit quieter and calmer. We stayed seven nights and had an executive room which gave us a little more space. I would say the extra cost was well worth it - on our way back through Dublin after going to Galway we stayed one more night and booked a regular room and it was quite nice, but appreciably smaller. It was also on the street side. The weather was very warm and so the nearby restaurants and pubs had a lot of customers seated or standing around outside, and it was noisy until we closed the window and put on the AC. With the window closed, it was fine. Our room we had the previous week was on the back side of the hotel and we found it much quieter. there isn't much of a view on the back side, but it you like quiet I'd recommend it. I will definitely stay at the Brooks when I go back to Dublin.",5,2013,07,19
236,Wonderful,My husband and I stayed at the Brooks hotel in early June and could not have been happier about our stay. We booked a classic double room but it was really more of a suite with a sitting area and separate walk in closet/office. The hotel offers nice touches such as turndown service and classical music playing on the vintage looking radio in the room when you walk in. We cannot vouch for the food as we did not eat here but the location was very good and the bed very comfortable. It was very quiet and was a great place to unwind after a long day of walking all over Dublin. We would certainly recommend this hotel or stay here again.,5,2013,07,16
236,A great find in Dublin!,"A couple of months ago a friend of mine recommended Brooks Hotel in Dublin when I travel for business. I have tried quite a few other hotels but by far this is my favourite! 
It is perfect for both business and leisure. It is clean and the rooms are roomy and nicely decorated. The staff is what makes the hotel better than the others, they are so helpful and absolutely lovely. There are not many hotels where you feel so welcome and I would recommend it to anyone who is planning a Dublin trip. The location is ideal and St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, pubs and restaurants are all within comfortable walking distance.
To get you started in the morning they have a cold buffet and you can order hot foods, it will all set you up nicely for the day, I recommend their soda bread, one of my Irish food favorites! 
When you are done sightseeing and shopping the hotel bar is an ideal place to sit down, rest your feet and sip a glass (or two) of chilled white wine or try one of their cocktails. The bar is also a great place to meet before dinner and a perfect for a catch up with a friend.",4,2013,07,15
236,Practically Perfect,"We wish that we had been able to stay many more nights at the Brooks Hotel.  It is in walking distance of dozens of restaurants and shops plus the major destinations like Trinity College, Connolly Street, and the museums. Arriving from eight time zones away with jet lag, we found the lower floor sitting room was fantastic -- a place where one could read or use the computers at any hour of the day or night. They even provide reading glasses! Also, we were happy that the hotel accommodated our last-minute shift in plans without any trouble and we were warmly greeted upon arrival.",5,2013,07,14
236,Ideal Dublin location,We recently spent two nights at the Brooks Hotel. We received the warmest of welcomes from Connor the concierge and the service we received from all the staff was outstanding. The rooms were very comfortable and the location was ideal for exploring the city. Francesca's restaurant was an excellent choice for both breakfast and dinner.,5,2013,07,09
236,Excellent hotel - highly recommended,"The hotel is well located in the center of Dublin for shopping and sightseeing.  The staff were very friendly, warm and helpful and not so formal and cold like some hotels can be. Besides other helpful interactions, my wife left a pair of shoes in our room when we checked out and after a couple of emails, they were waiting for us at the front desk a week later when we were departing Ireland. The rooms were very nice, comfortable and cozy - no complaints. While not inexpensive, it was a great value compared to other similar high-end hotels in the center of Dublin. The only two minor issues we encountered were that they were not able to accommodate our early check-in request (most hotels can't guarantee it) and once we did get checked in later in the day it took a couple of additional calls down to the front desk in order to get our bags delivered from storage. For us these were just minor issues and overall I would highly recommend the hotel.",5,2013,07,08
236,Nice boutique hotel in central location near lots of good eateries.,"Great breakfast in very plush hotel, centrally placed. Pleasant, quiet bar and amiable staff. Nicely fitted out, spacious rooms.  Residents lounge a quiet retreat. Walking distance from Grafton St and Guinness brewery, attractions in their own right. Felt it was a bit pricy.",4,2013,07,07
236,Extremely lovely and cosy,"Stayed in Deluxe room in the Brooks Hotel in January during the business meeting in Brussels. The hotel is nicely located in the center of Dublin, close to main attractions - but on a rather quiet street. The hotel itself is really good. Reception staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and very lovely decorated. The bed was truly comfortable and I slept like a baby. 
No need to say the room and the bathroom was clean and nice. It was also warm, despite many hotels in Central Europe being rather chilly. Loved the room. 

The breakfast was also good. Nothing extraordinary, but still good.

The place is definitely pricey. My room was around 200 euros for a night. However, the price is OK taking into account the quality, location and service provided.",5,2013,07,06
236,A warm Irish welcome,"We booked 4 nights at Brooks based on location and Tripadvisor reviews. The location was just perfect, on a relatively quiet street, close to everywhere you may like to go in Dublin, with a variety of shops and restaurants/bars very close by. Although Brooks is not our usual style of hotels, since we prefer rather modern and design ones,  it was very good, clean, standard room was relatively large, amenities were available. One problem we encountered regularly though was the temperature and pressure of the shower water, which sort of went up and down, while we were under it,  rather annoying. However, what we will remember the most about the Brooks is the wonderfully warm welcome we received upon our arrival and the great dedication of the staff to respond to our request. It was exemplary Irish hospitality.",4,2013,07,05
236,"For Dublin, a great place to stay","We had just one night before our visit to Ireland ended, so to be in a luxury room, with a real good water pressure shower, a huge comfy bed with down comforter and temperature room control made us feel so good. Clean rooms, great lobby area, excellent 5 star breakfast services. Small but intimate lounge area.  The service they offered by calling us a cab in advance, to wake up call, to lounge service was impeccable for Dublin.  I only wish they had told us to take more time to be at the airport as we almost missed our flight. We went 2.5 hours in advance, but to go through pre-clearance and customs takes 1.75 hours alone. Air Lingus lines were extremely terribly long to start with. We only wished the hotel had told us in advance to allow for more time, say like 3.5 hours needed for jus back to the US travelers.",4,2013,07,04
236,Irish Eyes were Smiling,"Immediately upon arrival we were greeted by the wonderful Concierge Connor.  After checking in and finding out our room wasn't ready yet - we arrived earlier than expected Connor sat us down, went through a few options for our next day, and sent us down to the Hairy Lemon pub next door for an very good lunch.  The rooms are on the smaller side but fairly standard for most hotels I've stayed in while in Ireland and Europe.  The hotel has a high end feel that doesn’t dent your pocketbook too much.  The turn-down service with chocolates was a nice touch.  The hotel is situated a short walk away from St. Stephens Green and provides easy access to the Hop on, Hop off bus tour around Dublin.  The breakfast offered provided many options including Porridge with a dash of whiskey, chocolate croissants, and poached eggs. The gnocchi for dinner was surprisingly exceptional!  I would stay at the Brooks Hotel again in a heartbeat!",4,2013,07,04
236,"Great location, decent hotel, a few quirks","We booked this room for only one night, mostly based on its location.  The location can't be beat -- parking right across the street and main sights like the castle, Trinity College, and Temple Bar all located within easy walking distance.  Unfortunately, the hotel didn't have a record of our reservation, made through SLH.com, but they honored the rate for the deluxe room.  The room we were shown to was large and very nice, but it turned out the air conditioning wasn't working.  The hotel then moved us to another room, just as nice, but again the air conditioning didn't work.  They finally moved us to another room, with working A/C.  Unfortunately, this room seemed to be one of the few not renovated or it possibly was not a deluxe room.  I was rather disappointed in the difference in the room, particularly given the price, but preferred being comfortable on a rather warm evening in Dublin.  Overall, the hotel was good, great location, and I can't fault the hotel for their responsiveness... Just a shame about the A/C not working.",3,2013,07,03
236,A warm Irish welcome,"The Brooks Hotel was a great place for us to begin our first visit to Ireland.  Although the hotel is pretty big (about 200 rooms, I believe), it has a boutique hotel feel to it.  It is very well located in a part of Dublin that makes it possible for you to easily walk to many of the sights and places of interest.  Our room was very comfy and they serve a delicious breakfast that you can enjoy by the windows, which look out onto the street. We received a very warm welcome from the concierge, Connor O'Connell, who is without a doubt the most gracious concierge we have ever met in our many years of traveling.  Mr. O'Connell is so friendly, kind and warm: he immediately asked for our names and remembered them (and us) throughout our visit.  We got the impression that he was always eager to do anything he could to ensure that our visit was all that we wished for.  The rest of the staff was also very helpful and worked hard to help us feel welcome.  We were traveling with another couple and I know they experienced the same warm greeting.  The hotel has a giant area on the lower level where you can relax (for hours, or all day) that is akin to a super-nice living room, which was perfect for us since we arrived hours before the regular check in time.  There is also a small workout facility, which looked fairly well-equipped, and seemed to be the exception rather than the rule in the hotels we stayed in in Ireland.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone- the staff is excellent, the facilities high quality, and the location- first rate.",4,2013,06,30
236,Good location. Modern and clean.,"Nice hotel in a good location.  Not quite as good as I was expecting. The bed was nice.The room was clean. The breakfast we payed for didn't start until 8 AM on weekends. We had to leave for the airport before that time. On checkout the front desk clerk tried to charge me for someone else's room. It took 5 minutes to sort that out. The shower curtain did not hold the water in very well so my wife and I both caused an unavoidable flood with each shower. Minor complaints, but annoying none the less.  Would stay here again.",4,2013,06,30
236,Perfect Choice,"My wife and I spent 4 nights at Brooks Hotel Dublin. Our stay far exceeded our expectations. All the staff coud not have been more helpful and pleasant. The location for us was ideal, being very central, and the bedroom, restaurant and bar were all excellent. As we were touring Ireland by car parking was a serious consideration when selecting our hotel, and in this case I doubt we could not have chosen better. We would certaintly stay here again.",5,2013,06,27
236,Back to Brooks Hospitality,"We were back to Brooks Hotel Dublin for the May Bank Holiday holiday visit for  Ireland's Bloom Garden Festival. We were thrilled to get a room for the busy holida.y weekend and we were so well look after from the caring staff.
On this occasion we attended a classic film show in their in house deluxe cinema that was for us a first night for a great weekends in Dublin.
Breakfast at Brooks is a great experience and a food spectacular that one will have to travel far to better, we will be back later on this year.
   Kind regards to a wonderful staff.
      Sean Horkan, Castlebar.",5,2013,06,26
236,Welcome respite in Dublin,"My partner, sister, and a close friend spent 5 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin recently. We were treated to a warm, friendly, professional staff and gracious surroundings right in the center of Dublin. There were some mechanical issues in one room, one afternoon so the desk staff allowed us to use another room close by until a room next to ours could be made ready. We were not inconvenienced at all. From the Irish breakfast each morning to a night cap in the bar each night, we felt so welcome. The room was tastefully decorated and had small refrigerator and safe inside cabinets. The location was just blocks from the river and central tourist destinations. The concierge kiosk & staff were extremely helpful.  It was certainly a good value for our American dollars.",5,2013,06,26
236,Brooks Hotel,"This Hotel delivered everything it promised.   From the moment of arrival we were made especially welcome at Reception and by the Concierge, Conor.  Our room was spacious and spotless.  Everything we needed was supplied, including toiletries, which is a rarity nowadays. Room service was prompt and pleasant.
The location is great for anybody visiting central Dublin, and the whole city centre is within comfortable walking distance. 
Food in the bar and restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced. On top of this, there are several very good bars and restaurants just around every corner.
All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay and will be back.",5,2013,06,25
236,Great time at the Brooks,"This hotel is in an ideal position. Walking distance to Trinity College and to the pick up points to collect your bus if going on a day tour. The room was very comfortable, the only negative would be the towels were well used and need to perhaps be changed for softer ones. The staff were so friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Breakfast was very good and the dinner menu was also very good. We would come to this hotel again, when in Dublin.",5,2013,06,24
236,Overpriced,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night, the rooms were nice, but the corridors very narrow., i was staying here on business which my employers paid for which i think it hd an impact on how i was treated, when arriving at the reception the lady was very nice however the first thing she said is we have a dress code, how can you tell guests what to wear when they are paying you over 250 euros per night to stay there, secondly my employers had put a tab for my food and drink, only to be told again that my tab could only be spent on food but no drink, again i was puzzled i am paying you a lot of money and you are telling me what i have to do?? Go down to dinner and order the chicken which was 26 euros what came on the plate was an absolute disgrace for the money, it was 1 piece of small chicken and i mean small with a slither of gravy over it and that was it no vegetables and no potatoes an absolute rip off, breakfast was absolute chaos with everyone running around like headless chickens, i was asked what i would like, i asked for 2 pieces of bacon, poached egg, toast and some mushrooms but no tomatoes, what did i get no bacon, poached egg which was the size of a 50 pence piece, 1 mushroom, a triangle of toast that was gone in one bite and tomatoes, a total shambles. This hotel is in a good location for bars and shops, the concierge were great but too many rules and regulations and over priced for what you got.",3,2013,06,24
236,Irish hospitality at its best,"Top-knotch hotel from front office staff to housekeeping.  Everyone at the Brooks Hotel was friendly, accomodating, and willing to assist you in any way possible.  The hotel is centrally located with some excellent restaurants, and of course pubs nearby. The rooms were fairly spacious with a large closet, however the beds were not super comfortable, but the pillows were.  They provide a pillow service where you can pick the type of pillow you prefer throughout your stay.  There were some issues with our shower, but they were resolved immediately, and the hotel manager even sent us a note.  That was impressive and appreciated.",4,2013,06,24
236,"Great for bussiness, maybe less for leisure","I find it hard to rate this hotel. On a bussiness trip with a single night stay I would rate it as ""excellent"". But after 3 nights on a holiday trip I have some doubts.

The hotel is situated in the center of Dublin and most main attractions are only a 10min walk away. It has no own parking place but the St Green paking is only 200m away (take care the Dury Street parking is expensive)

The rooms are large enough without being really spacious. All comfort is available but to get a power outlet you have to get on your knees and unplug the TV. The bathroom offers a nice enlarging mirror but if you take a shower be aware of fluctuating pressure and temperature.

At breakfast we got fresh juice, a nice buffet and cooked plates. The only problem seemed to be the organisation of the staff. It was simply chaotic.

To relax and enjoy a drink, don't go to the bar or lounge of the hotel. You will be surrounded by laptop tapping intensively discussing bussines people. Not relaxing at all.

Most of the staff was hotel-friendly, luckily some genuine Dublners made us feel relaxed.

One last advise: avoid room 101. The airco outlets can make a lot of noise.",4,2013,06,24
236,Excellence in Dublin,"My husband, two-year old and I stay in the Brooks for two nights in June.  The service was excellent from the check-in to the housekeeping.  The breakfast that was included was fantastic!  We are looking forward to going back.",5,2013,06,23
236,Lovely hotel but with serious problems.,"The rooms are lovely, with quirky artwork. The bed was firm but very comfortable. There were two cosy armchairs with a table between them. There was ample desk space, plenty of clothes storage, and a decent amount of vanity space in the bathroom. The restaurant had great food, the bar had great whiskeys, and the staff were so lovely, helpful and friendly. The location was brilliant, just a short walk from busy, buzzy Grafton St. And it was reasonably priced.

It should have been the perfect hotel but it wasn’t, for three major reasons:

1.	The air conditioning did not work. We stayed in two rooms in this hotel and in both the air conditioning would appear to work, but not very well, for about ten minutes, then it would show an error in the system although the fan still appeared to be working. The first room we had was 25°C most of the time. Opening the window didn’t seem to make much difference even though it was cool outside. Our second room, after a few days touring, was even hotter, reaching 28°C on the last night, which was unbearable and I got very little sleep that night. We complained to staff on both stays but nothing was done and I believe the whole hotel air conditioning system was faulty.

2.	There was no power point available for guest use. Furthermore the hotel had two different types of power points, some with round pins, and some with square pins which we had an adaptor for. The only power point that was easily accessible, with a light plugged into it, was a round pin one. We had to crawl under the desk and unplug the TV so that we could charge our phones, camera battery, and computer.

3.	The shower fluctuated, both in pressure and in temperature. In our first room the fluctuation was minor, just a brief cold burst every few seconds. However in our second room, a floor higher, the fluctuation was much worse, particularly the pressure. This shower was not one to be enjoyed!

We are so disappointed with this hotel, it’s so beautifully appointed but there are obviously serious problems with the infrastructure. Sadly, we do not recommend this hotel.",2,2013,06,23
236,Perfect location & Cozy atmosphere,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 1 night in mid-June. We arrived around 12, and check in wasn't until 2pm but were able to do a pre-check-in and leave our bags behind while we went exploring.

The room was lovely. Not huge, but comfortable. The bed was amazing, slept really well! You get a choice of pillows but we were happy with the ones we had. The decor is funky but nice. The bathroom isn't quite as nice as the bedroom itself, but perfectly adequate.
The hotel bar is cozy as well and the staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful. The girl at reception even remembered which room we'd had when we checked out the next morning which I thought was impressive and added a nice personal touch.

We had the continental breakfast in the morning and were happy with the selection. Make sure you ask for strong coffee as we had to send ours back when it looked more like weak tea... 

The location is ideal, it's walking distance to everything in central Dublin and this was the main reason we chose this hotel. I'm not sure about parking, I think you get discounted rates at a parking garage across the road, but on Sunday it didn't seem to open until about 10am so make sure you're not in need of an early get-away if you park there!",4,2013,06,22
236,Great Hotel Great Staff,"If you are looking for a hotel with charm, staff friendly, great location, great shower, great breakfast look no further Brooks Hotel Dublin I put all our clients into this hotel they always rave about this hotel.

236,Fifteenth trip to Dublin; first stay at the Brooks,"My 10 friends and I traveled to Dublin in January for a weekend pub crawl.  I had never stayed at the Brooks before, but the price was right for all of my traveling companions.  We arrived early morning, and although our rooms were not available, we were very warmly welcomed and our luggage was quickly stored.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.  Tea and coffee making facilities were well stocked (and refilled).  Plenty of towels.   The doorman could not have been more friendly and remembered us by name throughout our trip.  Everyone at the front desk and in the restaurant was friendly and accommodating.  We arranged a Whiskey Tasting for the group and it was the highlight of our trip.  I cannot recommend the Brooks enough for affordable luxury in the middle of everything in Dubln",5,2013,06,20
236,Ireland 2013,"This is the first time I had stayed at Brooks Hotel, initially we thought we were lucky to have our Aer Lingus flight land so early, we would be able to start our vacation quickly, however what we did not plan on was not being able to check in to the hotel so early. this was not the hotels fault however! We did arrive on Sunday and the hotel was fully booked, nobody checking out early either!! Oh well! the staff made us as comfortable as they could, gave us coffee and allowed us to wait and have a nap, in the downstairs residents lounge. So after several local walks and attending church we got out rooms. From then on all went well. The staff were a delight, the doorman was a charming old Dubliner and breakfast was worth looking forward to every day!
the rooms are a little small but the cheery and helpful staff make up for that with ease. Nice stay I would recommend this hotel for its staff, cleanliness and central location.",5,2013,06,19
236,Fantastic hotel,We recently stayed at the brooks for 2 nights and it was fab. The service from the moment we arrived was fantastic. Rooms were lovely. The concierge Connor was a real gem he suggested a little restaurant called darwins around the corner which was also family run and was fantastic! And a little place around the corner called taste was great for breakfast and light lunches! I definatly recommend this hotel and its central location was great close enough to everything but quiet at night! They also offer a pillow menu so you can pick whichever type of pillow you prefer for no charge and for those tired feet at the end of the day they offer foot spas to ur room!,5,2013,06,16
236,Wonderful property,Front desk service - wonderful.  We arrived from our flight via a bus and a short walk about 8am.  The front desk greeted us warmly and stored our baggage until the check in time.  Gave us a key to the downstairs lounge so that we could refresh ourselves from the long flight from the US.  Very nice location for walking almost anywhere.  Seems to be a very safe area.  Lovely little coffee shop just across the street with pastries to die for.  Lots of choices in coffees and teas.  The Brooks is near the Hairy Lemon Pub so grabbing a bite to eat is easy.  Definitely recommend this hotel for anyone exploring the city center of Dublin.,5,2013,06,15
236,Top marks for Brooks,"Our recent 2 night stay in Brooks simply wasn't long enough.  It really was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for a long time.  The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful and especially Conor, the concierge, who really was a star.  It is within easy walking distance of central Dublin.  The rooms were comfortable and well appointed and it was quiet for a city centre hotel.  The food both at breakfast time and in the evening was first class.  I can't wait to go back.  Although I was staying there with a friend, I wouldn't hesitate to go back there and stay on my own.",5,2013,06,13
236,"Great hotel, great location",The Brooks is a great place to stay if you want to be in Dublin city centre.  The staff is friendly and extremely helpful.  The rooms are nice and comfortable.  It is a little more expensive but well worth it.,5,2013,06,09
236,"Nice place, good location","We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for two nights in May.  The hotel is very well located - walking distance to Trinity College and the hop on hop off bus stops there, plus close to many restaurants, shops and other places, including the visitor center.  The room was good sized and had a ""pillow menu"" with a choice of options.  The front desk staff were very helpful and recommended an excellent restaurant close by for dinner.  Overall, a nice place that we would return to.",4,2013,06,08
236,Dublin break,"Stopped at Brooks hotel for three nights and was perfect in every way . Central location , lovely rooms and great friendly staff. We booked bed and breakfast and have to say the breakfast was first class , something for everyone's taste. Couldn't fault this hotel , definitely recommend .",5,2013,06,08
236,Fabulous Hotel,"We arrived in Dublin early in morning  6am. Took a cab to Brooks Hotel. We were told our room was not ready, but we were escorted to the lounge and served tea. Also our luggage was stored for us. We went upstairs and attended the fabulous breakfast buffet. We walked around for a bit in St Stephens Green, a gorgeous park. When we returned to the hotel around 9am we were told by Connor that our room was ready!!!. We so needed to hear that. We so needed a nap. Great staff. Great location. Good start to a great time in Ireland.",5,2013,06,08
236,Fabulous hotel,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  The staff was wonderfully friendly and helpful.  I think the breakfast buffet is the best I've ever experienced, besides the fact that it includes a cooked breakfast as well.

We've visited Dublin 5 times in the last 15 years and we have always stayed in the Temple Bar in the past...now that we have entered our 40's, we appreciated the quiet of the neighborhood near St Stephen's Green, still close enough to walk to the Temple Bar area for some nightlife but far enough away to get some sleep as well.",5,2013,06,06
236,Location is Everything!," First time back in Dublin in years, our old favorite hotel gone down the tubes so we were looking for a new favorite, and we found it. From the minute Connor the concierge opened the door for us, I was at ease. Steps from Grafton Street, the tourist office and great pubs and restaurants the Brooks was perfect and perfect for our needs. The room was great, though the view lacked a bit (but it's what I would expect from an urban hotel) but the room was comfy and stylishly decorated. The ONLY hitch was the morning I wanted a cold glass of water from the bathroom and all that came was hot... weird, I know! Next time I am looking for a great Dublin hotel, it's the Brooks for me!",5,2013,06,01
236,Great Stay at The Brooks Hotel,"We just got home from a 2 week trip to the UK. Our last 4 nights were in Dublin at The Brooks Hotel. It was a perfect end to our trip. The hotel is centrally located in the south city centre. We could walk just about everywhere. There was no shortage of shops and restaurants. Our room was very nicely decorated, clean and had plenty of room for three adults. The bathroom was even spacious. The beds were very comfortable. We had a room in the back of the hotel, not much of a view, but it was very quiet. Our rate included a free full, made-to-order breakfast, in addition to the continental breakfast. It was very nice and saved us a lot of money. I would recommend having that included. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Marvin and Conor were there if you needed them for ideas of where to go and what to do. We ended every evening in the lounge for drinks and dessert and the bartender was always friendly and happy to see us. I would highly recommend The Brooks Hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2013,05,31
236,"Fabulous hotel, shame about the a/c","Stayed at Brooks for two nights the weekend of the Dublin Writers Festival.  The hotel was just as the other reviewers said, friendly staff, nice breakfast, free wifi etc but there was a problem with the air conditioning in the room.  The room was like a sauna when I arrived, the thermostat said it was at 26 degrees C, which I could believe.  So I put the ac on.... A while later it was still at 26 so I phoned reception, who said they could adjust it for me.  They said it would take at least 10 minutes and as I was going out, I wasn't worried.  Unfortunately, when I got back at 11:30pm it was still too hot. I phoned again, and again at 2 am.  I opened the window during this time but not only was it very noisy, it didn't really make any difference.  Needless to say, I had a terrible night but to my delight, the Brooks charming manager phoned the next morning and said I would be moved. As the hotel was fully booked, I ended up in a luxurious suite, with ac that worked perfectly....thank you Brooks!",4,2013,05,31
236,A great choice for central Dublin,"You are right in the heart of things at this hotel, but just around the corner from all the noise of Grafton St and its offshoots.  My decent-sized room on the top floor (606) meant I could look out front over the nearby rooftops and all was quiet, but the lower floors get a view of the vast grey car park opposite which is, though not unpleasant, hardly scenic. Service was very accommodating, and the room has an empty mini-fridge (instead of a pricey mini-bar), which proved very useful over my 5-day stay.  Nice bathroom with good shower pressure (though the temperature was a touch erratic).  Sleep-wise, my back is tough to please and it seemed to really like this bed.  Overall, could you fare much better?  Can't really see how.  Recommended.",4,2013,05,30
236,Good central hotel,"A great combination - good location in central Dublin. The rooms as very comfortable, nicely decorated with good facilities. The staff are friendly and seem genuinely interested in giving you good service. Free Wifi. Breakfast was very good - nice but small buffet selection but freshly made cooked options. Car parking straight across the street.",4,2013,05,29
236,Brooks is a great experience,"We started out somewhat concerned with the size of the room, but we were coming off of some of the best accommodations in the south and west of Ireland, and now we were in the heart of city center Dublin! It as close to everything, including the tourist attractions and the nightlife of Temple Bar, without being in the middle of it all.  The food and service was excellent, so I would easily recommend this to anyone wanting to enjoy the center of Dublin with ease. ",5,2013,05,24
236,Friendly staff but fight with bus travelers,"The hotel is in a great location in Dublin.  Parking is across the street - expensive (40 pounds/24 hours) but convenient.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  All seemed fine at first but quickly went downhill.  We had trouble with our room - no Wifi reception which we needed to plan our trip.  We had a hard time getting any assistance. When the manager finally verified the lack of reception, he changed our room. Unfortunately, we got a room with an extra bed, very cramped and uncomfortable. The bed is hard and the choice of pillows can't make up for that. In the morning, the breakfast was a chaotic stressful event. The travelers from the buses descended on the restaurant and it was a pushing, shoving frenzy. The food ran out and the wait staff were unable to keep up with the demand. It was hard to even get coffee served. We chose not to return to the Brooks for our return trip. It was not a pleasant stay",3,2013,05,24
236,A very nice stay at Brooks Hotel in Dublin,"We had a great stay at Brooks, very centrally located, close to Temple Bar area.  We had lovely rooms, beds were comfy, and the staff was extremely helpful. Our friend wasn't feeling well, and the waiters in the restaurant and bar immediately got us some milk and shortbread cookies, as her blood sugar was dropping. The next day, they remembered and asked how she was.  Conner filled us in on all kinds of suggestions about things to do.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,05,24
236,Great stay,This was a jumping place.  It is located within feet of the bustling Dublin streets in the heart of City Center where nightlife is raucous and youthful.  The service was excellent.  The rooms were clean and spacious.,4,2013,05,23
236,Dublin Vacation,"The hotel was beautiful and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and informative.  The work out room was a little difficult to use with the 24 key provided, but I'm sure there is a good reason for that.  The hotel is in a good location to walk to all of the popular attractions.  We enjoyed our stay and I would stay again at this hotel.  The breakfast and service was phenomenal!",5,2013,05,23
236,Comfortable Stay,"We spent 8 nights here in May 2013. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable and quiet and a choice of pillows was available  - that little extra touch of service - . Very good location, we were able to walk everywhere, sightseeing, and to a variety of restaurants and bars . A varied selection of food available for breakfast all very tasty. We did enjoy our stay.",5,2013,05,23
236,"Elegant Yet Affordable Luxury, a Five Star Experience!","We arrived in Ireland in the early morning hours.  The Brooks Hotel was our first experience of Irish hospitality.  The Concierge was superb!  Our room shouldn't have been available for hours.  We were jet-lagged and a little overwhelmed with our first overseas flight.  The Concierge got us into our room within 15 minutes and we were able to get a few hours sleep before our friends from Wicklow came to pick us up.

The room was beautiful and blissfully quiet, despite the hotel being completely booked.  Our room had crisp white linens, dark mahogany and brass finishes.  Pristinely clean with a lovely selection of fine teas.  Breakfast was served on fine linen with silver service.  A full Irish breakfast or the more European musili, fruit, soft cheese, coffee and tea were available...delicious and delightful to the senses.

My great grandfather left from Dublin in the 1860's and I was the first of our family to return.  At the Brooks, I felt like we were truly welcomed home. 
My favorite hotel in Ireland! ",5,2013,05,22
236,Very clean and comfortable.,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed at. Very comfy bed, and a choice of pillows - though the standard ones were fine for me. Quiet, despite a room at the front. Very good breakfast too. Centrally located and surrounded by a plethora of bars & restaurants to visit. I had no complaints at all.",5,2013,05,21
236,Warmest welcome and great location,"What a pleasure! The team couldn't be more welcoming from the minute you set foot inside the door, from Connor the concierge who gives great advice, remembers guests names and seems to be everywhere at once, to the front desk ladies- so calm and helpful. The full Irish Breakfast is a treat so try to make time for it. Rooms are comfortable, clean and pillow menu- an additional treat. The hotel is perfectly located for walking and exploring the surrounding Trinity Street, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, etc. and there are a lot odf great pubs nearby for a bit to eat. As great as the location is, and as comfortable as the hotel is, it's the warm Irish welcome of the team that is the standout feature of the hotel and that which most encourages people to linger just a little longer and consider a return visit before even leaving. Thanks to the team for a great stay!",5,2013,05,21
236,Location best in Dublin,"The two concierges greeted us with warmth and knowledge. The rooms were ideal and the hotel is in the perfect location for seeing the heart of Dublin. Breakfast was ample with a fabulous selection of breads , fruit cheeses and cold meats. A cooked breakfast is additional cost. Only glitch was other couple in our party had checked in and front desk had no record of it. We had to rely on Internet message that they were next door. The morning we left for the airport, was too early for breakfast so concierge made a special effort to get us tea and toast. It was a very good experience overall.",5,2013,05,19
236,Very pleasant stay!,"We stayed here our first two nights in Ireland (honeymoon), and will be back for our last two nights as well. The staff is wonderful, the breakfast was quick and delicious, and the location is fabulous—close to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and all the shopping, eating, and drinking you could want to do in Dublin.",5,2013,05,19
236,A sanctuary filled with Irish angels,"I can't recommend this hotel enough, nor compliment the Brooks staff—the entire staff—enough. We had an unexpected injury within hours of our arrival in Dublin and had to sit in the Emergency room of St James Hospital for 7 hours. Such a bad start to a vacation we planned for 5 months. I'm so glad I chose the Brooks Hotel after all my Trip Advisor research. Every Brooks employee went out of their way to make our 2-night stay comfortable, peaceful, and memorable and more so after they learned of the ER visit. They truly made us feel like a member of their family. The concierge, Connor, would not let us walk less than one mile to a restaurant that Bobby Flay reviewed because your ""mum is a noble lass and all, but she deserves a horse and carriage"" and insisted on called us a cab to drive us there. The manager, Tom, sat with us and charmed us with his sweet spirit and caring nature. And, Mairead, the young lady who was only a staff employee for 4 short days insisted on walking us to the nearest AirCoach stop so we wouldn't get lost, and actually pulled my Mom's luggage so she wouldn't be further encumbered. ANGEL! Beyond this, the breakfast was terrific. The dinner was OUTSTANDING. (seriously, the best goat cheese I ever enjoyed) and the rooms were immaculate and quiet. (Hotel is tucked away on a quiet side street, so we were able to sleep off the Jet lag). Of course, a big learning while traveling through Ireland was that the entire country is filled with beautiful, kind spirits everywhere you turn, but Brooks embodied this paradigm in every way, forever cementing a truly remarkable travel memory. Please, Brooks, keep being the change you want to see in the world",5,2013,05,17
236,I will always stay here..,"The Brooks Hotel has earned it's reputation among travelers and locals alike. The location is right in the heart of City Centre, a short walking distance from every local attraction and hundred's of restaurant's and pubs. Inside, is pure elegance and the service is impeccable. Please make sure to see Connor, the Concierge. He is delightful and so professional. I was there with a conference, but stayed an extra couple of days on my own. I mentioned to Connor that I needed to get to the airport, and he suggested a bus. On the morning of my checkout at 7am, Connor came to work 30 minutes early, took my suitcase and personally escorted me to the stop. He even waited with me until the bus arrived and would not take a tip! He just made me promise to return. All of the staff, from the front desk to housekeeping and the Dining staff were amazing. As for the dining, breakfast was homemade, cooked to order and buffet and included with your stay. The croissant were freshly baked throughout the morning. They came out hot and flaky and never ran out. Last, but not least, the rooms were impeccable and the hotel even offered a movie/drink night! For value, location, service and beauty, the Brooks Hotel is bar none.",5,2013,05,17
236,The place to stay in Dublin,"This hotel is where you want to be to visit Dublin.  We stayed three nights. Perfect location for walking or taking bus, close to all the must-see sites.  Price is unbelievable!  Great breakfasts.  Staff extremely helpful.  Rooms and baths outstanding!",5,2013,05,16
236,Good quality central hotel,"I stayed in a double room for one night in May.  The room was medium/small but spotlessly clean, the bathroom was average in size, and it had a full bath (rather than the half shallow baths you often see in hotels).  The hotel was quiet on the night I stayed, but I could see it being noisy at times from people on the street as it is at the edge of a busy area.  It is very centrally located, mid way between the Georges Street restaurant area and the Grafton Street shopping area.  The typical guest was a middle aged American tourist and the location really suited this type of person.  Breakfast was above average in quality and hot food was waiter service plated food rather than a buffet.  Cold food was a buffet.  The evening meal was average, but you would be spoiled for choice for restaurants within 2 minutes walk of the hotel, from take away to sushi, a host of vegetarian and everything in between.",4,2013,05,16
236,Excellent location and staff,"A central location, comfortable hotel, lovely service - wonderful three night stay.
Connor and Sean, the Concierges, couldn't do enough...amazing! For breakfast either order
or buffet or both...bar makes a great Irish Coffee! True Irish service here.",5,2013,05,15
236,"Great location, well priced for value","This is a very good small hotel in the heart of Dublin. Excellent w-fi throughout hotel, bar and restaurant. Rooms small but efficient and very clean. Excellent staff who know everything about Dublin and can direct you  to non-touristy places and all the sights.",5,2013,05,15
236,Great place to stay,"We stayed for three nights and were very impressed by the hotel staff, very friendly, breakfast was great, very varied and a lovley choice, Thought that the pillow menu was quite quirky but as I am allergic to feathers they bought me some wonderfully soft yet comfotable pillows and I slept like a dream. The hotel is situated just right, far enough away from Temple Bar but in easy walking distance to most things, the piano bar was very relaxing as after a hard day you didnt always want to go out into the town, and this was very pleasant with lovley tentative bar staff. Would certainly go back here 10/10",5,2013,05,14
236,We would stay again,"The hotel is centrally located to many tourist sites. The concierge was outstanding!! Actually all of the staff was great. Only downfall was that the A/C was broken in the room and we had to sleep with the window open on the last night. Ireland doesn't get many warm days, but when you want to cool off it is nice for it to work. We would definitely stay again at this establishment.",4,2013,05,12
236,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed for one night in this hotel and loved our short stay.
Very helpfull and incredible sweet staff. Always trying to help in the best way.
Great location: close to shops, Temple Bar, Trinity university, etc.
Nice room: Super bed, with a large choice of pillows.
Diner and breakfast were very good.
Loved the fact that we had free wifi through out the complete hotel.
Definitly a great hotel!",5,2013,05,12
236,"Returning again, says it all!","Stayed in Brooks last year for a weekend with my husband. Hotel was everything we wanted, great location, comfortable and well stocked room. Breakfast was faultless and we enjoyed the bar for a drink after long busy days in town!
As we were going to Leopardstown Races the hotel was only 2 minutes to the tram which was ideal. Lovely selection of restaurants and bars nearby. 
Thanks Brooks and we are returning in September to go to Leopardstown again.",5,2013,05,11
236,Great Hotel and there was a reason the Wi Fi is free,"We stayed here for two nights in late April. The hotel is located on a quiet street that didn't have much traffic while we were then and is located in the central part of Dublin. It's close to the Temple Bar District and other sites.
 When we checked in we had no issues what so ever even though we had prepaid for the room, and they checked us in quickly. The staff at the front desk was friendly and extremely helpful. My wife asked for a recommendation to get Irish Stew and they sent us to the Hairy Lemon Pub which turned out to be a fantastic choice. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking the street. Even though there was a rooftop restaurant across the street from us the noise wasn't too bad. .Our room was great. The bed was extremely comfortable and for the first time ever, We were able to pick the type of pillow we wanted from a list. 
The only issue we had was the Wi-Fi, it turned out that to get a useable connection you basically needed to be sitting in the bed and even then it was just barely useable. Overall we enjoyed the hotel and plan to make it our go to place the next time we come to Dublin.",4,2013,05,11
236,W/e in Dublin,"The hotel is much closed to all the places nice to visit, otherwise is too expensive for the conditions offered. Our room was noise due to their ventilation system, which even stopped from the panel started to run in the middle of the night ... :(. Also the window was not properly closing and the street was leaving in the room with us...

The breakfast was good.

Still ... across the hotel is the best restaurant to eat ""Fade and Social"".
",3,2013,05,09
236,Charming Hotel with Excellent Service,We stayed in the Brooks Hotel for two nights upon our arrival in Dublin.  We found the hotel on Trip Advisor.  It was absolutely wonderful.  The staff were superb.  Our luggage took the long way to Europe and arrived a full day late and any time we walked into the lobby we were given an update on its arrival.  During the second night we received several  phone calls from the US as we had a water problem at our home.  They had to go through the front desk and the individual working that night was so helpful and accommodating.  The location is terrific with many places to shop and eat nearby.  It is easy to get to Temple Bar from the hotel but far enough away to have peace and quiet.  The hotel itself is welcoming and we enjoyed our room.  In the future we will only stay at the Brooks Hotel.,5,2013,05,08
236,Smart well presented hotel,"Spent two nights at Brooks. Warm and helpful reception staff and concierge. Smallish double room but spotlessly clean. All the staff were very polite and warm when dealing with anything we asked for including a late restaurant booking that was sorted in minutes. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is well situated being just minutes walk from temple bar, grafton street and st.stephen's green.
Only moan was that our room was next to the lift which announced its arrival at the floor when the doors opened - if we had been there another night would have asked to be moved.",4,2013,05,08
236,"our Dublin ""home""","The Brooks Hotel has become our ""home"" in Dublin. The Brooks is on the more ""posh"" side, it is Brilliantly run. The staff are the best in the hospitality business. You can not beat the service at The Brooks. You can not beat the food at The Brooks. The Concierge Connor, and Marvin can hook you up with a dream visit of Dublin and the surrounding countryside. What ever you may need, or want just ask Connor or Marvin and trust me, they know or they know someone who knows. The rooms are lovely and very comfortable. I wish they had better air circulation in the rooms, but in an old world hotel like the Brooks with all it's charm and homey feel you simply forget about those things. What keeps us coming back to The Brooks are the people who work there. The staff are so friendly and so good at their jobs. On our second visit to Dublin we walked into the Brooks to check in and everyone there remembered us by our first names and it had been a Year since our first visit. That is impressive. When the staff of a hotel who meet and greet for a living every day of the year remember their guest? Come On, that stands out in your memory. The Brooks is worth Every Penny!!!! The location is THE BEST IN DUBLIN. It truly is a quiet oasis in the heart of The City That Rocks Like No Other. Can you tell I'm in love with Dublin? Okay, I am. I admit it. But then I'm Irish. ;)",5,2013,05,07
236,Wonderful visit!,"I loved this hotel. Had never stayed there before. It's location must be one of it's top selling points. Near to the Aircoach stop, to and from airport, round the corner from all the best restaurants and shops etc. Easy walk to the Dart train line or car hire offices if you are going out of town. There is even a car park opposite the front of the hotel, and reductions for guests for overnight parking. We went off to the races in Punchestown, and had a car for two days. The staff are great, helpful and courteous all the time. Lovely breakfast, fresh fruit, yum jams and nutty brown breads, as well as cooked breakfast if wanted. Had very nice dinner one night too. The only thing i would say was that the mattress was a little too firm, as i am Could go on, but don't want it to be fully booked next time I visit Dublin!",4,2013,05,07
236,A classy hotel,"Brooks is located within walking distance of most everything in central Dublin.  The car was helpfully unloaded in front of the hotel and we then parked it easily in the multi-storey car park directly opposite the hotel at a discounted rate.
The rooms are well appointed and reasonably large as are the bathrooms.  The materials and decoration throughout are excellent (even slightly “funky”), and the bed superb – in short the rooms are comfortable and a nice balance for what is, after all, a city centre hotel.  The staff are top notch, helpful without being fussy and nothing seems to be too much trouble.
The restaurant is very good – the food was delicious and the atmosphere relaxed.  And not just at dinner, the breakfast was a joy in its own right – they even give you the recipe for some of the dishes, and there are many home-made choices available.
Departure was as easy as the arrival – out of the car park opposite to the front of the hotel to load and then en route. A satnav is probably a good idea as Brooks is nestled in a tight network of small streets in the centre of the city, an excellent hotel with genuinely nice people, really good food, and close to everything.  This is a classy hotel which does not feel the need to shout about itself.",5,2013,05,05
236,Good hotel in a great location,Brooks hotel is a good hotel in a fantastic location in the centre of Dublin.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Unfortunately our room was situated on the back side of the hotel and each morning we were awoken by the recycling bins filled with glass being dumped.  I would suggest to anyone booking at the Brooks Hotel to request an even numbered room (street facing side) on a higher floor.  Bathroom was spacious.  Free wifi was good although spotty in some locations. The hotel location is walking distance from most tourist attractions.  I would return to the Brooks hotel in the future. If it wasn't for the noise factor (not the hotels fault) I would rate the hotel higher.,4,2013,05,01
236,A great bargain in Dublin.,"LOCATION: excellent, very central yet secluded from heavy traffic and noisy bars. Near to everything.
STAFF: very friendly, polite & helpful.
CONDITION: needs some renovations. Some rooms are better than others. Small rooms.
FASCILITIES: all you need. Free WiFi.
PRICES: very reasonable.
BREAKFAST: NOT impressive. The heavy on carbs & fats English breakfast makes you feel guilty that you assaulted your heart and arteries.",4,2013,04,30
236,Great spot.  Great hotel,Perfect t location in the centre of old Dublin. Walked everywhere from here. Didn't find it very noisy despite other reviews. Bed comfortable. Shower pressure and bathrooms lovely. Breakfast was great. Often not the case but here it is well worth it. Jams to die for!  The rooms are spacious and free wifi always welcome!  Would definitely stay here next time in Dublin.,5,2013,04,25
236,"Wonderful hotel, perfect location","I stayed here as a solo traveller on my first trip to Dublin. This is a very well-run hotel in a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the room spacious and affordable by European standards. As others have mentioned, the staff is warm and welcoming. It was a bit noisy outside at closing time but it didn't detract from my experience. If you want to save a few euros, it is quite easy to take the public bus from the airport. Breakfast is great. Highly recommended.",5,2013,04,22
236,wonderful Dublin hotel,"Brooks Hotel is run by a great team. They make you feel right at home. It is in a perfect location
in centre city Dublin with comfortable large rooms. We just spent one night last week but
had stayed 5 nights back in 2010 when we were stranded by the Icelandic volcanic ash
eruption. We were welcomed back by Tom and Conor. This visit was as wonderful as the first.",5,2013,04,21
236,Business hotel in great location,"I frequently travel to Dublin on business, and most often stay at the Brooks.  It is located near Grafton Street, but far enough away that its hustle and bustle does not invade the hotel.  In general the hotel, and its rooms are quiet (though when the pubs empty out up the street, it can get a little noisy as people announce their disappointment with closing time).  The rooms are typical for Dublin - a little on the small side, but adequate.

The on site restaurant serves a full Irish breakfast, and their dinner offerings are outstanding.",5,2013,04,18
236,Excellent hotel,"We enjoyed our 2-night stay at this hotel, and in fact will return to this hotel next week for our last night in Ireland.  The location is convenient, easy walking distance to shops, restaurants,Trinity College, and other tourist attractions.  The rooms were comfortable, breakfasts were terrific, and the staff were gracious and helpful.  The physical plant was modern and attractive.

We liked it a lot.",4,2013,04,18
236,Loved our stay,"We stayed during the easter weekend. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, till we left it was such a wonderful experiance. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were excellent and so comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic and really efficient. We had dinner at the retaurent one night, food was lovely but the service has room to improve. The location is right in the middle of city centre, so you can walk everywhere.",5,2013,04,17
236,Friendly,"Stayed here for a weekend in April. The staff were excellent as was the food. Service was very good, rooms were nicely furnished and clean. The hotel is in central Dublin and gives good access to the town and surrounding area. It takes about 20 mins in a taxi to get from airport. the only down side was the noise of cars tooting in the early hours seemed to be coming from a car park behind the hotel.",4,2013,04,16
236,A great city centre hotel,"We stayed for one night and couldn't have asked for a better location to get straight out into the streets of Dublin.

The staff were very friendly and the bedrooms are large, and very comfy. 

There is parking across the road with the cost of staying there discounted when you leave the hotel.

We didn't use all of the facilities but the ones we did, you really couldn't ask for anymore from a hotel.",5,2013,04,14
236,A hotel that really does care.,"This was my second stay here this year and though my stay in january was very enjoyable I had made a note of some comments on their comment card. I recieved a reply to this and I have to say everything was even better this time round.  I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone, great location for shopping and socialising in Dublin City center. 
",5,2013,04,11
236,Welcoming,"We stayed for 5 nights  and it was really enjoyable ..The room was lovely clean and comfortable.
We dined in the restaurant and the bar and the food was really good the food was very well cooked and presented, our only complaint would have been that the cheese plate was in our opinion poor . The staff were great . The hospitality tray could be better biscuits and cream pots for coffee would have made it perfect.
Yes we would go again and we would recommend this hotel to all our friends.",5,2013,04,10
236,Great Value,"Charming hotel, great location, friendly bar open late, nicely appointed rooms with extras such as a pillow menu in case the one you have is not to your liking. Has a gym when many don't and friendly staff (particularly the bartenders.)",5,2013,04,06
236,Excellent hotel,Stayed in this hotel for one night over Easter with my partner. We had a lovely stay in a very well kept hotel. Our meal in the hotel restaurant was beautiful and the breakfast well worth getting. Handy for central Dublin and temple bar as well as shopping.,5,2013,04,04
236,"Quaint, Charming, Wonderful!","I stayed here just a week ago with my husband, and we truly loved our experience. When we arrived, the receptionist was beyond friendly, and they even let us up to our room early. We were only in Dublin for a few days for the last leg of our Europe trip, but in the short time we were there we really got to experience how awesome the city is. Connor, the concierge was extremely helpful in directing us and telling us the best things to see/do. 

One of the days, we slept in and had the privacy sign up, so we missed the window for maid service. They provided us the option to call and request service, but we didn’t feel like we needed it. However, lo and behold, when we returned they had cleaned our room after all. This is just an example of how they go above and beyond with service. The only (very minor and out of their control) issue was that there was construction going on at all hours of the night outside of our room, so we slept with earplugs. A warning might have been nice for that, but it really wasn't a big deal. Overall, the good WAY outweighs this one minor detail.

The location is absolutely perfect, very, very close to everything, and it very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,04,04
236,"Wonderful stay, great location",The Brooks Hotel in Dublin is centrally located to everything.  Front desk staff very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was included in our pkg and was delicious and very fresh.  We would definately stay here again when visiting Dublin.  We loved it!,5,2013,04,03
236,Location and service,"We managed to get reservations at the Brooks Hotel the night of the rugby game and through the week up to St. Patrick's Day.  Rooms were hard to find in Dublin and the Brooks was a fortunate find for us.  The room was lovely with amenities such as heated mirror in the bathroom, great shower head with hot water, and comfortable bed (decor was lovely and understated as well).  Because the hotel was booked, we were not able to get a room with view.  
The staff were welcoming and helpful, even answering emailed questions before our arrival, and the environment was relaxing, elegant without pretense.  All desk staff provided excellent service but Connor merits mention.  He seemed to be everywhere and to show up just as needed; he could answer any question.  He recommended a tour with Mary Gibbons that Lonely Planet also rated as high and gave us tips such as ""take your own food as the cafeteria at site is expensive and food awful"".  He was right and we were prepared.  
And the location was central to our activities, whether to catch Dart, shop around Grafton Street, visit ""our"" pub (Kehoe's), visit galleries, find restaurants.  We would stay there again when visiting Dublin.",5,2013,04,03
236,It's all about the location,"My wife and I spent a week here from March 23 through March 30, 2013. This was our first non- chain/boutique hotel. I usually consider 'boutique' to equate to old. Well this hotel is old and does have its physical problems - had to run the shower for 30 minutes to get the water from scalding to warm, doors that had to be propped open, no heat. These were just hiccups in what was a very enjoyable stay. The staff was phenomenal - reservations, desk,concierge, and housekeeping. Room upon our arrival and during our stay was very clean. The mattress, unfortunately, was hard like a dried out sponge. The breakfast (included in my rate) was good with a small menu for ordering. Internet (included) was good to very good. The windows are soundproofed and I heard no street noise (the hotel is across from a parking garage and social club). But it's the location that really makes this hotel one I would return to. A mini mart and ATM/CashPoint around the corner, 5 minute walk to Hop On Hop Off Bus, Grafton Street, 10 minute walk to Temple Bar, less than 15 minutes to Trinity College and the Visitor Center on Suffolk. I would recommend this hotel for couples and people on business (EU members were there at the hotel during our stay).",4,2013,04,02
236,Back again for relaxing weekend break,"Back in Brooks once again. It's the staff and the central location that really make this our hotel of choice when in Dublin. We booked directly with the hotel and benefited from a weekend break deal - very well priced and breakfast was included. Restaurant was grand and service once again great. The front of house staff are always pleasant and helpful. Brooks Hotel is not flash nor gimmicky. It is a friendly boutique hotel in a really central location (and with a good value parking deal for the multi-storey across the road). Loads of pubs, cafes and restaurants within walking distance though didn't get to Fade Street Social so that'll have to be for our next visit!",5,2013,04,01
236,wonderful hotel in prime location,"This is an excellent hotel in a very good location, minutes from everywhere..
Everything works perfectly, 
The staff could not be nicer.
The room was spotless clean, comfortable and  had all the amenities you could desire.
Had dinner at the restaurant and the food was good a reasonably priced.
Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,04,01
236,Wonderful Place to Stay,"We stayed with our two year old child. From the moment we arrived, we were given a very warm welcome and looked after exceptionally well. The staff just could not do enough for us! 
The room was very modern and clean. There was a great selection of quality food for breakfast. We ate dinner in the restaurant on one evening and it was so tasty and beautifully presented. Our waiter, 
Noel, was very attentive. 
The receptionists were very friendly and extremely helpful. We made several trips in taxis, all of which they organised. A special mention for Conor, the hotel concierge. He was very welcoming and always had a friendly word when we met!
The hotel is situated very close to a very large selection of restaurants, cafes and bars and just round the corner from St Stephens Green and Grafton St.
We will definitely return to Brooks Hotel!",5,2013,03,30
236,amazing food in okc!,We arrived in Dublin at 12 and the hotel helped us find a local restaurant (the Hairy Lemon) and took care of our bags. Plus they made a cup cake for our anniversary. They are an amazing place to stay and a cook walk to most attractions in Dublin. I would stay here again in we went to Dublin.,5,2013,03,27
236,A great location to explore Dublin on foot.,"One of the reasons we chose the Brooks Hotel was to be close enough to walk to most of the Dublin sites.  We were and we did.  It was a little hike to Guinness, but it's literally in the midst of the Temple Bar District, and a short stroll to Trinity College, Grafton Street's shopping, and Christ Church Cathedral.  The room was spotless, the shower hot, and the staff friendly and helpful.  Our room was ready early, too, which was a big help since our flight arrived at 8am.  FYI, we took a bus from the airport that was 6 euro one way, and stopped only a few blocks from the Brooks.",5,2013,03,25
236,very central,"great hotel very central ,car park a bit confusing !!!,it is directly across the road from the hotel but it can close very early ,check with hotel first 
Lovely staff and breakfeast was yummy,
Got great midweekdeal through  bookingcom",5,2013,03,25
236,Loved the Brooks in Dublin!,"Great stay at the Brooks!  Perfect location, friendly staff, nice room.  I would definately stay here again.  Breakfast was very good and included with my stay.  Not only did they have a plentiful buffet but you order off the menu as well.  The crepes were delicious!

So convenient to everything, they assisted us with dinner reservations and site seeing tours.  
First class property all the way!",5,2013,03,25
236,What service! Perfect Location!,"We stayed here for St. Patrick's weekend and were so glad we did. Besides being in the heart of Dublin within walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, St. Patrick's and Christ Church Catherdals, the staff is awesome.  Conor is a superb concierge/bellman. He was so helpful as was, Jane, in providing directions and advice.  They remembered our names and were sincerely interested in us and in making sure we had a great time.  Paul, one of the bartenders, was also extremely attentive and nice to talk to. While the hotel is lovely, clean, perfect, the staff made our stay memorable.  Lovely breakfast, parking across the street in a garage.  The hotel provides a discount.",5,2013,03,20
236,Great service!,"It takes a lot for me to be impressed with a hotel, but this one is worth writing about.  From the moment I stepped through the door until after I had checked out, the staff went above and beyond to make my stay memorable.  I was treated not like a customer/guest but as a returning friend.  My room was ready when I arrived, I was presented with a city map and oriented to the sights I wanted to visit, my questions were answered, and when I seemed confused about the place I was to meet my tour the next day, Collin the concierge walked me to the very place.  My next stay will most certainly include this hotel.",4,2013,03,19
236,"""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!""","Stayed for three nights with my wife,daughter and son-in-law celebrating my daughters birthday and also to watch the St Patricks Day parade.Very happy to receive an upgrade upon arrival! (not asked for)and the subsequent treatment was first class all the time.Superb location just minutes from simply everywhere you would wish to travel to.There is parking across the road in a safe multi storey car park and the Hotel is situated on a quiet side road.The Irish are rightly famed for their hospitality and  our treatment at all times was wonderful.Nothing was too much trouble and management and staff are to be congratulated.",5,2013,03,19
236,Happy to return again and recommend,"Stayed here one night 16th March, bit over the odds as we left it late and it was a popular wknd, so price is my fault, you can get a good rate if you book early.  just minutes off o'connell street and central to everything, has no parking of its own but literally a cars length across the street is a secure car park.  if you want a cheaper one go to stephens street car park, but we preferred the handiness of this so ended up paying 23 euros from 3pm sat to 3pm sun. again our choice so we paid. two girls on reception both flat to the mat, but were professional and pleasant. tiny wee irk was that the phone rang twice and we had to wait whilst those were dealt with, i prefer to think i have paid my money and am there physically so i should come first, but was gracous enough to see she was busy and was trying to please everybody.  we got our keys and made our own way up to the room which was just across from the lift.  usually i would try to avoid this, but i never heard the lift during my whole stay, nor people in the corridor; it was one of the quietest hotel stays ever.  for such a busy wknd and overlooking a street i was prepared for noise later in the evening - not a peep.  the room was spotless and ensuite well kitted out with toiletries.  decent tea and coffee facilities with extra milk provided on request free of charge.  we ate lunch in the jasmine bar, a curry and an omlette.  although we ate both, hubby thought the curry could have been hotter and i thought the omlette was just ok, but we were starving and its great just to get food set in front of you, you don't have to cook yourself, and the room was lovely and cosy, so again couldn't fault this.  our deal included a full breakfast and it set us up for the day, but for me full marks must go to the girl on the pass (Lisa, I think I heard)  she was unaware i was watching but she and her sidekick kept the plates of breakfast coming on.  this was the 17th of March, the chef hadn't turned in and the front of house staff kept the whole thing running smoothly in the restaurant.  she played a blinder, keeping the guy beside her cooking the bacon and tomatoes on his toes - although he could have done with a set of whites to cover his blue t-shirt.  All in all i would certainly return and will recommend.  free wifi throughout and a beautiful oasis of calm in the residents private lounge which has two more pc's you can use, loads of easy chairs and sofas, chess etc to wile away the hours.  if you are looking for somewhere to stay and aren't too sure if this is worth it, trust me, i have no shares in the place, but it is.",5,2013,03,18
236,excellent choice,"excellent location in the old town, great shopping area within 3 minutes, good restaurants 10 steps away, ( amazing ""social fade"" across the street, 66's restaurant within 10 m )  lovely and kind personnel, perfect food.
But mainly, amazing nice&kind stuff. Great management. 10 points",5,2013,03,15
236,Great hotel in low profile location,"We stayed 1 night in Brooks hotel recently and had a great stay. Despite its very central location on Drury street it is a relatively low profile area. A large NCP car park dominates the area but it is still a fantastic location. You are twenty feet away from the new and trendy ""Fade street social"" restaurant, the market bar, George's Market and other great shops and restaurants.
But back to the hotel!  A warm welcome and very easy check-in.  The room was a very comfortable size and well equipped with tea/coffee facilities, a selection of bathroom products and a large very comfortable bed.  A real bonus was breakfast.  I always have a problem with the cost of hotel breakfasts, especially given the range and quality of alternatives available in local cafes. Brooks had a special offer of 50% off breakfast, this was excellent value for money and the breakfast was really good!  They have a special deal with the car park opposite the hotel and we will definitely be back.  Check out was painless and we found all of the staff very polite and friendly.",5,2013,03,15
236,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, excellent service, stayed here for one night. Perfect location near to everything. Room is a lovely size and very clean. Reception staff were very pleasant. the only downside is the Irish breakfast which was included in our room rate. There wasn't a huge amount of it and we had better the previous day after arriving in a cafe down the road. I wouldn't be happy paying EUR20 for their breakfast. so don't order it if not included in the room rate. Would def be back for another stay when we come to dublin again.",4,2013,03,15
236,"Pleasant stay , great location","We were supposed to check into another hotel, so this was a real nice change of event. The rooms were decently sized and most importantly, the location was very central. We were able to walk to most places , as there were loads of restaurants and bars around the Temple Bar area. 
The service staffs were most pleasant and helpful with recommendations and getting around directions. We will return.",4,2013,03,15
236,Great hotel,"Excellent location, lovely and comfortable rooms, best stuff helping, best food, organic one, best service.  Food service 24/7.  Cleaning rooms 2 times every day. Very close to restaurants and lovely shops, near by the famous Grafton street.",5,2013,03,14
236,LOVED this hotel in the Dublin City Center,"I stayed at the Brooks hotel in Dublin City for 10 days in September 2012. I was there for business, but also did some sight seeing.  I LOVED it there. My room had such charm and character, the wireless worked perfectly, and the service was excellent.  The staff was so friendly and helpful in my electronic communications prior to arrival from the USA and once I was there.  I would stay there again for sure. I was in walking distance to many restaurants, pubs and shopping.",5,2013,03,14
236,Very Good Hotel,"I spent one night at the Brooks Hotel while visiting the city on business.

The location is excellent. It is close to Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green.

The receptionist gave me a very warm welcome, asking me if I had visited the city before, and offering me a map of the area.

The room was a fair size, with a comfortable bed. The TV wasn't very big, but was on a 'lazy susan' which allowed you to set it at the perfect angle. There was also a CD player in the room. The bathroom was a little small, but adequate. There were nice toiletries in the bathroom. The only thing I didn't like was the hair dryer. It was old fashioned, and not very powerful. 

The hotel offers an evening service of the room, but I had only just checked in, so the chambermaid simply handed me a chocolate mint, and wished me a pleasant evening.

I had breakfast included in my rate. There was a continental selection which you can help yourself to, and you can order something from the menu. I opted for the Irish breakfast, which I found a little disappointing. The sausage and bacon were overdone, and there wasn't much to it. The toast was lovely and chunky, though.

All the staff I encountered in the hotel were friendly and helpful.

I would be very happy to stay here again, although if breakfast is not included in your rate, I wouldn't bother. Save your cash and buy a breakfast in one of the many local cafes.",4,2013,03,14
236,Good time,We stayed here for 4 days and everything was good. Staff was helpful and room was clean. Food at hotel was good. Would come back agsin fir a stay and it is located right in the middle of everything. Real close to the church where all the tours take off every morning.,5,2013,03,07
236,A lovely city centre hotel,"With so many hotels to choose from in Dublin's city centre it is always difficult to know whether you have made the right decision, and I have to say we were not disappointed. We were met with a very warm welcome from both Jane at reception and Connor who helped with our bags, always nice to meet people who are both smiley and cheerful! We parked in the public car park opposite the hotel and were told that the hotel would validate the ticket so on departure (the next day) the rate would be reduced. This was correct and it cost around 18 euros for approx. 24 hours. The room we were allocated was very nice, plush furnishings, very comfortable 6' bed with a pillow top mattress and cotton sheets! - the bathroom was ultra modern and very spacious with a large P-shaped bath, power shower above and two wash hand basins. There was also a built in t.v. at the end of the bath but unfortunately we could not get it to work.

We booked the 'Birthday Package' as it was my husband's birthday and this gave us an upgraded room, proscecco and cupcakes upon arrival, together with a 3 course evening meal and breakfast the next morning. Firstly the cupcakes were in the room which was a nice touch - but the proscecco was not. We waited until we were seated for dinner before we raised this question and it was then brought over to us. It would have been nice had we not had to ask for this and it had just been offered. 

We were presented with a menu which had a 'set menu of the day' plus an a la carte section - printed on it. It was not explained to us which items we could have as 'part of our package'. eventually after having to ask the question twice we were advised it was from the 'set menu' that we could choose. The food was very nice and the staff were attentive.

Our room was facing the road and we did find it fairly noisy during the night - with revving engines and lots of shouting, this stopped by around 4am - so we were able to get some undisturbed sleep, luckily breakfast was served until 11.30am - and this was excellent! 

We paid £220 euros for this one night package and felt for a city hotel it was good value for money. Very close to everything you would want to see in this great city!",4,2013,03,06
236,Perfect weekend.,"Ended up going to the Brooks by accident really but couldn't have wished for or chosen a nicer place, away from the temple bar crowd and right in the nicest part of St Stephens Green where all the shops and beautiful park is (we also got engaged by one of the fountains in there :) ). The hotel itself is lovely inside and the finish on our room was of a very high quality. Real oak furniture, table and chairs in bay window for morning breakfast and classic fm on as you walk in to the room! its the little touches like that that make it all that bit better. Breakfast in bed was wonderful and like everyone else says the staff really do make the difference; from the warm reception on arrival to the great bar staff who were great to sit and chat to. My favourite room though is the residents lounge/drawing room. So peaceful and quiet and relaxing; could spend way too much time in there!

Would recommend and defo go back.",5,2013,03,05
236,"Super location, super staff and super breakfasts","Myself, wife and friends have just returned from our first visit to Dublin, where we stayed at the Brooks Hotel. The staff from the moment we arrived were very helpful. The room was very comfortable, needs a new TV and there was only a slight street noise. Breakfast each morning was first class with freshly cooked Irish breakfast made to order. I would also recommend the porridge. The location is perfect for shopping and all the attractions, including The Gaiety Theatre.
We will definitely return to this welcoming hotel.",5,2013,03,01
236,Would return,"We stayed for one night before leaving the country. Hotel was the nicest one we stayed in during our visit; clean, comfortable room, friendly staff & great location. Would definitely return on the next trip. Only negative was there wasn't a great deal with a garage for parking (had to pay hourly rate since we arrived before 5).",4,2013,02,28
236,Super hotel wouldn’t stay anywhere else!,"Been to Dublin about 4-5 times now and from my first stay this hotel is always the one we come back too and wouldn’t stay anywhere else
I really do like this hotel as it’s really classy and modern with some features being old style but you can feel a like with a warm feeling to the place.

STAFF - are very welcoming and even though we have been here many times nothing as changed as they made us feel welcome just like this was our first stay.

CUSTOMER SERVICE - All was perfect and we had a problem and within minutes all sorted out and overall the service we got was excellent and I know problems can arise out of the blue but they did a really good job sorting it out.
The customer service was very good thought out the hotel including the waiters, cleaners and not to forget the porters and all the staff know there job and to make customers happy!

ROOMS – all the rooms we have stayed in have been very clean and tidy with nice features to make the room feel like a room and very nice travel sized wash gels. I am sure some of the rooms have been re-decorated seen our last stay as they look more upper class now then before?  Still happy with our stay

FOOD/DRINK – food was very nice and all presented very well for breakfast and had very nice scones and the Irish breakfast very tasty just like the hot chocolate and Irish coffee!  

OVERALL – we had a great time again in Dublin and if you are looking for somewhere to stay and want great service and lovely rooms, food and drink you need to book this hotel, we have never been unhappy with anything from this hotel and if problems do occur then they will be sorted out but still this is our number one choice for Dublin.",5,2013,02,28
236,Communication issues,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend break. On arrival we checked in and were informed we had 4 reservations! After showing prof of cancellations and my paperwork for my pre payment for reservation we intended to use we were assured all was now fine. We were told our bags would be brought straight  up to us, however 3 hours later I had to remind them off my bags another 2 times! 
Our room was fine apart from one thing? The bed! It was incredibly short , at 5ft 6ins my feet overhanged the bed and my poor husband was even worse . 
Breakfast was ok, food on the cold side.
We ate out in the evenings so never used hotels resturant . The hotel bar as too be expected was expensive €7.50 for a small glass of wine. 
On check out we were horrified that they were trying to charge us for our room twice!! After once again displaying my prepaid receipt they agreed this was fine. However we have just discovered our credit card has been debited a lot off money by these.
Most unprofessional to say one thing to your face then without authorisation take money off your card",2,2013,02,25
236,An excellent hotel - highly recommended,"I booked a two night break at Brooks as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and both he and I were delighted with the hotel.
The lobby has a 'vintage' feel to it, with dark wood and comfortable chairs.  Staff were excellent upon check in and our room was ready even though we arrived early, at around 1pm.
When I booked we had been upgraded to a deluxe room which was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.  We had turn down service each evening and chocolates left on our pillows.  The housekeeping staff were unobtrusive and thorough - a real credit to the hotel.
Breakfast was fantastic.  There was a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, breads and cereals.  The full Irish was cooked to perfection and the coffee delicious.
We didn't eat dinner at the hotel as there was a super selection of eateries in the immediate area.  It really is a wonderful location for everything.
I have already recommended Brooks Hotel to my mother - surely there is no higher praise than that! 
This place is a little bit of affordable luxury in an expensive city.",5,2013,02,24
236,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel.
The room was old fashioned in a good way.
It was clean and room service at the evening and a pillow menu.
Very good breakfast with bot cold and warm choices.
Very central but still quiet",4,2013,02,23
236,"""Little piece of heaven""","Stayed in this beautiful hotel with friends and we had a blast !!! The deluxe rooms were just fab and I just loved the stand free radio,lovely touch.You get a ""pillow menu"",which is a great idea for people with allergies/ etc.. The breakfast was the best I have ever tasted and I compliment the chef-beautiful,freshly cooked food .What stood out for this hotel more than anything was all the staff we encountered-truely professional,friendly and always with a smile.We met a ""Gem"" of a concierge staff member,who showed us around the hotel - a wonderful,kind and informative gentleman and who was able to address us by our names the next morning....I highly commend this truely sparkling ""Gem""....Indeed,this could be applied to all staff members -reception,waiting staff,bar staff....Well done to you all - you make Irish hospitality stand out !!!! The hotel is in an excellent, central location and I  highly recommend this hotel for a visit. We shall be back !!!!",5,2013,02,21
236,Average hotel with delusions of grandeur,"Having previously stayed at the brooks I thought I knew what I was getting. I was however left sadly disappointed. The room itself was adequate but nothing special. Several times the door was opened by cleaning staff even at odd times, I.e 5.45pm.
We chose to dine in the restaurant the first night of our stay and I can only describe it as a surreal experience! We were the only diners present and the waiter paced the floor like a manic basil fawlty. The meal was quite cold and inedible. When we left our half finished plates we were offered more dessert, even though we hadn't finished the first one. Breakfast the next morning was another experience! Having been seated for 9.20am and placed our orders for full Irish we waited, and waited! 40 minutes later we enquired about the breakfast and were told quite abruptly that there were ten people in front of us and that was the problem. The toasted arrived, burnt and went cold as the wait continued. More toast was produced as the eagerly anticipated 'fry' arrived. Burnt offerings would be a better description! Bacon cremated black, fried egg inedible, potato bread uncooked! Staff more interested in clearing away the buffet than addressing any queries. All in all a very disappointing stay in a hotel that portrays itself as a classy establishment!",2,2013,02,20
236,Unhappy,"Room wasn't up to scratch, for price charged very very poor. 
Terrible shower and toilet, really old tv and phone! For the money paid, I couldn't believe it! €140 a night room only, compared to other hotel deals, terrible value.",2,2013,02,20
236,"very good hotel,  great location","very good hotel,  great location. staff vey friendly and helpful,  corridor is a little cramped,  in summary a lovely hotel in a great location but expensive.....  Bar is nice,  cheap parking nearby. perfect for a short stay near city centre  ",4,2013,02,18
236,Overnight Stay,"I stayed over in Brooks in January of this year.  I have to say it was a very pleasant experience.  The staff from the moment you checked in, to the moment you checked out were friendly, professional and very informative.  The room was a twin room - very restful decor, not in your face colour schemes.  The beds were lovely and comfy and i had a great night's sleep.  I ordered breakfast to the room which was a great treat.  Everything was very tasty and hot! All in all a great hotel for a city break.....close to everything and in a safe area",5,2013,02,18
236,A good spot to see Dublin,We booked this hotel for the three  nights in Dublin.  This was a perfect location for us as we were utilizing the HOHO for our Dublin sightseeing.  The concerige at this hotel was terrific.  Met us at the door and set down with us for our itinerary while in Dublin. He always had a hello for us in the morning and knew us by name.  You could add a breakfast on per morning and we did that.  It wasn't much and was very nice.  I'd recommend this location.,4,2013,02,14
236,The place to stay in Dublin,"Have stayed here at least 5 times since 2008 and never disappointed. Close to tourist attractions, excellent rooms and very good caring service. The concierge (Connor) is a delight to deal with, and nothing is too much trouble for him.

We will be back.",5,2013,02,08
236,Top class,"Stayed with my partner overnight, excellent service, food in restaurant superb with an emphasis on foraging, breakfast spread particularly good, lovely central boutique hotel with a homely feel, it's very central and I have recommended and shall definitely be back",5,2013,02,07
236,Good Hotel in Excellent Neighborhood,"This is a good hotel in an excellent neighborhood that has other places to stay that are more famous and more expensive. Services are fine and the rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished. The common areas are small but cozy, and the intimate little bar is a convenient place to meet other people.",4,2013,02,05
236,Fantastic  location  Excellent Service.,"The location is excellent, close to Grafton street, bars and restaurants.
The staff were very helpful, happy and friendly. Our room was bright and nicely decorated with  very comfortable beds. The breakfast was fantastic, tasty fresh and what a choice, sets you up for the day!  We will be returning to Brooks.

Thank you to Thomas who made us reservations at IL Posto 10 St Stephens Green, the food wonderful.",5,2013,01,30
236,A Great Find,"What a novelty a hotel that offers a choice of pillows never heard of that before excellent service, what was an even bigger novelty well trained and highly professional staff. All the staff we encountered were first class their attention to detail was excellent. My husband and I used to work in the hotel industry(many years ago) and its not often you see staff waiting on tables properly, this company invest in their staff and it shows all credit to them. As to the hotel not sure where the negative comments come from on this site, our deluxe room was first class well serviced a broken towel rail was fixed straight away, what people have to bear in mind is this is a city centre hotel and their might be outside noise and a lack of carparking but it is location location location. Would definately return and would have every confidence in recommending. We have stayed in their sister hotel in Connemara and had the same standard of service and hospitality. We will be back",5,2013,01,29
236,The right place in Dublin,"The location is excellent, very central, next to the pedestrian streets, bars and restaurants. The staff was very  helpfull. The rooms are  confortable. There is a pillow menu available to choose. The bar service is very good, the hotel atmosfere is very nice.",4,2013,01,27
236,Great position,"Very nice position in the city center close to Temple bar, Grafton street and historic centre of Dublin. Very helpful and friendly personnel. Comfortable room, very comfortable bed with a choice of pillows. Free WI-fi with a stable signal and good speed.   Next time when I'm in Dublin, will stay there again.",5,2013,01,26
236,Delightful,"Close to Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, Trinity College and Temple Bar.  Quite, comfortable rooms with lovey, large beds.  During our stay there was a great breakfast deal too.  The staff were warm, friendly and accommodating.  It might be a stretch to call this a 'small, luxury, hotel' but neither does it have the stuffy intimidation such labelled hotels suffer. Would certainly stay there again.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,01,25
236,Very pleasant stay,"Great location very good choice of breakfast. Convenient to tour bus, grafton  street and other restaurants in the area. Found the area quiet no noise to keep us awake and we were at the front of house.  Left some items of clothing behind and appreciated having them forwarded.  Many thanks brooks",4,2013,01,23
236,"Nice place, good service, quite expensive - especially the bar!","I mean over 12 euro for a large JD and coke, another one and I could almost go and buy a bottle.

Rooms and bathrooms nice and clean.

Breakfast good, but another posh hotel that seems to think its too good to serve baked beans!

Great location too, but car parking can get bloomin' expensive.",3,2013,01,23
236,Surprisingly Bad,"OK, Connor is great and the location is good, but that is the highlight of a stay at the Brooks.  I usually love Small Luxury Hotels, but this was not up to their standard.  Our upgraded room had built-in furniture from several decades ago, the drawer fronts were falling off, the toilet was broken, there were huge spider webs around the ceiling of the bathroom and our mirror was cracked.  The shower dribbled water on you if you stood directly on the drain and the corridors are downright depressing.  The worst was we had booked the hotel for friends too and had told them how wonderful SLH hotels are; it was embarrassing.  The lobby looks like it could be nice, but badly in need of a good carpet and upholstery cleaning.  Would highly suggest looking elsewhere.",2,2013,01,21
236,Clean and quiet - great Wi-fi,"We stayed here for one night when visiting family in Dublin. The rooms are clean, if a little jaded, but they are warm and quiet, and the Wi-fi is excellent. We did not eat there so cannot comment on that, nor the gym and sauna. It is very convenient for the city centre though. I would definitely use it again",4,2013,01,21
236,Grossly overpriced,"Booked this hotel for two nights last Sunday. It was not a good experience and we checked out the next moring after a sleepless night.
The ""deluxe"" room was cramped and dimly lit. The bed had all the comfort of a snooker table and the heating/air-co was so noisy it seemed like a gaint was snoring somewhere in the corner.

There is no carpark and one has to park in the public one across the road. Be prepared to pay €20 per day and around 7 for each overnight stay. That's an extra €47 to your bill.

Also be prepared to pay €40 in advance for any expenses you might incur in the bar and restaurant. Pardon me, but never in our lives, have we been charged in advance for the possibilty of our being thieves.

The only positive was the oriental barman - very open, friendly and attentive. Also the bar food was good.

Really cannot understand all the rev reviews for Brooks. Unfortunately I was swayed by them.",2,2013,01,20
236,Great city get-away,Very helpful staff. Comfy firm beds with soft pillows. Small room to be expected in city location but full of amenities. Chocolates on those pillows! Residents lounge closed for refurbishment and no food at the bar after ten for late snackers. Would recommend this hotel for a sightseeing shopping or business trip and would go back. Short walk to luas stop at St Stephens Green and 123 bus to Guiness Storehouse and Goal. ,4,2013,01,19
236,"Great location, fantastic service from the moment we arrived!!!","We've just had two excellent nights in the Brooks Hotel, the concierge Connor, couldn't do enough for us, so friendly and helpful, remembered our names, gave tips and advice. The receptionist was efficient and helpful, we also go an upgrade to a deluxe room, which was unexpected. Rooms spacious and well furnished, extremely comfortable beds with a choice of pillows to make sure you get a good nights sleep!! which we did! Breakfast - so much to choose from, fresh and great quality, Irish full breakfast yummy!! Would definitly recommend a true friendly Irish welcome!",5,2013,01,16
236,Great Location!,Very centrally located near all the shopping you could ever want. Tons of great restaurants and pubs all around. Hotel staff very helpful! The only negative I would say is that the price was a bit on the higher end other then that it was a great place to stay! ,4,2013,01,13
236,Fabulous Hotel with excellent staff and service,"Moved to this hotel having booked originally at Druys Christchurch (rated as third world at best) - just no comparison. From pulling up in the taxi outside and being greeted by the concierge Connor to the way we were greeted at reception was just excellent. Such a friendly hotel. My wife and I had 3 good nights just before Christmas and will certainly be going back this coming December 13. 

Visited again this week on business and Lindsay on reception had made a great effort to get me an early check in. Really cannot recommend this hotel enough and it could not be better situated for Grafton Steet and some great restaurants.",5,2013,01,11
236,Great staff!,"We were guests at Brooks Hotel over the holidays, and if you know anything about traveling in the UK over Christmas and New Year's, it is that NEARLY EVERYTHING shuts down for at least two days.

Well, at Brooks Hotel, the staff carried on to make it a most enjoyable stay, and there is no request that was not met with a smile and ""can do"" attitude (such as supplying a DVD in a ""regular"" room). Kudos! 

I'll add that, as Americans used to rooms that are larger than the typical European hotel room, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the bedrooms; the internet worked perfectly; the facilities were nice. And, though on the side of being expensive, the restaurant is especially good, again with excellent service. I should also point out that the location in Dublin could not be better.

If/when we return to Dublin, our choice will be Brooks Hotel!",5,2013,01,10
236,Good hotel in great location.,"Booked thru Hotels.com. Service is fine if not a little robotic, great concierge who walks around and talks to the guests and give little tips and hint´s about shopping and restaurants.

The hotel is in an older style and a bit worn but all in all a great place to stay.

The restaurant and bar seems to be run by someone else and is very unorganised and the breakfast is not great or very exiting, the bar managed to run out of Guinness on two separate occasions?

It's not 5* but nice and cozy.",4,2013,01,07
236,Couldn't be better,"We booked a short stay in Dublin in order to see in the New Year. Throughout our stay the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was large and very well furnished. We didn't need the choice of special pillows as the bed was very comfortable and the location so quiet. The location was perfect for exploring the city too - just a few minutes on foot to Temple Bar, Grafton St etc. The breakfast had a great selection and was very well presented, though at busy times it could get a bit frantic. If you don't want to eat at the restuarant then good bar meals are available and of course there are plenty of other places within 5 mins walk. Would definately stay there again.",5,2013,01,07
236,Central yet quiet,"Lovely, quality hotel, with old-fashioned standards of decor (abounding in mahogany and a concierge's corner) but right up to date with facilities. Not the best outlook, being opposite a multi-storey carpark (we chose a room at the back, which has no road at all going by), but incredibly convenient just outside Grafton Street, so close to all the sights. Bedroom capacious and very well-equipped, including tea and coffee facility, hairdryer etc, comfy (and huge) double bed, and large bathroom. Staff very friendly. Quiet and tasteful residents' lounge on basement floor. Good bar with bar meals on ground floor. Relaxed, polite and relaxing. Couldn't fault it.",5,2013,01,05
236,Great rooms even BETTER! we got cupcakes on arrival YAY!!,"We checked in on new years eve and was so happy with the welcome we got .especially from the friendly irish girl..i think her name was jane ???we got a comp upgrade to a deluxe room with cupcakes on arrival which were yummy.....we went on to the st stephens green to check out the fireworks ,which didn't last that long..so we headed back to the bar ,and rang in the new year in the hotel.bar staff were lovely, i would definitley recommend this hotel.its so central and close to everything!!",5,2013,01,04
236,"Perfect location, good service and a bit old fashioned","The location cannot be any better. Just 200 meters from Temple Bar but in a quiet street 
The rooms are clean and a bit old fashioned, perfectly in the old Irish/British style
Breakfast is good but a bit over priced if not included in the room rate",5,2013,01,01
236,We can't wait to come back.,"We had the pleasure of finding the Brooks Hotel when traveling in September. We were in Ireland for the first time and had plans to attend the American football game on September 1, 2012. Unfortunately I broke my ankle in Galway and we arrived in Dublin discouraged because we were staying at a B & B with no elevator. My husband walked into the Brooks Hotel and we were fortunate to get a room. Conor, the hotel concierge, was excellent. He found us a rolling chair that we used to get me to and from the game safely. He found us bigger cabs to accommodate my temporary disability and all around made the trip so much more pleasant. The waiter, Noel, in the hotel restaurant was also great fun. The food was excellent, the room very comfortable. the location ideal, we felt lucky to happen upon the hotel and look forward to returning. we'll recommend the Brooks to our friends!",5,2013,01,01
236,Quaint Hotel Close to Everything,Very nice older hotel very close to almost everything in Dublin. Best part of the hotel is the staff - extremely friendly and helpful. The concierge will provide great recommendation on dinner and sites to visit. I would definitely stay here again when I visit Dublin.,4,2012,12,28
236,How Soon Can We Go Back?,"We recently spent five nights at Brooks Hotel and had an excellent visit. The front desk staff is exceptionally friendly and efficient. I arrived early in the morning, before the room was ready, and they immediately took my bags, ushered me to a cozy sitting room with free computers and brought me a cup of tea. Heaven! Our room was comfortable, with every amenity we could have wanted except bathrobes. The room was clean and pleasant, with a nice bed and plenty of hot water.Breakfast was excellent, with friendly service and a good selection of buffet items and cooked meals.  I would love to have had a newspaper left outside the door in the morning, but they were always available for free in the lobby when you went down for breakfast. The location cannot be beat, on a quiet street a few steps from Grafton St., St. Stephen's Green and many fabulous shops and sights. We were there just before Christmas, and the decorations were beautiful inside the hotel and throughout the neighborhood. Magical. How soon can we go back?",5,2012,12,26
236,Superb,"This hotel will take some beating. Situated in an ideal location just off Grafton Street. Plenty of excellent restaurants nearby. The hotel was very clean. The deluxe rooms have a fridge, which came in very useful. Excellent food emporium around the corner Fallon and Byrne, almost like Londons Fortnum and Mason. Breakfast was excellent, wide choice, white linen tablecloths and a combination of buffet and waiter service. Nice quiet bar and a quiet lounge on the ground floor, a nice spot for some quiet reading. Reception staff were very efficient. Would stay again.",5,2012,12,22
236,Top class,"We stayed for a long weekend 14-17th December.
The welcome was excellent - the concierge knew all our names on the first day, was extremely friendly helpful and knowledgeable as were all the staff. The rooms were clean and comfortable with a super king size bed and tea making facilities. 
It was very busy in the bar due to the Christmas period but there is a lovely residents' lounge with a small annexe with Internet access and the bar staff are happy to serve there. 
We ate in Francesca's restaurant on the first night and the food was excellent with hearty portions and a good atmosphere.
The hotel is also very central.
We were very impressed and will visit again. We can recommend highly.",5,2012,12,21
236,Perfect!,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip and another 2 at the end. Booked 2 rooms for us and our 20-something girls. The hotel was awesome...great location, very stylish, nice rooms, delicious breakfast...just perfect. Located close to Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Connor is amazing. The man remembers every single person's name - including one of our visiting friends - and he's just a wealth of formation and help...true Irish hospitality. I did a lot of research before booking and was very, very pleased with our selection. The staff was also very helpful with booking a car through Enterprise, who dropped off and picked up at the hotel. Book this! You won't be sorry!",5,2012,12,18
236,Superb Hotel,"I have had the chance to stay at the Brooks hotel many a times for work and praise this hotel on its lovely decor, fabulous food and friendly staff. Every time i have had the best night sleep and the beds were extremely comfy. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin in the future.",5,2012,12,12
236,"Location, Style, & Staff","We just spent the better part of a week at the Brooks. From the phone calls we made ahead of our visit and throughout our stay, the front desk, concierge, and cleaning staff could not have been more pleasant, personable, or professional. The Brooks' location is excellent: beautiful central setting, plunked in the heart of Dublin. The hotel itself is tastefully decorated -elegant without being excessive- and very clean. A special thanks to concierge Connor! We feel as though we lucked into a wonderful place to stay.",5,2012,12,11
236,Benchmark for all Hotels,"We have just returned from a weekend break to Dublin and I have to say the Brooks Hotel is a fantastic hotel. All the staff were friendly and attentive,but not overpowering or "" in your face"", the Hotel  on a whole was stylish,clean and comfy,modern but with a feel  like you were stepping back in time, fantastic location just off of the top of Grafton St so whilst being right in the heart of everything south of the river it still wasnt too noisy at night. The only time we ate at the Hotel was for breakfast..fantastic combination of continental style breakfast and cooked full Irish on offer,all served fresh.. on reflection I wish we had had dinner there one evening, oh well another time maybe.  Even a minor problem upon checking out,had made two reservations and the PC hadnt linked them together was solved efficiently If I was to return to Dublin then this would be the first hotel I would look to stay at!",5,2012,12,11
236,"Exceptional Service, Comfort, and Location","In a word the Brooks Hotel is quite exceptional. The service staff is on-point to provide outstanding attention the moment you book your room and then walk through their doors. The reservation staff, Ms. Fitzpatrick and Ms. Forrester, were both highly attentive to my initial reservation requests and were most kind in offering advice and an upgrade of rooms to honor my wife's and my wedding anniversary. Upon arrival we had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Connor O'Connell who is truly one of the finest concierges I've had the pleasure to meet. Thank you Connor for making my wife's and my stay in Dublin special. The reception desk staff is prompt, attentive, and quite efficient in their operations. Always smiling and quick to provide assistance each of the reception attendants were quite impressive. Now for the rooms and dining services.

The rooms in the Brooks Hotel are quite spacious by European standards and to be quite frank exceed the size of many U.S. hotel properties. The rooms are well-appointed and tastefully decorated. The bedding is comfortable and we found that the lines were always crisp and clean. The room's restroom was quite nice with a separate bathtub and shower. The towels, soap, shampoo, and other toiletries provided were of high quality. Much like the concierge and reception staff, the housekeeping staff are clearly quite good at their jobs as we found the rooms to be fresh and clean upon arrival and throughout the week were always extraordinarily well maintained. 

The dining facilities at the Brook's Hotel are nicely situated and convenient. I appreciated how the dining area for the breakfast service was separated from the noon and evening meal dining areas. In particular the Jasmine Bar area made for a nice location to relax in the afternoon and evening as it was separated from the main dining areas. The breakfast service was quite friendly and attentive. The wait staff was always quick to greet and provide prompt attentive service. My wife and I found the breakfast foods to be very good. The prepared to order menu items were extensive and delicious. In addition, the cold buffet items were always fresh and enticing. 

The location of the Brook's Hotel is quite excellent. Only a few blocks from Grafton Street (shopping and dining), Suffolk Street (tourism office and day tours), Temple Bar (restaurants and bars) and all city centre areas you will find yourself perfectly situated within Dublin for all your tourism sites. Should you need assistance on booking a tour, finding a location, or simply looking for advice you can be sure that Mr. O'Connell will be quick to offer his assistance. Should Mr. O'Connell be unavailable the other concierge staff and of course reception staff are definitely well prepared and informed.

The only recommendation for improvement that I might offer the management of the Brook's Hotel is to upgrade the fitness facility. While the sauna is nice it is evident that the fitness equipment is in need of an upgrade and perhaps even relocating the fitness facility to a larger area. There is also a need to be more attentive to the towel and water service in the facility. Lest I end on a negative note allow me to say that even though the fitness facility needed attention it was adequate to meet my daily workout routine needs.  

There is no question that the Brook's Hotel is my lodging property of choice for future visits to Dublin. I am truly impressed and most definitely a loyal customer for the Brooks.",4,2012,12,10
236,Just perfect,"Location, Staff, Rooms, everything ... a lovely lovely 4 star hotel which is just perfect for a short stay in Dublin. I really could not ask for more. Yes, you can go better and spend £££££s but for a little bit of luxury at an affordable price, this is the one to go for. If I go back to Dublin, I will only stay here! Thank you guys.",5,2012,12,09
236,"Attention to detail, excellent staff, great location","I stayed here for one night and I was sorry I wasn't able to stay longer. The location on the south side of the city centre meant all the main attractions were within easy reach. The staff were incredibly friendly and efficient. The rooms were comfortable and stylish, I liked the use of original artwork on the walls. They also had some really nice thoughtful touches,  for instance there was a really cozy reading room and they provided a selection of reading glasses. Overall a very positive experience.",5,2012,12,05
236,I'll never stay anywhere in Dublin but here!,"Quick, friendly check-in followed by a wonderful experience with the concierge who never held his hand out for a tip.  (But we tipped him anyway of course!)  They have a nice lounge for guests to use and this came in very handy since we arrived early and our room wasn't ready.  There's a knitting group that meets there every Thursday evening if you're into any yarn crafts.  The breakfast is only 10 euros in spite of the prices on the menu.  Incredible breakfast!  Definitely try the porridge!",5,2012,12,03
236,Great location!,"My mom and I were on a quick overnight in Dublin before we made our way to Co. Mayo the next day, so we hadn't planned a long stay in the hotel. 

Check-in was quick and efficient. We were greeted warmly and it made us feel welcome after a long day of traveling. The room itself was relatively large, as was the bathroom (a huge plus for two women traveling together!). The shower was wonderful but the hairdryer was a total miss (some weird contraption on the wall that barely blew anything out but weak hot air). 

The location was fantastic! We were able to walk to the Temple Bar area in a matter of 10 minutes without a problem for a pub crawl we went on that night. With that being said, we arrived back at the hotel late at night, pretty drunk. Admittedly we'd had too much of a good time and it was pretty evident when we called down for room service. Unfortunately the beer got the better of us because we were a fit of giggles. The room service attendant on the other line waiting for our order was not impressed or amused and asked us to call back. We never did; he seemed more annoyed than understanding (we're in Ireland after all, surely you've dealt with drunks before?!). 

At breakfast the next morning, we had to flag down a server for coffee and toast, which was a little unnerving considering that everyone else had been served with toast and coffee except us. There was also something clumpy in the cream at the table, so I wasn't able to enjoy coffee at all that morning (bummer). 

Check out was good, with a very sweet front desk clerk who patiently explained our bill and offered to hold our luggage during breakfast. She also was helpful in calling a cab for us to the rental car location. 

I would probably stay at Brooks again when back in Dublin, based on the location alone. I wish we'd had more time at the hotel to really enjoy everything else, but alas, our journey kept us moving and shaking",4,2012,12,02
236,Great hotel in a good location,"Spent one night in the hotel as I wanted somewhere central as was meeting up with some friends for the weekend. The hotel is in an excellent location and enjoyed the stay. Arrived early Saturday and although the rooms weren't ready yet, checked in quickly and was told my case would be taken up to the room when it was ready.

We spent some time in the Jasmine bar in the afternoon which was a lovely location and the breakfast in the morning couldn't be faulted. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel was great and the only fault I could find was the fact that the location of the power sockets in the room could have been better (only one free which was underneath the dressing table in the room).

Would definitely stay here again next time I am in Dublin.",5,2012,11,30
236,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed in Brooks Hotel, and it was exceptional! Very clean, Breakfast was delicious. My husband lost his wallet on the flight to Ireland, and the Reception staff at Brooks Hotel were incredibly helpful in providing us with all necessary contact information and making various calls and updating us on any information- Extremely wonderful service. 

Thank you very much!",5,2012,11,27
236,Easy To Recommend But Hard To Return,"We arrived at the Brooks Hotel early in the morning after taking a red-eye flight from the States.  The desk clerk was helpful and friendly, which was important due to our lack of sleep.  Although our room was not ready, they stored our luggage while we toured Dublin on the hop on/off bus.  When we returned in the afternoon, the room was ready.  It was on the sixth floor looking onto Drury Street.  Others have commented on noise coming from the busy street below.  Drury is not a busy street and we had no problem here with the street noise.  We considered the room to be average-sized by American standards and was nicely furnished.  The included breakfast the next morning was either from a menu or buffet.  The full Irish breakfast was good as was the service.  Parking was at a pay lot a couple of blocks away.  When I paid for the parking at a machine at the neighboring mall, the amount was much more than described by the front desk at the hotel.  When I went to the customer service counter at the parking lot, they refunded me about 2/3 of the parking fee.  While getting the car, my wife had a very pleasant conversation with the bellman about American rock music and I asked him about Irish music when I returned.  We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and since its location is central to so much that one would want to see and do in Dublin, this is an easy place to recommend.  When we returned to Dublin for our return flight home, we tried booking this hotel for our last two night but it was regrettably already booked.",4,2012,11,22
236,Excellent experience,"My son and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend break in Dublin in November. I can't fault it. Everything  went perfectly from check-in to  departure, friendly staff, attractive lounge and good location - 10 mins walk from most of the major sites and all else accessible by bus. Only slight problem was that I found the room a bit hot at nioght (but that's probably me as I like sleeping in a cool room). Would definitely stay here again and also recommend to others for business or leisure trips.",5,2012,11,22
236,"Location, Location, Location","We arrived at the Brooks Hotel at 10:30 am after an overnight flight from Philadelphia.  Our room, an upgrade, was ready for us which was wonderful.  The hotel is perfectly located so you can walk everywhere within a short period of time.  The breakfasts were delicious and the staff very accommodating.  I would recommend Boulevard Cafe for lunch, Gogarty's and Il Baccaro for dinner.  Book of Kells within Trinity College is fascinating.  If we ever traveled to Dublin again, we would stay at the Brooks Hotel.",5,2012,11,20
236,I had a room with a view but not in a good way,The hotel itself is in a fantastic location and the room was great. On arrival they told me I had a free upgrade...it was late in the evening and the curtains were already closed. During the night I could hear a strange humming noise but put it down to the air con. In the morning when I opened the curtains I noticed I had what can only be described as a full air conditioning system for the hotel outside my window. They did try and cover some of this with some nice plants. So if they offer you an upgrade to room 101 say thanks but no thanks.,4,2012,11,19
236,Special weekend,Have just returned from a wonderful weekend in Dublin to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. The hotel was very warm and welcoming and a little haven in the middle of a busy city. We were upgraded to a deluxe room (309) and had no complaints with it at all. The bed was very comfortable and huge! Great location close enough to everything but not noisy. Good pub at the end of the street - The Hairy Lemon. Great atmosphere and great staff. All in all we would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2012,11,19
236,Great choice. Fab location!,"I'm a big vacation researcher, so I looked into a lot of hotels before finding The Brooks, and I'm so glad I did. My husband and I have traveled extensively and have gotten a bit spoiled by staying in some very nice hotels on business, so we knew we didn't want to cut corners, but we certainly weren't looking to blow our savings on our first foray to Ireland. Brooks fit the bill. 
First of all, the LOCATION is really ideal for exploring the city. Temple Bar, Grafton St., Christchurch Cathedral, Trinity College and the Book of Kells- all are right nearby. We took a cab to the Guiness Storehouse, but it was walkable as well (maybe in warmer weather). The neighborhood is vibrant and safe, with plenty of pubs, restaurants, take-away counters (don't miss Lemon- the crepe and coffee place on the corner), shops and boutiques.  We paid in advance and got the room-only rate, which I recommend. You can do the Irish breakfast thing at your next countryside inn or B&B- in Dublin I think it's best to grab a bite when you get out to explore.
ROOM-wise, we were pleased. We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip, so we had the opportunity to see two different rooms. The first, 601, was small (to be expected for the primo location), but well appointed and comfortable. It's standard practice in UK and Ireland for two twin beds to be pushed together to make a king, and even though I understand the motivation, I think I'll always find it annoying. Be prepared to unplug the radio or tv to charge your cellphone. Alas, the complete lack of free outlets was another trend we noticed traveling the country. 601's bathroom was huge and well laid-out, though I'd love to recommend those crescent shower rungs to make the shower a bit more comfortable (I'm rather petite, and I peeled the curtain off of myself more than once. Too much information??). I'd also recommend they welcome the hairdryer to the 21st century and maybe make an upgrade there. But we were there for 3 nights and all in all, felt very at home. Our second room, 514, was very similar, with a tad more space in the room, and a more average size bathroom. 
OVERALL, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to those exploring Dublin's city center. Visit Merchant's Arch pub in Temple Bar (by the Ha'penny bridge), San Lorenzo's on Great George's Street for lunch or dinner, Accent right around the corner on Lower Stephens is great for cappuccino in the morning, and a terrific ladies' boutique the opposite direction on Stephens (on way to Grafton St.). Really just wander- you can't go wrong.",4,2012,11,17
236,A beautiful hotel within walking distance of most Dublin attractions,"We arrived on a rainy evening and were warmly greeted by many staff members upon entering. Very professional, dedicated and helpful staff. Nice restaurant and bar. Freshly prepared food. Great breakfast offering with the B&B plan. Hotel had a rich classy feel. Room felt a little cramped, but still very good.",5,2012,11,15
236,"So good, we rebooked!","After a loooong flight from Australia, we booked into this beautiful hotel in a fantastic location in Dublin for 2 nights.
Our room was so clean and comfortable and the breakfast was the probably one of the best we had all through the UK and Europe!
The staff, reception, concierge and restaurant - were all professional and attentive.
We returned for one night before we left Ireland, and were given an upgrade to another lovely room - again a very comfortable bed and nights' stay!
Would return in a heart beat!",5,2012,11,14
236,Perfect hotel in perfect location,"This is a fab hotel with extremely good staff.  The rooms are nice and comfortable and the residents lounge is superb.  The bar and restaurant are good. The consierge is very attentive and a wealth of knowledge.  The location is great, grafton st one way for shopping and Dame st the other  for nightlife.  Well definitely be back!",5,2012,11,14
236,"Godd situation, friendly staff but hard bed","This is a really nice hotel with wonderfully friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was good - all hot food being made freshly rather than on a self-serve basis. In fact, I would have given the place a higher rating if it had not been for the bed - it was rock hard. I only managed to sleep by wrapping myself in the duvet so that I had a layer underneath me to take the edge off.",3,2012,11,11
236,Great find,"Recently here on business as my usual place was full.  Really comfortable, solid quality rooms.  Friendly staff, pleasant place, will be back soon. Loved the little radio

I only had breakfast, which was fine, I didn't have anything cooked.",5,2012,11,10
236,Very Enjoyable Stay,"We had a lovely two nights at the hotel. It started beautifully with a warm welcome at the desk and even though it was only 11 a.m. (early flight from the UK), our room was ready. The room was very nicely decorated and unlike another review I've just seen, the bathroom light switch was right outside the bathroom door. We did have a TV that didn't function, but it was quickly replaced when we told the desk of our plight. 

The hotel has a nice option of choosing one of four types of pillows, and I appreciated that small touch. The downstairs reading room/business centre was beautiful and usually empty - a very cosy spot to relax or catch up with some work.

The location is ideal for the centre of Dublin. It's a short walk to just about everywhere. There are a great many shops and good restaurants right around the corner.",4,2012,11,09
236,excellent location,"This hotel could not be in a more perfect location to explore Dublin city centre. With a few minutes walk to temple bar, trinity college and lots of fantastic shops and restaurants there was no where else i'd want to stay.

We were met by very polite staff on our arrival, and their concierge is a charming chap. The rooms are comfortable and clean.

The only negative thing i have to say is the eggs at breakfast are poor. I went for the egg and soldiers in the morning to be welcomed by a very hard egg, and 3 very small bread type things. My boyfriend had poached eggs and was also disappointed by how hard they were.

However, the next day I steered off the cooked food and i ate from the buffet and it was fantastic - excellent fruit options, yoghurt, pastries and bread.

So i would recommend to stay in this hotel when visiting Dublin, but don't have eggs for breakfast!",4,2012,11,08
236,Good but not Great,"I booked this hotel through SLH and was entitled to a free upgrade on arrival. My husband and I were with friends and they were upgraded too. However, the upgrade was disappointing. I had booked a Deluxe Room and was upgraded to an Executive Room. My friends were upgraded to a Deluxe Room. Their room was much nicer than mine. Their room had been decorated in a lovely art-deco style while my room was filled with plain wood furniture, reminiscent of a boardroom. So while their room was cosy, sumptuous and very comfortable to be in, mine felt cold and spartan. The only differences between the 2 rooms that I could see were that I had a bath in mine, with a separate walk-in shower (they had no bath), and a TV in the bathroom on the wall at the end of the bath. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to enjoy watching TV in the bath because the TV was broken. Some of the lights in our room didn't work and when we settled down to sleep, we discovered that 1 pesky hall light remained on. So we had to take the room key out of the wall socket to ensure that light turned off - but this also meant that the aircon didn't work. 

Onto the Bar - great cocktails but be prepared for a long wait. We waited 10 minutes before anyone came along to serve us and then another 20 minutes before our cocktails arrived (and the bar wasn't that busy).

Breakfast - great variety, lovely pastries et al but the hot food we ordered came to the table cold. 

Location - absolutely fantastic; you cannot knock it. So close to Temple Bar with Grafton Street a few minutes away. Fabulous location.

Parking - we parked in the public car park across the road and it was pricey, despite the hotel's validation. 30 Euro for less than 24 hours. But this is central Dublin after all.

Overall, I liked Brooks Hotel in that it was convenient and a solid 4 star hotel. But I won't be rushing back because this is definitely not a Small Luxury Hotel.",4,2012,11,08
236,"Perfect location, however....","My last stay at The Brooks was my third stay there in 18 months. I will be in Dublin again next month but I am not staying at The Brooks this trip. Why? My last stay at The Brooks was a disappointment compared to previous trips. I needed a double room with separate beds. The Brooks gave us a double room with twin beds shoved together on a king size bed frame. So essentially I was sleeping in the same bed with my adult son. Not cool, given I have been there, asked for what we needed was guaranteed they could provide two beds. Not so much. We made do. The room was on the back side of the hotel over the dumpsters, it was very stuffy and no way to get air circulation in the room unless you open the window to smell the dumpsters. Also for $180 a night the bathroom door needs to function perfectly, not need a door stop to keep it open when you want it open. For $180 a night in what is meant to be a 4 star hotel, the bathroom light switch should be IN THE BATHROOM NOT ACROSS THE WAY IN THE TEA CUPBOARD, that was far too frustrating for 4 stars and the price of the room. I do give The Brooks all the stars in the heavens for staff, Conor and Marvin are the best in the business. The front desk staff are like family greeting you when you come in the door. The location is perfect. The Jasmine bar is the best place for lunch or for afternoon tea in the Dublin 2 district in my opinion. I wanted to make The Brooks my Dublin home as I am there no less than once a year and usually 2 to 3 times a year but for MY money, I'm changing it up this next trip. Sorry guys.",3,2012,11,07
236,perfection !!,"Myself and 2 girl friends had arranged a trip to dublin 5 months ago. On arrival we were let done by the hotel we had originally booked and subsequently cancelled the booking on arrival. By chance came across Brooks Hotel and made enquires about a triple room. What a find !!! We were greeted with what I would describe as a real Irish Welcome ! All the staff at reception were very attentive but the award for being outstanding must go to Anna Kinsella. From our arrival to subsequent interactions with Anna, we always found her to be friendly, kind and really interested in us as guests. Aware of our rather disappointing start to our trip at our original hotel, every effort was made by all staff to make us comfortable. We were at the hotel ahead of checkin, so the room was not yet ready. We were shown to a very comfortable private lounge and served refreshments. 
Shortly after our room being available, housekeeping delivered some beautiful cookies with a welcome note. We had a slight mishap in the bathroom and could not fault the quick response that we had from the housekeeping staff, again not enough could be done to help us.
The hotel is ideally situated for all the sights, and some excellent recommendations were made for restaurants. 
The breakfast was first class. A buffet selection of breads, pastries, fruit meats and cheeses were available. The cooked breakfast was cooked to order. We were seated close to the open kitchen, in my experience this is always a sign of a good kitchen. As soon as a breakfast was ready, there was a member of staff to serve it. I did comment on the amount of attentive staff that were serving throughout breakfast, something that can be lacking in some hotels. 
Dublin is somewhere that I visit often, Brooks Hotel is somewhere that I would definitely recommend and stay at again. I am looking forward to my next visit !",5,2012,11,05
236,Great Hotel fro central Dublin,"Super bedrooms, cool bar and 5 minutes away from everything!
I have been here twice with groups and service is great, parking is no problem and it really stands out as a member of Small leading Hotels",5,2012,11,05
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin - Excellent Hotel & Breakfast first class!,"Travelled to Dublin to attend a family evening event, however was looking to stay somewhere which was within walking distance of Temple bar but was not over run with Stag and Hen parties.
Brooks hotel ticked all the boxes!

Rooms were tastefully decorated and spotless. Housekeeping could not have been more attentive. Bar and reception equally as well staffed, decorated and maintained.

Bar and lounge had a lovely atmosphere both for a coffee and a scone during the afternoon or in the evening for a glass of wine or a guiness.

Breakfast was excellent with every taste catered for.
My partner had the full Irish breakfast experience both mornings of our stay and I tried the kippers and then the scrambled egg and smoked salmon.
Both were presented and delivered faultlessly with the endless amounts of pastries and fresh fruits and yoghurts ensuring you are well fuelled for a days walking around the City Centre.

Could not praise this hotel enough.
We are a young couple (age range 30-40) and so I would say this hotel would appeal to all ages who appreciate great service, good food and lovely surroundings.",5,2012,11,05
236,Great Hotel,"We were stranded due to the storm in NYC, so I booked this hotel on the train kind of blindly. Best thing that I did. The value for money is tops, great staff, clean comfortable rooms, reliable (free) wi-fi. And in a great neighborhood in central Dublin. 

V nice I Will stay here again.",4,2012,11,01
236,Impressive 4 star hotel!,"We booked a deluxe double and were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Don't get me wrong, the room was fine, a little on the small side with all the mod cons you would imagine. However, I don't think the difference between a deluxe room and a junior suite is worthy to be classed as an upgrade. Yes it had a small balcony (with one chair and a view of an NCP carpark) and a Tv in the bathroom (which didn't work) and apparently it's bigger (??? I asked to view a deluxe double which I personally thought was bigger and a bit more plush, but I may be wrong) but if I'd paid the junior suite price I'd have been very disappointed and would have made a complaint. Having said this, it was a complimentary upgrade so I shouldn't whinge-it's just I didn't think it was any better than the room style I'd paid for! The air con didn't seem to be working either. We tried a few different 
things but nothing seemed to make a difference to the temperature!

Service can't be faulted. The staff we dealt with were all very professional, very helpful and courteous. We had breakfast on the first morning which was very good. They were able to provide gluten-free bread for my husband-but bread was the only thing offered. Their sausages  are already gluten free.

The communal areas are very nice. The residents lounge (with free computer and net access) is very relaxing and the seating areas around the bar and restaurant areas are stylish and comfy. The free WiFi throughout the hotel was excellent. It was a stable and speedy connection.

We would definitely return to Brooks Hotel as we were impressed with the location, cleanliness and excellent service.",4,2012,11,01
236,A Little Jewel,"This boutique hotel in the middle of Dublin is a find to be remembered. The location is excellent, in easy walking distance of all the sights, Temple Bar, St. Patricks, Trinity College, the museums and more. The staff, from receptionist, to doorman, to server is most friendly and helpful. We arrived from the airport at 8 in the morning and although we'd requested early check-in, we didn't expect being able to get in until at least 1 p.m., but we were exhausted. They led us to a comfortable private lounge,  served us coffee and by 10 were able to put us in a lovely room. It was good sized for European standards with coffee/tea service in room and the bath, though also smallish, had a wonderful shower. You can order the type of pillows you prefer from a ""menu"" at no extra cost. Plus, it has AC if the weather would call for it. 
The breakfasts are huge and very good. Cooked to order. They make their own pastries and their brown soda bread is special. The fashionable restaurant also served dinner or you can eat more casually in the attractive bar.",5,2012,10,30
236,Very nice hotel,"Just stayed here on our honeymoon and this hotel was really nice.  The location is pretty good and close to lots of shops, a daily market and restaurants.  Just a few minutes walk from Temple Bar.  The hotel does a turn down service and even left a heart made out of rose petals on our bed for us.  The breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very nice and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Would stay here again.",5,2012,10,29
236,2nd visit to Brooks and still as good as the first time!,I stayed at the Brooks Hotel 3 years ago and have to say it was just as good as I remembered!  Really fantastic hotel in a prime part of Dublin that makes it easier to get to every part of Dublin you'd want to visit!,5,2012,10,29
236,"Great location, not best for business","I stayed in this hotel for four nights. The location is great, right in the heart of Dublin. I was in the fourth floow, and could not hear the noise from the streets. There was, however, some noise from other rooms and the corridor. The room had an AC, but it was also a little noisy.

This hotel is not ideal for business for two reasons: the free wifi was unstable which made it impossible to maintain a VPN connection. The closet had a very short clothes rail making it hard to fit a suit, jacket and a few shirts.

The service was very friendly.",3,2012,10,27
236,Right in the heart of it...,"Stayed on business on a couple of occasions. Service great, and like the choice of pillows and Pecksniffs toileteries.

Breakfast cooked to order or buffet excellent, as is the restaurant in the evening.

Will stay again and would not hesitate in recommending...",4,2012,10,24
236,city break,"We enjoyed an anniversary city break recently in Brooks . We had been twice before and because of our previous great experience it was an easy choice to return. It is right in the heart of Dublin with easy parking across the road from it, but the real jewel in its crown are the staff. Always attentive and helpful. The rooms and food are also first class, Totally recommended'",5,2012,10,23
236,Solid Hotel in a Solid Location,"I spent one evening at the Brooks Hotel in October. I picked the hotel because it was within walking distance of the city-center location of my morning meeting. The staff were friendly and professional, and I had the idea that one girl was genuinely sorry that she didn't know the answer to my question. In room wifi was fast and easy to connect to. The bed was fine, if not spectacular. And the location is perfect: you're within walking distance of everything you could want to do in two days in Dublin. I also got the impression that there were quite a few people staying for much longer who were satisfied using the Brooks as their base.

My only 'complaint?' Only 12 channels on the tv. But that just made my decision to read at night easier.",4,2012,10,23
236,Bit of a miss,"Staff were pleasant but neglected to tell us the parking lot is closed on Sunday mornings (when we needed to leave for the airport).  A 40 euro fee to open the gates...and they were not very helpful.  So they forgot to tell us that- nothing worse than hearing someone say 'but we tell everyone ...' when you know damn well they didn't.
Walls are a bit thin and we heard every alarm that went off. Not bad if you were already planning to get up at 6:15 every morning while on holiday... They also direct you to some local pubs- not bad, some other really good ones around too- so you really can't go wrong. Not terrible, just not a good experience there.",3,2012,10,17
236,Good central location,"Visited with friends. Nice reception area, friendly desk staff, easy check in. 
Rooms boutique style, clean, warm, old fashioned but quaint decor. Beds comfortable and there's a pillow menu for guests to choose from. Our room was on the first floor overlooking a multi storey car park and must say the street below was noisy until about 4 am. Our friends in the adjacent room felt the same.The second night was much quieter and we slept better as a result. Hairdryers in bathroom are peculiar and didn't work well at all. When I mentioned this at reception they supplied a hand held normal dryer which was much better and in my opinion should be standard in all rooms in a hotel of this quality.
Breakfast was fine, choice of cereals, fruit, cheese meats etc and cooked food available on request. Service lacking at breakfast, rather than being taken away our plates soon piled high as waiters didn't seem to notice. 
Bar area was cosy and pleasant, we enjoyed a night cap there before bedtime.",4,2012,10,16
236,Good central location,"Stayed at Brooks Hotel at the end of September for three nights.  It is in a great location to enjoy all the sights and shops Dublin has to offer but has the benefit of not being on one of the main streets which can be very noisy at night.  Rooms very clean and had all the amenities you would want, with nice bathrooms and an abundance of good quality toiletries.

Breakfast was great, especially the full Irish and eating that each morning meant little need for lunch!  Also ate one evening in the restaurant with friends which was very good.  Only complaint would be slow service one evening with only one member of staff behind the bar and one waiter in the restaurant.  However those on duty worked tirelessly and it wasn't a great problem.

Dublin a great place for a long weekend and can recommend the Guinness Storehouse and afternoon tea at the Shelbourne Hotel",5,2012,10,14
236,A Craic-ing hotel,"This is a great hotel, in a central location close to Gtafton Street, St Stephen's Green, Temple Bar and the University. The perfect spot to explore Dublin by foot. Very comfy rooms and you get a choice of differently-textured pillows! The hearty breakfast alone is worth booking for but it is the thoughtful and helpful staff who really make this a special place. We really enjoyed our stay here.",5,2012,10,11
236,Comfortable night in the city centre,"ideal for a trip where you want to be right in the city centre and close to a lot of sightseeing, entertainment and shopping. Very comfortable room. On 5th floor so away from the noise of traffic. Parking across the street. ",4,2012,10,11
236,Stayed twice in five years and it is still a perfect place to stay,"We have stayed here twice in five years after the long haul flights from Australia to Dublin.  Both times impressed with the rooms, the service, the breakfast, the peace and quiet.  A really lovely boutique hotel centrally located that is always bustling with people coming and going.  A terrific place to get some sleep and gather yourself as you explore Ireland after several long flights.  The breakfast is the most appealing for my husband - you have to try the full cooked breakkie.  The hotel is a short walk from everything in central Dublin - Grafton St, Trinity College, Book of Kells.  Locations is close to restaurants and shops.  Very handy.",5,2012,10,11
236,"Great location, wonderful rooms & staff","My husband and I spent two nights at the Brooks Hotel at the beginning of a 8 day trip driving through Ireland. This hotel was fantastic! We arrived around 10 am (due to an early morning landing) and the hotel had our room ready early so we were able to nap. The location is great, easy walking distance to most everything and near many good pubs and restaurants. The beds were very comfortable and the entire hotel was very clean. The breakfast buffet in the morning was good, but may not be worth paying much extra for. The staff was wonderful and helped us with any needs. Lindsay at the front desk gave us a great dinner recommendation which was nearby, Darwins. Overall a great, comfortable, clean stay at the Brooks Hotel. We highly recommend.",5,2012,10,09
236,No hot water either,"In addition to loud noise from the street until about four am, there was no hot water that morning. We left the hotel for a quieter one that charged €79 less per night and had a better view (not of a multi-story car park).",2,2012,10,09
236,Nice hotel tucked away in the middle of everything.,"This hotel is a little hard to find but it is truly in the middle of everything.  A few minutes to anything in Dublin.  It is very nice with an extremely professional staff (Thanks to Conner, the concierge for his help).  The rooms are beautiful and we were impressed - not the small, cramped rooms you think of in Europe.  Everything was top knotch.  Very quiet too.",5,2012,10,08
236,loved the brooks,"just spent 2 nites here. only one minor complaint- when we went to check in there was only one person working the desk and there were a few people on the line. after we were done with the check in process- there were about 5 people behind us- who did not look too happy.

other than that- great location- we walked all over- trinity college, temple bar,grafton street, river liffey etc

very comfy room- we had a deluxe double with the romance package- entitled us to free prosecco and chocolates plus a free 3 course dinner one nite- and it was the same price as if we just reserved a room. the dinner in the dining room was surprisingly tasty as well.

the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, internet was effortless and the windows to the room opened easily so we could get a little fresh air- we were on the 6th floor so we had a cityscape view.

would totally recommend.",5,2012,10,02
236,"Great location,very comfortable and hospitable","Only stayed one night, but we were upgraded to a lovely room. Very spacious and nicely furnished. Most impressive were members of the staff, especially Conor who gave us wonderful suggestions on things to do and arranged for our transportation to the airport.  Walking distance to great shopping, Trinity College, wonderful restaurants. Would definitely stay again!",5,2012,10,01
236,Great experience at Brooks Hotel,"I had a very inspired moment when I decided to choose Brooks Hotel for a ""girls' city-break"" and I congratulate myself for this  :-)
Location is very good,central,but very quiet, very close from Grafton Street,Temple Bar,Trinity College,Gaiety Theatre. We had two standard double rooms and due to the kindness of the staff,we got two rooms which were separated by a door,practically as a big apartment.
Rooms are not very big ,but very nicely decorated,I rememeber an old functional radio,and also very clean. Speaking of, cleanliness is definitely a strong point of the hotel,it has been absolutely irreprochable.
We had a very good quality sleep,not (only) because we were very tired,but because beds were very confortable.Have to mention that Brooks Hotel is one of the few hotels were I found a pillow 
menu,which is really a plus.
Hotel has a very nice lounge at the basement level,where you can take a coffee or tea in a special ambience,pity that we discovered it too late!
Thanks to all the staff,but especially to Claire from reservation and magic Marvin,the concierge,who made our mini-vacation very special.
About breakfast,which is a very good one,I have one thing I want to be known,it is not ment to be a critic note,but just to inform other tourists,we had a kind of unpleasant experience during week-end,when we had to leave early for some trips around Dublin and we found out that on Saturdays and Sundays timetable is different,breakfast can be served starting at 8,30,if I remember well (I hope not to misinform).Next day we ordered room service(with a small extracharge).but no hot meal is available. The point is that we didn't know about this,because I was told and I am absolutely sure that they would have done some arrangements regarding this,due to (already mentioned by me) kindness of all the staff. It is good to know this.
I can't say anything about the restaurant,because we were out all day long,but menu seemed very special. What I am pleased to mention is Jasmine bar and the nice bartender,who served us some very good cocktails.
As a conclusion,I recommend Brooks Hotel whithout any doubt,more than this,I am planning to come back :-)",4,2012,09,29
236,"Great location, warm staff, good value","The Brooks is conveniently located within walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College, and St. Stephen's Green.  Notwithstanding the hustle and bustle of the area, the hotel itself is quiet.  We stayed in a recently refurbished room which had a comfortable king size bed, flat screen television, and soothing decor.  Breakfast was very nice; well prepared and many choices, although the staff seemed to be a bit rigid which may have been due to language issues. The reception staff and the concierge were extremely gracious.  After two weeks in Ireland in a variety of accomodations, I would say that Brooks Hotel was the best, and probably the best value too.",5,2012,09,25
236,One of my top 5 hotels ever...,"Stayed at room 211 so my impressions on rooms and location are based on that room.
Area of the hotel: Extremely central, ideally located near but not too near to all the main attractions, bars, restaurants, Temple Bar area, etc. The street was a one lane, one way only street. The outside of the hotel does not show how wonderful the stay was.
It was a romantic getaway booked a couple of months in advance. The hotel was 100% full during all the nights of our stay. This fact did not affect the speed of the check-in, check-out process, nor the friendly welcome given at reception where they took the time to explain the area to us and made sure all our needs were covered (including restaurant reservations during the very busy football weekend in town)
The room was Large (capital L) with a lot of space for suitcases, clothes and more clothes (see picture), the wardrobe was massive. There was a safe, coffee making facilities, very well appointed workspace, tv (with not enough channels though), radio, minibar (to be refilled upon request), hairdrier, walk-in shower, very nice amenities (amazingly good smell), thick towels and robes, large mirror, magnifying mirror, large bathroom overall with great pressure in the shower.
The corridors were silent, even with a full hotel. The room was facing a not very pretty inner courtyard but it was really quiet and there was no noise at all. I heard some guests complaining about noise coming from the rooms at the back of the hotel... I heard nothing. The curtains were thick, but they are just curtains so,... light leaked into the room (we were lucky to have full bright sunshine days during our stay)
Big feature: Free WIFI everywhere in the hotel.
Breakfast was awesome, full buffet breakfast with the normal cold dishes plus an added menu cooked upon request included in the price of the B&B price. We got the Irish breakfast everyday... and we ended up rolling out of the restaurant every morning... we were so full!
Last but not least, service was impeccable, the room was clean, tidy, turn-down service at night, personalized service was provided and they met all our needs, even the strange ones we had (yeah, we needed some strange stuff during our stay)
No late check-out (only 1 PM) was available but it is understandable with a full hotel.
Although on the pricey side, this hotel does not fail to provide the service they announce. To be recommended without a doubt.",5,2012,09,25
236,Beautiful,"In a hectic place like Dublin it's lovely to get a luxurious homely place like brooks, dead handy for shopping and dining in the city as really central with car parking available a cross the road, the braekfast is beautiful too. ",5,2012,09,24
236,Central and efficient.,"Just a couple of nights. The longer I stayed, though, the more I enjoyed the pulse of the place. Efficient bar at the lobby, the guests always coming and going. The lively and attractive surroundings added to this impression. For breakfast I especially enjoyed the oates porridge with a touch of whiskey.
I would suggest new flatscreens for the rooms. Good value!",4,2012,09,23
236,Great stay,"A lovely hotel with a good location, breakfast and Internet included. Great friendly, helpful staff. I would recommend to others visiting Dublin.
Near to shops and other amenities. Rooms are small but comfortable.",4,2012,09,22
236,Very comfortable,"What a pleasant surprise it was to be greeted so warmly and shown to a room that was a fantastic size and had a fridge. This is the only hotel in Ireland that we stayed in that had one. Marvelous and a big tick.
This was a lovely hotel in a fantastic location and traveling with my daughter we had a large room with a king bed and a single. Perfect. 
The staff are so nice and always greet you. The concierge is very friendly.
We will be back",4,2012,09,21
236,Would stay here again,"I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel.  We had to switch rooms 2 times during our stay and the staff could not have been more accomodating.  The first time was because our travel agent accidentally booked a single bed instead of 2 beds.  The staff moved us into another lovely room.  However. at bed time we noticed the air conditioner didn't work (this was unseasonably hot weather for Dublin - about 75 degrees F or 24 degrees C.  At 2am (when we arrived home) they were ready to move us to a new room.  This was the only issue with the hotel and they were so wonderful that it didn't bother us at all.  Everyone at the front desk knew us by room number and name, and the concierge, Conner, was as friendly as can be. For a truly wonderful experience, stay at this hotel.  
Fun fact - each room has its own theme!  We loved the retro room the best :)",5,2012,09,19
236,Great Stay,"Lovely hotel in a great location - travelled with 3 friends for birthday weekend and cant really fault hotel.  Check in was a bit late due to hotel being fully booked & Manager I spoke to was a bit off with me but once we were in rooms was lovely.  Stayed in Deluxe rooms & couldn't fault them, lovely size rooms & large bathrooms - they left birthday cupcakes & cookies for us with a birthday note (although was wrote out to wrong person in party) but still great.  Reception staff were really friendly & helpful & cleaners were lovely.  Breakfast was great.  Good location for getting around & near to lovely pubs, shops & restaurants.  I had been poorly one day & my friends asked if I could have some toast sent to room & this was no problem for them.  Would definately recommend staying in this hotel & if I go back to Dublin & I would stay here again.",5,2012,09,19
236,Perfect Location,"The location is outstanding. Near grafton street, trinity college, lots of pubs, temple bar area (not in the noisy area, where i think its impossible to sleep). The staff was very polite. Had no problem with street noisy, even in the weekend. Working AC. Really recommend the hotel.",5,2012,09,18
236,great 4 star hotel in the centre of the city.highly recommended.........,"myself and three friends stayed here for a weekend . we found the hotel in a perfect position for the sightseeing buses ( highly recommened ), shops ,pubs and eateries . situated down drury lane which is a side street , so not as much heavy traffic as other hotels i saw on bus route's etc . personally i think we did well with out choice of hotel , the view was nothing to write about, but we were hardly in the room . staff were excellent in the hotel from the cleaners to bar staff and went out thier way to help . room was perfectly adequate for our needs , clean towels everyday , beds made everyday , kettle with tea and coffee facitlily's , safe , trouser press , tv and hairdryer . i did hear noise coming from a nightclub on our first night at the end of the street ( was because we were in the hotel early ) it quietened down after 2 am . breakfast was served up to 11.00 / 11.30 on weekend which we thought was great coming in at 2 ish on a weekend and 10am on a weekday .would definately go back to this hotel again and definately recommend dublin .......",5,2012,09,18
236,Great Place to Stay,"Stayed here last week for one night with my partner. We loved it every thing was excellent from the drinks in the bar to the breakfast in the morning. Great location walking distance to the center of Dublin. Connor the concierge the receptionist with the brown hair didn't get her name that checked us in Jack in the bar and the girl from Estonia that works in the bar also, deserve a special mention they are excellent staff v nice and happy to have a chat with you . The room we stayed in was lovely modern and clean and welcoming! Great place to stay",4,2012,09,13
236,Wifi woes,"We liked this hotel very much. Rooms were comfortable, bathrooms well fit out. Desk service very good. Wifi didn't work very well and we called about it several times but it was never corrected. 

Breakfast servers were a little abrupt when presenting the bill. We didn't have breakfast included but left a credit card imprint with the desk for incidentals when we checked in. That wasn't good enough for whatever systems they have in place and we had to present a credit card again to pay for breakfast - not really a problem if you bring your purse down to breakfast with you, but we had to make a special trip back to get it. This must be a sore spot with the servers because they poured the coffee and then wanted the credit card impression before we started eating. I've never had an experience like this before. 

BUT that said, you can't beat the location.",4,2012,09,11
236,Good 4 star,"My wife and I Stayed in this hotel for 2nights.Brooks hotel was in a good location,it was clean,bed was comfortable,had good air con,and free wifi.The only downside to the room is the tiny bathrooom.Probably not a good hotel for big people.The young girl who did the evening shift was amazingly helpfull,had a beautiful smile.A special mention also for the nice young guy at the concierge, very helpfull and knows his stuff.Breakfast is done slightly different ,but it's ok.Breakfast staff is also just ok ,nothing special.All in All it's a good hotel for a 4 star.",4,2012,09,08
236,"Great room, wonderful concierge, sweet location",This hotel is in a great area with lots of restaurants for foodies.  The concierges were so helpful to us during our stay. Spacious room and luxurious bedding and bathroom.  Would definitely recommend this as a homebase for a Dublin stay.  The only down side was that we had not view.  we overlooked a parking deck.,5,2012,09,08
236,Lovely bedrooms and helpful staff,"Another week, another city and this one finds me in Dublin, staying in a small hotel tucked away near Grafton Street.  Not a very promising entranceway, but something of a mixed hidden treasure.  Lovely bedrooms, beautifully furnished and nicely thought out.  Resident's lounge in the basement - no natural light :(  Having said that I would stay here again.
Restaurant staff also a bit of a mix - needed to make more than one request for things, which was a bit irritating.  Reception staff busy but very helpful indeed. A stone's from the centre of everything, so definitely a good location if I were on holiday.  Good support for my business meeting.",4,2012,09,07
236,Good but not 15th best in Dublin,"Brooks is a fine hotel, well located, good staff, good rooms, but it is not deserving of the 15th best hotel in Dublin. having said that it cannot be faulted for what it is. It is a good location for Dublin city centre close to shops, bars and restaurants. the rooms are fine and the staff helpful and pleasant. I would recommend it but if you want five star in the city centre, go to the Merrion, Shelbourne or Westbury.",4,2012,09,07
236,OK but disappointing,"This is an OK hotel if you want to be in the centre of Dublin close to the shopping in Grafton street. But somehow, it does not match its description on websites and one has to especially wonder how it got its rating as a member of the 'Small Luxury Hotels' network. While reception staff were nice I never got any feedback about a query as was promised and my newspaper was not delivered on one of the days. The reception and dining areas are more like airport facilities. The bedroom was small and very noisy as it was on the main street and the windows are most definitely not sound proof.",3,2012,09,05
236,"Great Location, Very nice staff.","We stayed in a deluxe tripple and although it was a bit tight on space as European hotels often are, everything was very well sorted and of very high quality. 
Note to Brooks: The black lampshades look cool at first, but we just wanted more light in the room when we were getting ready to go out.",5,2012,09,04
236,Great stay,"We had a voucher for one night in this hotel, used it last weekend, upon arrival at all times the staff were friendly and courteous and always made eye contact and a smile, at check in we were told we had been upgraded to a suite.  The room was beautiful, nice sized living room with balcony (over looking air con units) but still nice to have the option, a massive bedroom with very comfortable bed, bathroom with bath & shower & some lovely toiletries plus a walk in wardrobe.  We had drinks in the bar, all good and people close to us were eating and ood looked and smelled lovely.
The location is excellent and in the centre of everything in terms of restaurants and bars.  The doorman was lovely and remembered us and our room no at breakfast. One tiny little gripe is that the staff on duty for breakfast seemed to be very concerned learning and setting tables rather than helping guests, requests for butter, toast and tea had to be made several times, however the meal itself was excellent and lots of nice touches like homemade bread.
Definitely stay here again.",5,2012,08,27
236,"Comfy, friendly and well located","After 23hr flight from Australia, it was nice to arrive to a friendly greeting, comfy room and a Hotel located right in the centre of old Dublin. Connor ( The Porter) was fantastic, breakfast was a treat, especially the oatmeal porridge with a dash of Irish Whisky. Shame it's booked out for our return to Dublin in a week's time",5,2012,08,27
236,Great Hotel,"This was our first trip to Dublin for my husbands 50th Birthday. We were not dissapointed. The Hotel was in a very good location, and the reception staff were very attentive and friendly. Thank you to Connor for bieng so helpful. The room was spacious and very clean. Our only negative was we felt the breakfast staff did not have the customer service skills like the evening staff in the restuarant or the bar. The food was excellent and thanks to Noel and Frank the waiters for the entertainment. A very enjoyable stay",4,2012,08,27
236,Excellent location and service,"Nice location. Like many reviewers our room overlooked the air con units, but I think this was preferable to the road noise on the other side of the hotel! Room and bathroom what we expected.
Connor the doorman deserves a mention as very helpful with bags and advice on what to visit and expect in the city.",4,2012,08,26
236,"very friendly staff, excellent bar staff with yellow and red cards!","This was our first visit to Dublin and the city certainly did not disappoint. The only word to describe the reception staff is awesome - we've never come across such friendly and helpful people for directions, ideas on places to visit etc. The hotel lobby is very welcoming with lit candles. We had booked a superior double room and the bed was impressive, probably the most comfortable hotel bed ever - you even have a choice of pillows! The decor was modern and very well kept but there was too much furniture in the room - 1 double bed, 1 single bed, 1 table, 2 chairs and dressing table - this meant that husband had to climb over the bed to get out as there was no space to get past on his side. The bathroom spacious and clean with a superb shower. Plenty of consistently hot water and water pressure. There are a couple of slight negatives, one being the view - we had the pleasure of air-con units, back of offices and similar. If you're after a good view of Dublin, this is not the hotel for you but if you want a friendly and welcoming atmosphere as well as a superb room, this is the place to go. The second let-down was the overpriced  breakfast - if you go on a 5 min walk outside the hotel you can get two huge cooked breakfasts for the same price as one at the hotel. The hotel's location is within a stone's throw of the Temple Bar bustle but without the noise. It is quite expensive but so is the whole of Dublin. We would definitely book The Brooks again. Many thanks for a wonderful and memorable weekend.",4,2012,08,24
236,Very comfortable stay,Myself & my husband stayed in this hotel whilst visiting relatives in Dublin.  We found the staff more than willing to help.  The facilities very good and attention to detail great.  I loved the guest lounge & business centre and found the pillow choice excellent.  Would definitely stay again when next visiting Dublin.,5,2012,08,23
236,The charming doorman,"I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the doormans name, because he always remembered mine!  What a charming welcome to our first hotel stop in Ireland.  We arrived at 9am and were VERY tired.  Our room wasn't ready, but they sent us down to a lovely quiet guest room - we could rest in.  The doorman helped us directions and helpful hints - and always with a touch of charming Irish humor.  What more can ask - when the service puts a smile on your face each time you walk thru the door?   
The maid was also amazing - she asked to help us when we were fumbleing in the hall.
The room was lovely, comfortable and clean.  The location was ideal for walking!",4,2012,08,21
236,Great hotel in a wonderful location!,"The Brooks hotel is a modern, very clean hotel located right in the heart of the action in Dublin, yet off on the side away from noise (just as many other reviewers have written). As other reviewers also shared, we were treated wonderfully when we arrived early, being given the opportunity to enjoy the downstairs lounge. We had rooms to the back, so we did not have much of a view, but there was really no noise at night. Rooms were very nice and well-equipped, with lovely bathrooms and many old-world touches (some people might not like that).  Breakfast was included, and it was fine, but not great  (that's why I am not giving it 5 stars). Most of the staff were very, very friendly and helpful (reception and concierge), but the breakfast staff was not as friendly or attentive as the others.",4,2012,08,21
236,A disapointment,"We booked this hotel based on its name and the good recommendations on here. The service was mediocre, the breakfast was reasonably good, but the room was small and not particularly nice. We tried to get advice from the concierge a number of times and only managed to find them once, the rest of the time they werent there. I would avoid this hotel if I was staying in Dublin again.",2,2012,08,21
236,A hotel that goes the extra mile!,"We arrived in Dublin during a storm and were soaking wet. Despite being 3hours early for check-in, we were checked in and given our room keys. All the staff were friendly and welcoming. The room (a standard double) was great and had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and loved the pillow menu, but we didn't change our pillows as the ones already on our bed were very comfortable. We didn't have breakfast included, but did have the full Irish breakfast which was delicious and very reasonably priced. Location is excellent and very central so we were able to walk to most places. We will definitely stay at Brooks again if we are ever in Dublin. ",5,2012,08,21
236,Had a lovely time.  I want to come back.,"Spent 5 nights at Brooks Hotel, mostly for business.

I had no trouble finding it after getting off the aircoach from the airport.  As I was too early to check in, they were happy to hang on to my luggage while I went for lunch at the Guinness Storehouse :)

My room was cosy and clean, with nice decor.  The bathroom was spacious and everything worked perfectly.  There was even a trouser press (not common).  Wi-fi worked perfectly and was stable enough for Skype (my children appreciated that!!)

Breakfast was hearty and freshly prepared.  They were able to accommodate some requests which was really sweet of them.  The hot breakfast provided variety such that I was trying different items each morning.  Of course the fresh loaves and croissants matched the rest of the spread too.  The coffee was also impressive.

Just a short walk away was all the fabulous shopping.

Great value for money.  Great service.  Thank you.  I hope to return again someday",4,2012,08,21
236,"Excellent first class hotel in the midst of Dublin, very accommodating with excellent facilties and fine staff","We stayed here for three nights upon arriving in Dublin and enjoyed the excellent services, large rooms, comfortable beds with good lighting, lots of drawer storage, very helpful staff and great convenient location close to everything south of the LIffey River.  Very courteous during contacts made before arriving in verifying reservations and pricing and in arranging for taxis, etc.  It's a first class efficiently-run hotel,not a B&B so don't expect ""Irish character.""",5,2012,08,19
236,Nice central boutique hotel with Accessible rooms,"Very nice boutique hotel, central location, friendly front desk.

We were traveling with a friend requiring wheelchair accessibility. For our party it was an essential feature that Brooks hotel has a flat roll-in access from the street to the lobby and restaurant. The rooms were cozy, one of which was a nicely appointed, adapted wheelchair accessible room. 

We travelled around Dublin on the ""Hop-on hop-off Dublin tourist bus"". This tourist bus is highly recommended for moving around Dublin's primary attractions. It too is fully accessible, with a purpose built ramp managed by the driver.",4,2012,08,18
236,Excellent - worth every cent,"We have stayed at Brooks twice. Having been very impressed on our first visit we were delighted to find standards just as high on our second visit, one year later. Location is very central, and convenient for Grafton Street and Trinty College. Rooms are very well appointed and serviced to a very high standard. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We had an evening meal on our second visit, and although the prices are a bit higher than some of the excellent local restaurants, the quality of the food was worth every extra cent. We'd definitely go back to Brooks again.",5,2012,08,16
236,A great place to stay in the heart of Dublin,"We stay in Brooks at least once a year, and it is always an excellent base. This time we arrived mid-morning and were given upgraded rooms as soon as we got there. Breakfasts are excellent, with freshly cooked Full Irish and plenty of fruit, breads and cereals. Rooms are very comfortable, with free wi-fi. There is a nice bar and a residents' lounge in the basement to escape to. All in all, we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2012,08,15
236,Excellent location & the warmest of welcomes!,"The Brooks Hotel is 99% perfect.  (I only marked it down as some of the finer details were just a little bit lacking e.g. a bowl with chips in it which took the shine off an otherwise gorgeous room.)  

Location excellent for all the major attractions.

As part of the romance package, we had breakfast in bed both days so can't comment on the breakfast buffet as such, and dinner, which was lovely.

If you're looking for somewhere to eat that's not too far away, check out the Market Bar.

As for service, we couldn't fault it - from the moment we arrived and got the warmest of welcomes from Connor, the Concierge, through to the bar/waiting staff (speak to Jacek about his whiskey tasting sessions) they were so attentive.",5,2012,08,15
236,Oldy worldy style but bit tatty round the edges,"Brooks Hotel is really well located in easy walking distance to most of the major attractions plus heaps of bars,restaurants and shopping.

Brooks has tried to conjure an oldy worldy style hotel. It generally works. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Breakfast is very good value if included in room price as it was for me. 

The room on first impression is Victorian/ Edwardian well equipped but very small (practically no space to open a suitcase on the floor). When you are staying 5 nights you need more space. Bathroom is tiny but ok.

After a while it also became obvious that the room wasn't wearing well; wall paper coming off walls, paint badly touched up in bathroom (water damage?), scrape marks along bedroom walls where others have tried to manhandle their bags. Curtains damaged by smokers (despite being non smoking).

Its a good hotel but, for the price, should be in better condition.
",4,2012,08,14
236,Pleasant stay,"i highly recommend tihis hotel , good service , splendid lokation whit 5 minutters walk to  most attractiones .",4,2012,08,12
236,Anniversary stay,"Excellent stay for our 10th wedding annuversary both  in our early 30's ,the hotel helped us in every way, from the mobile charger we forgot, to printing out our return flight tickets as we enjoyed Dublin so much we stayed a extra day.
Plus we got a upgrade to junior suite.
Location was close to everything.",5,2012,08,08
236,Nice,"Not a bad hotel. The service was friendly and the establishment was clean with good amenities. It had a large breakfast selection which was nearly half the price for hotel guests. It was in the center of Dublin city which meant that during our stay we could hear the hoots and hollars from the partiers in the nearby pubs. Therefore, if you want a decent night's sleep, ask to be placed away from the street side of the hotel. 
There is a smal gym, and I would have given the hotel an added point if it weren't for the fact that the gym only had three machines, one of which was broken...fairly annoying for fitness buffs!",4,2012,08,06
236,Terribly disappointing experience!,"I booked my room at the beginning of July, however was charged twice for the stay. It took a lot of persuading, hassle, time to make the hotel staff realize they made a mistake- an unacceptable mistake!. I made a few phone calls to the reception as soon as I realized I was double charged- unfortunately was left with an impression of not beeing cared of..Perhaps, if I had booked the most expensive suit, I would have got much better treatment...
I was not offered any room upgrade etc..for thefrustration and pain I went through (as you would expect from such a 'great' hotel). I got the refund but because the transactions were made in euros I ended up paying much more than I agreed to while booking the room.
One more thing: I do not understand why they ask you about your room/stay requirements?- I made it clear I wanted to have a quiet room, yet what I got in return was a room overlooking a car park and next to the very noisy lift!
I wish I had never booked that hotel. It was a frustrating and stressful experience. I spoke to the manager, he apologised for what happened but nothing will erase the bad time I went through. One would think, in these economically challenging times the hotel would treat its clients in a more professional way and with more respect...?..",2,2012,08,02
236,"Not bad, but expected better...","Pros:
-Great central location.
-Fast wifi and we connected multiple devices with no problems.
-Friendly staff. The reception helped me print out my flight boarding pass.
-Spacious room.

Cons:
-Old hotel that needs a bit updating.
-Could be cleaner. Toilet had a nasty stain. When I asked the cleaning staff to clean it, they just flushed the toilet and said that's the best they can do (and gave me kind of a silly look). I think they were busy with a lot of check-outs that day, but I expected more from a 4-star hotel.
-Wanted to charge us for a long distance call we did not make. They did not charge us at the end, but it was a bit annoying.

A side note: We really wanted to visit the Giant Causeway during our stay in Dublin. Since it was a long drive, we opted to book a day-tour with a guide. We had done some research and wanted to book with a certain tour agency. When I asked the concierge about this tour agency, he insisted that we take another tour (with a company called PaddyWagon). We booked with PaddyWagon because the he said it was a ""much better"" tour. The tour ended up being more expensive and the worst tour ever for reasons I won't go into detail here, but it pretty much ruined our trip. I don't think the concierge has ever been on this tour personally, so I don't think he should be recommending it. I don't know for sure, but I think the tour we originally wanted would have been much better.

Overall, the hotel was not bad and I really liked the location, but I probably will not return.",3,2012,07,26
236,Book it now!,"Three generations of the same family have just enjoyed an excellent trip to Brooks Hotel.  Why was it so enjoyable?
1.  The location, enough has been written about the central location for you to realise the hotel is easily accessible to the majority of sights.  What you spend on the hotel will be saved on taxi fares to the attractions
2.  Food.  The breakfasts were extensive and fresh with an emphasis on local and natural products.  We ate in the restaurant for two evenings and can thoroughly recommend the set menus.  A tip: if you don't mind eating early, they offer a 5 Euro discount between 18.00 and 19.00.  The chef (Patrick) came out to ensure we were happy with our meal.  He was informative and attentive, even showing our daughter the herb garden, again reflecting his enthusiasm for fresh food.  He's also an excellent cook!
3.  Rooms.  The rooms are of a high standard and have power showers and tea/coffee facilities. In our room, the hairdryers were those ineffective ones that sit on the bathroom wall.  I suggest you book a hand-held one on arrival.  My only negative comment relates to the size of the room, we were in an ordinary double (210) and there was barely enough room for my daughter and I to walk around at the same time.  I guess we spent little time in the room but the lack of space may bother some people.  There is a choice of pillows, although they were unable to supply our initial choice - get in early!
4. Public areas.  There is plenty of space to socialise or meet up with friends or family.  We particularly liked the residents' lounge in the basement.  This was very comfortable and offered the opportunity to relax in quiet surroundings. There are also two public computers here which have free access to the internet.  Reception will print off documents, such as boarding passes, for you.
5.  Service.  We found staff to be unfailingly polite and attentive.  We must make mention of Frank, in the restaurant, who provided us with an itinerary for a day's trip on the DART.  He wrote out a comprehensive itinerary and was spot-on in terms of his instructions.  Reception were also very accommodating in terms of a late check-out.  Don't forget to get a foot spa from housekeeping after a day's sightseeing

Overall, we can thoroughly recommend Brooks for your stay in Dublin.",5,2012,07,26
236,End of trip delight,"We just returned from a three-week auto trip through Ireland, making Dublin our last stop. We selected the Brooks Hotel as our splurge stop based on its location. We are so pleased we did. First-class all the way with a helpful and professional staff, great breakfasts and a nice bar. Convenient to all of the places we wanted to see and only a 25 minute walk to Guinness Storehouse so we returned our car on arrival and walked everywhere during the three days we were there. We didn't want to leave! Highly recommended!",5,2012,07,25
236,They may charge you twice for the same hotel room!!!,I booked a room through the hotel's website 3 weeks in advance. I was charged twice for the same room-once a week every week before my arrival the money was taken from my bank account!! it is a disgrace and lack of professional approach on a massive scale!!!,2,2012,07,24
236,Excellent service,I spent one night here at the end or a tour of Ireland.  It was very comfortable and the service was excellent.  They offered the use of a free foot spa and I thought that was a nice touch after a long day of walking around.  I would return if I ever get back to Dublin.,5,2012,07,23
236,Just what we wanted!,"A great find - an elegant smallish hotel, in a quiet location but right in the heart of everything if that makes sense? My friend and I were doing a ""girlie"" shopping weekend, perfect! 
Great concierge service, gave us the inside track on what to do and where to go, recommended a fab bistro for dinner, as the hotel made the booking we then received half price cocktails all night which was a nice touch and would have been rude not to have taken advantage of!",4,2012,07,23
236,"Lovely hotel, wonderful location.","Lovely comfortable hotel in the heart of the city.  Spotlessly clean rooms, pleasant staff.  Parking is at a car park directly across from the hotel and is quite expensive. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded when we arrived as this trip was part of our honeymoon.  There were delicious homemade biscuits and bottled water in the room for us ( much appreciated).  We will definitely be back.",4,2012,07,23
236,Excellent hotel,"Fantastic location, great rooms & room size is great, check in & out efficient, if you are looking for a place close to absolutely everything & still feel like a king then this is the place",5,2012,07,21
236,Consider yourself - at home,"We heaped high expectations on the Brooks - and this wonderful ""boutique"" hotel delivered in every respect.  Our trip was our silver wedding anniversary and neither of us had been to Ireland before.  We wanted an intimate hotel in the heart of Dublin - a home base for our relatively casual travel itinerary.  Conor and staff could not have been more accommodating.  Some mornings we had breakfast delivered to our room; others we dined in the restaurant.  The guest lounge in the lower level of the hotel is the perfect place to escape a busy day in the city.  The rooms are of generous size for a small hotel, and warm and inviting.  We often felt as if we had the hotel to ourselves, even though there were plenty of other guests.  The Brooks is unquestionably in the heart of Dublin.  So much of the life of the city can be experienced in the surrounding blocks, including Temple Bar.  The bread-and-butter pudding at the nearby Hairy Lemon is a spectacular dessert.  Stop in at Gibsons cafe just around the corner on Wicklow street for some of the city's best coffee, tea, and pastries.  Whether formal or casual, business or pleasure - the Brooks provides the lodging experience you are looking for.  There is no need to look anywhere else.",5,2012,07,16
236,First Hand Experience,I recently had the opportunity to spend one night at the Brooks Hotel. It was a wonderful experience. From the front desk staff to housekeeping everyone had personalized their greeting and was extremely courtious and helpful. The rooms are perfect in every way. It was probably the best hotel stay my wife and I ever had.,5,2012,07,16
236,Look no further,"Where to begin? 7 nights of Heaven, Cannot fault this hotel or the staff not one disappointed us, very friendly and attentive. 

We arrived off an early flight at 8am, we went to receptionist who was very helpful and told us she would get us our room as soon as possible and explained we could have some breakfast meantime so we  went and got our first breakfast at Brooks, simply devine lots of choice.... full Irish,continental,cereals,yoghurts,fruit,crepes,eggs done any which way, toast, salmon,porridge,kipper,jams,scones,several kinds of homemade bread,all kinds of fruit juice and more,  you can have as much as you want so sets you up for the day. At 9am Connor the consierge came and told us our room was ready and our cases were up there. Now thats an early book in and thats good service!

Up in the room we were more than happy the room had everything we needed it was clean and cosy. We had been up since 2.30am to get to the airport so decided to have a lie down the pillows were absolutely fine so we didnt look at the pillow menu. The bed was lovely and comfy.

And so the story continued throughout our 7 night stay we cannot fault our time spent at the Brooks Hotel..

Magdelina the restaurant supervisor, Amelia and all the restaurant staff were super efficient.... as were all the  staff.",5,2012,07,15
236,Brooks hotel,"Nice hotel. 
Very plesant staff.  
Terrible view of the air conditioning units but they were able to accomedate my little boy for an upgrade fee.  So maybe that was the only triple avail.  ",4,2012,07,13
236,Friendly Hotel - Fantastic Location,"I stayed here for 1 night with a friend for a city break to Dublin.  
The moment we walked in to the reception the staff were warm and friendly.  
Conor the concierge sat and talked us through the neighbourhood and where to go.  
Another receptionist booked us a table for dinner at a fab restaurant (half price cocktail too!)
We were on the 5th floor, the rooms were clean, and beds comfortable.  Great night sleep .. followed by a Traditional Irish Breakfast the next day.
Would def recommend the hotel, and would go back and stay here again.",5,2012,07,12
236,We picked the right place in Dublin,"the Brooks hotel does what matters right:  their beds are super comfortable and one of their best features is their pillow menu.  You can select from several options and they deliver the kind of pillow you want early that evening.  We selected the ones that helped relieve stress (can't remember the name) and ordered 2 each - and they were the best pillows I've ever slept on.  We had 3 to our room, with our daughter, and her twin bed was solid and comfortable - not an add on cot or flimsy addition like we had in London.  Internet service is strong and free - again something we did not get at a much more expensive hotel in London on our trip.  The breakfast, which is included, is abundant and good.  I especially liked the Greek yogurt parfait and porridge, but my family enjoyed eggs.  The location could not be better - we walked everywhere.  Major shopping streets are right around the corner.  We walked to Trinity College - pretty much everywhere.  We highly recommend and would stay here again in a minute.",5,2012,07,12
236,"Friendly, Cozy, Comfortable, Fantastic Location","Definitely stay here if you can get a good price.  It is the best location in Dublin, it is cozy, the staff provide superior service.  The breakfast is nice.",4,2012,07,11
236,Super location and super clean,"This hotel is great, but the decor is a little tired. The location is unbeatable and the staff were great. Breakfast was also very tasty.",4,2012,07,10
236,Good hotel,"Very nice, comfortable hotel, attractive inside and out.  Nice, helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast.  Very central location, walking distance of most major attractions.  Not cheap, but decent value for what you get and location.  We actually stayed twice, quite a bit cheaper when we booked directly from hotel's site than booking.com, so you might want to compare prices before booking.",4,2012,07,10
236,"Centrally located, comfortable accommodations, great staff and service","The  Brooks hotel is located right in the heart of Dublin near Grafton Street and Trinity College.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were great.  The breakfasts were very good and we ate dinner one night in the hotel and it was a lovely meal and the chef, Patrick, came out to chat with us afterwards.  He had made a special dessert in celebration of my parent's 60th anniversary and they really made it special. 

I would highly recommend the Brooks if you are traveling to Dublin.",5,2012,07,10
236,Great staff and Super clean!!!,"If your headed to Dublin, this hotel is in the middle of everything!!  We were able to walk most places.  The rooms were spotless and comfortable!  The people at the desk and doormen were always helpful and full of sunshine (which is hard to get in Ireland!!  LOL)   Great food too!",5,2012,07,09
236,"Great hotel, very central","I stayed in Brooks last week and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel was in a great location, very central and our room was very spacious. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. The breakfast selection was great, with our breakfast cooked for us that morning, the scrambled eggs were excellent. Thanks to all the staff for making our trip very memorable.",5,2012,07,09
236,Close to major sites,"I really liked this hotel. Very comfortable and clean.  The full Irish breakfast was good.  If you booked a room without a meal included you can eat at a significantly reduced price.  I appreciated the ambient music when you first enter your room.  The beds were bigger than I expected (two single beds). The staff was friendly and helpful. A centrally located hotel.  You can get to shopping, food, and major sites easily.",4,2012,07,08
236,Great Hotel,"We stayed here from June 21 to June24 to attend a big family celebration, and it was brilliant. As a born and bred Dubliner but now living in the Uk I am frequently popping back for family get togethers and have stayed in a variety of hotels over the years .This was by far the best in termslarge  of value for money and comfort, staff were so nice and friendly and helpful.Our room was a double and really large ,  spacious and decorated to a  very high standard. I would definately stay again , it really ticked all the boxes as it is bang centre in town a stones throw from Grafton street and great bars and retaurants, also the breakfast was fab. Hope to be back there soon !",5,2012,07,05
236,"Great hotel, nice location","We arrived on a Thursday morning as is typical of flights from the US. Of course, as is typical of hotels in the continent, rooms weren't available till 2pm. That left us a few hours to get a local SIM card, etc. The concierge held our luggage while we did our walkabout. Grafton Street is close by, so we were able to walk to a 3Store (cellular provider) nearby to get local SIM cards. The location of the hotel is excellent and not too far from St Stephens Green.

Rooms were nice and well appointed, and we were quite happy with our stay. The staff were friendly (as is universally true in Ireland) and helpful.

Breakfast was included in our room rate, and it was sumptuous. There was a good selection of breads, and the standard Irish breakfast, of course, was the standard combo of eggs, sausages/bacon, black & white pudding, tomato, etc.

All in all I'd recommend this hotel. At the end of our trip, we stayed at another hotel, which was a stark contrast to this.

The location is also close to pubs and it can get noisy on the weekend (our experience was a Friday night).",5,2012,07,03
236,Disappointed with accommodation...but as below Manager resolved.,"Rather then booking at the cheaper venues that we usually stay at, for the first time in many years, as we were going away without our children, we thought we would treat ourselves for a change.  Therefore after looking here on Trip Advisor, we booked to stay Brooks Hotel as it had good reviews.  Upon walking towards hotel, my first impression was made by the flags flying outside the hotel.  Now I appreciate it is in the middle of a city, but the dirty looking flags immeadiately gave me concern, I would not have thought it was to much to keep this first impression clean.  
Check was polite and quick, but not what I would call warm and welcoming.
Our room looked tired and in need of refurbishment.  Bath looked dirty to me, but upon checking by staff I was advised that the marks I saw were rust marks and not dirt.
Upon coming back from being out for the evening, the level of noise from the street in the room was excessive, and very much disrupted our nights sleep.  As we were unable to screw the windows shut.  Upon mentioning this to the lady on reception, she advised she would get it looked at.  
We then went out for the morning, and upon our return, there was a typed letter from hotel explaining about the baths, and also offering us a room change.  The letter I appreciated, as it made me feel we were being looked after.  This offer we took up, and again whilst the bath in that room also had signs of rust in it, and paint missing from the door, to be fair to the hotel the room was comfortable, as were the beds.  
Breakfast was okay and the staff friendly.  
We went for a drink in the bar in the evening, and this was pleasant, with a friendly chatty barman on.
I am disappointed about this hotel, as this was to us, a very special first trip away in nearly 14 years without our children, when considering how much we paid to stay there, as I did not see what to me was a significant extra cost from what I usually pay got me, apart from a very poor first nights sleep.  I would not choose to stay there again.
However, to be fair to the hotel, I was very pleased with how the hotel took care of us after we had raised our accomodation issues to them.  It was just a shame that we had the issues in the first place.
Ironically, whilst I am posting this review on Trip Advisor, it has also made me realise, that the ratings given are actually no real guarantee as to what the next persons holiday will be like.  
Therefore please note that all the above is purely a personal view of my holiday at this hotel.",2,2012,07,01
236,Could've been a bad experience...saved by mgr.,Checked in (no help w bags?) and our rooms were ready an hour early = cool. Daughters were upgraded but we weren't. Who cares if our room was a little stodgy and dated?  But wait it gets worse. The a/c didn't work and one can't open the windows as the street noise is too high. After finding technician's paperwork on our bed when he came to retrieve it later he said it was fixed in the room but he had more work to do on the roof. That didn't help either. Talked to our next door neighbor and her air was out since last night too. Forget that. Called and spoke to Phillip a manager who(after a while and some complaining from me) got us a nice room on the 2nd floor with great air conditioning and even larger/updated. Great stay after all. Loved my helpful Polish bartender!  ,4,2012,06,28
236,Absolutely perfect,"The Brooks Hotel combines top-notch service and hospitality with a warm and comfortable stay, right in the heart of Dublin. This is a boutique hotel with lovely, well-equipped rooms, fine beds and nice bathrooms.  It offers luxury touches, like pillow choices, thick terry robes,  concierge service, prompt and caring service, and a warm and welcoming atmosphere. And you couldn't have a better location, on a quiet street, but in the heart of Dublin.   The staff cannot do enough for you.  They are completely at your service and create such a warm and hospitable atmosphere that you truly feel you have a home away from home. You will love staying here.",5,2012,06,25
236,Excellent hotel.,"First class hotel. A one night stay on business. Rooms and bathrooms are spotless. Very quiet (and it's in the city centre and I had a 5th floor room facing the street). Staff are top class and very helpful. As I was staying one night in town and had not intended to do so they were flexible enough to bargin with me on price. Also there is a car park opposite and if I remember correctly they do a deal. 
Breakfast was very nice and service was excellent.",5,2012,06,23
236,"Good location in the heart of Dublin, good people","I was traveling with my wife and my 12 year old daughter.

We loved Brooks Hotel for many reasons - mainly for the cleanliness and central location.

Almost any and everything is a walking distance, including the Trinity College. The amenities are good. We took advice of the concierge in booking our day trips and that was helpful too.

The people at the hotel at genuine warmth.

To highlight a specific case of customer service, we checked out in the morning of our departure and left our luggage with hotel. We also ordered a taxi for Heuston station (our train to Killarney  was from Heuston train station). 

We then went for exploring the city.

When we came back to the hotel, a little late, not only was the taxi waiting, but the luggage had been put in. That was efficient.

Will recommend the hotel and shall also come back.",5,2012,06,18
236,Brooks Hotel is safe bet,"This is the best hotel for the money, location and accomodations (other reviews were spot on). Upon arrival the staff was ready, welcoming and very friendly. Better, the room was ready at 8:30am.  I knew the lower floors of hotel would be loud but forgot and slept in room 106...don't be like me, remember to request a higher floor and in the back, unless you like the sounds of delivery trucks and horns at all hours. Otherwise, the concierge was absolutely fantastic. He offered tour advice, circled attractions on the map, gave personal recommendations and best, remembered my name and said hello with a smile...touches like that make an OK hotel so much better. This hotel is comparable with a Marriott/Sheraton in the US, but with a much better bar and restaurant.",4,2012,06,18
236,Hotel is in a good location with great staff,"I decided to treat ourselves to a little luxury on this trip to Dublin after reading the reviews given to the Brook hotel. I was disappointed, as I have stayed in a lot higher class hotels for less and a lot of lower class hotels,  that were more luxurious.  On check in we were told that we had been upgraded, so my expectations grew. Our room was fairly standard but did have a fridge, kettle with tea & coffee, dressing gowns and a nice big bathroom. But I felt it was a bit pretentious with a menu of pillow choices. We ate dinner before going out for the night, nothing to write about. Our breakfast was served up to us, but our full Irish (€20 each) included just one sausage and rasher with the usual egg, tomato and mushrooms. Maybe, I’m getting too used to special hotel offers, in the present climate. I must say the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful.",3,2012,06,18
236,Central Hotel In Dublin,"I recently stayed in this hotel due to a recent Business event.  With only mins walk from Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green it was an ideal location.  
The hotel was very welcoming, checking was very quick as we had pre paid.  Our room was spacious, and bright.  You could see that the room furniture had been painted to bring it in line with the soft furnishings, (a few chips off the paint work told this.)  There was a Bath with over head shower, large granite sink area, with plenty of shampoo etc.  

The tea and coffee facilities were hidden away very nicely in the wardrobe.  

When we arrived in the room, there was a notice offering us a choice of pillows other than what was there, we should have asked for them, as i felt the pillows on the bed did not lend themselves to a good nights sleep. 

We didn't eat in the hotel as we arrived late and left early.   We did have a drink in the bar upon our return that night and found one of the bar staff to be very rude to both customers and his fellow staff, he was extremely abusive to the other bar man who was working with him.  I did feel that this was terrible in front of customers, they were not exactly run off their feet. It is for this reason only that i am giving the Hotel an average rating. 

The Hotel had a deal done with the Drury St Car park, so we got a very cheap over night rate on car parking. Which was great. 

I would stay in this hotel again, as it was reasonably priced and catered for attending events in and around the Stephens Green area. 

For tourists maybe you could talk to the local authority to have better sign posting when coming out of the car park etc, considering its all nearly on a one way system its hard to figure out how to get to the route you want, so i can't imagine what this would be like for tourists.",3,2012,06,18
236,Ideal base for Dublin City,I have stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions and have yet to be disappointed. The location is perfect for anyone wishing to visit Dublin city. The rooms are elegantly decorated and very clean. The Restaurant is nice but probably better options in the city area.,4,2012,06,17
236,What a breath of fresh air- literally!!,"After staying in an array of dirty, smelly hotels on our trip around the UK and Ireland, we were able to stay at this lovely hotel. What a breath of fresh air- literally. It smelled really clean.  Our room was amazing!! It was a nice large size, we were able to get a king size bed that was very comfortable. The room was really clean, even the bathroom!! The bathroom is so fancy, it actually looked like a spa to me- wow! This hotel offers a variety of bathroom products with different mood scents (I think a couple were named 'calm' and 'happy'), no joke, they were the best bathroom products from a hotel hat I've ever smelled and used. The staff members were very courteous upon arrival and checkout. The lobby was very clean and nicely decorated, and it had a beautiful grand piano in the corner.
In terms of location, it is a very close walk to Temple Bar, Christchurch, and St. Patrick's cathedral. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2012,06,15
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin wonderful experience,"We enjoyed our stay at Brooks hotel, a great Dublin central location and a very welcoming staff. Brooks provided a wonderful experience with good value and a plesant stay.
              Many thanks,          Sean Horkan.",5,2012,06,15
236,Nice rooms & fabulous breakfasts,"It may seem strange to some to rate a hotel by the breakfast, but an Irish breakfast is an experience.  My last trip to Ireland was in 1993 & I have been craving brown bread ever since.  We arrived at the hotel after waking at 4:30 am to fly from Pisa to Dublin.  Since it was much too early to check in, the site of the breakfast room just off the lobby was a welcome one.  They had no problems letting our party of 5 adults & 1 toddler into breakfast even though we had no room numbers yet.  The quality & choices were excellent.  
My room was large & very comfortable.  Although I didn't use them, they provided an iron, ironing board & kettle.  Just wish I had found the hair dryer in the desk drawer instead of using the tube like dryer in the bath room.  It looks kind of like a vacuum attachment.
The hotel staff were all quite efficient & helpful.  The location, near Grafton Street, is an easy walk to St Stephens Green & the River & Temple Bar area.  It was nice however to be on a relatively quiet street.  You can get a rate without breakfast, but for 10 Euros more you will have a full Irish breakfast that you will remember.",4,2012,06,15
236,Certainly not worth the Money,"Not a good experience and would certainly never stay at this hotel again when I am in Dublin
I tried to get the iron to work and it failed!
Door handle to bathroom came off when I closed the door, managed to get the door open again and advised staff, said they would send someone up straight away, waited ten min and no one arrived so I took the handle to reception, they said the maintenance were on a break and she would get it fixed. When I returned later the same thing happened again as all they did was use the same holes to screw the handle on so I ended up with it in my hand again!  This room is also next to a store room and for some reason every five min a banging sound would come through the wall of the bathroom and as I could not close the door I was kept awake for most of the night with the noise.
On checkout I was not even asked if everything was ok and if I enjoyed my stay, if I had been I would have let them know.  If you stay at this hotel just make sure you do not have room 212 !",1,2012,06,14
236,Frequent Visitor,"Brooks is a small boutique hotel in the best location..efficient friendly staff,quiet, good breakfast, restaurant, bar.  My favorite Dublin hotel and am a frequent visitor.",5,2012,06,14
236,Excellent hotel,"The location was first class - room was always very clean & comfortable. The staff throughtout the hotel were always very friendly and helpful.Thought the pillow menu was a great idea.
Both the breakfast & dinner menu were first class and the service was always excellent.
It made a special occasion for me all the more enjoyable and I would have no hesitation in recommending Brooks Hotel to anyone going to Dublin.brooks",5,2012,06,14
236,Great Location,"A very nice hotel, very clean and great service.  The location is good for shopping and visit a lot of bars.  I will stay again.  The front desk people are super, specialy the gentleman from Spain.",5,2012,06,13
236,"Excellent hotel, great location, amazing staff","Beautiful hotel in a great location for pubs, shopping, sightseeing and theatres.  Extremely helpful and friendly staff which made the stay so nice.  Nice airy bedrooms with towels and robes and pillow menus.  Fantastic breakfast, very fresh buffet and choice of hot cooked to your liking. Connor is a star and thought i might have to leave my husband at Brooks as they had become good friends.",5,2012,06,12
236,Comfortable Stay,"Our room was clean and comfortable, it had been refrubished but they could have painted window and bathroom door to complete the works.  They have a pillow menu which is odd but we did use as the pillows on the bed were paper thin, if they just used decent pillows there would be no need for the additional menu.

Breakfast was very good on our last day we had a breakfast to go as it was early and this was appreicated, any staff I did encounter were fine.

Stayed 2 nights, only in Dublin for a gig at the O2 otherwise it is not a city I would have chosen to visit, its way too expensive. This has nothing to do with the hotel, sorry
Like I say I would not stay again as I would not return to Dublin let the Americans have it.",4,2012,06,10
236,Fully satisfying and pleasing,"(+) location ; good service ; spacious room ; complimentary mineral water ; bathrobes ; efficient elevators ; comfortable & elder friendly bathroom ; european power socket in the room ; room refrigerator ; nice lounge

(-) no shower hand hose ; no magnifying mirror ; no slippers ; too high beds",4,2012,06,06
236,GOOD HOTEL IN GREAT LOCATION,"The best feature of this hotel is the location. My wife and I need to be as close as possible to where we want to go and this hotel suited our needs perfectly. There was a little late night noise but not sleep-disruptive. Wish I could say the same for the pillows! Very uncomfortable. Our room was kept clean by staff and was quite pleasant. Some peeling of wallpaper and paint where it should not have been. The WC did not flush properly. Size of room was average but I like my bed to be away from the wall and unfortunately the side I normally face when sleeping was against a wall. Having a fridge, a safe and a good TV in the room was good.  Wi-fi was great. Decor of public rooms was very good. There was even a television in the public loo! The breakfast was very good and plentiful if you wanted a hearty breakfast. My wife and I do not eat large breakfasts but we do like strong tea. On the first two days we were there the teapot had only one teabag in for two to share. On the last morning I asked for an additional teabag and that was provided. I did not have much conversation with staff members but I did see the concierge chatting to several guests. Overall I did not feel the staff were warm and friendly although they appeared proficient and polite. I would recommend this hotel and we would stay in it again. Dublin is a wonderful city and I was very impressed with it so I feel my wife and I will definitely return in the future.",4,2012,06,05
236,We would come back,"We stayed at the Brooks for the first two and last two nights of our trip to Ireland and were very pleased. All the staff were very helpful. I was having trouble figuring out something on my new iPhone that I had just obtained and the young woman at the desk immediately solved my dilemma. Our room was not large,but was comfortable and well equipped. The breakfast was excellent and a good value. The main reasons we chose the hotel were the location and the good reviews. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. Sights,shopping, and countless restaurants and pubs are close. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,06,04
236,Perfect Stay!,5 friends celebrated birthdays in Dublin and Brooks Hotel was a perfect choice. The rooms were great. We had a triple and a double room and plenty of space. The location was so convenient to everything. Staff was so  helpful and friendly.,5,2012,06,04
236,"Great location, friendly and courteous staff.","We have stayed at Brooks Hotel a number of times. The location is great, on a quiet street parallel to Grafton Street. Most of the main attractions in Dublin are within walking distance.

The hotel itself is very nicely decorated. The bedrooms are well furnished and comfortable. 
Breakfast is very good, as is the bar food.

One of the major strengths of this hotel is the staff. They are all friendly and courteous. Well done.",5,2012,06,03
236,Excellent service and excellent location,"Stayed here on the ""Dublin can Be Heaven"" 2 night package which included b&b and an evening meal. Friendly service from every member of staff from reception, porters, barman and restaurant staff! Full Irish is amazing here. Perfect location to enjoy the sights of Dublin during the day and the nightlife. Will definitely stay again",5,2012,05,31
236,Enjoyed my stay...,"Hotel is in a very good location, exactly what I was looking for.  Only thing I will change is the service in the bar - waiters weren't providing very good service.",4,2012,05,31
236,A Friendly find!,"The staff all go out of their way to make your stay a wonderful experience. The food was fantastic. For breakfast we had a choice of items from the menu, including a full Irish, and an array of wonderful homemade breads, croissants, scones, fruits, cereals, meats and cheeses. Wow, what a way to start the day! The location is perfect for walking to many of downtown's attractions and shopping. It is also close to the dart and buses. The airconditioning was welcomed since we were there during warm weather. Our other hotels in Ireland did not have airconditioning. It was also very clean and beautifully decorated. You won't be disappointed with a stay at this hotel!",5,2012,05,30
236,Wonderful hotel in ideal location.,"The staff are very accommodating.  While the rooms are small, they are very tastefully decorated.  We did not eat in any of the dining facilities, but our friend raved about room service.  There was construction going on in the street outside our single-pane windows and it sounded like the windows were open.  It was unseasonably warm and we were happy to have a few minutes of a cool down with the air conditioner.

Within easy walking distance of St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, and so many other Dublin sights.",4,2012,05,26
236,Great Location Great Service,The hotel is in an excellent location.  The service staff are wonderful.  Recommend this hotel highly.,5,2012,05,24
236,Fabulous Stay,"The Brooks Hotel was a perfect choice and great value. The staff was wonderful, always smiling, welcoming, and helpful. After the first day they knew who we were and were always asking about our plans and if there was anything we needed. The rooms were more spacious then most European hotels and all amenities were included. There knowledge of the area, suggestions for shopping, dinner and sightseeing was right on. We had fabulous meals at their recommendations and enjoyed their breakfast with a nice assortment of breads, pastries, meat, cheese, nuts, cereal, coffee, tea, juices, and fresh fruit. Wonderful stay, great people, and loved the city!!",5,2012,05,24
236,"First class, friendly service","We were greeted by a great concierge, Connor (only got one of our names wrong, but I'm sure he knew it really!) breakfast was very tasty and rooms were tastefully decorated. Our only issue was that our room was noisy from the road below (there is a nightclub at the end of the street)",4,2012,05,21
236,what a little gem,"booked this for a business trip and was a little bit more than i wanted to pay but dont regret it one
rooms are spacious and the bed was teriffic shower and bath superb had a really good nights sleep . the room has everything iron trouser press minibar tea coffee etc 
the breakfast was very good indeed one of the the best i have had for a long time you must try the porridge with cream and a dash of irish whiskey  the full irish breakfast was also a treat  go to dublin on a regular basis and this will be the place for me from now on .try it im sure you will enjoy , by the way the bar hasover 300 different types of whiskey",5,2012,05,17
236,"You walk in as a guest, you leave as a friend.","We just got back from 6 days in Ireland and made the Brooks Hotel on Drury Street our hub. What an amazingly enjoyable experience! The staff ( especially Anne Kinsella) was beyond helpful and friendly and many kudos to the ever charming Conor, the hotel's iconic concierge who never quit attending to our needs and every other guests' as well. His sense of humor, attention to details, advice and efficiency are unsurpassed in my experience. A special treat was at our request they arranged to engage a fabulous private driver complete with black Mercedes for a 2 day sojourn to the west coast to see the Cliffs of Moher, Galway and the beautiful countryside and castles which was perfection thanks to the skills, personality and ""blarney"" of Robbie Daly who is now an official member of our family! We stayed at their sister hotel, the Connemara Coast on Galway Bay and were treated like rock stars. We will definitely be returning to Ireland and going home to the Brooks Hotel.",5,2012,05,17
236,AMAZING hotel - stop looking and stay here!!,"There is just no better hotel to stay in in Dublin than the Brooks Hotel.  I had just came into Dublin from Spain (after running a marathon in Madrid).  From the moment I arrived in Dublin, I was greeted with open arms from my Chaueffer- Rummy (sp?) in the airport.  I can't begin to describe what a wonderful man he is...just a delight.  He showed me a bit of Dublin so I could guage my whereabouts before dropping me at the hotel.  Anne and the entire front desk staff were amazing my entire stay. So accomodating and more than helpful with whatever I needed.  Upon check in, I was immediately upgraded to a better room at no charge.  To add, when I returned to my room from a brief walk down Grafton St, the hotel staff had placed a cupcake and little card in my room congratulating me on my Marathon.  Not to forget the bar staff, Jorge (bartender) was just amazing and a delite to talk too!!  All in all, I WILL be back =)",5,2012,05,16
236,"Great location, service is great, Breakfast is delicous","Brooks is my number one choice of hotels in Dublin. This is an excellant location for sightseeing,shopping and socialising in Dublin. Everything is within walking distance. The rooms are well designed with comfortable beds, tea/coffee facilities and nice toiletries. Bathrobes and slippers are also provided. The hotel provides nice touches - turndown service, muffins/sweets and the late breakfast (11.30) at the weekends is great. Must say breakfast is top notch with plenty of choice. The service is excellent and there is definately a homely feel to this hotel while still maintaining the sense of style. Conor is the first friendly face you meet on arrival and he remembers everyone on their return visit. Having stayed in many 5 star hotels in Dublin, Brooks matches and exceeds in some cases on a number of levels. Highly reccommend this boutique hotel for all travellers, business and holiday. You will not be disappointed.",5,2012,05,16
236,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Safe, convenient, central Dublin location.  Friendly and helpful desk staff.  Rooms are tasteful and beautifully decorated.",5,2012,05,15
236,Simply the best forget the rest,"There simply isnt a better hotel to stay in when your in the capital.  The location. The comfort, the breakfast cooked to your liking, the staff, are but a few reasons why you should stay here.  When we go to Dublin this is the 1st place we look to stay and are bitterly disappointed if we cant get it.",5,2012,05,14
236,"Central, lovely boutique hotel","Had a lovely stay here when we visited friends in Dublin. The check in staff were very friendly and Connor, the concierge was such a lovely man and so helpful.
My room was very nice on the third floor. The only thing I would say is to request a rear facing room. I faced over Drury Street and it was really noisy with revellers leaving bars and lots of cars hooting horns in the early hours. I didn't get a lot of sleep whereas my friends at the back didn't hear a thing.
The breakfast was great and plentiful.
All in all, a lovely stay and just on the outskirts of Temple Bar. Everything is within walking distance.",4,2012,05,13
236,Great food,"There is two things upon which I judge a Hotel, Food & Service. Brooks Hotel scores high among my standards. I dined-in house a number of evenings and the quality of food and service was very good. On the down side I found my room some-what on the cold side.",4,2012,05,12
236,"Location, location, location","We recently spent nine wonderful nights at Brooks Hotel, and we couldn't have been more pleased.The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Dora and Anne at the front desk. We were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 2 pm, however upon check in, we learned that our room would be ready by 11 am. That was such a lovely surprise and we were so grateful. Our room was spotless and the beds were comfortable. It was also very quiet, we were never bothered by street noise. The location can't be beat. It is a eight minute walk to Temple Bar and a 5 minute walk to Grafton Street. Trinity College is just minutes away, and many other tourist sites are within easy walking distance. We loved our stay and will be staying here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2012,05,11
236,Perfection!q,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel and it's wonderful staff. I booked my reservation almost a year in advance based on reviews I had read on several travel sites which is always hit or miss but in this case the hotel far exceeded my expectations.  Upon check-in i was pleasantly surprised to learn i had been upgraded to a Deluxe room which was clean, nicely furnished and quite spacious for a solo traveler.  I chose B&B accommodations and was also very pleased with the breakfast selections. The location is perfect and an easy walk to many major sites.  It is also just close enough to the heart of Temple Bar to be convenient, yet still far enough away to allow for a quiet night's sleep.  Dora at the Front Desk and Connor were exceptionally friendly and helpful and made special effort to ensure I enjoyed my stay.  Dublin is a fabulous city and I will most definitely stay at The Brooks when I go back.   ",5,2012,05,10
236,Wonderful hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The location cannot be beat: close to Temple Bar and all the major attractions.  Breakfasts are terrific, and the restaurant was fine for dinner, though don't miss the Hairy Lemon pub next door! Our room was comfortable and quiet.  For the money, this is a real find.",5,2012,05,09
236,The perfect base,"New to us, the Brooks was a hugely pleasant experience.........from the first welcome to farewell, staff was sincerely helpful and friendly.  Connor is a fine ambassador!  Hotel is a nice size, beautifully located in a very cool neighborhood and an easy walk everywhere.  Rooms nicely appointed, dining in the hotel was excellent.  In the basement a wonderful lounge for guests.  Free WiFi a necessary bonus.  Hairdryer right in the bathroom!  Now our favourite Dublin hotel.",5,2012,05,08
236,"""Fork Over Those Extra Euros For Brooks Hotel""","Brooks Hotel in Dublin is the best argument to fork over those extra euros for a more upscale hotel experience.  From an oversize bed, opulent room furnishings, a good breakfast, friendly front desk staff and a pair of very helpful concierge, staying at the Brooks was the highlight of my April visit to Dublin.  (Check out my hotel room photo.)  Perhaps the most charming feature of the room was a vintage transistor radio that allows you to listen to opera all day.

The hotel is a short walk to Grafton Street and its many fine eating places.  Ask the concierge for directions to Kitchen, GBK Gourmet Burger Kitchen and the steak house Darwins for the best meals this side of Dublin. 

The Irish are probably the friendliest people I've met in Europe and they really make you feel that they appreciate that you've visited their country.",5,2012,05,08
236,Excellent hotel - great location,"We stayed 3 nights at the Brooks Hotel - it was our first trip to Ireland.  The rooms were well appointed, very clean and the staff was very helpful - especially Connor!  The breakfast was wonderful - many items on the menu to choose from - we had drinks & appetizers in the hotel lounge, the wait staff and bartender were very attentive.  The hotel location is great - it is located on a relatively quiet street, easy walking to all the sites & shopping Dublin has to offer.  We will definetly stay at the Brooks again when we return to Dublin!",5,2012,05,07
236,Satisfied Seniors,"We have stayed in Brooks Hotel before. It is our favourite hotel in Dublin. The location is very central. The staff are excellent. Breakfast and dinner are top class.The rooms are spotlessly clean, quiet and comfortable.",5,2012,05,02
236,Nice hotel. Friendly helpful staff. Especially reception.,We were in Dublin for just one night and decided to stay in Brooks because of the central and convenient location. The room was small but very clean and well presented.Breakfast was really nice and our two waitresses were most attentive. We enjoyed our stay BUT have one gripe.When going to our room at around 9.30 I wanted a bottle of water to take with me. I went to the bar and was charged 7.20euro for a 750ml bottle of Tipperary still water. Come on Brooks. Thats just ridiculous. One last thing for people visiting Dublin. We had a very nasty meeting with two aggressive and drunk beggars not 100 meters from the hotel entrance. Dublin is a great city but be careful out there.,5,2012,04,29
236,Good value,"Great location, very nice rooms, helpful staff - loved it.  Was booked up due to a rugby match, otherwise would have stayed again on the swing back through Dublin.",5,2012,04,23
236,Schizophrenic Hotel experience,"We stayed in two rooms while at Brooks. The first room was great (albeit small) but seemed newly renovated and clean. Location is awesome and staff helpful. The second room seemed outdated, old and dirty. There were stains on the mattress and the bathroom had mold. It was still nice, but not worth the price (second room). Overall it was nice and would stay again... just be sure to have the newer rooms!",4,2012,04,23
236,One of the best in its class in Dublin,"We have stayed in Brooks on several occassions and each time we go back, we are continued to be impressed.
First of all the location is super, within easy walking distance to all the nicer parts of the city, busing restaurants and cafe bars. The hotel itself is very comfortable with a lot of little extras in the rooms, the retro radio playing classical music when you enter is a great touch, as is the turn down service. The bar also has a very calm relaxing athmosphere, in the centre of all the fuss outside. Haven't eaten dinner so can't comment on that, but the standard of their breakfasts is very high, with it being very obvious that they use good quality produce to start with. Looking forward to our next trip, hopefully soon !!",5,2012,04,18
236,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location","This hotel is lovely, I went to Dublin for 5 days. One the first day and throughout the time i spent in Dublin i was pretty much bed bound with a fever and a very swollen throat, the hotel staff were so nice. I called reception for some salt (to gargle) at 4 in the morning and it was at my room in seconds with a smile and they gave me fresh honey and lemon to drink with hot water. The restaurant food (breakfast and dinner) was brilliant. The staff were helpful, they smiled and made my stay in Dublin much more enjoyable even though the only time I saw Dublin was to go to the chemist and back. Great Location, right by pretty much everything. And they had a pillow menu.:) If i was going to actually pick at anything (and this is really picking) there wasn't enough closet space for my clothes, but i was stuck in my PJ's the whole time so it didn't really matter. The room was lovely, bed was comfortable. can't fault it really.",5,2012,04,16
236,"Fantastic hotel, great service, central location","We spent two nights at Brooks hotel and recommend it highly. The service was fantastic, rarely have I stayed somewhere where every single member of staff I came across was so helpful, friendly and professional. The room was of a very high standard and the breakfast was great - I couldn't make any suggestions for how it could be better! The location is central yet noise was no problem whatsoever, it was perfect for being able to access many sights / areas by foot, and close to the hop on / hop off bus route for journeys further afield. The hotel also has a resident whisky professor (!) offering whisky sampling sessions for those familiar with whisky and those who are not - We had a very informative introduction to irish whisky, if you have chance give it a go. We booked our stay based on the reviews on Trip advisor and were not disappointed, I would not hesitate to stay at Brooks should I find myself in Dublin again.",5,2012,04,13
236,One more review in Favor of this Hotel,There were 6 of us traveling together for our first visit to Ireland. The breakfasts were very good but you need to tell the waiter that you like your eggs a certain way. The rooms are very nice and the beds are great. The staff is so accommodating. We had a driver but can see how the parking could be a problem.It is located so well! This hotel helps make the whole Dublin experience even better.,5,2012,04,12
236,this is really classy,"I loved this beautifull, well located hotel. It has lots of charm, superb service, large confortable rooms, good bathrooms. Breakfast is excellent and so is Francesca, the hotel's restaurant. The entrance hall is rather plain, but once you get into your room or you go to their superb lounge room, you will find well decorated and cozy spaces. A great place for short or long stays",5,2012,04,12
236,Excellent hotell in the perfekct location,"The standard of the hotel was a very positive and pleasant surprise. We were very well recieved by the personell on arriving. The Rooms were spacious and nicely decorated and well cleaned.
We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the food was lovely and  the service excellent, especial one waiter that was very entertaining and made us laugh many times. The hotell bar was also very nice. The best ting with the hotel were the location, the size of the room and the very friendly and service-minded personell. I don't have one negative ting to say about The Brooks. Next time we travel to Dublin we will definitely choose the Brooks. We will recommend the hotell to friends and family",5,2012,04,09
236,Great hotel in Dublin with everything going for it.,"We stayed here in April 2012 for one night only, but the professionalism and attentive staff make an enormous difference, seems to be a good place to work. Our room was not very big but sparklingly clean and the bathroom was excellent. Wonderful location as the shops and restaurants are very close, and the street is very quiet- no noise disturbance from traffic.",5,2012,04,08
236,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel. The staff are attentive and very good.Loved my room - comfortable and well appointed. This is my third stay in the hotel and I will be back again - perfect for shops, eateries and very welcoming. Thanks to all in hotel.",5,2012,03,31
236,Loved it!,"I was here for three nights in August.  The hotel is in a great location, service was wonderful, rooms were clean and modern.  I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Dublin.",5,2012,03,29
236,"Great hotel, let down by poor food.","Stayed here recently, the room was fine, the general areas within the hotel are very nice, comfortable atmosphere and the reception staff and front of house staff were very warm and professional. the food however was miserable. from the 'cooked' or microwaved breakfast, with tasteless food and overcooked eggs, to dinner, with flavourless, careless meals. at a four star rating i expect that the chef can at least master the art of salt and pepper. it is unfortunate as it let the rest of the stay down. we skipped breakfast the second day, although it was included in the price, as it was utterly unappealing. when you are staying in such a great central location with a high rating and high prices to match you don't expect to be so badly let down by the food.",3,2012,03,25
236,Location and Comfort!,"We chose this hotel based on the numerous reviews touting the location and they were correct.  The hotel is situated close to shopping, theaters, Temple Bar, Trinity College, museums and numerous pubs and restaurants.  The rooms were well appointed, clean and the front desk staff was exceptional. The only downside we experienced was when we stopped for an after dinner drink at the lounge.  My sister and I both got the feeling that the bar staff was a bit overwhelmed at the time we were there.",5,2012,03,21
236,High quality hotel where service is top priority.,"Was in Dublin on business over St Patrick's weekend and stayed 2 nights at Brooks Hotel.   This hotel is classier and more high-end than I would have booked for a normal partying weekend, however it was booked through my work.  It is in the heart of the action....moments from the shopping and also bars, restaurants.  The room was beautiful.  Everything was immaculately clean and finished to a very high standard.  Large room with comfortable bed.  A bowl of fresh fruit was laid out complimentary as was a lovely bag of chocolate trifles...courtesy of the chef.  Breakfast was efficient and very tasty.  There was a wide selection of cooked or cold breakfasts.  The main thing though was the staff.  They were so friendly and polite throughout and nothing was too much trouble for them. ",5,2012,03,19
236,weekend in dublin,"A very comfortable hotel in the the centre of dublin - tricky to locate if you're driving ( one way system!!).  Lovely staff, fabulous breakfast.  The downside is the parking -  only reduced rates from 5.30pm until noon the following day - quite expensive if you stay longer than this.",4,2012,03,15
236,Helpful Friendly Staff,"This was one of the best Vacations.  Thanks in much to  the staff at the Brooks hotel.  I could not have asked for  better accommodations staff.  We checked out several hotels prior to booking with the Brooks Hotel.  We actually had reservations at a 5 star hotels that I cancel after calling and speaking with the Anne K., the receptionist.   Anne was so warm and friendly that I felt as though we were going to visit family members.  I traveled with 3 of my coworkers and we have no complaints. The hotel staff was absolutely wonderful ,from  Anne(General Manager) coming out to personally welcome us, to the helpfulness of Martin and the restaurant staff.  While I did not get to meet Cornell, his tips and behind the scene assistance with reserving a cab for our tours was truly appreciated.  Yes, the rooms were not large rooms, my roommate and I found it provide enough space for us not to feel cramped and the rooms were kept spotless, with a wonderful nightly turn down treat. 

The hotel is centrally located, within a few blocks we found  restaurants, shops, bars, Trinity college,  the books of Kells, and the HOP-On -Hop off bus.  
If I am ever in Dublin again, the Brooks Hotel is where I would stay.",5,2012,03,08
236,Love this hotel!!! Would stay there again!!,"Brooks hotel was the perfect location, near temple bar and a short walk to pretty much everything.  The room was exceptionally clean, loved the turn down service and the pillow menu!!!  The best part of our stay was the staff.  Connor and all the front desk people, everyone was warm and welcoming and made wonderful suggestions for where to eat and how to get there!!!  There were great shops nearby and wonderful pubs to explore as well!!!  Favorite was The Hairy Lemon next door!!",5,2012,03,06
236,"Perfect location, lovely room, exceptional breakfast","We chose the Brooks Hotel primarily for the location and we were not disappointed. It is absolutely perfect in that regard, with its ultra-close proximity to pubs, restaurants, cafes, and shops -- and Grafton Street -- a shopper's dream. Although we had a warm welcome, as trans-Atlantic travelers we were completely exhausted and and more than a little disappointed to discover that our room was not ready (it was around 8 am) and wouldn't be until 1 pm! The prospect of waiting around until then was a little daunting when all one wants to do is lay down! We were, however, made relatively comfortable in the guests' private sitting room one floor below -- tea was brought which was welcome (no biscuits though!). We rallied, left our bags and took a leisurely dawdle around the area -- lots to see, even at that hour. Had a bite to eat and returned to find our room was ready a little earlier than projected -- thank goodness. The staff were very caring and kind. I guess this is must be an ongoing challenge for any European hotel with overseas visitors as check-in is almost always around 11 or later. Anyway, very pleasant room and exceptional service made up for this shortcoming -- not to mention one of the very best breakfasts I have ever enjoyed in a hotel. Very nice little bar area, too, with whisky nosings available!",4,2012,03,05
236,Can't wait to go back,"I'm only doing this review so long after my stay because I'm new to Trip Advisor.  We love this hotel!  The doorman Connor and front desk staff were wonderful, room was clean, and it's so close to our favorite pub, The Hairy Lemon.  It was a great location for sightseeing on foot as well.",5,2012,03,03
236,A hidden Gem just around the Corner,"on Valentines day last my husband treated me to an overnight stay taking in a play at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin. He booked a hotel close to the centre of things ,but on arrival I was not happy with it ,as we had a four hour wait to check in,and we were not allowed stay in the hotel and not even a chair in reception area. I took a stroll up the little street and came across Brooks Hotel ,went in for morning coffee. I was instantly at home and felt the warmth and friendly buzz and decided this is where I am going to stay. The receptionist  Ann was so friendly and helpful and booked us into a lovely double room on the 6Th floor room 603, in fact we were upgraded. The hotel is so close to Grafton St Stephens Green Theatres restaurants ,Museums all walking distance ,which suited us as we are both retired and did not wand to drive in the city. The room had everything one would need, plenty of fresh towels and toiletries ,and the bed was really comfortable.. Breakfast was lovely and offered a wonderful choice the whiskey porridge with cream was a treat. I believe the hotel is going to get a new face lift which will even enhance it further, Please don't loose your old boutique charm , Its a pity the lovely residence lounge is in the basement it should be close to where the restaurant is I think ,to add to the ambiance. Look some of the reviews I read were picky if someone is looking for a luxury hotel with garden views etc then book into one of them outside city centre. Brooks hotel offers charm attention to customer;s needs good food relaxed atmosphere and everything on your doorstep I will definitely be back for a longer stay next time. Well done Brooks hotel",5,2012,02,23
236,Perfect hotel and wonderful staff!,"This is the best hotel in Dublin. It's beautiful and the staff are wonderful. This place has old-fashioned values and the staff take customer service very serious. Everybody who works there will remember you when you return. I was stuck there during the volcano ash disaster, along with dozens of Americans and Canadians and all were so impressed by every aspect of the hotel. I stay there every time I visit Dublin and love being there. And the food's great too!",5,2012,02,21
236,17th and 18th February 2012.,"My partner and I stayed in Brooks hotel for two nights over the weekend. The first thing to say is that the location is perfect for central Dublin located between Great Georges Street and Grafton Street. Ideal for walking to all the central places of interest. The room was clean and of a good standard although getting a bit tired here and there. Our weekend rate, found on Trivago, included breakfast and was excellent value. The hot breakfast was of a very good standard. All of the staff we encountered were pleasant and very helpful. There is a secure public car park immediately opposite the hotel and as a hotel resident was available at a discounted rate.
I would recommend the hotel and would definately stay there again.",4,2012,02,20
236,An excellent little business hotel right in the centre of Dublin,"I travel to Dublin regularly and this is my preferred hotel when on business. It is centrally located, excellent value, and the lounge and lobby have plenty of space for small impromptu meetings. The rooms are outstandingly comfortable and very nicely decorated. For some reason the restaurant always seems to be empty, though the food is excellent and reasonably priced. The bar can get lively at times. Service is universally friendly, though it can be a  little slow when the bar is busy.",5,2012,02,20
236,Greed as emblem!!,"After more than thirty years of work and vacation travel , this is the first time in my life that We have found an hotel of this class where any opportunity , that may be used to support a good Capital City vacation  , became an opportunity to take money from the guest pockets.
Some example;
1)  A shaving Kit asked at reception desk ,late evening on arrival day,was payed 2.5 Euro
2)  All Bath Flacons Kit were not changed every day and practically after two night we were only with one Shampooing Kit (Just for Example!!)  
3)  As soon we have arrived , without any greeting at the reception desk, the customer has asked for Visa Credit Card in order to have a caution that with Our surprise was more than the value of all the stay already ooked and confirmed!!
We have tried to have a satisfactory explanation but they repley that the entering in force system is applied in case of some Room Bar use or unannanced breakfast!!
Not any drinks was found in Room Bar and also breakfast was already excluded from previous reservartion.
So!! Don't stay in this tipical example of stingy mentality management.
Last think!! The room was practically close to the roof basement air conditioner/warm unit 
and really noise.Unfortunately we don't need to open the windows in this winter season.",2,2012,02,20
236,good and central,"central to theatre and tourist area, comfortable clean and good value.",4,2012,02,19
236,Could hardly walk around the bed,"Last year my husband and I took a 10 day tour around southern Ireland with another couple. I had reserved a ""double room"" as we are used to sleeping in that sized bed. We expected the bed to be small BUT WE NEVER EXPECTED THE ROOM TO BE SO SMALL! 
The minute we arrived in the room we knew there would be a problem. We had two standard sized suitcases with no where to stow them. I had reserved the room 2 months in advance to ensure we could stay at this 4 star hotel with a great location. I immediately went back to the front desk and told them the issue. I asked if we could be upgraded to a larger room and we would pay the difference. They said they were sorry but they were sold out because of a popular concert that was in the area that evening. The people at the front desk gave me poor customer service. I'm a friendly person but they were ""snooty"". So I went back upstairs and tried to make the best of it. This proved to be impossible. There was so little space we could not walk around the room. The only place to stow the suitcases was in front of the door which was also in front of the bathroom door. Even the bottom of the line cruise cabin we stayed in years ago was roomier than this.
What would have been a beautiful culmination to our trip was actually a miserable experience whenever we were in our room at the Brooks.",2,2012,02,11
236,Best location for walking the streets of Dublin.,"The Brooks Hotel was the perfect starting point for  a day of walking the streets of Dublin.  Close to Temple Bar, shopping, and anything you wish to do while in the city.  Our standard room was clean, comfortable, but cramped.  On a side street, no window views.",4,2012,02,11
236,Ok,Yes the hotel is near the central scene. But it seemed to me a fairly bland hotel- could've been a mid range Hilton.  My room was ok-  a standard box that was not memorable though nothing was particularly wrong.  Hard to find enough plugs for the usual electronics of business life.  They did offer a pillow menu though I didnt explore the options.  A tub/shower that was small is another modest compromise vs more comfortable hotels.  The morning breakfast was reasonable.  I guess it's just being prepared for a mid value place after reading all this praise and expecting more than I experienced...,3,2012,02,06
236,First rate experience - highly recommend this hotel!,"We would absolutely stay at the Brooks Hotel again. The staff went over and beyond in helping us with touring ideas, restaurant reservations and transportation arrangements. Our room was clean and spacious. And you can't beat the location. Right in the heart of Dublin and walking distance from all the major city highlights. I LOVED this place. Fantastic. WAY better than the Trinity Capital Hotel, which we also stayed at, and did not have as positive of an experience. Stay at Brooks instead! It's worth it and reasonably priced.",5,2012,02,01
236,"Great location, great staff, good price","I stayed at the Brooks for three nights in January and despite the cold outdoors - everything was hot inside. First, the location. The Brooks is literally 5 minutes walk from most of central Dublin (Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, some of the Quays, O'Connell Street and more). There are plenty of pubs and good restaurants really nearby. Doesn't get better than that. Next, the staff. I've stayed at plenty of hotels of all qualities and just HAVE to compliment the Brokks' staff: Conor at the door, Eduard (who i believe secretly lives behind the reception desk as he was always there) and Harriet at the reception and the people (sorry that I did not catch your names) at the Francesca restaurant at breakfast time and in the Jasmine bar later on. I stayed in room 505 that was designated a deluxe room and while the bed was comfortable and the room and bathroom were reasonably spacious, I have to say that I've seen better. Also - the ice machine did not work during my entire stay (I mentioned that things were hot inside, didn't i?). The gym was small but as I was the only guest using it, it was fine. Too bad that towels were not always available down there and once the water had also run out. There is also a sauna that I did not use. The rates were very reasonable for center city and I would stay at the Brooks again as well as recommend it to others.",4,2012,01,30
236,excellent location and hotel,"On arriving we were welcomed by Connor who made us feel like one of the family.
the staff were very helpful and arranged for us to have an early check in as we were very early.
In my life time i have stayed in lots of hotels and consider this to be the most friendly and comfortable.
All the the staff showed a genuine interest in us. Great breakfast in a friendly environment.
The room was delightful.I would recommend this hotel to all.",5,2012,01,22
236,Perfect location for a stay in central Dublin,"Brooks hotel is ideally situated right near the lively part of Dublin. It is the perfect location near Stephens Green, Grafton Street and all the surrounding area.
If you are in Dublin for a night on the town I don't think there is a more perfect location.
Ok it's not the ritz but the prices reflect a good quality hotel without the excesses you might get in a 5 star.
I'd definitely recommend!",4,2012,01,13
236,A gem....,"Our family of 5 stayed at the Brooks for the first day/last two days of our trip to Ireland.   We had a most enjoyable stay in every way....attentive staff,  lovely setting, good food and drink....all in an excellent location for seeing the sites of Dublin.   I worked with agent Anne Kinsella and she made us all feel that we were her primary concern...quite a feat in a fully booked hotel!!!   I absolutely recommend the Brooks Hotel for your stay in Dublin.",5,2012,01,13
236,Solo Traveler,"The Brooks was my home away from home the last week of December 2011 through New Years Day. I enjoyed my stay there, and for the most part had a great experience. Ordering room service was sometimes a bit of a challenge, since they didn't always pick up when you called. Had to try several times to get something in. After being out all day exploring, I didn't want to try and figure out where to eat dinner. The food was good, but ordering was a pain. 

On one occasion, I asked for half the amount of a side (wedges) and they gave me twice as much. They didn't charge me extra, but gave me way more than I need/asked for. I booked a taxi the day before my last day there and a wake up call two hours before the taxi was to arrive. The wake up call did not happen. Thankfully I set my own alarm just in case, and I'm glad I did. According to the staff, it's automated, so not sure what happened. Only thing I really didn't like in the room was the kettle they provided. The inside coil was completely rusted out, not exactly something I want to drink out of. If I wanted tea, I just used tap water and set it at the highest temp. it would go. Saw this mentioned below, but I had no major issue's with wifi while there until the end of the week (assuming more people were trying to access it). They have a networking center in the basement that is great, and was always empty when I went.

Overall, I was happy with everything at the Brooks. The room was great (upgraded), comfortable bed and pillows, bathroom was stocked each day, as well as bottled water and tea.",4,2012,01,12
236,Not a good place to go if you want a  MERRY CHRISTMAS," My husband and I decided to have Christmas away from family for the first time. We really looked forward to a relaxed but jolly time. Unfortunately the experience was relaxed but not in the least jolly. There was absolutely no Christmas spirit, no atmosphere, no good music in fact the opposite was true. The pianist wasn't even able to play a Christmas tune.  On the positive side the food was good and as you will see from my scores the hotel over all is good but NOT if you want a jolly Christmas.",4,2012,01,11
236,Pretty Good Hotel in Central Dublin,"The Brooks is a nice hotel, centrally located in Dublin for all the attractions. The staff were friendly and attentive. We had a comfortable room, nothing fancy, but reasonable enough by Dublin standards. 

Visitors be aware. The Brooks is located in the Temple Bar area of Dublin which is an extremely  ""lively"" nighttime area, so don't expect quiet at night. Of course, if you're a party animal, you won't care.",4,2012,01,10
236,"A lovely hotel for a ""treat""","We stayed here for 2 nights at new years eve and loved it. The only two downsides are; the hotel is expensive in my opinion, price could be better and there were spanish sockets in the wall and only two actual plug points which was very odd? As the stay was going to cost a decent amount, we decided to pay the additional €20 a night and upgrade to a deluxe room which was really nice with bottled water and robes in the room. The hotel itself is very homely and cosey, even though it is also quite modern in decor, there is a really relaxed old fashioned luxury feel about it. The room itself was lovely and really nice comfy beds with goosefeather pillows. They also place a pillow menu in your room so you can have allergy pillows or partiuclarly comforting neck pillows etc brought to the room for you. I asked for a quiet room so we were situated on the sixth floor at the back of the hotel. The room veiw as a result wasn't great but it was really quiet and you could get a really peaceful silent nights sleep. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, enjoyed some really lovely red wine at the residents bar. The breakfast has plenty of options on offer for every taste, we went for the full irish and it was lovely. Would stay again but only for a treat or special stay as it is costly. However, hotel great, room great, food great, service....well you get it!One massive bonus is the location, just a 2 minute walk from Georges Street, South William Street, Grafton Street and some of the best bars and restaraunts in Dublin!",5,2012,01,02
236,Average,This hotel is in a great position. Rooms are small but adequately equipped. Maybe we were just unlucky but our room was never cleaned very well. Bathrooms were never restocked and we had to ask for tea and coffee replacements. Otherwise nice hotel. ,3,2011,12,31
236,Excellent Staff; Great Location,"I stayed over a weekend in the middle of December.

Pros:
Very friendly and accommodating staff - I think they are probably used to transatlantic travelers arriving early in the morning - I arrived at about 8 in the morning, and although my room wasn't ready, the front desk clerk invited me to have breakfast and use the guest lounge, which allowed access to a computer and various newspapers; this was great in that it gave me something to do and a chance to relax a bit before any shops/sites were open.
Great location - The hotel is on Drury, which is just a few minutes from both Trinity College and the shopping on and around Grafton Street. The location is convenient to the Trinity College Aircoach bus stop, which provides very reasonable airport transportation. It should be noted that the city center area of Dublin is fairly compact, so any city center location is probably convenient. Regardless, from this hotel, you can walk to most all of the major tourist sites if you wish (even the Guinness brewery is at most a 20 minute walk).
Great breakfast - Lots of variety, of a good standard, and a wide range of hours.
Cons:
Rooms are small and a bit dated (i.e. a blow dryer from probably 1982), but given the pricing, location, and standard of this hotel, I wouldn't let this bother you too much - it seems to be good value given most of the other options.
Can be noisy - I was there on a weekend, and therefore one would expect noise; I was on the 6th floor and away from the elevator, but the street noise outside was definitely not quiet for most of the evening.",4,2011,12,28
236,Fine hotel in the heart of the city,"The location of the Brooks can't be beat. A block or so to Grafton St, a few blocks to Trinity College and easy walking distance to most all of Dublin including the Temple Bar area.  Our room on the fourth floor was quiet and roomy with good sized bath. We opted to include breakfast which was very good and included menu items as well as breads, fruits and cereals. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Will definately stay here on our next visit.",4,2011,12,27
236,Centrally located,"Great location, easily accessible to restaurants, tourist sites and shopping.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast.  Modestly sized rooms well furnished.",4,2011,12,26
236,Excellent location,Location is excellent. Restaurant very good - we had pre-theatre menu and breakfast. We were not fortunate enough to get a re-furbished room but the decor was ok (Laura Ashley type). However plumbing in bathroom left a lot to be desired. No exaggeration -it took 10 minutes for tap or shower to run hot. That included second person in bathroom!!! Also plug in sink would not stay open. Window was not closing properly so was draughty and noisy. Pianist in bar was very jazzy and not at all seasonal for Christmas. On checking out we had been charged for having eaten dinner twice instead of once! However we would use hotel again but request a better room.,3,2011,12,21
236,Great value and great location,"Very friendly and welcoming!  They took excellent care of us.  Room was typical size for Ireland, but was warm and well equipped.   The location is great located in the middle of most of Dublin's sights.  We also had dinner at the hotel which was excellent.  If you're staying in Dublin, we highly recommend this hotel and will use them again the next time we're there!",5,2011,12,15
236,Okay For a Late Night Out in Dublin,"We stopped one night at Brooks to rest after our transatlantic flight before traveling onward to visit family in Derry.  We were hoping for a good night's sleep, but we did not get it.  We were given a first floor room facing Drury St.  Brooks Hotel is in a great location - easy walk to Grafton Street.  But this also meant a lot of late night pedestrian traffic passing by.  We were kept awake by street noise, and noise from the Brooks bar (including the piano playing which we could hear clearly in our room) until 3 am.  The bed is comfortable.  I was surprised to see this hotel still has old-fashioned televisions, but no one goes to Ireland to watch TV, right?  The staff was friendly, and the rooms were clean.  If you are in Dublin to stay out late and experience the night life, this is a great place to stay.  If, like us, you need some sleep, this might not be such a good choice.",3,2011,12,13
236,Wonderful Little Hotel In The Center of Everything,"The Brooks Hotel in Dublin was a pleasant surprise.  I was a little worried about it.  The photos I saw online weren't the most flattering and while guidebooks didn't say anything negative, they don't exactly endorse it either.  

But, other than trying to park in this part of Dublin, the Brooks Hotel is a wonderful place to stay.  The people at the reception desk were warm and helpful, the concierge was incredibly helpful, going well beyond what we expected from him.  The rooms were on the small side, but beautiful.  The beds were among the most comfortable we've ever come across.

The location is ideal.  It's a short walk to all of the major sites in Dublin, making this a terrific home base.",5,2011,12,11
236,breakfast not as good as it was!,"Disorganised staff, cold toast, full irish breakfast lacking enthusiasm and crispness.  Will still come again and again, but a wee bit more due care and attention required on cooked breakfasts is required!   Porridge has got worse over time!  Sorry to be a bore!",4,2011,12,11
236,Again: very good,Another annual trip to Dublin with my wife and again the great atmosphere of this extremely well situated hotel. We usually eat in the city but this weekend each and every Dublin restaurant in the city center was overbooked. It was a pleasure to dine in the hotel itself. Nice music and excellent food. See you next year!,4,2011,12,11
236,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel, food v good, bar and lobby area spotless, great service, room was a little dated but spotless nonetheless.  Location excellent, highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back",4,2011,12,11
236,Why stay anywhere else?,"Clean as could be, modern, stylish room and the most helpful staff made this a great base for exploring Dublin.  Near great shopping and restaurants.  Can't wait to go back!!",5,2011,11,30
236,First Nights in Ireland,"We stayed here for the first  2days in Ireland after flying from Italy after 2 weeks driving in that country . We arrived quite late but that was not a problem as we checked in quickly and were shown ti the room which was terrific ,Great bed and lovely bathroom . The hotel is very near good shopping and restaurants but the Hairy lemon pub at the end of the street was a favourite .We only had Breakfast at the hotel which again was a superb buffet and you had to order the full irish breakfast which was a bit slow in arriving and the pot of tea was also very slow ( my only little gripe) The concierge Connor is an absolute diamond and a wealth of local knowledge and a true gentleman who made our stay fabulous",5,2011,11,29
236,Great Hotel and Staff,"We stayed here for a long weekend with friends to celebrate my husbands 50th, the Hotel is in a great location for shops and restaurants but in a quiet street. The hotel staff were very helpful and Conor the Head Concierge made our trip even better. Breakfast is served at weekends until 11.30am and is cooked to order which is great.",4,2011,11,29
236,"Great, But Not Fantastic – Slipped A Bit","This was our third visit, albeit that we hadn’t been for a few years.  3 nights to relax, do some shopping and just please ourselves.  The Brooks Hotel was our hotel of choice, always has been when in Dublin.  It has lots to recommend it, not least that it’s a 4 star hotel with a really great central location.  Quiet, near but not on main streets, but a short walk to great shopping, serious history and huge varieties of restaurants.
  
The executive room, was comfortable, with a great bed, choice of pillows, tea and coffee making facilities and heating and air-conditioning that was efficient and quiet...it didn’t rattle noisily through the night.  The bathroom was very clean, a good size with a separate shower.  Nice Pecksniff's products, lots of mirrors, great lighting for make up and hair.  So far so good.
 
The restaurant we only used for breakfast, where the food was fresh, varied and plentiful, but the service was sometimes painfully slow.  By contrast, the Jasmine Bar, with friendly and efficient staff, was wonderful for afternoon teas, long chats with friends and so relaxing you were tempted not to leave the building at all. There is a small but functional gym, and also a really quiet and relaxing resident’s lounge.
 
Any issues?  Well, yes. The hairdryer was weak and not really good enough, 4 star should provide better.  There was no safe in room 411 and so that was a problem.  The Wi-Fi in the room was temperamental at best and at one point I held my iPad above my head inside the room’s main door in order to get a signal.  The computer in the residents lounge was irritatingly slow to respond, if indeed it chose to respond at all.

The irritations were just that, irritating.  These shouldn’t happen in a 4 star hotel.  The good things probably balance out the bad, enough to make the overall impression positive.  We would go again, and would stay there from choice.  But if it was my hotel, and my name on the door...I’d be looking into the ways to make it 4+ and not just reaching a 4.",4,2011,11,25
236,Excellent hotel Shambolic Service,The hotel is absolutely lovely now I must point out I stayed here on a voucher which I got from my employer in the hotel industry and overall it was excellent value even if I paid full price. however onto the service I arrived late on a Friday night and the night Supervisor Eric Checked us in it had been a long journey as I had got a flat tire on my way to Dublin and left my credit card at home so I offered him my laser card to take a pre authorization but he took 50 euro out of my account and it took almost a week for me to get it back I also found the waiter at breakfast extremely condescending My self and my partner went for breakfast and I am on a special diet so I ordered just scrambled eggs and mushroom and the Indian guy looked at me in amazment and four times offered me a full Irish despite being told no I felt extremly un comfortable and this was disgracefull however breakfast taster lovely and it was a good stay,3,2011,11,24
236,Really nice hotel,"The Brooks is a really lovely hotel right in the centre of Dublin. The staff were all extremely helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble.
The room was spotlessly clean as were all the common areas of the hotel. Food was excellent and the breakfast porridge had a nice Irish twist to it.
A hotel you can't go wrong with, recommended for a comfortable stay and just a few minutes walk to the heart of the action.",5,2011,11,16
236,Great choice,Centrally located hotel within walking distance of most major attractions.  Nice decor.  Courteous staff.  Outstanding breakfast buffet.  Highly recommended.,5,2011,11,14
236,"Great location, great staff, shame about the restaurant.","This is a wonderful place to stay. It's friendly and welcoming and the staff were extremely helpful (great nearby restaurant selections etc). The only letdown was the hotel restaurant. We tried it twice (on the off chance that the first experience was not typical) and unfortunately the second time was no better than the first. Lesson learned. No worries because the front desk staff were extremely helpful in helping us find great restaurants nearby (ask for directions to Darwin's - a family-owned restaurant nearby). The room was very clean and comfortable (take advantage of the pillow menu). We were in Dublin for five days and after long days of sightseeing, this was a great, relaxing place to return to.",4,2011,11,13
236,Great Location,"Spent a Sat and Sun night at Brooks Hotel at the start of a business trip.  Location is great for getting around Dublin.  I walked everywhere (mostly because I kept getting lost!  More street signs please!)  Service was good.  Did take them quite a while to get my bags to my room after I checked in but aside from that, staff was very attentive.   My room faced the street so the noise on Sat night was a little loud but nothing extraordinary...it is a city after all.  Room was clean and comfortable.  Internet access was excellent.  Only complaint would be that the tub did not drain very well when taking a shower. I didn't try the restaurant or bar in the hotel as too many good choices elsewhere in the city but the bar did look very comfortable.",4,2011,11,12
236,Quality and Hospitality,"This was our first trip to Ireland or together.  We just returned  that past October and our final hotel was the Brooks Hotel!  It was excellent.   The hotel itself is quaint and exquisite.  It is nice to come back from a day's outing and see that there were chocolates on our pillows.   I appreciate the staff and their hospitality.  They were able to assist us will all our needs down to getting pillows at the last minute to assist us with our sleeping issues.   The staff has such knowledge of the area and can direct to you make sure you see their wonderful country.  The hotel is located in a perfect part of town so you can see the highlight of Ireland such as Trinity College or Temple Bar.  Despite in the city, parking was simple with a rental. 
We plan to return to Ireland and we plan to stop there again.  What a quality hotel with a flare or Europe and home.",5,2011,11,10
236,A comfortable hotel in an excellent location with excellent service,"We stayed at Brooks Hotels for two days In November. The location is extremely convenient being just behind Grafton Street and a few minutes walk to both Trinity College and St. Stephens Green. The Airbus to the airport, tourist buses, city buses and taxis are all available closeby. There are excellent restaurants two minutes walk and Brown Thomas department store is also nearby.

The Hotel has a very efficient Reception with an extremely friendly Conceirge who is very knowledgeable. The is a comfortable well stocked bar, a Sitting Room and Restaurant. Lifts attend all floors.

Our room was a smallish double, with ensuite ,well fitted with a mini bar, desk, table and two easy seats. A good selection of uptodate magazines were provided of varying topics. A selection of different pillows are available upon request.The furnishings was quite dated but all in good condition. The bathroom was extremely well fitted with a large selection of Peck and Sniff bathroom toiletries. 

Overall the Hotel would benefit from a major refurbishment to bring it into the modern age but accepting the slightly tired decor it does remain a very comfortable place to stay in Dublin. We did not have breakfast but used the excellent in-room tea-making facilities.",3,2011,11,08
236,My lovely stay at Brooks Hotel,"It's true: Brooks Hotel is the smallest luxury hotel in Dublin. But the most important thing is that the staff is so kind and friendly, this is why it became my second home when I am in Dublin. Moreover is located near the most important streets of shopping and near the most beautiful Dublin's attractions.",5,2011,11,08
236,Wheelchair accessible and in the heart of Dublin,"We loved this place.  It was in the center of everything, parking was available across the street in a covered parking garage subsidized for hotel guests.  This hotel is really spectacular because of the staff.  It's a small place, you get to know the staff quickly, they cannot do enough.  The bar is lovely, the dining room is nice and the food is superb.  We ate here most of the time.  There is a small ""reading room"" in the basement exclusively for guests complete with computers, lots of books, peace and quiet; I found it to be a bit too warm for me but my sister spent a lot of time down there on the 'net.  Waitstaff and the concierge were the best.  We had a small emergency which the concierge helped to resolve quickly.  This was an excellent choice for a hotel.  
If you are in a wheelchair and street traveling in Dublin, be aware that the streets are sometimes cobblestone, especially in the Temple Bar area where we went at night.  It's difficult to find an accessible place for Irish music that isn't packed with patrons.  Most places have a step or two up to enter.",5,2011,11,07
236,lovely hotel in heart of dublin's entertainment area,"I stayed here at the weekend with work colleagues. Wonderful hotel with friendly and helpful staff, the hotel is spotlessly clean and beautiful throughout. Was a little more expensive than other city centre hotels but worth the extra stretch for the quality of room, location and service. Highly recommended!",5,2011,11,07
236,Great service in central location,"This was a real find!  Very friendly staff, lovely room and free wifi.  What's more, it's dead central to all the sights of Dublin city.  Loved it here!",5,2011,11,03
236,Loved It,"Stayed for 2 nights in early August ( was going to the dublin horse show) myself  and my 12 year old daughter. Staff were really really nice and very helpful. Room was fantastic. Food was lovely had breakfast and an evening meal. Cocktails were lovely. Location was perfect couldn't get better, for a hotel in city centre it was quiet at night. Will go back again.",5,2011,11,02
236,We really liked the Brooks Hotel,"Could not find fault with anything about this hotel. The staff were always especially helpful and pleasant. The room was very clean and the location cannot be beat.

We had one meal in the hotel restaurant on an especially rainy night and we really enjoyed our dinner. Very nice atmosphere overall in the hotel.",4,2011,11,02
236,Great central spot,"Thanks to all at the Brook, especially Ann on the front desk who was always helpful and friendly, even when we met her on the street after her shift was over. Room very comfortable and spacious. Breakfasts great as were the Irish coffees we had in the bar after an evening out. Would stay there again.",5,2011,10,31
236,I would go back to the Brooks Hotel in a minute!,"We stayed in room 518 for 3 nights. Our room was wonderful. It had a television near the bathtub, a separate large shower with great water pressure, and 2 sinks.

We had an upgrade so the room was large with 2 comfortable chairs and a balcony with a table and chairs.
The dinner was great as well as the drinks at the bar and the breakfast was so good!
We loved the hotel and the employees went out of their way to assist us.
Our phone did not ring to give us a wake up call and one of the employees came to our room and knocked.
The location was so convenient-I recommend it to everyone.",5,2011,10,30
236,"Good location, priced accordingly","The hotel was very comfortable, the lounge areas spacious and inviting.  We enjoyed late night tipples in the hotel bar and toddled off to our comfortable bed and room.  The hotel fronts a relatively narrow street, but it is a major thoroughfare and as our room overlooked the street, we were woken early in the morning by the everyday cacophony of a busy city.  

A sign in the lobby urged guests to dress 'smart casual', as befits the hotel's standards.  A bit presumptuous, we thought.",4,2011,10,24
236,3 Special Nights at the Brooks Hotel,"We recently started our first-ever trip to Ireland with 3 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin and what a fantastic way to begin our 2-week tour of this beautiful country. The Brooks has everything, great rooms, great location, great service and great staff. Our morning breakfasts at the Brooks were the perfect way to start our days. Our one evening dinner at the Brooks was nothing like ""hotel"" food with our meals being freshly and deliciously prepared and presented. The city center locations was perfect for getting to the highlights of Dublin. We would love to get back to Ireland and would surely include the Brooks Hotel as our place to stay in Dublin.",5,2011,10,22
236,Excellent hotel - perfect location!,"We recently spent 4 nights at the Brooks Hotel while visiting Dublin as tourists.  We could not have been happier with our choice of staying at the Brooks.  Most importantly - the location was perfect - close to most things we wanted to see - Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Stevens Green, Merrion Square , etc.   The Hop-on-Hop-off was also very near  The hotel itself was very nice with comfortable rooms, great service, excellent and helpful staff...basicially everything for a perfect stay.",5,2011,10,21
236,Fabulous experience,"Our group of eight requiring 4 double rooms arrived at the hotel on Sept.22. The overall experience was excellent. Friendly staff, excellent breakfast and a surprisingly good in hotel restaurant (Francesca's) were all enjoyed by us. Great value for this ""downtown"" hotel within a few blocks from Grafton Street and Temple Bar. We shall return !!!",5,2011,10,21
236,"Perfect location, nice staff, comfortable room","My husabnd and I stayed at the Brooks for 3 nights in Dublin.  The staff was very pleasant and the location was superb.  You literally can walk to everything from Grafton St. to the Liffy to a ton of fantastic restaurants.  The rooms are standard, meaning not 5 star, but very clean and comfortable.  The price was really great, so we didn't mind it was not The Four Seasons.",4,2011,10,14
236,great location - what a jem,What a lovely hotel - It is so brilliant as its in the middle of all the shops and everything  - we were so lucky to get a room as its so popular .The breakfast was really good and there were a lot of details in the hotel we liked. It was a great place to start the day.,5,2011,10,14
236,Ideal Boutique Hotel,We stayed here for 9 days and loved everything about this small hotel. I had read other  positive reviews and I agree. Perfectly situated within walking distance to all visitor hilites and wonderful helpful staff to assist. We were a party of 30 and proved to be a handful for the hotel at times but management and staff did everything we could have asked for.  The rooms are tidy and very comfortable as was the linen. I would stay with them anytime.,5,2011,10,13
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin,"We recenty stayed three nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin before our driving tour around Ireland.  It was in a great position, quiet and yet still just around the corner from all the main attractions.  The concierge Connor was friendly and a great help to us... also very knowlegable about Aussie music which was a bit of fun.  He told us of two great places to eat and enjoy the local craic.  The rooms were clean, above average in size for Irish hotels and quiet.  The full Irish breakfast was to die for... just delicious.  If we are ever in Dublin again, this will definately our hotel.",5,2011,10,10
236,"amazing location, lovely staff","We were delighted to be upgraded to a deluxe room, which was very comfortable. Against some other advice here, I would say booking your cab to the airport through the hotel will not save you any money. Next time in Dublin, I would definitely come back to the Brooks.",4,2011,10,10
236,Great Hotel!!!,"Very nice stay at the Brooks Hotel.  All of the hotel staff was outstanding. The room was quite, clean and very well located to all of the attractions, shopping, great restaurants, etc.  The hotel bar was an excellent and quite place for a nightcap.  There is a ""rest"" area louge available for guests who arrive prior to checkin - from the U.S., this is awesome!  You can check e-mail, use the extremely nice restrooms, get a beverage, a bite to eat, or snooze in the comfortable chairs while getting over your jetlag and wait for your room.  I booked through Booking.com, and everything was just as advertised.  Super hotel, great 4 night stay for me and my family (3 different rooms)....I would highly recommend it!  This was reinforced by several other locals we talked to, all had very high marks for this hotel, and indicated if they had family or friends coming to Dublin, this is a hotel they would recommend.",5,2011,10,02
236,"Great location, reliable hotel","We topped and tailed our recent trip to Ireland with stays at Brooks Hotel in Dublin. I had stayed here numerous times before on business trips so was familiar with the hotel. The location is perfect for visitors as it is just a few streets behind Grafton Street, and therefore easy walking distance to most city centre attractions, shopping and restaurants. The staff are friendly and helpful, and a picnic that I had pre-ordered was exactly as requested and beautifully presented. My inlaws ate at the hotel restaurant, which they thoroughly enjoyed and found to be good value for money. The wireless internet needs a serious boost though, we bought prepaid SIM cards for our iPads as the free wireless was too flaky.",5,2011,10,02
236,Appalled,"I stayed at the Brooks for one night on the 23rd July. and never again!!!

I booked and pre-paid for the room through hotels.com and everything seemed OK. The staff at the desk were friendly enough and the room was clean and tidy but problems started arising when I came to check out. The guy on the desk informed me that I had not paid for the room. I explained to him that I had and pre-paid through hotels.com - I even showed him the confirmation e-mail that I still had on my phone. He then requested a card to take a 'pre-authorisation' payment. He told me that nothing would be taken from my account but within days £54.80 came off my debit account. I rang the hotel several times and spoke to Anne and Elaine. Eventually Anne stopped returning my calls and Elaine advised me to talk to 'MY' bank to recover the money. My bank confirmed that the Brooks hotel are holding my money and that is still true to this day. The contrast between pre-stay and post-stay Customer Service has been huge - To the point where I now feel compelled to warn other guests of my experience - 1 Star!",1,2011,10,01
236,Very friendly hotel,"This was my first stay in Dublin and I really enjoyed the whole experience. The hotel is very close to the Temple Bar area and also near our favorite Pub, the Hairy Lemon.
The rooms are very nicely designed with a great feel to them. The hotel even provides a pillow menu were you can decide exactly what kind of pillow you want.
The breakfast for 10 EUR was extremely good with a great buffet and a great menu for cooked items.
The only thing I would not give the highest grades was the fitness room. It was really tiny with just a few cardio machines and no weights.",5,2011,09,27
236,Very good choice,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Temple Bar for two nights last week.  I would say this place is overall a great choice.  I was looking for a good value during our stay and feel I got it here.  Nothing is very cheap in Dublin when you're considering the value of the US vs. Euro but, it's vacation right.  My fiance and I arrived and told the hotel we just got engaged and they upgraded our room...which turns out, was great for us.  When she returned later in her stay (I was only here a short time), she was in a regular room and, although it was clean and as large, the furnishings were not as new as the room we stayed in so keep that in mind.

Rooms-very clean, the furnishings were very up to date, in our room at least, and the bed was comfortable.  They actually give you 4 choices of pillows, which was a first for me.  The in room wireless worked well for the most part and the restroom was very roomy.  Shower was a bit short for taller people but the water pressure and temp were great.  We were right on the street and slept with the windows open.  The noice from the area is rather loud at night but after a few drinks, I slept right through it.

Staff-friendly and went above and beyond.  Told them about the engagement that morning and they gave us the upgraded room and sent up a nice letter and some cupcakes.  Unfortunately, the cup cakes were tossed out with the letter during the cleaning of the room which was unfortunate but hey, they looked to be tasty so we just considered it the cleaning ladies tip!  They really tried to go above and beyond with every facet of the staff.  The included breakfast was very good as well.  

Overall-I would highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind spending a couple of bucks.  I'd go back if I'm in Dublin for a few nights again.",5,2011,09,26
236,"warm, friendly ,helpful staff","we chose the brooks hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor....the location is excellent with many sights, restaurants and pubs in the immediate area....we had just landed in dublin that morning and the staff couldn't have been more accomodating providing us with a place to freshen up since our rooms weren't ready yet....the rooms were spotless and nicely furnished...we'd definitely return there on a trip to dublin",5,2011,09,23
236,EXCELLENT,Ideal location close to all amenities in this wonderful city. Actual views from hotel not ideal. An excellent staff who make you feel very welcome. Breakfast superb the best I have experienced anywhere in Europe. Rooms very comfortable with all facilities. I return every year.,5,2011,09,21
236,Disappointed...,"Made reservations 4 months ahead of time because we were traveling with another couple...at check-in we were 2 floors apart. Our room was fine, but the other couple had a room facing the street on floor 2 and could not sleep due to the noise from the people leaving the Pubs around the area and yelling in the streets from midnight onwards. They would not give the couple another room until the morning. Very disappointed in the front desk and the hotel manager. They knew about the noise. Do NOT stay in a room on floors 2-3 facing the street!!
The food was good and the service in the dining area was very good, and the pillow menu is fun. Unfortunately this hotel does not live up to the image it is trying to project.",3,2011,09,21
236,romantic break,"we traveled to Dublin and Brooks Hotel for a small mini honeymoon in July 2011

i decided on this hotel after selecting there romantic package from there own website......i will admit the romantic break was not worth the money and i didn't feel like we was being treated to a romantic break at all.... other than the heart shaped petals on our bed on arrival, other than that the hotel did nothing to make our stay feel special in a romantic way.... this was very disappointing to me as i was trying to treat my new wife (who says i'm never romantic) to a special 3 night stay in Dublin....... our room was nice quite spacious and very clean.... had everything we needed.... bathroom was nice, shower good - but the tv above the bath never worked = again was disappointing..... 

With the package we had was an evening meal for two in there restaurant.....  and i can say this meal was superb... the lady addressing our table was friendly and professional, the food was as near 5 star as i have seen....... as was the breakfast menu and again the service was got from the staff was very good..... as was the night staff within the bar who was always friendly and helpful

therefore on conclusion - the rooms are nice but i think all rooms could probably do with a updating.......staff are probably the most helpful i have ever come across on my travels and thank them for everything.... the food is also very good....

The hotel itself is close enough to to centre of Dublin to be in a prefect position for everything and is also nice and quiet so your sleep will not be disturbed.... 

all this said - the hotel is nice and i would stay there again - but at present with the condition of the rooms it is probably a bit price heavy for the whole package you will receive

the staff / restaurant are 4 / 5 star - the rooms are probably 3 star..... and for that i think this Hotel in its present state is a bit over priced",4,2011,09,17
236,Overrated & overpriced.,"Stayed in Classic Single room No. 312, 3rd floor, front of the hotel. Cost 148.00 Euros for 1 night room only basis. Central location of hotel ideal although Drury Street street is not particularly easy to find in the dark. Easy walking to many sites of interest for the tourist and only a short stroll to the City Tour / airport service bus stops. Plenty of pubs, cafes & restaurants in the vicinity.
Check-in/check-out dealt with by efficient & friendly enough receptionists. I  did not make use any of the guest facilities available choosing instead to spend as much time as I could exploring the city so I can only form an opinion of the hotel based on the on the room I stayed in. 
The room was quite small, but adequate for a single traveller. I found it impossible to adjust  the air-con unit for temperature or fan speed (the operating guidance provided implies it's centrally controlled - either that or it was broken). Thankfully the room had opening windows to let cool fresh air in to overcome the air-con deficiencies. There was no mini bar on offer though the online brochure implies there should be. There was only a kettle with a few sachets of tea, coffee, sugar & individual milk pots were provided. There was a small 'fridge (although it appeared to be broken as you could almost boil water in it!). The room had no clock/radio/alarm but a wake-up call service was available, if required (I'm unsure if that service is free). The bed was two uncomfortable singles pushed together. The bathroom had a cracked sink & stained lavatory bowl. Plenty of toiletries and clean towels were provided.  The over-bath shower took a good ten minutes to provide any water above freezing point but was ok once it had decided to warm up. There was little street noise once the window was closed and only minimal internal noise from banging doors etc. A free morning paper was  available from reception. 
Brooks' describe themselves as 4*. Although only experiencing a room for 1 night I would  have to say it is 4* in price only and could not recommend this hotel at the rates charged.",2,2011,09,17
236,Reasonably Close to Perfect Visit,"My wife and I are a couple of days into our first trip to Ireland, and it is our routine to plan our hotel reservations based upon the very detailed and unbiased reviews other Trip Advisor members very generously take time to post.  We spent our first two nights, in Dublin, at the Brooks Hotel, and once again noted that those Trip Advisor reviews were spot on, and the high ranking among hotels in Dublin very much legitimate.

We knew it was a good omen when a couple of pre-arrival email inquiries to the hotel were answered within literally minutes.  We had hoped that an early check-in would have been feasible, as our Delta flight was due to arrive at 6:45 a.m., and ended up arriving at 6:15 a.m., and others had posted here that the hotel had been able to accommodate unusually early check-in requests.  When we arrived at the hotel at 7:30 (the airport process and AirCoach bus were quite efficient), we were advised that the hotel had been full the night before, and it would probably not be until at least noon that we could access a room.  I would not even suggest that we were disappointed, as the official earliest check-in is posted as being 11 a.m.  Bubbly Ann at the front desk could not have been any more pleasant, and Marvin kindly took our luggage downstairs, and we spent a few minutes in their beautiful lounge, were brought some tea and coffee, as we planned our short term jet lag survival strategy.

After a visit to the Book of Kells, Merrion Square, and a red-bus 90 minute tour of Dublin, we were given keys to a room (#504).  It is a very comfortable and quiet room, with firm mattress, good strength and plenty warm (both parameters easily adjustable) shower.  The room's temperature control was great.  My wife is deathly allergic to feather pillows (the hotel has a rather unique Pillow Menu with five choices), so one was promptly switched out for foam.  I had the foresight to bring an adapter for my PC power cord, but I somehow overlooked the fact that my PC cord had three prongs, and my UK adapter only accepted a two prong input, so Ann bailed me out with one of theirs, which I returned to the front desk the next day once I walked a block to a nearby hardware store and purchased one for Euro 6.50...the WiFi worked great (evidently NOT the case for all rooms, worth requesting in advance if relevant to your personal needs).

We had hoped for some ""authentic"" Irish pub grub the first night, and we were directed to the Hairy Lemon, which is right around the corner...a separate positive review has been posted for them.  And breakfast at Bewley's on Grafton Street (we did that twice) was an unbeatable experience.

Just a couple of minor suggestions, though, for the hotel:

1.  A clock of some sort in the room would have been helpful...or maybe it is standard in Ireland to not provide that particular amenity
2.  Has the hotel management ever personally tried out those tiny ""step on the pedal"" garbage containers in the bathrooms?  The usual end result of stepping on the pedal was that the can toppled over.
3.  Our 7 am wake call was phoned at 7:15 am...we were already up and about, but of course the quarter hour could have been problematic for someone with a time urgent schedule.

Others have noted the proximity of the Brooks Hotel to just about anything a visitor to Dublin might need to see.  It was a healthy ten minute walk from the Grafton Street Air Coach drop off site to the hotel, and we ended up taking a taxi to get back to the departure point for the return to the airport (10 Euro including tip), having four pieces of luggage to manage.  With less ""stuff"", the walk and baggage transfer would have otherwise been an easy to accomplish task.

So, the Brooks Hotel gets a solid thumbs up from us, and we would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone making a visit to Dublin.",5,2011,09,17
236,Missing on the easy things,"This hotel misses on the easy things which is odd because on other things, they excell. The hotel is in an amazing location so you can walk to almost every attraction and many good 'cafs', restaurant and of course, pubs are very close. This brings me to the first miss: the food, average at best and poor at its worst. We didn't spend alot of time at hotel but three meals in two weeks and it went downhill. The other misses are based on false expectations: they do not have us/uk power as they report. They do have the capability in the bathroom but none of the instruments are programmed according to management so they're respond was converters. Unfortunately, many others thought the same as we did so converters are in demand and you have to wait for one to become available. They refused to set up a waiting list and kept telling us to check in the morning. It took three mornings. And good luck trying to find a plug. You have to unplug something else but be careful, the plugs are all alarmed so when we tried to charge our phones one night, we were awaken at 1a.m. with the alarm and figured it out after five minutes. (Sorry, if we woke the whole floor). The hotel should forewarn people of this but next morning, we were met with only a shrug frm staff. The last is the 'power shower'! This was actually comical. The shower is a drizzle at best and where the power went, who knows?

In there defence, the service was 'grand' as they say.",3,2011,09,16
236,Great location; average food,"We stayed only one night so we did not really have much interaction with staff. The package we had included dinner and breakfast. The room was quiet and comfortable. The dinner was from a special menu, offering adequate variety. I really enjoed the soup and pasta but my husband's meal was OK but not spectacular. My real disappointment was breakfast. The buffet was limited and we did not have time to order from the menu. Perhaps I was spoiled by the previous place I had stayed, a lovely B&B in Edinburgh with fantastic breakfast. 

Having said that, I would consider staying here again as the location is great - very close to all the sites but far enough from the main streets to be quiet. But I think I would forego the breakfast included plan.",4,2011,09,13
236,"Perfect location, very nice hotel.","The reception was very helpful. Connor (the doorman/concierge) escorted us to the lounge since our room was not ready (we arrived early inthe morning after a flight from the US). The room was very comfortable. Great bed! The location, a few blocks from Trinity College and the Visitor information center, was perfect.",4,2011,09,13
236,"Nice location, but there is no car parking.","Nice clean hotel, maybe needs some updates. Excellent location, walking distance to anything in the city. Exceptional service. Hotel's staff will go an extra mile to help you out.",5,2011,09,13
236,Great hotel in a tremendous location,"Stayed here the last night of an incredible week in Ireland.  Although we were tired having just driven in from Galway after a day trip to the Aran Islands, the location of the hotel inspired us for one last jaunt through Dublin town.

The no name bar/permanent house party was around the corner, the Long Hall pub was around the block, everything you needed for a great final night was within arms reach.

The room was lovely, comfortable, and convenient.  It was a great cherry on top for a tremendous week.  Highly recommended.",5,2011,09,09
236,city centre gem,"I stayed here with my sisters for a couple of nights. Everything about brooks hotel was fantastic, the check in was warm and welcoming, the hotel offer an evening service where a they come and offer towels, pillows, bottles of water and sweets! which we thought was brilliant for a 4 star.  Breakfast was very good, excellent buffet and menu, again the staff are very friendly.  
For a visit to Dublin this is the only hotel that I would recommend, a 2 minute walk  and you right slap bang in the middle of Dublin city centre.
Will be back soon!",5,2011,09,09
236,Great personal hotel in excellent location,"We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend and although not the cheapest rooms in Dublin, it is clean, modern, has really friendly staff and is in a great location.

The rooms are a good size and well equipped. Not everything worked in the room though and whilst some things would be fixed at lightening speed others were known to have been out of order for a while. However these were not the most critical factors. There was a pillow menu, plenty of storage and a turn-down service too which were also really nice touches.

The service in the hotel is second to none. Connor the head concierge learns (and remembers) everyone's names and the staff are all friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned and the turndown service happened at times to fit around our schedule without us needing to ask, even if we spent time in the room during the day.

The breakfast was also fantastic for a smaller city hotel with fresh fruit, yogurt, local cheeses, pastries etc. Even the coffee was really nice (often a let down in hotels).

The hotel was centrally located with easy access to Grafton St, Trinity College and Temple Bar and all in all is a great place to stay in Dublin.",5,2011,09,06
236,First class stay,Three days in the Brooks hotel proved to be a wonderful stay. Excellent accomodation and service and the personal touch was second to none. A special thanks to Connor in the lobby.,5,2011,08,25
236,The best Customer Service I've had in quite a while!,"I stayed at the Brooks Hotel about a month ago.  I was amazed at the attention to detail and the efforts to go above and beyond to make my stay most enjoyable.  I travel nearly every week and I have my favorite ""hotel chain""....I opted to go for what I thought might be ""the road less traveled"" and selected the Brooks Hotel....and I am very glad that I did!  My room was clean and the bed was comfortable....the staff was friendly and the food was great...and it is conveninetly located next to the pub district!  If you get the chance to visit Dublin, THIS is the place to stay....you will surely meet up with Connor (the concierge) and you will immediately begin to know why I will visit Dublin and the Brooks Hotel again one day!",5,2011,08,25
236,The perfect base to explore Dublin,"I don't often have an excuse to stay in the centre of Dublin but whenever I do I choose Brooks. It is warm, cozy, welcoming and has nothing of the impersonal feel of larger city hotels. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful, the breakfast buffet is excellent and the bar is a peaceful oasis in the heart of the city with good wifi for the business traveller. Deluxe rooms are cozy, beautifully decorated and quiet. Opt for the recently refurbished rooms on the 5th floor whenever available. They are the nicest.",5,2011,08,24
236,Great Location; However...,"The Brooks Hotel is ideally located for seeing sights and getting around Dublin; however, with such a location comes street noise and rowdy people. My husband and I stayed at the Brooks for the last few nights of our honeymoon, and found our room comfortable and clean, but noisy from the street. It was not very romantic or charming. The staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were very ordinary. If you are looking for a great location with friendly staff, Brooks is a good choice and worth the price; however, if you seek romance and charm with delightful meals, best to stay elsewhere.",4,2011,08,21
236,Fantastic hotel and brilliant staff,"The rooms are perfect and the staff are helpful,friendly and very cheerful. Could not have asked for better. breakfast  was  very good.Will definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,2011,08,20
236,Good hotel centrally located,"Rooms a bit small and A/C is sometimes working, but overall a good place to stay",4,2011,08,12
236,Nothing to criticise but lacking that special something,"When Mrs Bear and I travel we look for something really special that makes the trip or stay memorable. If you want a hotel that is completely satisfactory in every respect then you will be very happy with Brooks. It is clean, comfortable, well furnished and ideally located for a stay in Dublin. But we probably won't go back there because it just wasn't memorable. If you like the safe choice then choose the Brooks and we think you will be perfectly happy.",4,2011,08,12
236,Perfect.,"We are experienced travelers, having gone to many countries over the years, but we have never felt compelled to post a review before.  The Brooks Hotel was perfect.  It is ideally located in Dublin, close to attractions and transportation, and is the friendliest, cleanest, most comfortable hotel we have used.   Our good experience began when we wrote to ask for advice about transportation from the airport;  we heard back within four hours, with detailed description of the options and directions.   The staff was welcoming and helpful, especially the people at the reception desk and the concierge.  The summer special, which we bought on their website in advance, included a superb breakfast in the room rate, with any food we could imagine for breakfast.  The wait staff accommodated my dairy allergy without a blink,  providing Irish porridge without the cream.  There is a pillow menu in the room, which was fun - we experimented and found our favorite pillows for the night.  The place is immaculate and well kept.  WiFi didn't reach into our room, but it was easily available in the lobby.  There is a reception area in the basement, with comfortable sofas,   two computers for guests, and interesting  books to peruse.  We stayed for three nights, but felt it was almost a home away from home.",5,2011,08,11
236,"Wonderful last night in Dublin, thanks to the Brooks.","This is a fantastic hotel, wonderful location and staff that really go above and beyond.  We arrived back in Dublin after a week of driving around the country (three females), with no reservations for a hotel, and the  Brooks was the only one that could accommodate us.  We checked in and got a recommendation for a restaurant from the front desk.  The restaurant didn't work out (won't go into that here, too long), but we arrived back at the Brooks tired and hungry.  The staff kept the kitchen open and prepared an amazing meal for me and my traveling companions, along with other Brooks guests who got the same treatment at the same restaurant.

The ""feel"" of the Brooks Hotel is calm and comforting.  I highly recommend it.",5,2011,08,09

236,Loved it,"We stayed 2 nights in the Brooks Hotel in late May.

We loved the location - so central, yet quiet. It's very close to Grafton street, from which you get to St Stephen's Green and to Trinity College very easily. It's also within walking distance to Dublin Castle and Temple Bar, and tons of bars and restaurants.
We loved the room - good size, clean and comfortable. The decor was nice, too.

And we really appreciated the staff - everyone was so welcoming and nice, from the lady at the front desk, to Conner and everyone else! It really made a difference. Turn down service with the chocolates was also very nice :-)

We highly recommend Brooks Hotel for anyone looking for a fair priced, boutique hotel in a very central location in Dublin.",5,2011,08,03
236,Beautifully appointed and great service,"This is a lovely hotel, close to Temple Bar, the Liffey, and many other attractions in Dublin.  We used it as a base for the theatre--the Abbey and the Gate are both within easy walking distance, as are wonderful restaurants.

Each room seems slightly different.  We shared a double and had another guest in an adjacent room.  Both rooms were large enough, beautiful bedding that complemented interesting wall paper and decor.  The hotel doesn't feel corporate, even though it's recommended by and for business travelers.  It's unique and arty enough to feel more like a boutique hotel, and it's certainly not a large chain.

We stored our bags for a day; front desk and bell staff are lovely, concierge more than willing to help.  The breakfast is extra and a bit steep, but the buffet and hot items are very good (especially the scones).   We had a room facing away from the street, but the whole location seems quiet and elegant.",5,2011,07,29
236,"Nice Place, Friendly Staff","Ok, so it says I was here in August 2010, but the truth is it was July of 2009, but that wasn't an option on the dropdown, haha!

Anyway, my wife and I stayed here for our Anniversary in 2009 and we thought that this hotel was a great place to rest our weary heads at the end of a long day.  Much like many of the hotels we stay in, the location was great and made the city seem much smaller than it really was.  

This hotel is in the middle of town, and step away from many of the fine shopping and nightlife areas of the town.  Temple Bar is a few blocks away and very walkable.  Most major attractions at in walking distance, but we would suggest taking the hop-on hop-off double decker bus tour.  You can purchase tickets for a couple of days and use themt o get around to where you want to go.

The staff here was AMAZING.  Coming from California we had an interesting schedule, and most times when ou fly overseas you get in during the morning hours in Europe.  We left at about 4:00am California time, went to Chicago, flew to Ireland, and landed somewhere around 8-9 in the morning.  We took a shuttle bus into town, didn't know where we were going, but found many helpful Irish citizens who were more than willing to assist.

Once we got tot he hotel it was obviously too early to check in.  We didn't know what to do, we were tired and had traveled virtually for over 24 hours.  The concierge offered to let us use a private room in the basement, kind of like a cocktail/entertaining room for guests.  We changed out shoes and clothes, freshened up in the restroom and allowed them to check our luggage until we could get to our room that afternoon.

he concierge was the person who told us about the bus tour thing.  He said it would be a great way for us to check out the city, figure out where we were, and kill enough time before we could get to our room.  This advice was nout sought out, but was frelly offered to us as a kind gesture on his behalf.  This was going to be the norm in Ireland for the duration of our trip.

The hotel had a nice little resteraun inside that served a great breakfast.  You could get normal breads, jellies, and things like that.  Pancakes, waffles, and other breakfast items were also available.  They also had a traditional Irish breakfast, which I suggest you try once during your stay.  The food was of good quality and the price was perfect.

The room was comfortable and spacious.  We didn't feel cramped at all, and the amenities were very nice.  The one problem I experienced was that coming from America we like to use the A/C a lot!  However, the A/C in this hotel was not designed to be used like that.  In the middle of the night it shut off because it was overworked and it got a little stuffy in the room.  However, we opened the window to cool off.  Unfortunately, the noise outside was too much since we were backed up to an ally.  So, we closed the window, adjusted the air so it was a little more reasonable, and it was fine for the rest of the trip.

The hotel also offers guests a small computer room where you can check your email, make dinner resevrations, check-in for your flights, and anything else you might need to do.  All at no expense to the guest.

We felt this hotel was a great value and would love to stay there again!",4,2011,07,29
236,"Solid service, great location, but needs better Wifi system","I stayed here on 2 different occasions. As it has been commented many times before, great breakfast, always very helpful staff, clean rooms and bathrooms. I had to make a last minute change to our booking and was not charged cancellation, and for this reason we went back again. The bar is open later for guests so that is another plus. All in all a solid hotel in a fantastic location in central Dublin, walkable everywhere.  But I did have an issue with the WIFI in our room.  On both stays the signal was too weak (the 2nd stay we had no signal). Even the wifi signal in the residents' lounge is way too weak to be practical (besides, some of us need to work with some privacy in our own rooms).  It's 2011... please invest in some routers.",4,2011,07,29
236,A gem of a hotel right in the center of the city,"From the moment we checked into Brooks, we had an unbelievable experience-and for such an affordable price. The hotel is about a 30 Euro ride from the Dublin airport, and is located a stone's throw from St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. The hotel was beautiful, clean, and felt quite cozy and intimate for being located in a big city. Check-in was a breeze, and the check-in desk was kind and helpful in all of their recommendations.  The room itself far surpassed every European room I have stayed in. It was spacious, clean, and had the most comfortable hotel bed I have EVER slept in. Additionally, there is a choice of 5 different pillows that room service will deliver, one better than the next. The bathroom was clean, modern, and large. On a superficial note, the TV had really great channels with a variety of shows, which is welcoming after a long day of site seeing-in most European countries, all you get is Sky News which gets boring quick. The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions, and is a block from really great pubs, restaurants, and bus stops that will take you to out of the way locations (Dublin Zoo, Guinness Factory, etc.). I highly recommend the Brooks for your next trip to Dublin-it's well worth the money, and is quite cheaper than all of the other 4 and 5 star hotels in Dublin.",5,2011,07,28
236,a jewel in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I just got back from a 6 night stay at the lovely Brooks Hotel, a boutique hotel centrally located just blocks away from the Temple Bar area, Trinity Collage, Stephens green, Dublin Castle and many other major attractions. While the hotel is clean comfortable and has character, what makes the Brooks a Jewel is the employees, From the front desk staff to the wait staff right through the cleaning staff and of course the wonderful Conner and his  companions who are the concierge staff, all are spectacular with their service and warmth no matter what the request. In fact without exception every local we had the pleasure to meet was friendly, informative (always a history lesson), and truly expressed both their love for Ireland, Dublin and their pleasure in meeting us.

The food was amazing, one day we had the pleasure of enjoying the cooking of Kevin Thornton who runs his own Michelin stared restaurant, and the next  day we enjoyed pub fare that was in its own way just as spectacular. Our only complaint was that our stay was to short, when we return we will stay again at the Brooks and hope that the staff remains the same (It is like being welcomes home).

Cannot say as to the value for the price of the room as we booked it as a package from Air Canada Vacations , and were thrilled with the Hotel. The Pillow menu and the turn down service complete with chocolates was a nice touch.",5,2011,07,28
236,Good service and location,"Service:  everyone we met was polite, helpful and friendly from the front desk agent who gave us directions by phone when we lost our way from nearby Trinity College, to the waiting staff who brought us information about the city as we ate dinner on the evening that we arrived.  Those who worked during breakfast service were also efficient and friendly.

Location:  convenient for many of Dublin's attractions and for the Gaiety theatre.  For the two hop on, hop off bus tours that operate in Dublin, Brooks is conveniently placed for two stops.

Room: our deluxe room (part of a package) was clean, spacious and well-equipped and we were not disturbed by late-night revellers as we thought might be the case (the seagulls were another matter!).  The retro-style radio added to the ambience as did the dressmaker's dummy.

Breakfast: our package entitled us to have breakfast in our rooms on two mornings but we found that this did not work successfully, as we had chosen to have full breakfasts and the cooked Irish breakfasts did not retain their heat as we enjoyed cereals and fruit before them.  It would be an improvement if jams and marmalades were also available with room service breakfast.  In the restaurant, a wide choice of cereals, fruits, cold meats, cheeses and breads are available along with several cooked breakfast options.  Porridge with a dash of whiskey was particularly enjoyable.

Evening meals: as part of packages, we had two evening meals.  Evidently, most guests choose to eat elsewhere in the evenings and in our opinion the restaurant lacks somewhat in atmosphere.  We had looked forward to a 'romantic meal by candlelight' but one small nightlight style candle burning on a table in an otherwise brightly lit open-plan room is not really what we had in mind.  Both our meals were acceptable: no more or less than that.",4,2011,07,25
236,"very nice, would definitely go back","The staff was very friendly, the location was great, the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft and crisp. Very clean, and there was a hot pot and instant coffee and tea in the room. It 's on a fairly quiet street.",5,2011,07,25
236,Great hotel!,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for two nights in July, 2011.  We had two rooms for the four of us.  The rooms were comfortable and clean, the staff friendly and helpful.  Great location!!  Would recommend.",4,2011,07,23
236,Quiet comfortable and great location,"I picked Brooks Hotel for my first trip to Dublin based on TripAdvisor reviews and once again TripAdvisor didn't let me down. This is a truly wonderful little hotel just a few blocks from Temple Bar and the shopping streets. It's an easy walk to almost anything that you might be interested in seeing in Dublin. The staff were friendly and super-helpful, to the point of pampering almost. There's a elegant little ""resident's sitting room"" with the latest papers and PCs for Internet access, and that turns out to be a quiet and soothing place to catch a nap if you arrive in Dublin on a red-eye and your room isn't ready (as I did). The bar was great for sitting and relaxing and checking email after a long day of touring and walking around. Highly recommended.",5,2011,07,21
236,A wonderful hotel!!!!!,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel last week. What a warm welcome we received after arrived from the US so early in the morning. Marvin greeted us in the lobby and offered suggestions on where to eat and what to do on our first day. Our room was lovely, comfortable, and quiet even though it faced the street. Breakfast was delicious with many choices including very healthy options. The front desk staff offered excellent restaurant suggestions and graciously assisted us with a train ticket issue. If we return to Dublin, we will definitely stay at the Brooks Hotel. It was a great beginning to a wonderful trip.",5,2011,07,21
236,Perfect from start to finish,"What a fabulous hotel. From the minute we arrived we were greeted very warmly by Connor the concierge. His amazing memory meant that he remembered our names every time he saw us (a trick I could do with learning!!) The hotel itself is divine, absolutely spotless. There is a delightful lounge in the basement which is very restful fully equipped with two PCs for resident usage. The rooms are lovely as well, having the biggest bed I have ever seen and a pillow menu. Turn down service and rooms cleaned daily. All the staff were very polite at all times and nothing was too much bother. Our room overlooked the car park across the road but it was so quiet and we were only in the room to sleep, spending most of our time out and about. This hotel is in a perfect position for just about everything within walking distance. There are some amazing bars and cafes as well as fine dining places very close to hand. We didnt eat in the hotel at all as we had plans for other places but a 'must visit' is Honest to Goodness' a cafe that saves absolutely first class food. This can be found a minutes walk in the arcade near to the hotel - treat yourself to the croque monsieur for a measly $6.95 - bargain food but not bargain quality.
If we ever go back to Dublin then this hotel will be first on our list. Do yourselves a favour - book it and enjoy :)",5,2011,07,20
236,Great Choice,"Spent three nights at the lovely Brooks Hotel...staff always ready to assist...breakfast had a huge selection of choices...extras such as choice of 5 different kinds of pillows...perfect location in center of town, but yet on a quiet side street...couldn't have been more pleased.",5,2011,07,20
236,The jewel in Dublin's crown....,"I had read the reviews before booking a weekend awaqy for my wife's 40th Birthday, and thought that surely it couldn't be that good - well I'm pleased to say it was!!!

The Brooks experience started a couple of months before our trip with a call to reservations where the welcoming voice of Anne helped me with my initial questions and subsequently my booking - this continued with my many questions over the period between booking and staying at the hotel - an excellent experience.

Where do I start about the hotel?

The reception is a welcoming area both in decor and greeting / check in experience - nothing is too much trouble.  There is nothing Connor the concierge doesn't know, which helped us throughout the weekend.  The lounge and bar area is comfortable and stylish, we were greeted with a couple of glasses of Prosecco and some home made cupcakes as we had booked the birthday package - this made us feel at ease straight away.

The hotel is perfectly positionned to make the moost of everything Dublin has to offer - Temple Bar (10 mins walk); St Stephen's Green (5 mins walk); Grafton Street (1 minutes walk) - but down a pleasant side street so that you don't get the noise...

I had pre-booked one of the studio suites as it was a special occassion, but were upgraded to the Presidential Suite (Room 511) which was superb (see the photos attached).  The room was very spacious with a big bathroom, a massive bed, and a separate lounge with contemporary furniture.  The Roberts radio in the bedroom is a nice touch.  My wife particularly enjoyed the walk in wardrobe / drfessing room.

On our first night we returned to the hotel quite early (around 9.30) after eating locally at Chathams Brasserie, somewhere I would highly recommend.  We sat at the bar to have a nightcap and ended up staying there for a couple of hours after sampling one of Pawel's Mojitos (he went to the hotel garden to get the fresh mint to make them) - SUPERB!!!

At breakfast there was a good choice for all tastes, from cereal to a full Irish breakfast (I had the latter on both mornings) - again the service was fantastic.

We ate in the restaurant on our second night as we had booked the birthday package which entitled us to the 3 course Table d' Hote menu.  Tom Reiley looked after us and made sure all was right with our order etc, with the restaurant staff being just as curteous - the food was excellent!!!

All in all our stay was made all the better for the staff and the surroundings - I would definatey recommend Brooks to anyone who was looking for a quality hotel in the centre of Dublin...

Thanks to all at the hotel for making my wife's birthday such a memorable one.",5,2011,07,19
236,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"Smack bang in the centre of Dublin; yet on a quiet street. The receptionist (Lisa) was incredibly helpful. Excellent room; nicely decorated and a change from the soulless fare of the larger chain hotels. Nice bar with good range of drinks. You don't need to go anywhere else.

We had the breakfast one morning which was really good; a great choice and cooked to order. Why can't all hotels be like this?",5,2011,07,17
236,NIce hotel in wonderful location,We recently stayed two nights at the Brooks Hotel and had a wonderful time.  It is conveniently located and an easy walk to almost all of the tourist destinations.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and the rooms were spacious and clean. The only drawbacks were that Wi-fi was available in the lobby but not in the rooms and that our room was over an alley which caused alot of noise in our room during the night and early morning hours.,4,2011,07,14
236,"Fabulous hotel, food and great location",Stayed here for 1 night for business. Was a wonderful find and hope I have the opportunity to stay again. Staff incredibly professional yet friendly so you felt welcome - especially valued as a lone traveller. Lots of home made and locally source food. Free internet added bonus.,5,2011,07,14
236,Great Location,We were looking for a central located hotel out of Temple Bar area but with in walking distances of most Dublin attractions and Brooks fit that need perfectly.  Room was spacious by European standards and vert clean and updated.  Breakfast was great and staff was extremely helpful.  I would consider this a a great option for staying in Dublin. The only reason this is not a five is that it seem a little pricy.,4,2011,07,12
236,Wow! What a gem and they are so accommodating!,"This is a beautiful little gem nestled amid the St. Stephen's Green area of historic buildings as well as commercial establishments.  The staff was welcoming and accommodated our need to have a packed breakfast to take on our way to the airport.  The breakfast at the hotel was fabulous with so many choices of cold items along with our choice of a cooked breakfast.  All was well served.

My husband experienced cold water on rising the first morning.  However, a call to the desk was welcomed and the problem cured in 15 minutes.  We resumed our showers.  Later the concierge delivered a lovely apology letter from the manager.

The room was outstanding.  Lovely roof top views as well as comfortable bedding and amenities.",5,2011,07,11
236,Lovely boutique hotel,"Brooks Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel on a quiet street but right around the corner from Stephen's Green and all the life of Dublin.  The beds were our best in Ireland, with perfect pillows and nice linens.  The lobby is quiet and has a nice cafe.",5,2011,07,09
236,Dissonance of the Celtic Tiger,"Don't get me wrong - its a nice hotel - but there are a few things that don't make sense.  Scenic views of a multistorey carpark from all front facing rooms is one.  The hotel is part of Small Leading Hotels - and it used to ooze charm 30 years ago I susupect - but now its been 'done up' - so its just a nice four star hotel - down a slightly dodgy road betwen Temple Court and St Stephen's green.  Food was OK (although the Irish breakfast was no better than you would get ina  B&B).  Room was fine, but things like the bathroom had not been repainted or grouted in 10 years - fading at the edge. The serving staff were Irish (bizarre in a world where staff are normally Polish) - suggesting that the Hotel does actually have some traditional values, not always employing minimum wage staff.",3,2011,07,07
236,No need to look elswhere!! just book the Brooks!!!!!!,"My wife and I just came back from an 8 night stay at the Brooks and we couldn't be happier! the hotel, the staff, it's location!!!! the Breakfast, words can not describe how incredible The Brooks Hotel is....from the day we arrived until we left, the staff was great, Lisa, Anne, Sean, Harriett and the rest of the front desk crew were awesome, Christine took great care of us at breakfast in the morning....the room was a deluxe with breakfast included this is a must, try the porridge, they add a shot of wiskey with real Irish cream(recommended). The room was spacious, the bed was incredibly comfortable and they have a pillow menu! so you can choose what your preference is.

Firstly the LOCATION, right where you want to be, it is on a small tucked away side street so it is quiet, but still in the best location in Dublin, you can walk to Grafton Street (high end shopping) the Gaiety theatre (Saw Riverdance-on until August 28th-plan one night to go and see it awesome!) you can walk to Temple Bar (a must see) great pubs and shops and will give you a nice feel of Dublin old and new. Henry Street (Shopping, much more reasonable) there is nowhere you can not walk to from the Brooks.

A few travel tips when in Dublin, if you have not driven on the other side of the road, DO NOT rent a car-there is no need if you stay at the Brooks, there are so many day tours and trips that go all over the country...ask at one of the three tourist offices around the corner.

Shopping if you are a resident outside the EU, make sure to ask at the tourist office BEFORE you start shopping about the VAT Euro-Refund Ireland has in place, the VAT is very high and if you do shop you can get it back at the airport, you can get a red plastic card and all you have to do is show it and have the retailer swipe it-if they are part of the refund program, not all are, but be sure to ask....this will make it easier when you leave Ireland, all you have to do is present the card at the VAT euro-refund office at terminal 2 in the Dublin airport and they will issue you a credit to any of the major credit cards.

Just down the street from the Brooks is the St. Georges Market, right at the main entrance off Drury Street there is a little stand called Looly & Cook, they have great cupcakes-you must try one! and each day have a fresh menu of great soups and meals, very inexpensive and terrific, Dublin can be expensive and so are some of the more causal resturants...two we loved were the Crown Jewel Indian resturant and Gotham Resturant-great pizza and not expensive.

To see Dublin, make sure to hop on the hop-on-hop-off Sightseeing Bus of Dublin-it is the red bus in front of Trinity College-ask for Willie, it is the best way to see Dublin, it is 16 Euros each and is good for two days back to back, make sure to stop and tour K-jail and any of the other 23 stops and sights throughout the city.

Remember you can not do everything, so take a breath, go to the tourist office(s) and plan you trip as you like, one bit of advise-go see the Cliffs of Moher!! and do not book long day trips back to back as you will exhaust yourself.

My wife and I went to Belfast, you will hear different opinions about going, do yourself a favor and go, this history is incredible and will give you a good prespective on Ireland's history.

I know this is long, I hope it helps and again if going stay at the Brooks Hotel, really it is the only place to stay when in Dublin....enjoy Ireland the people and the country are amazing!!!! the Hotel has a lounge in the basement for guests, my wife and I loved it and went every night to relax, browse the books in the library and surf the internet etc...it is a great place to unwind. Also when we did go on day trips the hotel packed a breakfast for us on the days we left early...they are simply amazing, do yourself a favor and take away the worry of where to stay and what is the hotel really like....book the Brooks and leave the rest to them and enjoy Ireland...",5,2011,07,03
236,Like Being At Home,"The only thing wrong with our stay at the Brooks was that it wasn't nearly long enough. From the moment we walked in the door, frazzled after a long day of travel and sightseeing, we were taken excellent care of. The hotel is small and of a certain age and the comfort level was extraordinary. No question was too trivial for them to answer or resolve with the utmost speed and efficiency. They took care of our laundry, provided delicious food (breakfast) and a comfortable lounge for the obligatory nightcap (if you like whisky, the Brooks as 121 whiskies from around the world on its bar menu). The location is within walking distance of much of central Dublin, with all the shops and pubs and fine restaurants you could want. We'll definitely be back.",4,2011,06,29
236,Great location...great staff,"Brooks Hotel is on a quiet side street in central Dublin.  The hotel is very convenient to many of the key Dublin sites...Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and the National Gallery.  The staff is very professional and accomodating - they go out of their way to make sure that your stay is pleasant.  The room was a decent size and very clean.  The only strange part was that the doors were locked at night with a sign posted that only guests are allowed.  When I returned from the pubs at midnight on a Friday, they opened the door for me and after a brief confirmation that I was a guest, I was able to go to my room without a problem.",5,2011,06,26
236,Over rated and over priced,"We were really disappointed with this hotel.

We arrived early, at around 2pm and, understandably, were told our room wouldn't be ready for 30 mins.  We returned 90 mins later and were kept waiting for a further 30 mins.

To be fair, the room was lovely but there is little or no soundproofing and so noise from nearby pubs and clubs goes into the early hours.  A vey noisy air con system doesn't help either.

Service at both the bar and restaurant at breakfast was unattentive.  

All in all, a disappointment.",2,2011,06,26
236,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at The Brooks Hotel in June 2011.  The service from the staff was excellent - they helped me with such silly minor things like Irish cell phone problems, and were very accomodating.  The hotel itself is very clean and my room was perfect.  The hotel is on a side street but it is in a fabulous location, close to everything.  The full Irish breakfast was great as well.  I would definitely stay at The Brooks again.",5,2011,06,24
236,GOOD HOTEL IN A VERY CONVENIENT POSITION,"I picked this hotel thanks to some good Tripadvisor reviews ... and didn't regret it.
The hotel is not brand new, but it is very well positioned very near Temple Bar ((but  away  ebìnough from the noisy pubs to be able to get a good night sleel), the rooms are big and comfortable, the staff is professional and friendly.
I really enjoyed my stay there and will definitely book it again the next time I go to Dublin.",4,2011,06,23
236,Great location for Temple bar but away from the madness,"Lovely room, nice shower, great breakfast with a large variety ordered from menu.  Staff very pleasant.  Location fab 5 minute walk to temple bar and 2 minute walk to Stephens green.  
The only down side to this hotel is car park, there is a car park directly across from hotel and they provide a rate of €6 per day from 5.30pm to 12pm the next day.  We arrived at 3pm and departed at 4pm the next day and it cost us €26.00, so for an extra 6 or so hours its very expensive.",4,2011,06,23
236,Great Hotel and Great Staff,We stayed two nights at Brooks Hotel. The accommodation was excellent and the warm greeting on arrival and each day from Connor made us feel at Home. Dinner in the Dining room was excellent with wonderful service from James. We fully recommend this hotel to any visitors to Dublin.  Anne and Peter - Australia,5,2011,06,22
236,"Great location, service and cozy rooms!","Walk down the quiet Drury Street to all of Dublin's sites! Easy access to shopping and pubs, of course. The hotel lobby welcomes you at the end of a busy walking day with a comfortable  place to relax and have a cocktail. The lovely decorated and comfortable library on the bottom floor is a great spot to read the paper or play a quick game of chess too. Great staff, and good breakfast (a little pricey). Our three night stay was too short!

PS When we arrived, hotel offered a 5 euro discount on breakfast which worked for us!",5,2011,06,21
236,"A quiet haven in Dublin, walking distance to everything you need","I stayed 5 days in June of 2011, and found the hotel ideal. A quiet, comfortable room, and an efficient and friendly staff (what's with the supermodel chambermaids on the 5th floor? All of them beautiful.)
I walked everywhere from the Brooks. It's a quarter mile from Temple Bar area, less than that to the Dublin Tourism center, where you can catch tour buses or arrange train trips all over Ireland. A good bed, nice shower (watch out for micro-bursts of cold, then hot, kind of a thrill). Free Wifi for your mobile device.
The only way I found to get coffee early in Dublin is to go to the Bald Barista nearby on St. Georges, which opens at 6:30. Everything else seems to begin at 9:00 a.m. or so.
I would stay at the Brooks again!",5,2011,06,17
236,"Nice hotel, perfect location","We stayed at the Brooks hotel for two nights.  First, the people at the hotel are wonderful.  They gave us directions to all the places we wanted to go, recommended sites and were overall very friendly.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel.  Shopping, Restaurants & shops are literally outside the front door.  The hotel is within walking distance to Dublin Castle, Trinity College and a number of other attractions.  The only negative is how expensive the municipal parking is across the street -- but I think anywhere you stay in Dublin will have expensive parking.  If you want to be able to walk everywhere in Dublin, this is the place for you!",5,2011,06,14
236,"Great location, but not a hotel for food lovers.","We stayed on a Sun/Mon night and booked an offer that included a 3 course meal and room upgrade. First of all, rooms are great, nice size, great bathroom and well equipped, but Wifi does not work in room. Hotel itself is in a great location, just minutes from everything, attractions, shopping, restaurants etc. As for the meal, I ordered goats cheese for starter, was not informed until the starter arrived that they had ran out of goats cheese and they had replaced it with Mozzarella!! Not a good start, main course was great, but again dessert - creme brulee- custard was lovely but the crunch came from the sugar granules rather than the caramelised sugar topping.  Full irish breakfast was lovely, but my wife asked for soft eggs and got severley overcooked ones. Not trying to find fault for the sake of it as I was really looking forward to this based on other trip advisor reviews ( the main reason I actually booked it) , but for a 4 star hotel rated #11 in Dublin, I have to agree with a previous review in saying I was underwhelmed.  All in all it's a nice hotel, but not one I could genuinely recommend or will return to.",3,2011,06,14
236,Opulent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This truly is an amazing hotel, beautiful & stylish. Check in is easy & very friendly. There is a pillow menu in your room so you can oder the perfect pillow! There is also a turn down service complete with chocolates. The hotel has a smart dress code which I found delightful. 

There is a public car park directly across the road from the hotel & there is a special rate available, remember to ask at reception. We also had dinner in their restaurant & it was devine. Fresh produce whiped into amazing creations. The waiter in the restaurant was brilliant, very helpful & attentive.  Breakfast was a feast of fresh fruit, breads, cheeses & meats. You can also order a hot breakfast from the kitchen whith options including porridge & crepes. 

Brooks hotel is a real gem of a hotel, upper class without being pretentious in any way.",5,2011,06,14
236,"Charming, exellent location, service and value","We stayed at the Brooks hotel, Dublin for two nights. The hotel is located in the heart of this lovely city, yet in a very quiet street. The Grafton is only 2 minutes walk, and the lovely Chatham Street, with several very nice shops, is on the way there, as other streets to the pubs near the visitor center , such as The fabulous O'Neal's. The Trinity College is 5 minutes walk only, and The enchanting Temple Bar area, 10 min. walk. The hotel is a charming and very cute one. Rooms are quite spacious and pleasant, the Irish breakfast generous, and the service superb – you may have all the information needed, they will help you with everything you need (Taxi, room services), and they do it with great smile and willingness. Stay there while in Dublin.",5,2011,06,13
236,Great location - Lovely Hotel!,"The Brooks Hotel was the perfect location for exploring Central Dublin on foot. We walked everywhere! 
The hotel is very nice....With helpful front desk staff and a lovely lounge on the lower level with free computers to use. We had free breakfast included in our rate and found it delicious, with lots of variety.
The bedroom was large enough and the bed was very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this hotel!",5,2011,06,13
236,"Overrated, in my humble opinion","We were on vacation throughout Ireland for 10 days.  Our last two days were spent in Dublin and we were most excited about our stay at the Brooks Hotel.  Not only was our two-night stay the most expensive hotel of our trip, but it was also the highest star rating (4*).

PROS:  Great location with close proximity to all attractions.  Dublin is a small city, so everything is within walking distance.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.

CONS:  It's located in a busy area and if you are not on a high floor, you will hear a lot of noise from the streets.  It is also located on a small ""alley-like"" street, which is a little sketchy late at night.  Some of the rooms are not renovated and that's the biggest complaint of the trip (see below)

When we arrived, we were placed in a first floor room.  Seeing pictures from their website and tripadvisor, we expected at least modern (but quirky) designed rooms with similar decor.  What we found was something you would find in a 1-2 star Motel 6.  The walls and carpet had really old wallpaper and carpet.  The mismatched curtains and bedding were bold and multicolored and the TV on the table was old and boxy.  I understand the appeal of this style, because it looked a little retro and had some character to it.  However, we paid a TON of money for our stay and with it being advertised as 4 star we expected a little more ""posh"" to the space.  Another negative was that it was right above the street and was so loud.  Luckily, my dear husband asked the front desk to be moved to a higher room because we were very light sleepers.  The wonderful woman at the front desk moved us to the fourth floor and it was literally night and day.  I wish I took pictures.  Our new room had new carpets, a flat screen tv, solid bold colored curtains and bedding and a beautiful bathroom.  It was like we were in a different hotel!  THIS was what I expected the rooms to be like.  It was still the same size (in fact the same location, just 3 floors up).  
We heard a lot of noise at night, but it was a little better being farther up. 

If you choose to stay at Brooks, make sure you specify a higher floor.  I think that the lower floors have not been renovated yet.  However, if you want a little more modern comfort I recommend looking elsewhere.  It's not a bad hotel and the staff are lovely, but I don't know why it's so highly rated.  Maybe I missed something...",3,2011,06,13
236,Unforgettable experience,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks hotel for 5 nights in May and we could bot have picked a better hotel to stay at in Dublin.  We flew in from the states and arrived early in the morning. The staff was very friendly and our room was ready right away.  Any time we had a question about where to go in Dublin or any other question the staff went above and beyond to find an answer.  We cannot thank them enough for making our trip so wonderful!  Connor was absolutely the best concierge we have ever encountered! He knew our names after introducing ourselves only once and greeted us every morning in the lobby.  The rooms were beautiful and nice size, VERY clean.  The food was great as well and the lounge area downstairs was very cozy.  If you find yourself traveling to Dublin you must stay at this hotel, you will not be disappointed!  The location is great you can walk to most places and the friendliness and hospitality at the hotel was the best we ever experienced, we will definitley return in the future!",5,2011,06,13
236,Simply Wonderful,"This is a great small hotel in the heart of the action.  Occasionally some noise, and the computers in the basement never seemed to work, but everything else was wonderful.  Connor the Concierge is an icon, however the rest of the staff were great as well.",5,2011,06,11
236,Fantastic weekend break,"Our first visit to Dublin, what a fantastic time we had, would definetly return and stay again at the Brooks hotel. We booked the romantic package and it was all it said it would be, the rooms were really big with every amenity you needed. Breakfasts - great selection, real authentic irish food and made to order. Had dinner, compliments to the chef, well presented, plenty not pretentious and delicious.. The staff added to the whole aura of the hotel, very welcoming and helpful, nothing too much of a bother. Location was perfect, 5-10 mins to Temple Bar area, you actually only had to walk round the corner to find great pubs and restaurants too. All in all, thanks again to everyone at the Brooks.",5,2011,06,07
236,Perfect St. Patrick's Day stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 days over the St. Patrick's Day festivities.  It was the perfect place to stay.  We arrived early morning from our overnight flight and our room was not ready.  The hotel has a guest lounge where you can rest and is happy to store your luggage for you.  The concierge Connor is a kind, lovely gentlemen who goes out of his way to insure that you have a pleasant stay.  The hotel is located across the street from a car park (warning - it is pricey) and is within walking distance to all the sights of Dublin.  Breakfast was terrific and the hotel bar was lovely in the evenings.   It was an easy walk to Temple Bar without all the noise.  I highly recommend this hotel.  

Hint:  If you attend the St. Patrick's day parade, get grandstand seats on Westmoreland. This grandstand is very near the hotel and is near the beginning of the parade.  Afterwards, we went to Trinity College and almost had the Book of Kells to ourselves.",5,2011,06,07
236,Very Nice Hotel,"My husband and I just stayed at the Brooks Hotel in May, 2011.  We thought it was very nice and convenient.  The entire staff was very friendly and hospitable.  We would definitely recommend staying at Brooks House.",4,2011,06,06
236,Quite excellent hotel in the centre of town,"I booked this hotel for a five-night stay in Dublin with the girlfriend. 

The first thing to say about the hotel is the location. You're on Grafton Street in five minutes, at Trinity College in another two, or are a fifteen minute stroll from O'Connell Street. And the Aircoach stops just outside Trinity College, so it's nice and easy to get there if you've just landed in Dublin. 

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about where to go in the surrounding area, and how to get a little further afield, happily giving us several travel options for getting to the Aviva Stadium for the football (the less said, the better). 

We'd booked on a room only basis, but this wasn't a problem at all, as there's a plethora of resteraunts serving breakfast within minutes of the hotel - not just on Grafton Street, but on plenty of the side-streets all around.

Yes, the room we were in (312) didn't have a lot of floor space, but was taken up by a HUGE bed. So, can't complain too much. There were a couple of things which brought the room down - the decor is a little dated, there were a couple of chips and cracks in the bathroom, and the view was of the car park across the road (but there was no road noise at night at all).

But, it's very hard to be picky about a well-apointed, 4* hotel in Dublin for 65 Euro a night!

If the Tartan Army return to Dublin, I'll be booking here without a second thought.",5,2011,06,03
236,"Fantastic!""","I spent a week in Dublin, and The Brooks Hotel was my base the entire trip.  One of my best stays anywhere!
-The service was top notch.  Of particular note was the concierge: Connor.  He got to know my tastes in sites, food, and drink; and did a terrific job of recommending places.
-The room as clean, well kept, and the Turn Down Fairy left chocolate!
-Booking was a snap, and any dealing I had with the front desk were professional and courteous.  
(-and if you're a whisky guy like me, the bar has one of the best selections of anywhere I've ever been!)
Good travels!",5,2011,06,01
236,"Perfect location, great hotel","Perfect location for a hotel in Dublin - just over from St Stephen's Green, stones throw from Grafton Street, many tourists spots and close to some good pubs and restaurants too!
Great room, very comfy bed and pillows. Very clean and room service was quick and efficient.",5,2011,05,31
236,"Great location, excellent service but rooms and decor are lacking......","Just returned from a 10 day journey in Ireland.  We began in Dublin, staying at the Brooks Hotel for 3 nights.  The service at the Brooks is top-notch, all staff is incredibly pleasant and helpful.  The concierge Connor is almost worth the stay.  Almost.........However, the rooms themselves are another story.  Incredibly small, and somewhat outdated decor if you ask me. Some people call it old charm, I call it time for some redecorating.  We stayed in Room 404 and it was very tiny!!! Bathroom, very tiny!!! However, the location is great for Dublin, I loved being so close to Grafton Street and a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar (I live in NY, we walk fast :) Close enough to Temple Bar, but minus the noise and mayhem. You honestly cant beat the location, but for the price they are charging for rooms, they should really update the hotel and offer a few more amenities to guests.  I guess you are paying for the location itself.  Would I recommend this hotel? yes, if you are focusing on location and if you get a really good deal online.  Otherwise,  I'd say shoot for another 5 star hotel close to Grafton Street.",3,2011,05,26
236,I'll be back!,"I LOVED my 3 day stay in Dublin, and a large part of that was having a room at the Brooks hotel.  

The concierge who greeted us, Conor, is a great representative - he obviously loves his work, and it shows...very friendly and personable.

The room (206) had a lot of amenities packed into it, including an iron and ironing board, hot pot and tea/coffee, cups, and a small refrigerator.  The bed was VERY comfortable, the linens were a silky cotton blend, very nice.

Perfect location - easy to walk to all the hot spots a tourist wants to see - but the street is very quiet at night.

We had a rental car that the staff advised us to park a few blocks away for a reasonable rate of approx. 12 Euros/day, but there is a parking garage right across from the hotel if you don't mind paying a higher rate.",5,2011,05,26
236,Great Hotel!,"We stayed here for a week vacation in Dublin and enjoyed every minute of it.
The room was spacious, clean, elegantly design with the most professional and courteous staff & service. We especially loved the final touches as jelly sweets on our pillows every night. Also to have a drink in the bar after a long day outside was great and the living room downstairs was so warm and welcoming for relaxation.
Breakfast variety at the hotel was amazing, but the only remark we have is regarding the breakfast-to-go: We took 3 organized trips outside of Dublin and thus had to leave the hotel very early and the breakfast to go was very poor. But that didn't change our overall overview and we would recommend this hotel warmly to our family and friends.",5,2011,05,24
236,So Disappointed,"I've never written a bad review on TA, but I can not, in good conscience, recommend this hotel.  My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights.  This was our last leg of a 10 day trip.  We booked this hotel based on TA reviews (TA award winning in 2010??), and this is the first time I felt I was let down by TA.  Granted, most reviews focused on the great service at the Brooks, and here I tend to agree.  But the best service in the world can only take you so far, it was the actual accomodation that we felt lacking.
Most noteabley, the rooms are tiny.  We stayed in room 600 - this would be uncomfortable for one person, much less two people with luggage.  The bathroom was so small you literally wouldn't have to leave the shower if you forgot something.  We felt like we were crawling all over each other.  We would stay out as late as possible so we could just come in and crash (ie avoiding time in the room).  Yeah, yeah, rooms in Europe are small, I get it.  But we didn't have this problem in London or Edinburgh and for the price we felt ripped off.  
The shower had great water pressure and hot water (a plus!), but the stall was narrow and the shower curtain kept clinging to you.  The ""hairdryer"" is kind of a joke.  It's a box attached to the wall with a vacuum hose coming out of it.  It blows cold air, so not at all effective for styling.  They do not offer complimentary water (disappointing).  
The room was clean, however, and the staff was friendly.  Great location, but I would not stay here if ever in Dublin again.",2,2011,05,21
236,"""Great hotel in the heart of Dublin...loved, loved, loved it.""","My friends and I were in Dublin for business and stayed on a few extra days to sightsee. We moved from the Four Seasons to the Brooks Hotel and enjoyed it more than the Four Seasons. From the minute we walked in the door, the friendly, helpful staff were great. It really felt that everyone at the hotel...from the reception staff to the room staff to the restaurant/bar staff...wanted to make guest feel welcome. 

I would stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2011,05,16
236,Quiet oasis in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed at Brooks for 3 nights recently (2 nights before our tour and one night after).  This was certainly not the most inexpensive hotel in the area, but it was very quiet and quite lovely.  

For our first night we were in a delux double room.   When we returned for our final night we were placed in a larger double room and had cupcakes awaiting our arrival!  Please note that the rooms are smaller than the standard American hotel, but did not feel constained.  The rooms were decorated beautifully as well. We enjoyed the pillow menu (a choice of 5 different pillows for your sleeping pleasure). 

The hotel is centrally located to Temple Bar, shops and restaurants.  We loved that the St. Stephens park is 2 blocks away.  The service was exceptional.  The staff was very helpful and friendly at all times.",5,2011,05,15
236,"Clean, modern and wonderful boutique in the heart of Dublin","The Brooks Hotel is in a great location, about 3 blocks from Grafton St, around the corner from pubs and clubs and restaurants and shops, but on a quiet street away from the crowds. The staff was amazing and knowledgeable with great restaurant and pub recommendations and great service. The restaurant was really good! People were coming in from the city to eat there. The room was modern, spacious, clean and comfortable. There was a separate bath and shower. You can choose your own type of pillow (e.g. hypo-allergenic, goose down, etc) which was a fun luxury.  My only complaint is that noise from the heating system woke us up during the night a couple times, and we couldn't stop it. More pluses - reading lights by the bed, and turndown service with chocolate toffee on your pillow! This is a true gem, and I would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2011,05,10
236,"For boutique hotels, a decent choice.","I was happy to be a the Brooks as it was located in a great part of Dublin. Very near st Stephens green as well as Graften street. Good restaurants nearby as well as shopping.
The people were helpful but not that knowledgeable about where to go and what to do around Dublin. Lots of europeans and businessmen there. Very good breakfast choices as well.",4,2011,05,09
236,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, Friendly Staff!","I stayed here with 3 girlfriends in April and I would definitely recommend this hotel.  I'd say it was an average rating if in the US, but from what I've seen, it seems the hotels in Europe are not quite the same standards as some US 4+ 5 star hotels. The staff is great here... Very helpful and super friendly.  They gave us some ideas about where to go and mapped out a few spots for us.  The room was clean.  The hotel's location is good because it is very close to everything (shopping, Temple Bar area, tour buses etc.)  The street is not so great (side street with a view of parking lot or something) but we were not really looking for a great view out the window, so it didn't matter much.  The room was a good size for the 2 of us (we had 2 rooms, 4 people).  The hotel bar was nice and a good bar to have a pre-dinner drink at.  The hotel seemed very safe and doors were locked at night time.  It was also quiet in the hotel.  NOthing fancy about this hotel, nice lobby, but nothing spectacular but we didn't care much because gone all day long and out all night long!  But I would highly recommend because of the location and friendly staff!!!!!",4,2011,05,06
236,Great location and staff,"We came in from a US flight and our room was waiting for us. After a quick nap the concierge directed us to a local pub. Such super friendly people, clean hotel, and walking distance to great spots. Hope to return.",5,2011,05,04

236,a very good hotel,great value! perfect location and very friendly people at the reception! thank you!,5,2011,04,06
236,Charming Great Location,"I purchased a package through Aer Lingus and this hotel was included in the package.  It was a wonderful stay from the moment we stepped in a bit bleary eyed from having flown all night and Conor O'Connell, the concierge, greeted us with Irish hospitality.  The room was great and we could control the temperature on our own.  The best part is the location.  It is quiet yet within walking distance of all the major attractions.  I would definitely return to this hotel.  The breakfast was fantastic and ours was included with the package.  The coffee was strong, the bread and butter fresh and the greek yogourt was superb.  We loved it and are certain you will too.",5,2011,04,04
236,Great Location,We really enjoyed our stay at the Brooks Hotel. We traveled with my elderly mother and it was a close walk to many major sights and places to eat. The room was clean and modern and the front desk staff gladly helped us with restaurant and transportation.,5,2011,04,02
236,Delightful base for sightseeing Dublin,"The hotel is on a quite street near Grafton St & St Stephen's Green - everywhere in the city centre is within easy walking distance.

Then, at the end of a day foot-slogging all over town, a delight to go into the bar immediately to the right as you come in from the street, collapse into an armchair, and be served with a refreshing Darjeeling and an energy restoring snack.

Evening meal in the hotel restaurant excellent - the sort of meal where the chef frequently checks that the diners enjoyed it.

And the next morning we saw the same chef running the kitchen for the similarly excellent breakfast.

The room was comfortable but nothing special but after a tiring day and a good dinner and a nightcap...

We were staying off season, so the hotel was quiet and the service immediate.

There is cut price parking at a nearby multistorey.",5,2011,03,28
236,Wonderful place to spend your nights in Dublin!,"My friends and I decided that since we were going to be spending St. Patricks Day in Dublin we should stay somewhere close to the action.  There was PLENTY to do right around the Brooks Hotel because of its great location!  Parking was a little difficult, as the parking garage we had to park in was a few blocks away, but it was St. Patricks Day after all and there were people and cars everywhere.  The rooms (and especially the beds) were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were large.  When we were having breakfast, which was fantastic, the head concierge came over to us and introduced himself.  He had seen us check in the previous day yet hadn't had a chance to meet us. I thought it was very nice of him to take the time to visit with me for a while.  The front desk remembers your name and always greets you with a smile on their face.  In fact, the entire staff is extremely friendly.  This is by far one of the nicest places I've stayed while on vacation!",5,2011,03,27
236,BRILLIANT,"Brilliant was this years theme for The St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin , & Brilliant is the only way we can describe our stay at Brooks Hotel, Drury Street. We spent two night's there and from the first e-mail contact till our departure the staff were informative,helpful and extremely kind.  Room 507 was gorgeous and very quiet. The residents lounge was very comfortable, and the breakfast was very good.
                 Any visit to Ireland is great, but St. Patrick,s Day is very special and in our opinion the only place you should want to stay is Brooks hotel.",5,2011,03,20
236,Good value hotel very friendly and superb location.,"Good hotel, very friendly service, excellent breakfast, superb location if you are planning a weekend visit.
Room maybe a little tired, but would use again",4,2011,03,13
236,Close to all the Dublin attractions,I booked this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor.  .My husband and  I were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is centrally located to alot of the Dublin attractions.  The staff is most helpful. We enjoyed the breakfast each morning especiaaly the selection of breads. The room was adequate.,5,2011,03,12
236,"Totally relaxing, warm hotel stay","The Brooks is an amazing, small boutique hotel with an excellent staff . The rooms are small but well appointed and clean. Location is great, the restaurant was very good and there is a warm inviting bar area. The hotel staff is amazing, they respond to all requests rapidly, they ahve suggestions for restaurants that are on the mark and the morning wake-up knock on the room door was so much nicer than the ringing phone. Loved this hotel
Would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2011,03,01
236,"this is a gem of a hotel, perfect location, great service and wonderful food.","I highly recommend the Brooks Hotel.  The rooms were quite nice, excellent bedding and although small, they well equipped with drawers, closets and places to stash your belongings.  Bathroom was spacious and lovely.  Breakfast was fabulous, especially James, our waiter, the cooked to order eggs and yummy scones.  The bar was a great place to unwind.  Location was near perfection as was the service.  To top it all off - the residence lounge with computers and comfy chairs were perfect for four girlfriends to relax at the end of the day.  To top it all off, we got a great off-season deal - paid for only two nights and stayed three!",5,2011,02,27
236,Delightful!,"I was at a business meeting at The Four Seasons and moved to the Brooks after the meeting for a 3 day vacation with friends.  It was a move up.  The staff was warm and made it a point to remember our names, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the breakfast was delicious and the choices numerous.  Location is perfect.  The Brooks has a quiet comfy space downstairs where we enjoyed an after dinner bottle of wine.  Everything at the Brooks was perfect.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2011,02,27
236,Friendly on a great location,It was our 4th stay in this hotel over the past few years and we were again impressed by the friendly staff and the perfect accommodation. This time we also brought our daughter and got a spacious room and a bathroom that was well equipped for three. The hotel is just a block away from the Green and the shopping/dining area and on a 15min walk from Temple Bar. Unfortunately the excellent location is refected in the roomrate but it is worthwhile.,4,2011,02,05
236,Everything you need & more,"I thought this hotel was fantastic. From the minute we walked in we were greeted by the charming staff, and we were very happy when we saw our room- spacious, modern, comfortable and with all amenities including free internet access, very comfy bed, air conditioning, flat screen tv, and a great shower. The location is bang in the centre of town, but we were not disturbed by outside noise at all. My partner and I actually live in Dublin and stayed here with my family when they came to visit. All of us were delighted with this hotel and I will be recommending it to everyone that stays here from now on.",5,2011,02,03
236,Comfortable Luxury in a Prime Location!,"If you are going to Ireland, definitely stay here! The Brooks hotel had a comfortable luxury that is hard to find when traveling overseas. We got a great deal on the price and were happy with everything. The room is very comfortable and the bathroom meets all needs. The breakfast in the morning is delicious and has much variety. 

The staff showed us great hospitality and welcomed us warmly. Some perks of the hotel are is superb location, its fitness center, and the cozy library in the basement. My husband and I walked to all tourists sites and it was an easy taxi to the airport. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin!!",5,2011,02,01
236,Stylish hotel in great location but food overpriced and sub-standard,"I had a two-night stay. We found the reception staff very friendly on arrival. The rooms were stylish and spotless. Our one major gripe would be the food. I don't know whether it was just a bad week but the food for breakfast and particularly dinner was wildly overpriced and sub-standard. We both had fish (hake) and the portions were tiny. And they have the audacity to charge 20 euro for this (per head, with fries extra). Also, at 20 euro, the Irish breakfast (without toast or tea/coffee) is outrageously priced. Rooms are very comfortable though. Just don't eat there.",3,2011,01,14
236,"warm welcome,very comfortable hotel in city centre","I stayed one night for a function in Dublin city centre.  Hotel in great location with parking directly across from front door.  I was very tired and under time pressure on arrival, it was lovely to have warm welcome from very pleasant and helpful Receptionist.  Swift check in.  Room (double) was very clean, well equipped and the bed was very comfortable.  Hotel was quiet and I had undisturbed sleep. Receptionist & Concierge were very helpful and pleasant when  I was leaving.
Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for a leisure or business stay in Dublin, it provides that extra hospitality that can be lacking in some city hotels.",5,2011,01,08
236,Fantastic hotel,"Arrived at 10 AM in the morning. Our room was ready so no waiting required. We stayed for 4 nights (16-20 Dec. 2010). We were on the sixth floor. Room was quiet, and had a pretty nice view over the top of the adjacent parking deck, towards Dublin castle in the distance.
Room was a little small for two people with lots of luggage. This is the way it is in most of Europe and was  not a serious problem for us. 
The hotel is in a great location. There are lots of pubs and restaurants nearby, and many of Dublin's tourist attractions are nearby.
Hotel had a business room that guests could use for free.  I used it every morning to check email and confirm onward flights. 
The hotel staff are extremely courteous, and would bend over backwards to take care of guests needs (we had several).",5,2011,01,07
236,Absolutely brilliant!,"I booked this hotel for three nights with a deal through the hotel themselves, it was for a surprise for my partner and we were not disappointed. We are a young couple in our twenties and found the location perfect. Walking to all the attractions was very easy, and there are some lovely restaurants and bars incredibly close to the hotel, meaning we were easily able to enjoy Dublin's nightlife. The shopping is fantastic and about five minutes away from the hotel.  Our room was very clean with a huge bed and lovely bathroom, even though it was a small room (the classic room), we needed nothing more! We had breakfast included in our deal and this was fantastic also, there is a continental buffet and also cooked breakfast if you wish. We sampled both and were impressed with it all. The Jasmine bar was lovely to come back to for a final quiet drink before heading up to the room, (ours was on the fifth floor) where we heard no noise from the street below during the night. I would absolutely recommend the Brooks Hotel and we look forward to heading back there as soon as we can!",5,2011,01,07
236,Wonderful,Arrived here at 8.30 in morning after travelling overnight from New York.  We were very tired and the receptionist got us coffee while they got a room ready for us.  The room was lovely and the hotel was very peaceful.  The staff could not have been more helpful.  I will definately come back again as once we had recovered we were able to enjoy the Temple Bar area which is very close by!,5,2011,01,07
236,Perfect Location in a great city!,"Brooks Hotel was perfectly situated in the lively city center of Dublin, close to tourist destinations, shopping, and countless dining options with plenty of Irish pubs to choose from! The lounge is lovely, a wonderful place to enjoy a drink. The restaurant was fine, but other more interesting options are a short walk away. Check in and check out was completed with warmth and efficiency. The rooms are smallish, but not uncomfortably so. There was no need for a car as most destinations are within walking distance and public transportation and taxis are easily accessible. I would encourage looking carefully for rates as we found wildly different rates on a variety of booking sites. Overall, I would recommend Brooks Hotel highly.",5,2011,01,02
236,Great hotel,This hotel is in a great hotel in the center of town.  The hotel has lots of charm and is very nice. I really enjoyed it and would stay there again.,5,2011,01,02
236,"Nice hotel, if they are not overbooked!","Elected to stay at Brooks Hotel in Dublin after it received excellent feedback on Tripadvisor.  We were only in Dublin for one night, so wanted a hotel close to town centre - but far enough away from Temple Bar that we could sleep!
On arrival at hotel we found out the hotel had overbooked their rooms and we had no choice but to leave.  To be fair the hotel staff were pleasant and had arranged alternative accommodation for us that they promised was quiet and relaxing.  Unfortunately the alternative hotel backed onto the Temple Bar area.  Unsurprisingly we got very little sleep.
Difficult therefore to recommend this hotel as our experience was poor.  I understand we were not the only group that were moved either, so maybe this is a frequently occurring problem at Brooks Hotel.",2,2011,01,02
236,Great hotel - perfect location!,"The Brooks hotel was absolutely gorgeous - and somehow we had an unbelievable deal for $70 euro a night in April 2009. The location was fabulous, the staff were helpful, and the rooms were comfortable (especially the super deep bathtub - what a welcome surprise!). The breakfast was delicious, but definitely not a bargain- breakfast for 2 one morning was almost as expensive as one nights stay.  Our only issue was that the area was a bit noisy at night.  We didn't realize that we came in on a holiday weekend which meant drunken revelers passing our window at 2am Monday morning...but the location was so central that should be expected.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat!",4,2010,12,25
236,"Best hotel in Dublin for location, service and cleanliness","We arrived  very  early in the morning and were lucky enough that a room was available due to a ""no show"".  The staff was extremely polite and helpful.  Connor is a legend at the Brooks.  He acts as though his name is on the hotel.  You will not find a more helpful person who truly cares and  takes an interest in your visit.  We had a double king room in the newer wing and our son had a standard single room in the original section.  Our room was spacious and the bath was very nice with what appeared to be new fixtures.  Our bathroom door did not close by itself but our son's did (older section).  The rooms are maintained immaculatley.  The WiFi is weaker as you get farther from the lobby, but each room has a wired connection.  There are UK, EU, and US outlets in the rooms but no clock/alarms.  We used our phones.  On our last night we said we would not require a wake-up call but got one anyway.  We did not eat at the Hotel.  We tried to on our first night there (Sunday) but the head waiter would not let us in the restaurant with our bar drinks 10 min. before they opened.  So we decided to not bother him for the rest of the week. There are numerous pubs, restaurants and cafes within a block or two so this was not a problem. The Hotel has a nice bar with a whiskey tasting available, daily newspapers and an exercise/gym with sauna (coed).  The view from the hotel is a large parking garage. The area is very close to shopping and Temple Bar yet does not come with the street noise at night.  Overall, this is a very good place to stay and Hotels.com has prices that the hotel itself could not match!",5,2010,12,11
236,Comfortable boutique hotel in the heart of the city,"We stay in this hotel every time we come to Dublin.  The location cannot be beat.  As has been said before the staff is very friendly.  We always ask for a deluxe room on the back side of the hotel on a higher floor.  This gets you away from any street noise.  The deluxe rooms are also bigger and I believe more updated.  We are very picky about beds and theirs are really comfortable. Free wifi in the rooms works well. For the female travelers, you don't have to use the weak hair dryer on the wall in the bathroom. There is a hand held dryer in one of the drawers in the bedroom. I agree with other reviews that the towels are not plush and there is no view from the rooms but we don't go to Dublin for the views. If you have driven and parked in the independent garage across the street be sure to ask front desk staff for a discount ticket upon leaving. We will definitely return to the Brooks Hotel.",4,2010,11,29
236,Great stay,"Hotel recommended by friend, met our expactions and made our visit to Dublin great. Location makes this a great place to stay - dead center of Dublin.Staff excellant, room was very spacious at back of hotel, no noise. Will return.",4,2010,11,29
236,"Brooks Hotel- Elegant,relaxing and great location but does not come cheap!","Went to stay in this hotel the same night as Ireland were playing the All Blacks. Staff at reception are lovely and very helpful. We were staying in a deluxe double room and it was quite simply beautiful. The pillow menu is a nice touch and makes you feel like your needs are been looked after. We had been doing some sight seeing all day and upon returning to our room we availed of the complimentary foot spa to soothe our aching feet. Room has every thing you could want -DVD player,ample lighting,big TV with good variety of channels and a bath and shower.
The Breakfast is expensive but is fabulous!! Well worth the money!! Wide selection of homemade breads and cereals and the full irish was very nicely presented.

If i was to try and pick out any negitives maybe the gentleman who came to offer the fold down service could of done with a little more English as he was very hard to understand. 
Mini Bar in room is rather expensive and there is no sign of a price list.
Parking is in a multi storey carpark opposite the hotel and was only covered from 5.30pm Saturday to 12noon Sunday, so we had to pay €14.50 from 12noon saturday until 5.30pm saturday as this was the time we were arriving.",4,2010,11,22
236,elegant but needs attention to details,"nicely decorated

beautiful residents'lounge but is not sufficiently ventilated; smells bad at times",4,2010,11,17
236,Great hotel in Great Location,"Trip Advisor reviewers were right-on with this one. A very clean, modern and comfortable hotel. The Concierge makes you feel right at home, even before you enter the front door. The Concierge and staff are very friendly and helpful from the front door to the front desk to the maid service. The rooms are very spacious and very comfortable, with great beds, and a very nice, large bathroom. Service was excellent in all respects. Hotel is in a great location in the city center, with great dining, shopping, sightseeing and tour operators within easy walking distance. We usually choose B&Bs and self-catering lodgings when we travel. But, we decided to pamper ourselves a little on this trip based on the Trip Advisor ratings and the location of this hotel in central Dublin. In retrospect, we made a very, very good decision. This was an excellent hotel experience for us. Brooks Hotel is a little pricey, but not unreasonably so. It is excellent value for the money. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay at the Brooks Hotel.",5,2010,11,13
236,great staff and convenient location,hotel was recommended by family and glad we took their advice...it is walkable to most sights in dublin..has very comfortable rooms and was quite clean...the staff was wonderful....they were able to accomodate us with one of our rooms when we arrived very early which was quite surprising as we've never had that happen after an overnight flight...the breakfast was more than adequate and the wait staff very friendly esp. james from manchester...the downstairs lounge was amazing....would def book this hotel again,4,2010,11,10
236,very nice hotel,"The Brooks hotel became one of my favourite from the first second when I stepped into. Very friendly staff, fast check-in, comfortable rooms and a lot of restaurants / shopping street and some cultural location are just in walking distance.
The food is excellent, the choice for breakfast fantastic. WiFi is complimentary! I am very sensitive regarding the pillow, so I was very excited to see that they offer a pillow menu. You can choose the pillow which is the best for you out of several different ones.",5,2010,11,05
236,another visit,"And yet again another wonderful stay....no complaints with the exception of a headache next day, this was the fault of alcohol being in the beer at the establishments we caroused ...staff couldnt help with that matter :) . Lovely staff and look forward to staying there again.",4,2010,11,02
236,Excellent service and location,"Very enjoyable smaller hotel that is in a very convenient location for walking to restaurants, shopping and tour bus pickup locations.  The rooms were fairly spacious, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and modern.  The staff was extremely helpful and polite.  The hotel bar was a pleasant place to wrap up an evening with an Irish coffee.",5,2010,11,02
236,"Nice rooms,lovely staff,room without a view.......","Stayed at the Brooks hotel for one night.The location is perfect ,right in the center of Dublin.Front desk staff were smiling and helpful.The concierge recommended a very good restaurent for us and staff at breakfast were efficient and helpful.Breakfast was in line with regular 5 stars in Europe.Rooms were tastefully decorated and spotless.The beds were extremely comfortable.Only problem is that we were given 1st floor backside rooms.One room overlooked a group of garbage bins and the other was facing the kitchen of a restaurant.This meant that you had the smells and the noise of the ventilation all night long.Don't even think of opening the window.Also the shower head came off while my daughter was showering and hit her on the head.Not quite what you would expect for 180 euros per night.",3,2010,10,24
236,"Outstanding hotel, great food, caring staff","My wife and I arrived at Brooks Hotel on September 30, 2010.  We were very impressed by the friendliness of the front desk staff and with the beauty of our room.  It was spacious, nicely decorated and complete with many amenities.  On October 2, my wife slipped on a curb outside of a building next door to the hotel.  I was in the hotel lobby when I heard a passer-by tell the front desk staff that she had fallen and was in pain.  The consierge (Connor) left to help, with me following behind.  My wife had broken her ankle, in three places as later determined.  The concierge advised me on my options while we awaited an ambulance.  She was taken to a major Dublin hospital where she had surgery.
That is the background.  So I was alone for two weeks as my wife was in hospital.  The staff maintained my room at a low rate, checked with me morning and night about my wife and my needs.  Quickly, all staff knew who I was and looked out for me.  The  General Manager, Anne McKiernan, would spend time with me at breakfast and dinner so I would not feel alone.  Front desk staff followed my commings and goings and provided me with phone contact to the US at no cost.  I could detail all of the  considerations I received, but it would take too long.  The concierge actually called me in the US to inquire after my wife three days after our return.  In hospital, they sent a get well card signed by all the staff and cupcakes for her and her ward mates. And today I received an inquiry after my wife's condition by the General Manager, now that we were back in the US.
I am so impressed by the warmth and caring of the people at this hotel.  I must also comment that their menu and specials were reasonable,  creative, and tasty thanks to an award winning chef.
I am a dual US/Irish citizen.  I visit my Irish family often.  When in Dublin, there is no place that I will ever stay again except Brooks Hotel.  Great prices for a four star hotel,  excellent location just off Grafton Street, wonderful staff, and great food.  What more could one ask for?
As a college professor, I would grade the Brooks Hotel as an ""A+"".  Their caring and assistance allowed me to keep my stress level low in a difficult situation.  A four star hotel seemed like 6 stars to me due to the wonderful staff and incredible food at a reasonable price.",5,2010,10,20
236,"Very good hotel, with some noise during the night","A  few steps from the city center. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpfull and very service minded. This was our first visit to Dublin and this hotel choice in terms of location was great. For those who have  sleeping problems , I would recommend to ask for a room at the higher floors, or even a room away from the street. During weekend nights Drury street becomes noisy, since there is a pub/night club on a near by street and all the taxis are using Drury street to exit to George street..",3,2010,10,18
236,You get what you pay for!!,We arrived very late in the Evening as Dublins famous nightlife was in full swing Excellent check in very polite and friendly we were also upgraded to an executive room the bed was very comfortable and the room was very spacious 311 and also being at the back of the hotel very quite no view but this is a city centre location and it's really central we never ate at the hotel as Dublin has many many fine restaraunts one gripe was the television in the bathroom didnt work but hey ho we were very happy with the hotel as I say you get what you pay for this hotel is not cheap but if your looking for a quite retreat and want too be central then it ticks all the boxes they also have a pillow menu we didnt try this as our pillows were fine but I suppose if you have allergys then this could be of use also they have a tundown service every night where they put sweets on your pillow each evening all in all nice hotel in a great location,4,2010,10,18
236,Charming find in an excellent location,"Coming from the U.S. on a red eye even in Business First one always arrives exhausted in Europe.  A room was actually available at 10 AM, but I requested a high room after reading TA, so there was a bit of a wait.  Imagine our delight when the concierge, Connor (who also functions as doorman, porter, bellman) came up, introduced himself, escorted us to the cozy Resident's Room (a library replete with antique furniture and spare reading glasses), brought us tea and answered all our questions about Dublin.  There was no charge for the tea, and he made it clear that he would be our friend for the duration of our stay (7 days).  Which he was.  Our room on the 6th floor was quiet and plush, amenities and maid service excellent and attentive to detail, and the hotel location could not be beat in terms of proximity to everything including Tourist Info Center, Trinity Library, tours, and public transportation.  We booked with a consolidator, and did not opt for the breakfast which was rather expensive; but there were many breakfast places in the neighborhood, and we had very nice tea and fridge provided in room so I was completely satisfied.  The one meal we had in the hotel restaurant was excellent, if a bit pricey.  The business center (resident's room) computers were sometimes cranky, and staffed only by the front desk clerks, who could not be contacted by phone (had to walk up one flight).  But they were invariably cheerfully helpful, and other guests also pitched in; a testament to how well cared for we all felt at this charming little boutique hotel.",5,2010,10,08
236,"Classic, old world hotel located in a wonderful city-center neighborhood.","The Brooks Hotel is a lovely hotel on a narrow street in the center of Dublin.  It captures the feeling of 19th-century Dublin with its boutique size, lots of original wood, and the charming furnishings.  Our rooms were standard (but more than adequate) with comfortable beds, a choice of pillows, and a bathroom that was larger than it was small.  

The staff, with the exception of one man behind the desk, was outstanding.  Many of them were very colorful characters interested in striking up a conversation, should you wish.  The breakfasts were excellent with a wide choice of items that would cater to North American or European tastes.",4,2010,10,08
236,5 of 5 stars. Perfect place to stay when in Dublin.,"My Wife and I spent two nights last year and then returned for three nights this year. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone. The location is right in the City Center, the food is excellent, the staff were fantastic....I could go on. We enjoyed our stay on both occassions and would definitely return when back in Ireland, ABSOLUTELY :).",5,2010,10,03
236,Very good hotel in perfect location,"We were only in Dublin for two nights so it was nice to be in close proximity to many great sights.  Our room was very nice, breakfast was wonderful and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  We would stay there again.",5,2010,09,30
236,"Splendid location, great welcome with friendly attentive service at a well managed hotel","From the moment guests arrive at Brooks Hotel there is a warm friendly welcome from all the staff. Helpful service, comfortable rooms with cleanliness a priority made our stay most enjoyable. search out the Residents Lounge in the basement for relaxation or planning trips in the city. 
Brooks Hotel is in an ideal location since it is located between Temple Bar and Grafton Street.
Temple Bar has a lively street scene, especially during the evening. Gallagher's Boxty House is recommended for traditional Irish food.
Grafton Street is for shopping with Brown Thomas, the elegant and stylish store for those with deep pockets and large wallets - well worth a visit.
Trinity College is an essential visit during a stay in Dublin. Escorted tours taken by former undergraduates with a good knowledge of the College, enhanced by entertaining anecdotes is a real treat.
A visit the the Guinness Storehouse, stop number 13 on the Dublin Tour Bus, is on the itinery for most visitors to the city. The self guided tour passes through six floors before arriving at the seventh floor Gravity Bar. Wonderful panoramic views of the city while sipping a ""free"" pint Guinness.
If arriving at the airport it is worth buying the 72 Hour Dublin Pass which can be used on the Airlink regular shuttle bus to the city, Dublin city buses and the Hop on - Hop off Dublin Bus Tours. 
On our final night we enjoyed dinner in the hotel restaurant. Irish lamb, new potatoes and vegetables cooked to perfection - a great way to end a splendid city break in Dublin.",4,2010,09,29
236,"Great location, comfortable rooms, excellent staff","As a travel writer, I have run the gauntlet of hotels, inns and B & B's.  The Brooks Hotel is one of the best!

Yes, it's an older building but it's Dublin, which is an extremely old city.  However, there is nothing to complain about with this hotel located in City Centre.  The location is perfect for getting around the city.

The hotel is near major intersections in relation to facilitating tourism.  It's not far from the Dublin Tourism Office and the street is quiet in the evenings.  The food there is excellent and the staff nothing short of professional, kind and helpful.  Also nearby are several pubs which serve delicious local fare with the fish being gotten directly from the docks of Dublin!

The business center is located in the basement but, honestly, you feel as though you are entering someone's comfy library complete with ottomans and overstuffed armchairs.   Also, I was down there checking in for my flight and needed help from the gentleman on the computer next to me.  Thanks again, Mr. Sinnott, for the assist!  It was my honor and privilege to meet you.

The beds are comfortable to the point of not wanting to get out of it each morning and (surprise) the wake up calls are made by a human rather than a computer.  Imagine waking up to a cheerful ""Good Morning"" and they really mean it?",5,2010,09,28
236,"Helpful, friendly staff and great breakfasts.","We were greeted immediately by a staff member who oriented us to the city with a meet and great in the hotel lobby.  He sat down with us and gave us an overview with a map.  Nice touch.  The rooms were pleasant, the hotel is charming and the food was good.  My only complaint is that there was no plug by the bedside for my CPAP machine, and although I asked for an extension cord, I never got it, necessitating me to sleep at the bottom of the bed to be near electricity.",4,2010,09,25
236,"Very pleasant city hotel close to major Dublin attractions,with very friendly and efficient staff.","We booked a 3 night mid week break by phone direct with the hotel and were able to take advantage of a good deal for over 50's. We paid room rate only but received free breakfast for the 3 days plus tea and scones on arrival. In addition two bus tour tickets ( worth 32 euros ) were provided free of charge. Despite arriving at the hotel at 10.00am a room was ready for us. The desk, restaurant and bar staff were all very friendly and efficient throughout our stay. The breakfasts were excellent and whilst we did not eat in the restaurant in the evenings the bar did excellent irish coffees to finish the day. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from numerous restaurants and bars- too many to mention by name but we particularly liked 'The Old Stand' and the famous 'Oliver St John Gogarty'. A visit to the Guinness Storehouse is a must and worth the queue to pull your own free pint. If you go to Trinity college for the Book of Kells and Library pay the extra euro to have a brief pre tour with one of the students - you get a good potted history with plenty of amusing anecdotes. Only downside of the whole visit was the rain!! But what would Dublin be without it.",5,2010,09,24
236,perfect location but just ok rooms,"The lobby, bar and restaurant are tastefully decorated so we had high hopes for the room.  It was just ok, nothing special and the smallest room we had during our Ireland vacation.  The location is absolutely perfect though, very convenient to Temple Bar and Grafton St but quiet enough.  We did make selections off the pillow menu but truthfully we couldn't tell a difference in the different pillows.",3,2010,09,21
236,Should be the #1 stay in Dublin! Great experience for the price!,"Updated hotel, very clean, modern and quiet. I asked for a ""renovated room on a higher floor"" and was granted my wish :) The room was very clean and quiet and the bed/pillows were extrememly comfortable! The staff was very helpful and friendly!!!! My only small small complaint is that my sister and I are BIG TV watchers before bed and we were supposed to get channels 1-18, but only got 4-14 and then in the middle of watching a movie one night we lost 4 more channels!!!! Most people wouldnt care about this but as I said we really enjoy watching TV before bed. When I called down to the desk they really didnt have any answers for me :( Other than that things were wonderful!",5,2010,09,20
236,Fantastic hotel with very friendly service,"It was a bit more expensive than I would normally pay (especially with the terrible exchange rate) but it looked and sounded lovely, and we were not disappointed.  I booked a deluxe double with breakfast included.  If there's a choice of with or without breakfast, it's well worth having it as there is a fantastic choice and it's all delicious.  If you have to leave too early for breakfast in the morning, they will pack a breakfast to take with you.  

The bedroom was perfect in every way and there were even chocolates on the pillow every day.  The service in all parts of the hotel was extremely friendly and very good.  The only minor problem was the slowness of the service in the restaurant when we ate there one evening.

The hotel is located ideally - near the main shopping area, not too far from the cathedral and in walking distance of the Jamesons distillery and the Guinness Experience (the former being more interesting).  If you go to the gaol and use the free map in reception to get there on foot, be aware that the map doesn't seem to be to scale outside of the city centre.  It was actually much further than it looked.  But it's definitely worth a visit.",5,2010,09,19
236,Great hotel. Convenient and comfortable,"Lovely hotel. Rooms are comfortable and unusual decor. Staff very friendly on reception. . Breakfast not included and almost 20 euros , so a bit pricey.,  

Very handy for seeing the centre of Dublin. Near to Temple Bar but far enouh away not to be noisy . Lots of bars and resurants nearby. 

Would certainly recommend .",4,2010,09,17
236,Excellent hotel in a charming part of the city,"Dublin is a city I am going back to, and then I will definitely be staying at Brooks Hotel.

236,"Great Choice, thank you Trip Advisor","Once again I was not disappointed by the reviews I read on Trip Advisor.    The Brooks was very clean,  beautifully decorated,  extremely helpful & friendly staff and within walking distance to everything.  I traveled solo and this was the perfect choice for me.  I felt safe and comfortable, as if I was home in my own neighborhood.",5,2010,09,12
236,"Perfect Location, great hotel","When we were planning our trip, we struggled with where to stay. I'm so glad we decided on Brooks Hotel. The hotel is in the PERFECT location. I'm so glad we did not choose to stay in a hotel in the Temple Bar area as I suspect it would have been loud. Brooks is nearby to all the main sights (Dublin is a small walk-able city), yet in a quite area. There was a wonderful grocery store nearby too. Rooms were clean and of a good size. They provided us with a free upgrade for our honeymoon, so I think we may have had a slightly larger room. Staff were helpful and friendly. My only wish was that the wifi signal was stronger. Our room was a corner room and we had to sit in the doorway or in the hallway to get a consistent signal.",4,2010,09,12
236,"Great Hotel, Great Location - Allow time for breakfast!","This hotel is really cool.  It's right bang in the nice part of Dublin city centre with some grat bars and clubs and restaurants around.  I stayed here on my return trip to Dublin this year on my vacation.  A litttle far for the airport but with the welcome etc we received it was well worth that extra trip the following morning.

Rooms are great and roomey and have been renovated recently.  Oh I asked for an upgrade and they were happy enough to accomodate but with a little addional charge.

When we finished up for the night out we had a little drink to finish the night off in the residence bar.  Great whisky selection.

The breakfast was great.  Cooked to order but a little slow and it didn't seem to be that busy.  Again this was not a major deal.

Lovely and will stay here again if I go back to Ireland,",4,2010,09,09

236,Excellent location and perfect hosts,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a press trip.  Wonderful hotel, in a great location, close to Gaiety Theatre, great shopping, old historic areas and lots of eating places.  A perfect hotel in every way but just one tiny thing to comment on...in the evenings it gets pretty noisy because this is such a popular spot to go with all the pubs so I would suggest that if you want a quiet room, you ask for one not facing the street.  After closing my windows I did not hear the noise but I do like to sleep with windows open.

Food was excellent and so was the service here.  A wonderful business center/reading room complete with free internet.",4,2010,08,31
236,Four star hotel Five Star service,"My familly and I recently visited Dublin Ireland.  I loved Dublin and I am a hard sell.  We did not stay at the Brooks but dined there one evening.  From the moment we entered the hotel lobby, we were treated like royalty. It was full five star service all
the way.  We dined in the hotels restaurant  Francesca's.  My daughter is vegan and 
althought they had nothing on the menu that appeared to comply, the chief came out
and spoke with her.  He and the waiter were more than accommodating and did 
everything possible to assure that her meal was prepared properly.  Everyone in the hotel was extemely nice and cordial and the hotel was just lovely.  We were staying in
one of Dublin's more priceier five star hotels and the service was not as friendly and hospitable.  Although I did not see the suites, everything I did see and experience in
this hotel was on par with the hotel I stayed in that had a higher rating on trip advisor.",4,2010,08,30
236,Can't praise Brooks Hotel enough....,"Looking through other reviews for Brooks Hotel in Dublin and most at are all 5's Wonder why?  It's the service, rooms, beds, bathrooms, breakfast, staff, location. What it doesn't say is that you will feel like family from the minute you walk in till you leave, and you will wonder why other hotels can't seem to send you away thinking everything about your stay was perfect.  So best to everyone at Brooks especially Anne at the front desk  with a smile made in heaven and Conor the Concierge Exraordinaire. We'll be back.....",5,2010,08,27
236,Uninspiring Service,"Hotel is in a good central location close to Grafton Street..

Family room was a bit cramped for three. Low ceelings in bedroom and bathroom could annoy taller people. Beds were a bit too hard for adults and too high for small children. Public areas were clean and pleasent but quite small. 

Service was usually friendly, but superficial and not very customer focused. Polite reception staff, but none offered to help us with luggage and didn't try to find out if we had enjoyed our stay.

We had an evening meal included in our package. But it turned out to be restricted to the 'Early Bird' menu - which was quite limited in its scope and left us little choice but to order of the more expensive main menu. Why do this? Its a bit mean spirited to guests.

But the real problem was the service. Service in the resturant was very slow... a few of the waiters and chefs need to up their game. Brooks will loose business if they don't improve their basic service standards. We waited half an hour for a salad starter! Not what you expect of a four star hotel. That was our fiirst experience of Brooks' service. Excuse offered by the waiter was that the order docket was lost in the kitchen - but there were very few others eating in the resturant - so they were hardly busy - not much of an excuse. 

Service at breakfast was no better. Breakfast spread was good but it took us nearly an hour to get everything we had ordered... Our order wasn't that complicated but Brooks seemed make a mess of it. Waiter didn't get the original order right and we had to return one cooked meal and when the porridge arrived it was undercooked and watery - had to send it back. Ordered more tea and toast - took twenty minutes to arrive. Who else serves such small breakfasts so slowly - must be an Irish record. Very disappointing

Couldn't recommend to others unless service improved.",2,2010,08,22
236,A fine hotel in Dublin!,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Brooks Hotel this past May and enjoyed our stay very much. Our room was very quiet, clean and comfortable and the staff was quite friendly and helpful. The Brooks proved to be  a good base for sight-seeing and was near some very nice restaurants. We also were more than pleased with our breakfasts there.",5,2010,08,22
236,Excellent choice for a Dublin city break,"We recently spent a long weekend in Dublin staying at the Brooks Hotel. We chose the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and it’s location in the city – it was a great choice. Arriving early in the morning we went to leave a bag at the hotel only to find that a room was available and we had been up graded to a junior suite. The suite was a large room on the 5th floor with seating area, small balcony and large bathroom. It was clean, comfortable and the small terrace was great as the weather was warm and sunny and it was nice to sit outside (the view wasn’t great but what do you expect in a city centre). The staff were all pleasant and helpful and the breakfast excellent (we had this included in our room rate). We couldn’t fault the hotel or it’s location close to the Gaiety Theatre (Riverdance was fantastic) and numerous bars and restaurants as well as St. Stephen’s Green park",5,2010,08,20
236,Underwhelmed,"Was touring Ireland with a friend of mine and was looking for a good hotel at a good price.  I got the good price, but the hotel itself was lackluster in almost every way.

It's in a great location, but that's about the best thing going for it.

Room was small, boringly/cheaply furnished and decorated. Think Marriott Courtyard before the refresh a few years ago.  Mirror screwed to wall with the screws showing prominently, polyester bedspreads, etc.  Public areas areas too are non-descript and a bit long in the tooth.

Service was typically friendly (Americans tip well), but amateurish at best.  Room wasn't cleaned one day.  I left my umbrella in my room one night, not realizing it was raining.  I asked the doorman if he had one I could borrow, and he (politely) responded that they did not have umbrellas for their guests use.  It's Dublin.  It rains.  No umbrellas...really?!  

The kicker was when my friend went to check his gmail account.  The site was blocked by the hotel!!  I am somewhere between annoyed and offended that the hotel censors their guest's internet usage (something that wouldn't surprise me in Yemen or Saudi Arabia), but irate that their filtering system didn't allow access to google mail!

This sums up the Brooks Hotel.  General friendliness masquerading as actual service.  Clean my room, buy a few $5 umbrellas to loan your guests, and let me check my e-mail or surf the internet I'm paying for access to (without big brother checking).

I won't name names, but there are better hotels to be found within a five minute walk.  This is where I'd recommend you begin your search.",2,2010,08,18
236,Great place to stay in Dublin,"We had an excellent stay in this hotel befor and after our journey to the West.
Very welcoming and helpful staff, great breakfast, location near many sights and shops.
We stored half out luggage with the hotel when we went out of town and found it in our room when we returned. On weekends the neghborhood is busy, so do not sleep with windows open.  Hotel if very friendly to families and business travellers.",5,2010,08,17
236,Wonderful place,"Just stayed at the Brooks for two nights...one at the beginning of our week in Ireland, and one night at the end of the week.  Both experiences were fabulous.  Stayed with my husband and my mother and we all loved it.  The staff are so welcoming and attentive, the rooms are beautiful, and the location is perfect--easy walking distance to many restaurants, pubs, and various sites.",5,2010,08,16
236,"A pleasant surprise - reasonable, friendly, 4-star in town centre.","I was hesitant to book this hotel because 4-stars in popular tourist spots like Dublin can be very dodgy.  This hotel was completely fine, and nothing at all like what I had feared.  It was actually pretty good value for a good, clean place - quite smart for a 4-star, is what I thought.  The room was modern and looked like it had been refurbished not too long ago.  The space was good in the bedroom and bathroom.  The front desk was really friendly and sweet, if a bit forgetful - both days they missed our wake up calls.  The breakfast was okay and service was quick.  Bed was reasonably comfortable, and they offered to fit it with a variety of different pillows.  The bathroom had amenities from the White Company.  The only complaint was that the door was a bit thin, so we could hear people walking and talking in the corridor - it wasn't a hugely disturbing factor, we didn't lose any sleep.  Location was very good.  Close to Trinity College, Grafton Street and all the nice side streets with nice bistros etc.",4,2010,08,16
236,Great hotel in a great location,"The Brooks Hotel is located in an ideal location on a quiet street within walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and other tourist attractions. Our room was very clean with great decor and very comfortable bedding. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. It exceeded our expectations.",4,2010,08,14
236,Make sure you get a rennovated room,"When we arrived, the room was a disappointment.  It seemed shabby, and a little run down -- not the attractive modern room on the website.  The beds did not seem vey comfortable.  A maid explained that the room had not yet been rennovated, but that the hotel had nicer rooms.

The front desk offered to upgrade us for a small extra charge.  The new room was very stylish, clean, and comfortable -- worth every penny of the upgrade.

The location is ideal - near the Temple Bar but without the obnoxious, noisy crowds.  It was central to everything we wanted to do.  After exploring Dublin on foot, I could not think of a better hotel location to use as a base.

Just make sure you are reserving one of the recently rennovated rooms.",4,2010,08,05
236,GREAT LOCATION BUT.... OVERRATED and A BIT RUNDOWN,"Am quite surprised at the high rating of this hotel. Sure did NOT live up to it’s reviews.  

Check in was quick and front desk people very courteous. I can’t fault service. Concierge efficient and customer service very accommodating.

But the hotel looks old and in bad need of renovations.. 
1-	Rooms are really small , carpets worn-down, furniture look old and have seen better days
2-	Towels in our bathroom were threadbare and had weird stains -  we had them replaced. Manager acted on it quickly and invited us over for free drinks in the bar while they cleaned our bathroom again
3-	Bathroom looks old too. Cracked tiles, rust stains, shower curtains had lots of mildew and black stains, loose hairstrands in the bath tub .. I guess housekeeping doesn’t bother to clean thoroughly
4-	Had a bath tub, but I wouldn’t dare soak in it for reasons mentioned above
5- The cups, teaspoons, saucers for the tea service were sticky

The great thing about this hotel is it’s great location and value

Previously, we stayed at the Radisson Blu on Golden Lane.The  service was excellent, bigger rooms (twice the size of Brooks hotel in the same category with a living room area) , new and modern facilities in room, superior amenities,  although location not as central",3,2010,08,01
236,Affordable luxury,"Have to share our delight for our stay at the Brooks Hotel, Drury Street, Dublin.  The rooms are fabulous decor and very comforatable.  We arrived to music which was a nice touch. Staff friendly and helpful.  Hotel clean and food very nice.  Great location for all the City attractions-very accessible.  Also delighted at selection of vegan and vegeatrian eateries nearby, starting with Blazing Salads, in the same road, just down from the hotel.  Selling a selection of vegan, gluten free etc dishes.  Also, Cornicopia on Wicklow Street, vegan restauarant, which is about a five minute walk.  We was in our element.  Very nice food, but make sure you are hungry when you go in as their portion sizes are not for the faint hearted, 10out of 10.  Well done Dublin.",5,2010,07,31
236,Great Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Really liked this hotel. 

Great staff, nice room, great location.

The bar serves a very nice Guinness.

Just south of the Temple Bar district and a couple of minutes from Grafton Street.

What's not to like",4,2010,07,30
236,Top notch night!,"It took me ages to decide which hotel to go for, for our one night stay in Dublin to see Riverdance.  I have to say we weren't disappointed one little bit!

Before we even left the UK, the superb customer service started.  I had put a couple of requests on the booking form and, before I knew it, there was an email from Claire, telling me the details of our stay and asking if there was anything else she could help with.  I knew we were onto a winner!

The friendliest of welcomes awaited us from Anne on reception and the wonderful character, Connor, the concierge.  We felt at home the minute we stepped into the lobby.  Our room was perfectly appointed and really comfortable - just what we had requested.  We had an early dinner in the hotel restaurant which was absolutely delicious ... and thoroughly enjoyed our 2nd visit to Riverdance!!!

Breakfast was great and was served until 11am.

We only had one, tiny, let-down during our stay ... our morning showers were only luke-warm.  We let reception know and after checking things out discovered that there had been a problem with one of the boilers.  Let's face it, things go wrong sometimes - it wasn't the end of the world and it didn't, in any way, spoil our stay.

At Brooks, nothing was too much to ask - Tom, the duty manager even offered to ship back a borhan (Irish Folk Drum) for us as Ryanair wanted EUR80 for the privilege!  We have been offered a fantastic deal for our next stay in compensation for the problem with the shower and we will definitely be back later this year.  

One night was definitely not enough time in Dublin or at the Brooks and it would be rude not to make the most of such a good offer!",5,2010,07,27
236,"Nice hotel, great location","Overall great.  We were in Dublin for 2 days so we wanted to be in a good location.  I asked for the top floor and glad I did.  The hotel is quiet, at least on the top floor.  Dublin is really loud if you are near any pubs and some hotels are in noisier areas than others.  The hotel staff is very nice and they have a nice breakfast- probably the best coffee i have ever had in a hotel.",4,2010,07,19
236,Great little hotel,"I stayed at Brooks Hotel for four nights in early June.  I was traveling with a small academic group from the U.S.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel.  The staff was wonderfully hospitable and helpful at all times, the rooms were immaculate and very quiet.  Our group met for dinner in one of their private dining rooms, and I must say that the food was excellent and beautifully presented.  The use of their computers was free, a fact that I greatly appreciated as the connection on my Blackberry did not work for several days as there were problems with the server in Ireland.  On a lower floor was a pleasant room for reading, with newspapers and books about Ireland, a most welcome place after a hard day's sightseeing!
In all this is a most pleasant hotel with a delightful and helpful staff.",4,2010,07,18
236,Convenient Location,"This hotel is conveniently located!  It is outside of Temple Bar so you won't hear too much noise but you can definitely walk to all major tourist attractions!  If you are taking the AirCoach (instead of a cab) from the airport , take either Trinity College stop or Suffolk St stop and walk a few blocks to the hotel.  The staff are kind & friendly!  The gym is very basic with three cardio equipments, some free weights & a bench.  The room we stayed in with two beds was clean & actually quite roomy.",4,2010,07,09
236,Very Nice Stay at the Brooks,"We recently returned from a 4-night stay at the Brooks while in Dublin and were very happy with our stay.  My husband and I were traveling with my Mom and so got a room with one Queen and one single bed – while this made things a bit tight, the room was more spacious than many others I have stayed at in Europe and definitely met our needs.   The room was well decorated and we found the beds to be quite comfortable.  The bathroom, while a bit outdated, was clean and served its purposes.  

Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.  On arrival, while we were waiting to see if our room was ready, the concierge introduced himself to us and sat with us for a few minutes to introduce us to the city and answer any questions we had, which was very nice.  Our room price included a full breakfast each morning (including the big Irish breakfast, if you wanted), which we really enjoyed.  And we also made use of the fitness center in the basement which, while pretty tiny by American standards, exceeded my expectations for Europe.  

The hotel is in a great location (right near Grafton Street), and it was nice knowing we could quickly stop by during the day if we needed to drop something off.

Overall, we had a very nice stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to other visitors to Dublin.",4,2010,07,05
236,Great location..everyting else was average,"This place was a bit expensive and would not be worth it if it wasn't so ideally located.  The rooms were small, but clean.  I would stay here again, but only for the location.",4,2010,06,28
236,Excellent hotel with first class rooms,"Booked rooms for 3 nights here after finished tour of Ireland.  Great location- close to many thngs but did not get the noise of the street.  Rooms nice size, great shape and air conditioned.  Staff extremely cordial.  Would definitely stay here again.  Linda and Karl",5,2010,06,19
236,AMAZING Hotel!!,"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in!  I have absolutely no complaints.  Check in was fast, we were able to check in several hours before check-in time (which was nice given we were exhausted after a long flight).  The front desk staff were wonderful, very polite and really knowledgeable about the area.  

The room was superb.  Very clean, nice updated furniture.  The beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was large and immaculate.  

The hotel location is perfect.  Walking distance to many popular tourist areas.  There are great restaurants within walking distance and it's right near the shops.

Free wi-fi and free use of computers (always a bonus, so you can print off your boarding passes).

This is a really fantastic hotel and I would stay here again and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!!",5,2010,06,15
236,"Wonderful place, clean, comfortable, great service and excellent location!",We liked this hotel so much we went back and stayed a second time. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. It was a great place to rest and relax after several days of long travels. I would recommend staying here without reservation.,5,2010,06,08
236,The best at every item of concern,"Location, service, room size, appointments, staff, amenities, restaurant, etc.  just flat out one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at--top of the line in every category.",5,2010,05,14
236,"great location, helpful staff, clean","This was recommended by a friend who is from Ireland.  We had a great time in Ireland partly due to the great location of this hotel.  Close to it seems to everything, including the Temple bar area, Trinity University, Dublin Castle, and shopping.  

The staff could not have been any nicer and helpful.  I don't remember the hostess name that checked us in, but she allowed us to get to our room 5 hours ahead of time.  Robert the desk help at night was fantastic.  All the staff was top notch.

I thought the meals were a tad expensive, tasty, but a wee bit expensive.  The one bad thing, they said we could have breakfast the first morning, they had said we could check in early.  My wife was not hungry and ate a slice of toast, and some juice.  The waiter said the hostess was wrong and we would be charged.  I said sure, no problem, they charged my wife 15.50 Euro for the toast and juice.  I thought, never again would I accept the free breakfast.  Other than that, great place and I would recommend it to anyone.",5,2010,05,03
236,"Warmth, friendliness, great service under trying circumstances","Stuck in Dublin during the volcanic ash crisis and this hotel rose to the occasion by showing great Irish hospitality. Unlike other hotels around Europe they did not overcharge us but in fact threw in breakfast.! The room was generous in size for Europe, the staff was overwhelmingly helpful and the location could not have been better. What could have been a horrible, stressful experience instead was a enjoyable time in a wonderful city epitomized by an excellent hotel.",5,2010,04,25
236,Wonderful hotel with warm staff!,"I just returned from the Brooks Hotel after a 4 night stay due to being stranded by volcanic ash.  My colleague and I had originally been in the Westbury but had to leave when our flight was cancelled because they didn't have enough rooms for us. Someone at reception at the Westbury recommended this hotel to us as an alternative.

We ended up absolutely loving this hotel, even more than the Westbury.  It has a cozy, intimate atmosphere that we really needed under the circumstances of being stranded in Dublin.  The staff was wonderful - from Lisa at the front desk, Conor the concierge, and Frank, Ruthie and Frederick in the restaurant/bar - they really cared about our situation and took good care of us.

It is in a great location, within 5 minutes walk of literally dozens of restaurants and shopping (near Grafton Street and St Stephens Green).  The rooms are quiet, well appointed, with nice bedding, decent storage space and a good sized bathroom with good water pressure.  We loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone for either business or pleasure.",5,2010,04,22
236,Excellent hotel.,"Myself and my colleague were very pleased with the hotel, the staff and there were no problems with cleanliness.

The Hotel bar served excellent bar meals and had a very nice atmosphere (for a hotel bar)

Very close to the Temple Bar (if that's your type of thing) but further enough away to be in a quite area not far from shops and some nice bars.

The restaurant looked nice but we didn't try a we were invited elsewhere.  The only disappointment was the breakfasts.  Continental was provided in the price with cooked at a extra cost.  We stayed 2 nights on both mornings I had the continental they has an excellent choice but the pastries were very over done (pastries are a highlight for me going away!) to make them inedible.

However, I am thinking of taking my wife there next year for a short break due to the rest of the stay (I'll just pay the extra for a cooked breakfast next time!).",5,2010,04,07
236,Highly avoidable,"I stayed there for just one night as I found it easier to have a room near the theatre where I was going to watch a concert.
All four or five stars hotels,  with very few exceptions, rely on a friendly and qualified staff to make them  bearable. Apart from those brilliant people, they are dusty and boring places. 
The Brooks goes one step further -or down ?- : the plastic curtain in the bathroom smelt of dirty bath towels -sorry, hope you weren't eating...- and the bath casing was stained with splashes of what looked very much like old, dried up blood. 

Hygiene is not something that can be taken lightly in my opinion and I am not going back there, ever. Would rather stay in a clean hostel than a dirty four star establishment.",3,2010,04,04
236,"Cracking hotel, great location.","Stayed here for a rugby weekend with wife and a large group of friends. Got a great rate and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The concierge, Conor, is the consumate professional. He has a great knack of retaining individual details and making you feel like youre're more than just a room number! 
Excellent breakfast and comfortable communal areas, though the decor in the rooms is a little 'tired'.
We'll all be back again for the Michael Buble concert and for future rugby weekends for sure.",5,2010,04,02
236,An absolute Gem,"We stayed at Brooks for my wife's birthday, which is the day after St Paddy's day.  Arriving on St Paddy's was not a great idea as the entire city centre is shut off for the parade and 650,000, mainly drunken people, take to the streets.  Pulling 2 suit cases through the throng was not much fun, but never mind.  When we arrived the reception staff were lovely, effecient and helpful.  The room was a good size and the bed King Size.  Everything was just right, down to the turn down service with a chocolate on the pillow.  Corny I know, but welcome.  Facilities are impressive with a cosy bar and quiet guest lounge area.  Location is great, 1 minute to Grafton St, 2 minutes to St Stevens Green and 10 minutes to Temple Bar.  We did the Viking Splash tour on the DUKW, which was fun, the open top us trip with a live commentary which was informative and very funny and a River trip which was good too.  All in all great trip and would certainly stay at Brooks again.",5,2010,03,20
236,"Great Location, Nice Hotel, and Great Service","I stayed 3 days and 3 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin, and couldn't have been more pleased with my choice!  

What I loved:
-The location was perfect (it was on a semi-quiet street and was a short walk to Grafton St., St. Stephen's Green, and Temple Bar)
-The contemporary room decor and modern bathroom
-Clean and comfortable
-Great service from the hotel staff and concierge

I booked it online for 180 euros per night and thought it was a little expensive, but considering that I stayed there the weekend of the Ireland-Wales rugby match and just prior to St Patrick's Day, it was a popular time to be in Dublin and I do not mind the rate I payed given the quality of location and service.  It was a fair price.",5,2010,03,20
236,Fantastic find in Dublin,"Another late review...we stayed at the Brooks Hotel in July 2008 for 2 nights.  Great location in central Dublin within walking distance to all the shops, bars and restaurants.  Facility was in excellent condition - big rooms, super clean, choice of 6 different pillow types (you get the picture!).  Overall we felt like this hotel was a great find and very good value for the money.  Will definitely stay there again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2010,03,13
236,The Best Service Ever,"The service at this Hotel was impeccable. We missed our car rental return, which isnt hard to do in Dublin since it  literally is ""The streets with NO Names"". The front desk encouraged us to relax in our room while they made arrangements to fix this for us. Very helpful with navigations to pubs and restaurant choices. The breakfast was made to order and had a wide selection of choices.  The room was comfortable and had everything you would need in it.  The bathroom was small but the shower was strong....(much appreciated and hard to find in Ireland). Would definitely stay at the Brooks again.",5,2010,03,08
236,You will have a lovely time staying at this hotel,"We booked a weekend break to Dublin, the location of this hotel is fantistic!  It's about 10/15 minutes walk from the bus stop (the airport shuttle bus) and it's just off the main street so it is quiet at night considering that you are at the heart of a city.  The room itself was just spotless, very clean, tidy and well decorated.  There was a ""pillow menu"", yes, you can choose the firmness of the pillow!

Breakfast was just brilliant, all cooked to order, service was really good.

Overall it's a 5* hotel at a very reasonable price.",5,2010,02,24
236,Stay here! Lovely hotel in Dublin.,"I can't say enough about this hotel's location. It's steps away from everything- eateries, sites, Temple Bar and fun pubs.  Visited Dublin for Valentines weekend and was debating the Westin or Brooks. The Westin is also in a lovely location. The Brooks was just slightly cheaper and we decided to try it for something more ""boutique"".  I loved the hotel, the front desk and service was lovely.

The rooms were small but very cozy. Beds were OK. Free WIFI which was surprising. Very friendly, helpful concierge. Nice restaurant in hotel. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and the location alone is reason enough to stay here. It's central to everything you'd want to do in this city.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay :)",4,2010,02,22
236,What a wonderful hotel!,"I happened to be staying overnight in Dublin city recently on business. My colleague recommended Brooks Hotel as the ideal place to stay in the city centre and how right he was! I found it to be a home away from home where you are really made welcome. The staff were absolutely brilliant in their attentiveness, politeness and professionalism. The bedroom was spacious and modern, very clean and with some many lovely touches not seen in many hotels. I opted for room service dinner and found the food to be of a very high quality. I know sometimes with room service dinner it can be a bit of a lottery in some hotels what with waiting forever and then the food arriving cold and uninviting. But not here. Although the restaurant was busy my food arrived quickly and very well presented. Breakfast the following morning was superb. The staff were very attentive and the simply things like pouring my coffee for me was an example of the attention to detail. The buffet was very well stocked and presented, especially the breads/pastry table. I'll definitely make it my business to visit Brooks Hotel again whether for business or pleasure.",5,2010,02,17
236,Great Location,"Just a quick entry to say stayed here in late Jan 2010 and was perfect. It has no views or anything but is in the centre of the best part of Dublin. One street over from all the hip restuarants and bars so great spot and also no noise at night. Perfect for quick trip, shopping trip, romantic trip.",4,2010,02,12
236,"Excellent 4 star hotel, Wonderful staff","Stayed in this hotel over Christmas 2009. One of the best 4 star hotels I have stayed in. Finnair lost our luggage and staff could not have been more helpful in trying to locate our luggage even though it never turned up in our entire six week trip. Wonderful staff who made our stay a great experience. Our daughter also stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks later on our recommendation and she also was looked after very well and had a fantastic time. The hotel is of the highest standard, the food is great, and  close to Grafton St and all the tourist attarctions. The hotel also has easy access to the airport via the airport bus or cab. The rooms are a good size and the hotel is value for money. I would definitely go back and the only negative thing I can think of is that we wished we had stayed longer. Thanks to all the staff and in particular to Gerard and Connor for a fantastic stay!",5,2010,02,07
236,Stay at the Heart of stylish Dublin,"Great stylish hotel situated in an area which exudes authentic Dublin.  New and Old pubs, Indoor market, are on your doorstep together with great boutique style shops. All around the hotel within in easy walking distance are all the main tourist attractions.  The staff are friendly, the service is good, and the rooms are well appointed and spacious. This is a stylish gem of a hotel.",4,2010,01,21
236,Superb hotel in superb location.,A very friendly boutique hotel with a luxurious feel.  The atmosphere was relaxed but there was good attention to detail like the chocolate with the turn-down service.  The breakfast included a very well stocked buffet.  Excellent location just off St Stephen's Green. The only drawback is that we had to go out to find some mad night life.,5,2010,01,04
236,great!,"Very good position, very confortable room and lovely receptionist",5,2009,12,26
236,Enjoyed our Stay at the Brooks,"My wife and I and our 20-year old daughter stayed at the Brooks hotel for five nights beginning December 11.   Our son is an exchange student at the University College of Dublin, and so we thought the three of us would visit him and check out Dublin.  

As indicated in previous Tripadvisor reviews, the Brooks is a very nice hotel.   We had two rooms at the Brooks.  Initially, my wife and I were on the fifth floor and our daughter on the third floor.   Apparently, the fact that my daughter was in room 312 was not properly recorded in the hotel system, and the hotel staff tried to give the room to another group at 4 AM on our first night.  Needless to say, my daughter was a bit unnerved when she awoke with three strangers entering her room.   We managed to sort this out, and the hotel staff were very apologetic.   To make amends, they moved my daughter to the fifth floor and upgraded her room, and comped three of our breakfasts.   Except for the incident on the first night, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, including Connor (previously mentioned in other reviews).

The rooms were very nice.  Our room was smallish, but my daughters upgraded room was of better size.  The mattresses were nice and firm.  The bathrooms were nicely appointed with good hot water and water pressure.   My female companions were happy with the in-room hair dryers.  On Saturday night, though, we could hear some drunken singing from the street below – Trinity students celebrating? – but there was very little noise on the other nights.  We did not take advantage of the Pillow menu.
The Brooks location can’t be beat.  It is just a few minutes walk from Dublin Castle (and the Beatty museum), Trinity College, the shopping on Grafton street, the park on St. Stephen’s Green, and the national art and history museums.   We took the hop-on hop-off bus from the front gate of Trinity to visit the Guinness Storehouse and the Kilmainham Gaol, and also took the historic walking tour from the same front gate location.   We also walked to the main bus station (about 20 minutes away) for a day tour to Newgrange (highly recommended), and saw the Seafarer, a wonderful play at the Abbey Theatre, maybe a 15 minute walk away.   Our farthest walk was to the Dublin Writers museum, about 25 minutes away.  The Dublin tourist office is just two blocks away from the Brooks in a decommissioned church, and I highly recommend a visit there as they have loads of info about events, tours, and transportation.
We did find Dublin to be an expensive city, more so than other European capitals we have visited (even accounting for the exchange rate).  There are quite a few restaurants near the Brooks, and the meals were generally good, but dinner for four cost us between $150 and $200 each night.   The breakfast at the Brooks was nice, but also pricey (if we hadn’t been comped, would have cost between $20 and $30 each).  We found a relatively inexpensive place to get a hot breakfast – at Café Seven, down the block and around the corner, but even a complete breakfast plus coffee cost about $12.  There were several “Spar” and “Londis” markets – small convenience stores -- within walking distance where one could pick up some bread, cheese, and fruit for a less expensive picnic meal.  
Overall, we did enjoy our visit to Dublin and the Brooks.  We will likely return at some time for a more extensive Irish experience.",4,2009,12,19
236,Excellent Location,"This hotel is not bad at all - the best thing about it is its central location as just around the corner from Grafton Street - all in all we had a great time in dublin and in this Brooks hotel - service was very good, rooms lovely",5,2009,12,13
236,Great little hotel,"The Brooks Hotel is is a great location - far enough from Dublin nightlife to get a good night's sleep, but close enough to walk to after you spend the day sightseeing or the evening at the pubs.  The staff was friendly and helpful.

On the negative side I paid 145 Euro for a Saturday night stay at the end of August (NOT the height of tourist season).  The hotel is nice, but not worth that kind of money for a Twn room.",3,2009,12,06
236,"Great hotel, great location.","Just returned from a long weekend in Dublin staying at Brooks Hotel.  The hotel is in a great location, within 5 minutes walk of Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel.  We stayed in one of the contemporary rooms which was spotless, tasteful and well furnished with a fab shower.  The bar and public areas are also of a similar standard.  Did get a peek into one of the rooms with flouncy wallpaper etc and it would give you a bit of a headache!

The breakfast is of an outstanding quality served in pleasant surroundings.  We did find the breakfast service a bit chaotic on the Sunday morning and had to wait for a table, but I think this is because everybody seemed to turn up at once.  We were very impressed that breakfast is served right up until 11.30 at the weekends.  

The only possible negative that I could report is that the hotel staff on a number of occasions just let themselves into our room when we were in, on one occasion I was wearing just a towel!  Each time they knocked just prior to or, as they were opening the door and then apologised saying that they ""thought no-one was in""!!  However, this is just a minor gripe and I wouldn't let it stop me returning.",5,2009,12,02
236,Wow what an amazine hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my husband and 2 friends for a leisurely weekend brea. The moment we arrived the concierge 'Connor' made us feel very welcome and he couldm't do enough for us throughout our stay!
All the staff we met were pleasant, friendly and helpful.
The breakfast was lovely with lots of choice.  We didn't get chance to go in the bar area but it did look very nice.
Our rooms were lovely and also quiet for saying we were in a fantastic central location.
All I can say is the hotel exceeded our expectations and we would dfeinitely recommend this hotel to anyone. A special thanks to Connor.",5,2009,11,25
236,PERFECT !!!!!!,"From my first contact with the hotel in July inquiring about rates and availability, to our check in (Nov 4) to our check out (Nov 7) everything was PERFECT.  I had requested (based on other TV suggestions) a room not on the front of the hotel.  Was assigned room 411 and it was very quiet.  We arrived very early (9:30 AM) and were taken to the wonderful downstairs library by Marvin (who was most helpful) and served tea while our room was prepared.  We waited not more than 15 minutes and then shown our wonderful room.  The next three days we did our sightseeing (walking is soooooooooooooo easy as everything we wanted to see was no more than 15 minutes away from the hotel).  EVERY time we went through the lobby (past the reception desk) we were ALWAYS greeted with a smiling face, calling us by name and asking how our day was.  All the staff are exceptionally nice, warm and professional.  I hope to return to Dublin and would never even consider staying at any other hotel.",5,2009,11,21
236,THE Place to stay in Dublin. Absolutely perfect!,"We stayed 3 nights at the Brooks hotel at the beginning of our Irish holiday. We chose Brooks based on the tripadvisor reviews and they were on the money. Everything was perfect. The location, a shorth walk from Grafton street and Trinity College is unbeatable. The rooms was spotlessly clean, comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast was outstanding. a great selection on the buffett and excellent cooked to order food. The Full Irish is excellent but the porridge was a surprise. Fabulous!

The best thing about the Brooks Hotel though is the staff. You could not find a better group of people. Kind, helpful, and friendly, they are the best of the best. And the absolute best of the bunch is the incomparable Connor. What a perfect host! After meeting our taxi and helping with the luggage, Connor took us to the guest lounge and dashed back upstairs to bring us a pot of tea and some biscuits. Gave us all the information we could want to make the most of our time in Dublin and saw that we we always looked after. Connor greets everyone by name and always has time for a friendly chat. I know we'll never forget Connor or the great stay at the Brooks Hotel.",5,2009,11,15
236,Good location - service needs improvement,"We were expecting great things of Brooks Hotel, given the reviews on this site but we were ultimately a little disappointed.
First the plus points:  The room was comfortable and well laid out (though the decor may not be to everybody's taste).  Breakfast was good and the hotel is in a great location on Drury Street - a short walk from Stephen's green and Temple bar.

There were a few drawbacks however:  During our stay the service was pretty sloppy for a top hotel.  Our order at breakfast was mixed up, promised coffee never arrived etc.  Then the mini bar was lacking a bottle opener and i called down to reception - it took nearly 2 hours for it to be delivered.  Then the hotel forgot our wake up call on the day we were due to leave.  We tried to order a cheese plate after 11pm and were told that the kitchen was closed and they could only do sandwiches.  Also a couple of requests for sundry items like paracetamol were met with directions to the chemist up the road.

Overall i would say that for the money there are probably better hotels than this one to stay in.",3,2009,11,08
236,You Can't Ask for a Better Hotel,"What a delight! Giant comfortable rooms and great location. 

The staff was unbelievably helpful and friendly. I arrived back at the hotel late one night after the restaurant was closed, but when I asked if there was a chance to get something to eat, they made me a delicious club sandwich, which, combined with a Guinness from the bar, made the perfect nightcap. When we sent out a large load of laundry, the bellman refused to take a tip, even when we tried to force him to take it. The desk staff was friendly and efficient and would move heaven and Earth to do anything for the guests. 

And how could I forget the lounge downstairs? It's what you want in a hotel lobby; plush and cozty.

I can't recommend this place highly enough; it's a perfect hotel.",5,2009,11,03
236,"Great Location, Better Service!","The Brooks is a modern, clean hotel with one of the best locations in Dublin. It is close to sights, Temple Bar, St Stephen's Green and pretty much anything else you would want to do in Dublin. Reception was extremely helpful with our sightseeing plans and with arranging transportation. The whiskey bar staff was excellent, but the modern decor doesn't seem to match a whiskey bar's style. I loved sampling the huge selection of whiskeys.",5,2009,10,27
236,Excellent base for exploring Dublin,"Based on TripAdvisor reviews, we both chose the Brooks and opted for the cut above a standard room -- which took us into more expensive territory than usual, but found the accommodations attractive (not dated), very comfortable, and very clean.  The bed was great -- best sleeps I had in Ireland, the shower had nonstop power, appreciated the bottled water, terry robes, in-room safe, and turndown service.  Every hotel or B&B were stayed in during our 2 week trip used energy-friendly but low-light bulbs in bed-side lamps, which were horrible for reading; the Brooks, however, provided a second, higher-beam lamp with an adjustable goose-neck on each side of the bed -- a BIG improvement.

Some reviewers reported noise, but our room was very quiet, perhaps because it was at the rear and also at the end of a corridor.  The downside of the location was that the wireless internet connection didn't work at all in our room (apparently too far from the nerve hub).  That was an annoyance, but we were able to use the computers in the cozy and comfortable guest lounge without waiting.

Our rate (from Booking.com) included breakfast -- plenty of choices, including the whole works (cooked Irish breakfast) and several kinds of fresh fruit and breads.  Friendly and attentive servers, spacious and attractive dining room.

The location, tucked on a small street, is unbeatable.  After unloading our bags, we said goodbye to our rental car -- dropped it off across the river and got our first look at Dublin by walking about 30 minutes back to the hotel.  Museums, theaters, Trinity College, loads of bookstores, and eating and drinking places of all kinds are an easy walk from the Brooks.  The beautiful St. Stephens Green, with a lake, ducks, and pan-handling geese, is a very short stroll.  We felt like were in the heart of everything.",5,2009,10,18
236,Beautiful!,"Really nice Double Room, very clean. The staff were very friendly. A very pleasant hotel to stay in. ",5,2009,10,17
236,TERRIFIC,Brooks Hotel exceeded out expectations.  The staff was incredible - be sure to met Conor - and the location couldn't be beat.  We checked in a day early and they were most welcoming.  All the great places are within walking distance and their dining room is quiet and a nice respite from the other places out in town plus great food.  You won't be sorry you stayed here!,5,2009,10,16
236,Perfect Location,"Loved the location of the hotel as it was close to all the sites in the main part of Dublin.  I would reccomend eating breakfast at any of the local cafe's as the breakfast was just as good as the Hotels and about 1/3 of the price.  We requested a room in the higher floors and no problem whatsoever with outside noise.  The hotel seems to be far enough from temple bar so noise is not a problem, but note that any hotel in the area has excessive noise on Friday and Sat.",4,2009,10,13
236,Charming hotel great location,"We spent the last 2 nights of our Ireland trip at the Brooks Hotel.  It is an excellent location, close to Grafton Street, restaurants, St Stephen's Green , shopping and the AirCoach stop is a very  short walk. The lobby and bar/dining areas are very trendy.  The reception staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.We had breakfast both mornings and dinner one night.  The dinner was probably the best meal that I had for our trip.   
We were given an upgraded room.  Our room was on the 3rd floor looking into an office building, so we did not experience any of the noise that other posts have noted. Our room was compact but had an incredible bed!  Pillow menu was fun! Our bath had a wonderful soaking tub!  My personal pet peeves  would be that the hangers in the closet were the anti-theft kind and the hair dryer was attached to the wall with  no adjustments.  Our room was showing some signs of wear. As previously noted the free internet was a plus.
Overall, the Brooks is a charming boutique hotel and we would stay again.",4,2009,10,13
236,Noise and Censorship,"My first reaction was very positive, lovely lobby, pretty room but since that initial view two things have emerged that will have me avoid this hotel at all costs: noise and internet censorship. 

Noise: The Hotel seems to have no soundproofing at all. I awoke twice during the night to loud revelers from nearby Pubs who sounded asif they were right next to my bed. Unless you are a very heavy sleeper, not an establishment I would recommend.

Internet Censorship: I work n the Wine and Spirits Industry  and Brooks Web Administrator has blocked access to sites relating to wine and spirits (and perhaps a variety of other ""sins""?). This blocked access to my company and all other industry sites I normally use at significant inconvienience to me. Attempts to fix the situation with the Hotel manager yielded nothing. I understand that many businesses block access to certain sites for their employees and that is their business, however I have never experienced this as a Hotel Guest and found it both a major inconvienience and a totally unacceptable intrusion on my personal rights.",3,2009,10,09
236,"Great hotel, great location!","We found this hotel on-line and booked because of location and previous reviews. More than lived up to our expections. We used it for the last two nights in Dublin after driving around Ireland for a week with frienids. This quiet, elegant hotel is near all the Dublin sights. As planned, we turned in our car and walked to everything. The friendly front desk staff were was very helpful. There is a cozy resiident's lounge (library) in the basement with two Internet stations. Thohgh we didn't use them, the on-site bar and restaurant looked very nice. The express caoch to the airlport is an easy couple of blocks away. We would defintely use the Brooks Hotel on a return visit.",4,2009,10,09
236,Wonderful service,"The staff of the Brooks Hotel were wonderful!  Upon early arrival, we were served lovely tea and coffee while waiting for our room and offered suggestions about planning our day.  The rooms have high quality linens and pillows and nice touches throughout.  We received great recommendations from the staff for dining, sites, and even where to find the best selection of Irish whiskey's by small producers.  I would highly recommend it.",5,2009,10,08
236,Excellent hotel to be in Dublin,"We had our annual girl's trip and this year's destination is Dublin. I chose this hotel because of the pleasant reviews. True enough, it was indeed an ideal hotel inside the sentrum of Dublin. The staff were helpful and jolly. Thanks to Gerrard, Marvin and our half french-half dubliner man in the hotel's restaurant. It was close to Grafton street which is impt for us - shopping area. The hotel was close by the castle, Christ Church Cathedral, St. Patrick Cathedral and even in the areas of Henry st.  Probably it's a bit far for those who hate to walk but it was just fine for us. The hotel's room was clean and the area was safe for women going home late at night. It was close to pubs and restaurants but not that close that you can hear the party people. It was good value for money.",5,2009,10,07
236,Wonderful Hotel Close to Trinity College and Grafton Street,"I checked into the Brooks on September 25th and stayed for 2 nights.  As soon as I arrived to the hotel, the woman at the concierge, I believe her name was Lisa, was extremely warm in her greeting, and dropped everything to see about getting me a room when I arrived at 9:30am!  After a long international flight, it was much appreciated to be accommodated into my room so early in the morning.  Once I got into my room, I was even more elated.  The room was gorgeous, immaculate and very nicely decorated.  The bathroom was spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in.  I definitely recommend this hotel to any traveler and I hope to be back myself sometime in the near future!",5,2009,10,06
236,The best hotel I've stayed at in Dublin,"This is not an amazingly luxurious hotel but it is friendly, very clean, comfortable and in a really superb location. Dublin hotels in general, in my opinion, are overpriced and generally disappointing- I've visited Dublin many times and stayed in around 10 different hotels as I've yet to find a really good one. This is probably the best I've stayed in yet. though I've stayed in a few which were much more expensive this was probably the best value in terms of room quality and overall experience.
Pros- Great location. 5 mins walk to Temple Bar, 5 mins walk to Grafton St, 2 mins walk to St Stephen's Green. Lots of funky, independant shops and cafes in the surrounding area.
- spacious very clean room
- very friendly and professional staff
Cons-
Standard rooms are a bit dated and a wee bit scruffy( chipped paintwork, scuffed wallpaper in places) . I would pay for a room upgrade next time.
- our room at the front of the building was pretty noisy until  after 2 am- not good for light sleepers! Also sound insulation from next door rooms and upstairs wasn't great.
All in all I would return but I'd try the executive room and insist on a room at the back.",4,2009,10,02
236,WARM WELCOME TO IRELAND,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for the first two days of our trip to Ireland.  What a wonderful, warm welcome we received!  Conor, the Concierge, is a treasure - providing a general layout of the city, excellent rcommendations for touring, eating and shopping!  Our room was beautifully appointed and spotless.  We loved the ""Pillow Menu"".  Breakfast, dinner and bar staff could not have been more efficient or friendly. We enjoyed an exquisite dinner in the hotel restaurant with flawless service. We loved the Brooks Hotel - would recommend it to anyone and hope to return one day.",5,2009,09,28
236,This hotel is well located.,"This hotel is well located to visit Dublin.  The room we had was clean, quiet and quite nice.  I wish it had had more storage (drawers, etc.).   Our room included breakfast.  We had a little trouble communicating with the multicultural wait staff but the food was very good.  The concierge, Conor O'Connell was a special treat; very friendly and most willing to suggest attractions, places to eat and the like.",4,2009,09,27
236,Fabulous hotel in great location,"Hotel is well placed with everything in easy walking distance. Small, stylish, very comfortable boutique hotel with fantastic service from everybody. The staff all worked well together and were always pleasant, helpful and attentive. Room was very well appointed and extremely comfortable, loved the pillow menu and White Company toiletries! Breakfast was also of a very high standard.
Really enjoyed it and would return.",5,2009,09,27
236,Have seen the rest. But stayed at the best!,"Brooks stands head and shoulders above the rest. Location is perfect (though we did get lost once),  the rooms, the restaraunt the staff were world class. we were on first name terms from the moment we stepped through the front door. The concierge were fantastic.  

I have been to others in Dublin and I would only go back to the brooks.

If you are travelling to Dublin do your self a favour, book the brooks!",5,2009,09,24
236,Superb boutique hotel - no faults,"Only one bad thing about this hotel:  unimposing entrance because it is in a side street opposite a car park.  However, this has 2 advantages: (1) if you want to park your car;  (2) it is quiet at night as there are no pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants on this stretch of road.  Conor the Concierge probably came straight out of Hotel Babylon - he couldn't be more caring or helpful in a friendly, not patronising, way.  All the staff were first class. Fresh fruit to welcome you at Reception.  Breakfast superb.  There's a welcoming ""Residents' Lounge"" in the basement. Bedooms and bathrooms very clean.  Beds very comfortable with a pillow menu.",5,2009,09,24
236,Nice Place in Great Location,"A very helpful and polite staff make this a stand out hotel.  The rooms themselves are well furnished, though a bit dated and small.  It was also quiet and had a very effective climate control system.",5,2009,09,22
236,Perfect!,"The absolut best location in Dublin. You can get by foot everywhere in a few minutes. Shopping, theatre, sights...but it is not noisy like most of the hotels there. Very nice and helpful stuff. Nice and clean hotel, did not try the breakfast, but it looked good...
There are a lot of cafès in the vicinity where you can get a good breakfast.
Room and bathroom are not small, for a city hotel rather quite big, very clean and well equipped. Price and value ratio very good. Not cheap, but worth the money. 
Dublin is great for shopping and eating out.",5,2009,09,21
236,Excellent hotel in the Grafton Street Area,"We were a group of 14 staying in this hotel for 4 nights. From our inital contact via e-mail and until we departed, the staff were welcoming, accomodating, professional and very friendly. The rooms are really nice with comfortable beds, fine bathrooms and a high standard of cleanliness. The breakfast is wonderful. There's no noise from other rooms nor from the street. The hotel is very central to the Grafton Street Area which is the nicest area in Dublin. Our next time in Dublin we will definetely stay in this hotel again, and if you like small luxury hotels yourself, you should too.",5,2009,09,21
236,Great Service!  Wonderful Staff!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in May with our kids (5,7 years old).  We were told via email that we could have an adjoining room.  Upon arrival, it was booked but available on our 2nd night.   While we were frustrated by the error,  the staff was incredibly apologetic.  They put us in rooms next to each other and the kids actually did just fine. They offered to have a staff member walk the hallway a bit more frequently at night.   They sent a bowl of fruit to our room with an apologetic note and moved our luggage the next day.  It was impossible to remain upset because they were so genuinely trying to be helpful.  The  staff was also great with recommdations and always friendly and warm.  Breakfast was good.  The rooms were nice, especially the adjoining room which I believe is an upgrade from the standard room.  Big difference.  If you are traveling with children, just understand that there is only one adjoining room in the hotel and apparently books quickly.  Also not a lot of channel choices on the tv (which is unfortunate because nights tend to end earlier with kids).  Great location.  Well located to all of the sites yet on a quiet street.  We were able to walk virtually everywhere.",5,2009,09,15
236,Sensational!,"We had no idea where to stay in Dublin and relied on Trip Advisor and a few other sources.  The Brooks Hotel proved to be perfect for our stay.  The room was delightful with all of the amenities we could have wanted.  The location is sensational, an easy walk to the tourist center for catching a hop on-hop off bus, the Temple Bar area or Grafton St.",5,2009,09,15
236,loved our stay,We stayed for three nights in August in this hotel and would love to stay there again.  The hotel location is great and the rooms were comfortable.  The sitting room in the lower level with newspapers and computers was a plus for us.  The breakfast was expensive but the quality was excellent.  I would highly recommend this hotel!,5,2009,09,08
236,This is one of the best hotels I have used in Dublin,"Stayed here for one night on a theatre break, tickets sorted by the hotel.  Excellent value, good service and great room.  Parking was directly across the street in a municipal car park, hotel gave a special price voucher for this.  One of my delights was a mirror which did not steam up after showering, i only ever found this in top hotels, not boutique ones.  I will definitely be back.",5,2009,09,05
236,All good as per most reviews here..,"Stayed for two nights in this great hotel. Near to Temple bar and it's shopping/nightlife and 10 minutes walk to centre of Dublin.
Rooms clean and comfy with a little street noise but not alarming.
Bar and restuarant good with very helpfull european staff.
Would stay again.",4,2009,09,04
236,where in the world is Brooks Hotel?,"We stayed there two nights in September 09.  Major difficulty we had was finding the Brooks Hotel, picture letter H. Hauling luggage while searching for hotel stressful even with directions given by hotel. Fine if you are taxi takers but not fun walking about late at night in the rain. Not accessible to public transportation. There are alot of  hotels with better locations for the price. The room we stayed in was on the top floor. Large by EU standards with nice but small bathroom. The business center is in an alcove off the very nice library.",3,2009,09,04
236,Great little hotel,Nice location. Great shopping & restaurants nearby. Friendly staff.,4,2009,08,29
236,"Great location and staff, decent room","Great hotel location-wise and the staff was extremely helpful. They allowed us to check in early (around 10 a.m.) at no extra cost, and concierge Connor was friendly and informative about what sights to see (not only in Dublin but throughout the country).

The room was small by American standards but comfortable and mostly clean (windowsills were dusty but the important things--bathroom and bed--looked clean). There's not much of a view (ours was of the parking garage across the street), and our second night, a Saturday, was a bit rough due to the street noise. 

We didn't use the gym or eat in the restaurant, but we did make use of the business center, which was well equipped and a nice convenience. 

Overall our stay was enjoyable and I'd certainly recommend the Brooks.",4,2009,08,29
236,"The hotel is just ok, but the staff was wonderful!","Our rooms were very small.  I guess we had standard rooms, but I think they were very average and the bathroom was not the cleanest.  I thought the price was a bit high considering the rooms.  The elevators are tiny and you couldn't fit more than 2 people plus their luggage. We only planned to stay one night, which was enough.  The best part of this hotel is the staff.  They were extremely friendly.  We had high hopes for this hotel, but they fell short.",3,2009,08,27
236,very central hotel with top class staff,"We had a great stay at the Brooks Hotel. The staff were all so friendly and went out of their way to help.  We arrived at 10am and a room was ready for us. A nice note welcomed us with 2 chocolate muffins. The bed was just so big and very comfortable The  breakfast was just great with a very wide choice. The hotel is just round the corner from St Stephens Green and the main shopping of Graffton Street. Also not far to walk to Temple Bar, infact it was just a great location  would stay there again.",5,2009,08,24
236,Excellent Choice in Dublin!,"The Brooks hotel is located in an excellent neighborhood in Dublin! The area has lots of shopping, pubs and restaurants but the hotel itself is located on a quiet street (a huge plus!). The staff was very helpful and informative. Comfortable bed and nice room. Excellent breakfast included in the room rate... full buffet and cooked breakfast to order. I would definately stay there again!",5,2009,08,22
236,"Hidden,  but with everything you'll need.","Located a bit off a side street, it is close to everything you would want in Dublin (shopping, site seeing and Temple Bar).  The rooms were a bit small, but well-furnished and comfortable.  The staff was accomodating and very knowledgable about the area.  Wi-Fi worked great and they have a room downstairs for quiet time:  reading, chess and two computers w/ internet access and printer.  The only complaints would be the bathroom door would not stay open - it naturally swung shut and I could not find a way to keep it open.  Also, don't try to check in early.  It was a 35 euro charge.",4,2009,08,17
236,"Brooks, Best Boutique Hotel in DUB","For our first 4 days in Ireland, we were welcomed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin.  The rooms were cozy, with first class linens and modern, marble bathrooms.  The excellent central location made walking throughout the city easy.  The staff more than took care of our every need.  Our booking through Expedia made this hotel a real value ($144/night) although when we wanted to shorten our stay Expedia was not accomodating.  The hotel did all they could do to ensure that we were satisfied.  We highly recommend this beautiful gem.",5,2009,08,10
236,Very good,"Lovely hotel, well located for the city centre.  Fantastic breakfast.  We had a twin room, and the beds were huge.",4,2009,08,08
236,"Nice hotel, good location","Stayed here for a weekend away in a deluxe room. The room was very nice and quite spacious, I believe the standard rooms are the old ""frilly"" style while the deluxe rooms are the refurbished and more ""boutique"" looking rooms. Our was indeed very nice. The location is perfect with everything of interest on your doorstep including a huge range of restaurants. Note that Dublin is very, very expensive... The front desk staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. The only negative during our stay was the breakfast. Some staff were rather snotty and there were clearly some issues going on amongst the staff and they seemed to argue between them who was supposed to serve which table and our coooked breakfast ended up sitting on the counter for a long time until somebody finally decided that it was their job to serve it to us, by then of course it had gone cold. On top of that the breakfast itself was not very inspiring anyway. Other than that we very much enjoyed out stay.",4,2009,08,06
236,PERFECT,Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for one night in July 09.  We were greeted by the friendliest staff.  We wanted to watch the State of Origin and they went out of their way in ringing places to see if they were showing the game ... very impressed!  The room was extremely clean & comfortable and the pillows are exceptional!  It is situated in a handy location and within close proximity to the Gaiety Theatre. Highly recommend this Hotel.,5,2009,08,01
236,Very Satisfied with our Stay,"We stayed at the Brooks for a week in July and can't complain about a thing.  I booked the room back in February with Lisa and she was very helpful.  I was very specific about the rooms I wanted and she got it perfect.  We found both rooms to be spacious and clean and were able to make ourselves at home for 7 nights.  Beds were comfortable and if you didn't like the pillows they supplied, you had your choice of others you could order from the pillow menu.  The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant and made sure they always greeted you with a smile in addition to keeping you well stocked with amenities.

The front desk staff and concierge staff were friendly, helpful and somehow always remembered your name (I wish I had that talent).  A special mention for Conor, the friendly, chatty, lovely Irish gentleman that you imagine you will encounter when traveling to Ireland.  Breakfast was good and the restaurant was run to perfection in the morning - when you needed something, you got it immediately.  Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the gentlemen who seemed to be in charge of breakfast most mornings but he made sure everything ran smoothly.  We made a habit of having a Guinness in the bar area each evening before going to dinner and were always happy with the service there.

As is mentioned in other reviews, the location is perfect to get to Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, the fabulous Tourist Center on Suffolk St., and many, many pubs and restaurants.  There is also a Dunne's (grocery store) around the corner if you want to keep a few snacks (or a bottle of wine) in the room.  The hotel itself is on a street across from an office building and parking garage so you're not getting great views, but it is quiet and we felt safe coming back to the hotel at night.

I booked this hotel because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and I do have to say, they got it right.  I was not disappointed one bit.  Although, I do agree with ""Ksdbt"" below regarding the bathroom doors that won't stay open.  I think they just need new door stops.  I'm sure if I would have asked for one, I would have gotten it, but it was such a minor flaw that I didn't bother.

Overall, a great experience and would not hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2009,07,30
236,"Excellent front of house staff, location etc.","We booked a 3night stay with lastminute.com for our wedding anniversary last weekend.  Greated at reception by Conor, the title concierge doesn't do him justice, what a great guy and asset to Brooks.  Room was great - although noisy as it was at the front of the hotel and I'm sure if we'd asked to be moved it wouldnt have been a problem.  As it turned out we only stayed one night due to a family emergency back home - Claire on reception and again Conor were amazing with their advice and support in sorting out last minute flights and working out what to do with our theatre tickets.  
The only downside was the general manager who could have chosen to reduce their bill to lastminute to reflect a reduced stay (totally at their discretion to do this), which lastminute could then have honoured to us through a refund.  The manager refused to do this but offered a complementary upgrade and breakfast if we visit again - not quite the same.  
Exemplary front of house service and hotel, Conor said he liked people to arrive as guests and leave as friends which is certainly how we felt from our short visit - it's a shame that same wonderful Irish hospitality and warmth isn't shown by the management.",5,2009,07,22
236,Absolutely perfect,"Just got back from an overnight stay in Brooks hotel and felt I needed to write a review straight away. The hotel is a beautiful place to stay. It was our first wedding anniversary and while checking in we were asked was it a special occasion and we told them. We got there too early for our room to be ready so they took our bags and we went shopping. On arrival back to the hotel, they upgraded us to a deluxe room, a fantastic room and a very comfortable bed! They also left us a lovely note and two little cream cakes for our anniversary. It really made our day special. I felt the customer service is one of the best I've ever experienced and I'll definitely go back. We went out for dinner but came back to the hotel to the bar which was nice and cosy and a very friendly barman made us some delicious cocktails. I'm originally from Dublin and I know it well and the location of the hotel is the best you will find. A fabulous hotel in a perfect location!",5,2009,07,20
236,"Nice hotel, great location","We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor recommendations and we were very pleased with the hotel.  
The location is great, it is right in the heart of the city centre, there is a fantastic pub on the corner and you are very close to some great places to eat and in a great location to explore the city.
The staff that we met were all very pleasant and accomodating, and were able to help us out with everything we needed.
The hotel is very clean, but the rooms were small.  As a result, I would say that if you need somewhere very central as a base to explore the city then it is ideal, if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room, you may want to confirm a larger room than we had or look elsewhere.",4,2009,07,15
236,Hidden gem!,"Very happy with this hotel! Hidden gem in the city. Short walk to shopping and resturants. We were able to check in early which was wonderful after an overnight flight. Actually stayed  2 nights the beginning of our trip, and the last night after our tour of Ireland. They had a special treat in the room for us the last night which was a pleasant surprise.  Breakfast was very good. Helpful and friendly staff.  Would stay here again !",5,2009,07,14
236,Nicer lobby/restaurant than rooms,"We stayed one night at Brooks hotel upon our arrival, and one night before we left Ireland.  The staff was excellent, and the lobby and restaurant are very modern and beautiful.  Unfortunately we didn't find our rooms to be as nice as the downstairs, although they were fine. I found the beds to be very hard, and the decor in the rooms is pretty unattractive, especially compared to the beautiful, modern lobby.  However, the rooms are spacious, and the bathrooms were excellent with a great shower.  Our second room was not nearly as nice as the first, though - the bathroom actually smelled like smoke, the bathroom door wouldn't stay open, and the window was broken and kept coming off the frame - it even opened by itself in the middle of the night, even though it was locked.  Also, on our last night we could not get internet in our room, either wireless or through the ethernet connection.  I think the hotel is slightly overrated on tripadvisor.
The location was pretty good - it was nice to be on a quiet side street, although it was hard for us to find at first.  It was certainly an easy walk to Grafton Street and a little further to Trinity College.  We enjoyed our meals at Pig's Ear near Trinity College and at Mao's on Chatham Street just around the corner.",3,2009,07,07
236,Sent my parents to stay,"I reserved this hotel for my parents for a weekend in Dublin before a larger tour of the country. As it was their first visit, I aimed for a place with excellent location that wasn't too impersonal. I chose well! From the moment I made the reservation to the day they left Ireland, the Brooks hotel staff were wonderful. My father and I  wrote the manager separately with different questions and requests, which were answered promptly and affably. My parents raved about the friendly and helpful customer service the hotel gave, inlduing holding onto some of their luggage while they were on tour until they returned to Dublin (wherein they were staying elsewhere!). The three of us couldn't be more pleased.",5,2009,07,07
236,Okay hotel but wouldn't stay there again,"We stayed two nights in this hotel last week with our two children.
I will say the location is very good.  
My problem lies with the room and bad service.
The room was very small even though we had paid for a larger room to accommodate our two children.   
Our room also had a water leak so that when the shower was used, the carpet on the other side of the wall would become soaked.  
If it were only these two problems I could still recommend this hotel. 
My biggest complaint is with the service.
We were sitting in the lounge/bar area one evening having some food.  The bar had maybe a dozen people and was fairly noisy.  The attached lounge area had only us and the attached restaurant area had one couple.  Our 3 yo was talking and laughing with us and a person (I presumed to be the manager) came up to him and asked him to be quiet because people were eating.  
Mind you the noise coming from the bar was much louder and I don't even think the one couple in the restaurant even complained.  This person just took it upon himself to say something like this not to my wife or myself, but directly to my 3yo.
I decided it wasn't worth the confrontation but we immediately left the lounge and no longer ate in the hotel.",2,2009,07,06
236,Great Location - Friendly Staff,"This hotel was very well situated within walking distance of all the sights we wanted to see in Dublin.  The hotel and conceirge staff were extremely helpful in giving us an overview of the error and suggesting a day trip outside the city.

The one drawback is the street noise before the pubs close.  We were situated on the first floor and were moved to a quieter room (at the back of the hotel) on request.  However, there was still some noise from the street.",4,2009,07,05
236,Great City Centre Hotel & Nice Friendly Staff!!,"Stayed here for 1 night when I was in Dublin at a concert. The staff are amazing & so friendly & helpful. The breakfast as lovely too, great selection & I love the fact they cook your breakfast to order. The only bad points were the hairdryer in my room only blew cold air and the remote control didn't work, but overall I was happy & would come back again.",4,2009,07,02
236,comfort and accomodating,"Wonderful place to stay!! Centrally located, staff was wonderful and accomodating. If you are like me and want to bring a curling iron to do your hair, DON'T BRING ONE WITH AN AUTOMATIC TURN OFF!! Even with the electrial converters the curling iron turned off. The hotel even gave me one of their converters to try but it didn't work. No hairdo the entire trip:)  Everything we wanted to see was located within walking distance. Rooms wonderful, did not eat in attached dining area. Did hear traffic sounds and people during night but staff would have moved us if requested.",5,2009,07,01
236,One of the Better in Dublin,"This is the fifth different hotel I've stayed in Dublin and I have also visited or 'scoped out' almost every hotel in Dublin (city centre anyway).  For the money, it's one of the better in Dublin.  Location is great, not too loud and the rooms are good sized, well equipped and the public areas are quite nice.   All wireless internet worked great (which in Ireland can be a challenge).  Service was good - didn't eat at restaurant or bar because there are so many great spots so close.  I'll likely stay here again - would do so for pleasure or business.",5,2009,06,28
236,A Very Friendly Hotel,"My wife and I stay here for four nights in May and I have to say that the staff must the friendliest hotel staff that I have ever had the pleasure of encountering.  The Concierge, Conner, is the epitome of Irish charm and humour.  The hotel has a novel feature of a “pillow menu” to suit your sleeping tastes.  The hotel is ideally suited for the sights, sounds and shops of Dublin.  The restaurant is outstanding; as previous reviews have noted the breakfast is fantastic and eating in the restaurant of an evening did not disappoint.  Would use this hotel again, but with the Pound / Euro rates at the moment it will not be sometime soon unfortunately.",5,2009,06,26
236,Highly recommended,"Great place to stay - very clean, comfortable, great breakfast and very well located.  Not great views - but you go to the Guiness Storehouse for those!  We stayed in the classic double - spacious and very comfortable. Absolutely no complaints!",5,2009,06,26
236,Comfortable and friendly,"It had everything I wanted in a hotel: extremely comfortable bed, quiet and clean room, central location, staff who were very helpful, friendly and accomodating, basic amenities (shampoo, soap, lotion, Q-tips provided as well as a coffee maker and hair dryer), plenty of wall outlets. The unexpected perks were free wi-fi, a business center where you could print for free, the option to order a ""foot spa"" to your room, a ""pillow menu"" to accomodate allergies or sleep needs, turn down service, currency exchange at front desk, converter plug available. The only negative is that the towels were not super fluffy and they charge you to ""rent the line"" per call even if you are using a calling card. Be sure to check to see if the cleaning staff left your window before sleeping so that you can avoid any street noise. Overall, I was very happy with my stay and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2009,06,24
236,"Great location, friendly service, clean rooms","Four of us stayed here mid-week for 1 night and wished we could have stayed longer. The location is perfect for Dublin sightseeing. It's right in the center of city: 2 blocks from Grafton Street and a 'hop on hop off' bus stop.
As soon as we entered the hotel, we were greeted by a warm staff that was ready to answer any questions we had. The rooms were clean and available (hours before the slated check-in time) and the turn down service was great. 
Would def. stay here again and recommend.",5,2009,06,23
236,fantastic service great location,"First time to stay in Brooks hotel and can absolutely recommend it. We were in dublin for the Neil Young concert and just wanted a central hotel, It also happened to be our wedding anniversary. The service was fantastic, we were greeted with anniversary good wishes, recieved a complimentary upgrade to our room and also had some fruit delivered up. All the staff were so friendly ,nothing was too much trouble. The location is very convient for grafton street for shopping and some great restaurants etc. Car parking is just acroos the road.(there is a charge for this). The next time I'm in Dublin I will certainly stay in Brooks.",5,2009,06,22
236,Excellent as always,"Stayed in Brooks Hotel for one night while trying to escape from our home village of Slane on the weekend of the Oasis concert. 
This hotel has it all. Excellent rooms and facilities, very professional and friendly staff with no exceptions, delicious food, and a location that cannot be faulted- two minute walk from Grafton Street, and just around the corner from the Gaiety Theatre.
This is our favourite hotel in Dublin and we will be recommending it to any relatives and friends travelling from overseas.",5,2009,06,22
236,good choice of hotel in dublin,from conner's greeting to his goodbye upon check-out...  great choice.,4,2009,06,19
236,Loved this place,"Great location, friendly staff, lovely bar, excellent decor. You'll love it!",5,2009,06,09
236,Perfect Location,"Amazing location, can walk everywhere important from here! Hotel was very nice, staff was amazing and super helpful! Very nice that they exchange currency in hotel, even have a turndown service in PM...only downside was dinner in restaurant was disappointing and expensive, but many other places to eat within walking distance.",5,2009,06,03
236,Fantastic value for a luxury hotel with great service,We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 2 nights which turned out to be lovely.  A great location with easy access to the Hop-on/Hop-off bus.  Also easy walking distance to Temple Bar but on a quieter street.  It would also be great for business travelers.,4,2009,06,02
236,"Excellent Location, Extremely Helpful Staff","My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin for the first 2 nights of our vacation and I would recommend it as it's in an excellent location.  It's not easy to find, especially if you're driving in a car but there's a parking garage right across the street, once you find it.  While the decor in our room was a little over the top with a purple and yellow design, the room was very comfortable and clean.  The bathroom was modern and well lit.  Ladies, take your own hair dryer if you stay here as the one in the room is one of those typical European wall mounted dryers that looks like a vaccuum cleaner and has no power.  If there's one thing that really stood out about this hotel, it was the service.  Colin, the Concierge, is one of the nicest people I've ever met and was extremely helpful.   He remembered our names every time we saw him.  When we decided to make some changes to our plans for the week, Clare (front desk) graciously called 3 of the other hotels on our itinerary to help us change the dates.  We would definitely stay here again.",4,2009,05,31
236,Good hotel in the heart of Dublin,"There are several reasons why the Brooks is a good choice of hotel for visitors to Dublin.
1. The location. It is situated within walking distance of most of the attractions of Dublin - 15mins to the musems and galeries to the east and about 10 minutes to Dublin castle and the catherdrals to the west. Shopping centre and eating places nearby. We found getting there from the airport very easy using the aircoach - 12 euros return and about a 5min walk from the bus stop by Trinity College.
2. The service. Staff very friendly and keen to help make your stay enjoyable.
3. The hotel itself. Our bedroom was a good size and had everyting we needed.
It is fair to say that Brooks is not the cheapest place to stay but you will not I think be able to fault their commitment to customer service.",5,2009,05,28
236,"Great place, great location, helpful staff","This is the place if you want a quiet spot right in the city. This hotel is very close to Temple Bar, Christ Church Cathedral, and St Stephen's Green. Staff were very friendly; great breakfast. Good solid place.",4,2009,05,28
236,Nearly first class hotel in a great location.,"I booked the Brooks Hotel in hopes of pampering myself during the last leg of a long journey.  I was not disappointed.  The hotel is in a fantastic location in Dublin.  It is close to many interesting little shops with unique items, particularly clothing and jewelry.  It is within easy walking distance of Temple Bar, the Castle, Stephen's Green, the Liffey, and most anything else.  The staff was quick to solve any problems that I encountered (internet connection is iffy in some rooms and they moved me), friendly and very professional.  The hotel clearly aspires to excellence.",5,2009,05,26
236,Outstanding experience for a hotel stay,"We stayed at Brooks Hotel for 2 nights after 9 nights in B&Bs through out Ireland.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect trip.  As mentioned in the other reviews the staff was terrific and so helpful.  The room was very clean and had all the right extra touches, like coffee and tea service, flat screen TV, safe, great toiletries, etc.  The turn down service was much appreciated each night with a different surprise each time.  I would highly recommend this hotel for the staff, cleanliness, food and location.  I hope to stay here again.",5,2009,05,25
236,Wonderful hotel and location,"Just stayed one night in Brooks hotel but I will certinly be there again (I hope). We live just outside Dublin but decided we would stay in town for one night following a night out. we decided to stay in Brooks because it gets such good reviews and also for the location. Neither could be faulted. The staff are exceptional. Friendly, curteous and effeicient. They could not do enough and made the experience special. The turn down service is a lovely touch. The breakfast was great with a good choice. I prefer continental style while my husband prefers Irish but both were well catered for. The room was lovely and spotless. All in all a great hotel in a teriffic location. Stay there if you are in Dublin!!",5,2009,05,20
236,"If I ever return to Dublin, I would stay at the Brooks Hotel.","If you want to stay in the heart of Dublin near the shops and sites, you should definately consider the Brooks Hotel.  Not quite a five star, but the service was top notch, the rooms were incredibly clean, and the location couldn't be better.  I liked it so much that I also stayed at their affiliate during my stay in Galway (which wasn't as nice as the Brooks).",5,2009,05,17
236,"Great hotel, but a little pricey... traveling with young children.","The hotel was nice, but a little over priced. Service was incredible. We arrived in Dublin with 2 small children and were immediately allowed to check in (any parent will grateful for this accommodation). Then we needed a roll away bed, which was brought up to us in 5 min. The hotel is centrally located to just about everything you may want to visit. Since breakfast was included in the price, it may make the hotel worth staying in. However, our first day we had to pay for breakfast and it totaled 75 euros (which is ridiculous since my children are 4 & 5). However, the hotel will bring breakfast to your room for 3 euros, definitely a plus!! 

I wouldn't advise eating at the hotel unless you have to: exhausted from traveling or can't get out. The food is very over priced as explained above. If you are traveling with young children, I advise eating in the room, as the atmosphere in the hotel is a little stuffy. The staff is friendly enough, however we got some looks from various hotel stayers and one women opted not to take the elevator with us and wait for the next one.",4,2009,05,08
236,Great Location but room was small and noisy,"I stayed in this hotel for the May Bank Holiday weekend.  The hotel has a superb location, 2 minutes from Grafton Street and right in the city centre.

Staff were warm, hospitable and friendly and went out of their way to make you feel at home.  Though quite pricey, many rooms do include what can only be described as the most extensive and delicious buffet and table-service breakfast I have ever eaten.

The twin room itself was disappointingly small and less than I expected. We were also located at the front of the hotel which proved quite noisy on both Friday & Saturday night until the early hours of the morning.

Overall an excellent choice for a weekend  break and is worth it for the breakfast alone! However I recommend you request a room at the back of the hotel.",4,2009,05,03
236,Has it all - Great Location and Excellent Service,"We just returned from 2 weeks in Ireland beginning and ending in Dublin at the Brooks Hotel.  It made for a perfect start - the staff is very welcoming and the room, though a bit small, is lovely and comfortable with lots of storage.  The decor is traditional with a lovely modern bath with all upscale ammenities (could use new hair dryers in bath).  There is a common living room below the first floor for hotel guest to read quietly, enjoy a cup of tea, or access the internet.  The bar just off the lobby is very welcoming, as well.  The breakfast was the best we had in Ireland - lovely cold buffet and good choices of cooked to order items including porridge with whiskey sauce (yum).  The various conceirge staff were more than accommodating  and sought out the guests to offer maps or other suggestions about the city.  The location is fantastic - you can literally walk to all the sites, shopping, parks, and nightlife or get on one of the Hop-On, Hop-Off buses for an inexpensive tour of the city (I'd recommend the Green buses).  Lots of good bar food nearby (try the Hairy Lemon), as well as bistros and an upscale hamburger restaurant.",5,2009,05,01
236,great location and great staff,Just back from a weekend at Brooks Hotel. We really enjoyed it. The staff were all helpful and friendly. The location is great and we weren't disturbed by any noise even though we had a room at the front of the hotel - other than a car alarm which went on for ages in the early hours!,4,2009,04,27
236,This place is a real gem.,I have stayed in Brooks Hotel before (over a year ago) and I have to say it is without a doubt one of the best hotels in Dublin.  The staff are excellent in every way.  The Front Desk staff greeted me with a warm and friendly 'Welcome Back' even though I only stayed here once and it was over a year ago.  On arrival to my room there was a personal hand written note from the Manager welcoming me back with a small plate of home made cookies - to say I was wowed would be an understatement.  The hotel is very centrally located near all the attractions and maps are available for those who don't know Dublin.  There are so many good restaurants in Dublin that you will find it difficult to visit them all.  I went to 'Bentley's' which is Richard Corrigan's new restaurant in Dublin which was very good. The breakfast in Brooks is superb with amazing home made jam.  The staff are by far their greatest asset - the friendliness of the place is almost hypnotic - puts you in a good mood to see a hotel getting on with things by putting their best foot forward in the middle of this depressing recession.  Whenever I stay in Dublin again (soon hopefully!) then it will most definitely be in Brooks.,5,2009,04,27
236,Great Central Location,"My husband and I spent two nights in this hotel.  We arrived early and were pleased that our room was available and we were checked in right away.  The desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.  The room itself was on the smaller side, but it was tastefully decorated.  One of the first things I noticed was the pillow menu!  I won't ruin the surprise for those reading the review, I'll just say it is a wonderful amenity!  We were within walking distance of the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus tour stops, Trinity College and Temple Bar area.  The evenings were noisy, as our room faced a parking garage and there were revelers on the street most of the night, but I suppose that is to be expected in the city centre.  The concierge was wonderful - he gave us a lot of great tips and advice - and remembered our names everytime he saw us!  The only negative is that we had a few holes in our sheets and some mold in the shower area - which I would not expect from a 4 star hotel.  All in all, though, all of the little touches added up to a nice stay.",4,2009,04,24
236,Excellent Hotel in good location,"Having just returned from a short break at Brooks, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere comfortable and welcoming to stay in central Dublin.  The staff were, without exception, excellent.  Nothing was too much trouble and my room was comfortable and the housekeeping excellent.  A nice touch is that breakfast is cooked to order and not left on the usual buffet.  I also had an excellent evening meal in the restaurant.",5,2009,04,22
236,One of the best hotels,My husband and I stayed here for one night as we were going to a concert at the O2.The car park is directly across the road from the hotel and very reasonable. The hotel is very comfortable and the food is  really good.The early bird menu is great as is the breakfast. The real gem about this hotel other than location and the aforementioned is the STAFF. We stay in hotels frequently and We are going to another Concert soon and have already booked this hotel. We have stayed in 5star hotels but there is something warm about this hotel that makes it stand apart from others.A gem,5,2009,04,21
236,An excellent choice for Dublin,"The Brooks Hotel was a great base for my recent visit to Dublin.  The staff was helpful, warm and efficient.  I arrived very tired after a redeye flight from the U.S.  The staff first steered me toward their breakfast room, then the lounge, and shortly thereafter had my room ready.  While waiting, I was greeted by the concierge, Conor, who was gracious and welcoming, and who each day composes a very entertaining newletter for the hotel guests.  The room itself was a standard size, traditionally decorated but very clean and comfortable, and with a lovely, live green plant.  Breakfast (included in my rate) provided many options, including that of a full vegetarian Irish breakfast.  Location was perfect, within easy walking distance of Trinity College, Suffolk St., Grafton St., all the smaller shops, restaurants and the tourism center (which incidentally was also very helpful).  The only ""down"" side was the rate, which at any other time I'd consider a reasonable value.  But these days most hotels are offering discounted prices; even the most luxurious hotel in town (I later discovered) was offering a wildly reduced rate not much higher than that at the Brooks.  I'd definitely recommend the Brooks for its comfort, great location and wonderful staff.  But if you're also seeking value, I'd advise asking for ""the recession price"" before booking.",4,2009,04,19
236,Brilliant stay at Brooks Hotel,"Just back from 3 nights in Brooks hotel and I can honestly say it was one of the best hotels that I've stayed in. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was extremely comfortable.  
The location was perfect, right in the center and within walking distance for Trinity College, restaurants and pubs.
We ate in the hotel on our first night and the meal was terrific and although there was no children's menu, they asked my 10 year old what he would like and they would make it for him so he was impressed!  Breakfast in the morning was excellent and really set us up for the day.
The rooms were all extremely comfortable with a pillow menu to choose your own style of pillow and a turn-down service and a chocolate left on your pillow at night. 
Children were not allowed in the bar after 7pm, which seemed a bit strange as it was the hotel bar, but there was and open lounge before you go through to the bar where you could sit and have your drink and also downstairs there is a beautiful lounge with books, games and a separate room with internet access.
I cannot emphasise enough how brilliant the staff were and if we are back in Dublin, this is the hotel we would stay in.",5,2009,04,14
236,Happy First Timer In Dublin's City Center,"We just got home from Dublin last night.  We had a wonderful stay at the Brooks Hotel.  Originally we were to stay at the Mercer Hotel but because of travel delays I had to change hotels at the last minute and I’m glad we did.  

The hotel is located on a relatively quiet street and easy to get to Grafton Street, Trinity, Temple Bar, St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin Castle, National Gallery, etc... 

We stayed four nights so we were able to get a good rate.  We took the public bus from the air port (only 1.5 Euros) and walked from O’Connell Street.  Returning to the airport we took the more luxurious Air Bus (7.5 Euros). It is located 5 minutes from the hotel.  A taxi (approx. 35 Euros) might have been nicer but I don’t see how.

We did not eat in the hotel.  There are so many other places to eat that it never made sense to do so.  Our favorit restaurant was ""Jewel and the Crown"" which is an Indian restaurant a few minutes walk from the hotel.  

We took advantage of the computer with internet service on the lower level.  Also, A good place to read and play chess.

My only complaint is that they charged me for the daily paper delivered to the room.  Fool me once... I thought it was complementary.  They never mentioned a charge when we were checking in. That’s what happens when you're sleep deprived and jet lagged.",5,2009,04,09
236,Great place!,"This hotel has it all.  A great location in the heart of Dublin.  A quick walk to Temple Bar (for those interested in that scene).  Also very close to all the sites (Trinity College, Guinness brewery etc.  Note: the castle is pretty weak as far as castles go...).  It is hard to go wrong with this place - it's an upscale, very nice hotel that's very fairly priced.",5,2009,04,07
236,Fantastic from start to finish,"I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin as one of the best hotel experiences I've had my my extensive travels.  

The hotel is conveniently situated in the heart of Dublin surrounded by plenty of shops and restaurants but on a side road what makes it fairly quiet at night.

The hotel building looks pretty average on the outside but on the inside is impecable from head to toe.  Their staff are friendly and attentive and their service is second to none.

The rooms are very spacious and beautifully decorated and so cosy you feel at home.  There are plenty of the small touches that makes you wish you had booked to stay there for longer like, small complimentary chocolates, pillow menu etc.   The bed is incredibly comfortable, I had the best night sleep I've had in a long time.

Their restaurant was excellent as well, they had a fantastic choice of dishes that tasted exquiste and beautifully presented.  Their breakfast selection was just as good as the dinner, an excellent one although not included in the room rate, a bit expensive, in my opinion specially, if you don't eat much in the mornings.

Overall, I was delighted with the Brooks, will recommend it to all my colleagues and anyone visiting Ireland, I'm rarely this enthusiastic about the hotels I visit but this one was fabulous.",5,2009,03,31
236,A little Gem,"This has to be one of the best hotels I've stayed in for customer service.  Every member of staff seemed to love their job and be more than happy to help.  It made what is a regular (but perfectly fine) four star city centre hotel something extra special.

The only thing that slightly spoiled it was the amount of noise from the street outside in late hours of Saturday / early hours of Sunday.  I’ve no idea where it was coming from, but there was loud music and plenty of people around enjoying themselves in the cold night air.  Maybe when they next plan a refit, double or triple glazing would help.  

Though that is only a tiny moan and the more than excellent service from check-in, housekeeping, the bar and extra cheerful concierge more than made up for that.",5,2009,03,30
236,Quite Impressed,"When we arrived at the Brooks on a busy holiday and they could not find our reservation I freaked out a little - but they checked our bags and told us to go and explore the city and by the time we returned it would all be straightened out.  When we returned four hours later after exploring Trinity College and taking a ride on the HopOn HopOff bus we had a fabulous room, bags where delivered, and dinner reservations had been obtained at a local hot spot that was within a five minute walk from the Hotel.  We were quite impressed!  We even had time to walk to the Guinness Brewery for the tour after we got settled!  The only drawback was the parking.  If you are planning on starting or ending your trip to Ireland in Dublin arrange to pick up your car either before or after - you can by parking for about 13 Euro's a day from the hotel - but everything is withing walking sitance and having the car was just an added cost.",5,2009,03,26
236,Fantastic place to stay,"Great rooms, great food, great bar. Connor the concierge was spectacular. Close to all great sightseeing spots. You will love the breakfast.
Tom McKenna",5,2009,03,23
236,5 star service!!!,"My Fiancee booked this hotel as a surprise getaway for my 30th birthday and what a great choice it was. Brooks is hidden away in the back streets of Dublin although this doesn't mean it isn't central, it couldn't be more central. The staff couldn't do any more to help us with our stay, helping with great restaurant choices, etc. Room, although small, was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. All in all we couldn't recommend a stay here more to ensure the best of visits to Dublin",5,2009,03,22
236,"A little pricy, but worth it","Compared to most hotels I stayed in during my visit, this was the most modern ( but also the most expensive ).   The hotel itself is gorgeous, taking a page from some of the comparable boutique hotels in NYC.  The reception has a porter who is very welcoming and helpful, and the rooms are chic and elegant.  The hotel has a fitness center and a bar which stays open during ""special"" late night hours for its guests only!  Its a good hotel to come back to and unwind after a night at the pubs, as its somewhat off the beaten path, but still in the center of things.",5,2009,03,18
236,"Quiet location near Temple Bar, extraordinary staff","We recently stayed at the Brooks Hotel as part of our honeymoon. We were so pleased with our junior suite -- huge, incredibly comfortable bed, desk, large flat screen television, high-pressure shower, bathtub, and television in the wall over the bathtub! The free high speed internet really pleased my husband -- it really is fast! The room was spotless and quiet given its proximity to Temple Bar, however, what really blew us away was the staff who gave us the utmost attention during our stay. We had a bit of trouble with some of the appliances in our room but friendly staff members were very quick and helpful; furthermore, the front desk is extremely knowledgeable about the area and spent ample time telling us where to go / things to do. The restaurant and bar areas are extremely elegant as well. Recommendable.",4,2009,03,11
236,Hidden Gem in the heart of Dublin!,"My husband and I stayed at Brooks Hotel on 11-13 Feb 2009. It is a charming hotel, the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The deluxe room we had was lovely, clean and very well maintained. There was nothing to fault and, in future, 'Brooks' is the only hotel we will be staying in on our return visits to Dublin!",5,2009,02,15
236,Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel. Room was well appointed and comfortable with a massive bed (2 large singles made up as one bed). Fruit bowl in the room was a very nice touch. Nice bathroom with a separate shower and quality fittings/towels/toiletries.

The hotel is well place for sight seeing and shopping - just off Grafton street. Staff are helpful and friendly. The only possible downside was the wifi internet could not be picked up from the room - but this could be just a problem particular to this room.

Would recomend if the budget can stretch  to it. Many places to eat around the area and in walking distance of Temple Bar and Henry Street.",5,2009,02,10
236,Great service and comfort in the heart of Dublin,"This comfortable, quiet hotel provided a peaceful retreat - yet it is right in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Dublin city centre. Trinity college, Grafton St, Temple Bar and the castle are minutes away on foot, as are numerous bars, pubs, restaurants and live music venues.

Our executive double room provided excellent value for money especially as we phoned direct and got a much better rate, including breakfast, than the internet booking site. Our room did not overlook the busy streets therefore it was quiet and peaceful although the view was therefore of a back alley.

The staff were friendly and attentive, we turned up for breakfast 5 minutes before it closed yet were still welcomed in. The breakfast was a delicious buffet style continental and a cooked breakfast menu, all the food was fresh and there was a wide selection.
The hotel also provided us with a left luggage service free of charge on our final day because our flight was not until the evening.",5,2009,02,01
236,Fabulous location lovely staff worth the bit extra,"Brooks is a lovely litlle oasis in the heart of Dublin.  The staff were brilliant, the hotel was clean and neat and the location is spot on if you want to see the sights, do some shopping and eat great food.  We had a wonderful time in Dublin for a couple of days and with the help of the staff at Brooks managed to see and do everything we would have wanted to.  From the first impression where we were greeted by the desk staff and the concierge they were lovely they gave us a map showed us all the things we should do provided us with recommendations for food and drink.  We had one issue with our room that was resolved immediately. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for a short stay in Dublin it is a little bit more expensive but it is totally worth it to minimise your hassle.",5,2009,01,15
236,Wonderful Hotel,"We booked our trip to Ireland through a company who specializes in Ireland travel.  I read about the Brooks here and decided this was where I wanted to stay for Christmas, the beginning of our trip.  However, the travel agency didn't have a contract with the Brooks, and the suggested other places.  I looked them over but finally said if they didn't book us at the Brooks I wouldn't be booking with them, they did, and we had a wonderful time.  The only thing I would have changed was that our room was small--a double and a twin for myself, my husband and our nine year old.  However, everything else was first class.  The food was fresh, delicious, and varied.  The croissants were the best we've ever had, hands down.  The location is perfect for visiting Dublin.  There is a pillow menu, a huge ""screening room"" for movies, turn down service, and a great bar.  I cannot say enough about The Brooks.  We stayed in many different hotels all over central and southern Ireland and this was by far our favorite.  I suggest you don't have a car, however, while staying there. No need, and it will cost you at the car park across the street.",5,2009,01,01
236,Excellent Service,"My parents reserved a night at the Brooks for my husband and I the first night of our honeymoon in Ireland. They heard good things about the hotel and they were right!

The hotel itself is located downtown in Dublin, a few blocks from the river. It was within walking distance of many major sights, including the Guinness Brewery (about a 20 minute walk). Check-in was easy and we had a bell-hop accompany us to our room, even at the late hour we arrived. He was very helpful and friendly and showed us where to find some restaraunts that would still be open. 

The room was pretty, if a little out-dated. They took good care of it and it was very clean. The bed was very large and comfortable. They had put rose petals in the shape of a heart on our bed and set out cookies and sparkling water, compliments of the hotel. The bathroom was clean and modern, with marble flooring and countertops. 

Breakfast was included in the price of the room. We chose continental style (serving scones, cereals, fruit, juices, bread, etc) so I can't say if the hot meal was included, but by the look of the neighboring tables' food, it was hearty and good!

We would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2008,12,25
236,Fantastic location !,"The huge plus point for this hotel are the lovely, friendly staff and excellent location as well as the fabulous bedrooms !  We arrived before checkin time but our room was ready so we were able to go right up.  The room was really lovely, at the back of the hotel not overlooking the street so it was nice and quiet.  The only problem we had was with grumbling pipes in the bathroom when we turned on the tap and it seemed to be the same if anyone else in the vicinity turned on the taps too !  However, it wasnt a major problem and didnt detract from the ambience at all !  The only other little detail was, there were no heated towel rails in the bathroom and in December, it made the room a little chilly !  We eat in the dining room on our first night and also had breakfast both of which were excellent !  The location of the hotel was excellent, just minutes from Grafton Street and we were surrounded by not only little individual shops but all the multiples that abound in every city.  There are lots of lovely eateries adjacent to the hotel if you don't want to dine in but check out the prices, we found Dublin to be quite expensive compared to the UK.  The exchange rate for the euro/pound didnt help.  But ~ all in all an excellent trip in a beautiful hotel !",4,2008,12,10
236,Perfect base in Dublin,"A very nice, clean hotel with an excellent location and a reasonable price for Dublin. Our room on the second floor was facing the street, which during the weekend stay turned out to be quite busy / noisy with local pub traffic. If you manage to reserve a higher floor and/or a room that doesn’t face the street – this hotel is hard to beat.",5,2008,12,07
236,Great Hotel,"We recently got back from a trip to Dublin.  We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for two nights (Tuesday/Wednesday).  The staff was extremely helpful which was great because it was our first trip to Dublin.  The hotel location could not be better.  We walked to Guinness, Trinity College, Temple Bar, Christ Church, and lots of pubs/bars/restaurants.  We received a good deal on the hotel since it was the off-season.  It was definitely worth it.  Can't speak to the hotel restaurant as we didn't eat there - plenty of lower cost options within walking distance.  Would definitely stay at Brooks Hotel again.",5,2008,11,30
236,Amazing customer service is alive at the Brooks,"My wife and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for our final night of our honeymoon.  Thinking that we had seen the best there was to see throughout our tour of Ireland, we were blown away by the level of customer service we had the pleasure of experiencing at the Brooks.  
I can't wait to come back to Dublin to stay at the Brooks again, and I woudn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning on visiting Dublin in the futur. 
Congratulations to the management and staff of the Brooks Hotel, and a number of other hotels show take some notes how customer service should be executed.
Great work!",5,2008,11,20
236,Great Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights, the hotel was lovely, very clean, staff very helpful and friendly, its situated down a quiet street opposite an NCP carpark but you don't hear any noise from it.  Bedrooms were very spacious, clean and you had a choice of pillows.  Bathroom was a good size with a powerful shower.  Breakfast was excellent, a good choice ranging from a cooked breakfast to fruit, cereals, breads, plenty of tea or coffee and toast.  Evening meal was also excellent, food was to a very high standard the only down side was their wasn't much atmosphere in the restaurant even though their was a gentleman playing the piano.....  Hotel is in an excellent location very close to all the sightseeing attractions and the shops.  I would definatley recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2008,11,15
236,Lovely Hotel,"I've just returned from a 2 night stay at the Brooks Hotel. I can agree with all the other good reviews on here. Its in a great location, on a quiet street but in the city centre. The staff were all really helpful. The bar had a lovely relaxed atmosphere so we drank in there on both nights. The restaurant food was lovely and breakfast was perfect. We stayed in a superior room and again, it was lovely.

Overall i can't think of anything i would have changed. We had a great time in Dublin and would definitely stay at the Brooks again.",5,2008,10,13
236,"Great, Centrally Located Hotel","We stayed here for a recent 3 night stay.  We were town for vacation and found this hotel to be in a great location for being near all the key places we wanted to visit.  You can walk almost everywhere from here. 

The hotel itself is great.  We had one of the upgraded rooms and found it to be extremely comfortable and most importantly - clean!  The bed and bathroom were well appointed.  We also asked for a higher floor, therefore we never had any issue with street noise.  

We did not have the breakfast as a part of our rate, but found it easy to find a quick bite close to the hotel.  If you go out of the hotel to the right and then take another right - there is both a Leon and a Munchies that will get you a coffee and a pastry or breakfast sandwich.  We found both to be good.

On the back end of our trip, we stayed at the Westbury.  Though it was nice as well, the staff and price at the Brooks made it a better choice for future trips.",5,2008,10,12
236,Excellent hotel and location,"I spent a four night weekend in this hotel and, along with so many other reviewers, found it to be excellent quality and value.   I stayed in one of their higher quality rooms and found that it met the description well.  Public and private rooms are very well furnished, clean, and staff helpful etc. etc.   

My booking did not include breakfast and as I eat little at that time of day I didn't bother with it: so no experience of that.  

The location is very good: close to so many tourist spots, restaurants, bars etc. but in a fairly quiet street.  

Well worth it for those willing to pay a higher price for a quality experience.",5,2008,10,07
236,Liked it very much,"It´s a nice hotel, with nice details, comfortable  and beautiful. Service is excelent and employees are very nice and friendly.
My room was big and beautiful. The views from the window were really awful, but, as I was working there, I was not in my room with day light, so it was not important for me.
Nice breakfast too, and wonderful location for wandering in Dublin",4,2008,10,03
236,Fantastic Homely Hotel!,"I have stayed in this hotel before but never go around to writing a review until today, where I spent another night there recently.
This Hotel is a credit to the Hotel Industry in Dublin. Its everything that a Hotel should be, it has a true Irish Welcome, very friendly and welcoming staff, a quality product and great food. Their breakfast is the best in Dublin. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my stay at this Hotel and I would definatley recommend it to anyone travelling for business or pleasure. The only thing is that on occasion, its on the expensive side so perhaps they should consider reviewing this a little. I will pay for quality but they are sometimes a little too much for what they offer. Its ideal also as there is a car-park directly across the road from the Hotel which is very very convenient. The location of the Hotel is great too as it is right in the City Centre.",5,2008,10,02
236,"Very nice hotel, but a tad on the pricy side","Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for night as part of our trip to Ireland.  Since we were arriving early morning from our flight from NYC to Dublin, we had contacted the hotel a few days before arriving asking for an early check-in.  We arrived even earlier than expected (9 am) and the hotel was able to accomodate us without any problems, which was a big plus.

The room was a nice sized room with a very comfortable bed and had a large set of windows facing onto Drury street.  Windows opened if you wanted to get in some fresh air.'

The bathroom was a decent size and included a bathtub and a shower stall.  

The hotel is on a quiet street in Dublin, but if you walk a block or two, you will realize that its one of the few quiet blocks around... its a couple of minutes walking to Grafton Street and is pretty central to all.

The staff was very courteous from the moment we walked in and met all our needs, although they couldnt confirm whether or not someone had made a reservation at a restaurant nearby. 

This was a nice hotel and differed from the usual American hotels we stay at.  But for its price ($330 + tax), it was a tad on the high side compared to the other hotels we stayed at in Ireland and in Europe.  Would definitely recommend the Brooks though because it offers alot.",4,2008,09,27
236,Truly comfort,"We stayed for three nights in late september, and found everything nearly perfect. 
The bar personell however was more or less a comedy in their ignorance. They had never heard about sparkling wine, they didn't have a clue about what whiskey they had to offer, and they served lukewarm champagne! 
Compared withe the quality in everything else, I suppose we ran into  apprentices or substitutes. It was more funny than irritating.

236,happy guest,"We have just spent a great weekend in Brookes Hotel, we have spent many weekends in Dublin and this has to have been one of the best ,the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were good with a superking bed ,but the highliight has to be the breakfast a great selection of freshly baked breads, cold buffet or a freshly prepared cooked breakfast. The hotel is in a great location designer shops, a quaint market, Stephens Green Shopping Centre , PowersCourt Shopping Centre all within a stroll away. The hotel restaurant s excellent, but there are loads of other cafes or restaurants all around. Small hotel with alot going for it.",4,2008,09,23
236,Great times,"Just returned from a weekend break in Dublin to celebrate my 4oth. This hotel is everything and then some more. I would recommend paying extra for a deluxe room as it is certainly worth it.. We had the biggest and most comfy bed EVER. 
The choice of pillows is a added bonus. All the staff were helpful and there were even some locals working at this hotel. 
Try the porridge with cream and whiskey for breakfast and then eat a hearty full Irish. The location is excellent, near enough to reach all parts of central Dublin. We would return tomorrow, as would all of the guests in our group",5,2008,09,22
236,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel on a room only basis for a long weekend just after Christmas.  The staff are very polite & friendly, mostly international, I think I only heard one Irish accent the whole time, however all spoke very good english.  Breakfast was very good but a bit on the pricey side at £18 each.  The rooms are very comfortable with a modern decor and well equipped bathroom and the hotel was quiet at night.  Easily within walking distance of Grafton Street shops and Templebar, but take a street map (you'll find them at reception) as it is very easy to get lost.  Not the cheapest of hotels in the city, but definately worth paying the extra.  If you like a lively pub, visit ""The Hairy Lemon"" at the end of the street, great atmosphere and friendly crowd.",4,2008,09,20
236,Excellent,"We stayed 6 nights at the Brooks and it was absolutely wonderful.  The room was beautiful, quiet and clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful when we had a problem with a tour we booked online (learn from our mistake and let the concierge book your tours!).  The food was delicious.   Great location close to the action but on a quiet street.  Highly recommended.",5,2008,09,10
236,"Lovely stay, excellent location","We (two couples in our thirties) are just back from a weekend here and loved it. We stay in Dublin quite a bit and this is by far the best located hotel that isn't ridiculously over priced for what you get and/or very, very basic. (We have stayed in 5*/4* eg The Merrion, Alexander and 3* Drury Court / Jurys inns).  I would describe Brooks as compact but perfectly formed. Think old world. Unfortunately too oftern this translates into shabby or run down but there is absolutely nothing shabby or run down about Brooks.  It is a little Gem and oozes character. We stayed in 2 executive rooms so cannot comment on the normal rooms. Having read previous reviews I had requested rooms on a higher floor (stayed on the 6th) at the back so noise wasn't an issue. The rooms are beautifully appointed with everything you would normally expect to find in a 5* (air con, mini bar, robes, chocs on the pillow,  turn down service, pillow menu, and also  tea and coffee making facilities). The only negative I could find if pushed is, they are perhaps a little on the small side. This is probably more to do with being over filled with furniture but we thought it added to the overall character. In any event it didn't bother us at all. The bathrooms are a good size, nicely decorated, brightly lit and perfectly clean. One thing that could annoy was the water temperature in the shower dipped briefly every now and then, but it lasted a split second and the good water pressure made up for it!           

We didn't eat dinner so can't comment on that but breakfast  was excellent with a wide selection of juices, cereals, fresh and dried fruits, cold meats and numerous breads and conserves plus the usual selection of hot breakfasts which could be ordered at your table. 

The staff was friendly and efficient at all times. The location is second to none if you want to be in the middle of everything. As others have mentioned there is no view, but what can one expect in the middle of  a city!

This is definitely going to be our first choice on future trips to the capital.",4,2008,09,08
236,Beautiful Brooks,"Located in a quiet side street, but yet very central.  Best to choose a deluxe room as some nice extras and quieter and nicer as at the back, car park opposite at the front. Some lovely touches, and excellent staff.",5,2008,09,01
236,Liked it so much I came back for a second visit!,"Was lucky enough to get cheap flights to Dublin (1p, NO taxes!) so decided to treat ourselves with a stay at the Brooks Hotel - its the second time I have stayed at the Brooks - its not the cheapest, but is of a good standard in a really good position and with friendly, helpful staff.

Particular mention must go to Connor, the concierge, who gives an excellent, first impression to visitors with his friendly greeting and suggestions of places to visit or eat. 

The staff were also very helpful when we had problems checking in online for our return flight.

Would definately stay here again (in fact I did!)

Dublin highlights: The Guiness Brewery, Jamesons Distillery and the open bus tour - I would recommend all!",5,2008,08,29
236,Nice But Noisy!,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel on a Friday and Saturday night.  We had a first floor room which had no double glazing.  I may aswell had my bed in the street outside.  It was so noisy and was kept awake till 4am on the Sunday morning! I was very annoyed about this as the hotel in general is a nice hotel and the rooms are lovely.  We ate in the restaurant which I would recommend and was reasonable in price compared to other restaurants in the vicinity. The bar was also nice.
My only complaint was the noise outside and this should be dealt with by the hotel by installing some double glazing!",3,2008,08,25
236,"Great hotel, great location, would definitely stay again!","This hotel is in a great location to explore the city.  Also close to restaurants and night life!  Wonderful, helpful staff, beautiful rooms.",4,2008,08,19
236,Excellent again!!,This was our second stay at the Brooks Hotel and again I can leave an excellent review.  The hotel is ideally located.  The staff are extremely helpful and the rooms are lovely.  I would definitely stay again and cannot think of staying anywhere else in Dublin.  Well done Brooks!,5,2008,08,18
236,"Beautiful surroundings, let down by breakfast...","Friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a ""luxury"" hotel for one night.   And in almost all respects, Brooks fit the bill.

We checked in about 3pm, and our room was ready so there was no delay.   The room was spacious, with 2 double beds, small table, chairs, flat screen TV (with DVD player) and lots of storage space.   The bathroom was well equipped, had a bath and shower and it was nice to see a range of toiletries provided.

Our room was at the back of the hotel, so we didn't have street / pub noise, however it overlooked the storage yard for the hotel bar, so there was quite a bit of noise from that, as well as the constant hum of the air con/extractor fan/heating machinery outside.  We had to close the window to minimise the noise.

The only quibble (a minor one) we had with the room contents was the kettle & tea/coffee facilities.   They were hidden in a wardrobe, placed on a sliding shelf....what's the problem, I hear you ask?  The wardrobe door couldn't open fully, because it hit off the closure mechanism on the room door!   So the shelf couldn't slide out!  As the kettle base was fixed to the shelf, we had to boil the kettle inside the wardrobe....surely a safety issue?   

We didn't eat in the restaurant in the hotel, because there wasn't a lot of choice (from the menu we saw in the elevator - why not provide one in the room?) - all of the starters were either fish- or cheese- based ( I can't eat either), and most of the main courses were similar.  This is a scenario common to quite a few restaurants, not just Brooks, and as there are plenty of places to eat in the Grafton St area, it wasn't a major inconvenience.  Would have been nice to try the restaurant on our night out though!   We did have a drink in the bar at the end of the night, and it was a lovely relaxing spot - there had been piano music earlier in the evening too.

The bed turn-down facility was a nice touch, as were the sweets on the pillows!   
Mustn't forget to mention the Pillow Menu - yep, you read it right!  There are several types of pillow available, just ask!

Having had a very comfortable night's sleep, we looked forward to breakfast (our package included full cooked breakfast).   The dining area included a self-serve continental breakfast with an array of breads, pastries, fruit, cereal and yoghurt which all looked good.   We were shown to our table and asked if we wanted toast and tea/coffee.

The coffee and toast duly arrived, but our breakfast order wasn't taken at this point - it took another 10 minutes or so, and another 10 or more before it arrived.   Now I know holidays are for relaxing meals...however.....by the time the cooked food arrived, the toast was cold.   The coffee had been little more than lukewarm, so we ordered more, but it wasn't much better.  Drinkable, but not a cup to sit and mull over.   The cooked breakfast (sausage, bacon, scrambled egg and black/white pudding) was average at best - the egg was the best (having been freshly prepared), the pudding was greasy when it should be crispy, the bacon was ok and the sausage was hard and not too warm. Got the impression that the food had been sitting around for a while.   And it was all served on a cold plate, which didn't help.

We both felt a bit let down by the breakfast - it didn't do justice to the surroundings.

The hotel (and the staff we met) is a lovely spot, very central, very nicely decorated and comfortable, but must do better on breakfast!",4,2008,08,15
236,"Fab, loved it overall","Brooks is a great hotel, excellently located and very comfortable. 

The room was very clean and the one minor niggle I had with the entire stay was that the bath enamel was chipped and the bath plug chain was broken (but the plug was there) Also one day the shower gel used didn't get replaced. But these are really minor things but given the price of the room I would have expected it to be perfect. 

The staff were very efficient and friendly and breakfast was excellent. Bed was very comfy and the room facilities excellent. 

It was mostly very quiet despite being in the centre of the city, however one night a group of people were having a bit of a row in the street outside (for at least half an hour) which woke me up, but this was not the norm. 

Overall a good experience, very comfortable hotel and excellent staff.",4,2008,08,12
236,Excellent location,"We loved the good food at the restaurant and found lots of good cafes and restaurants in the close neighbourhood. 
We stayed Friday and Saturday night and were given a room facing a noisy street. There must be a pub or disco closeby. I was glad I had my earplugs with me and slept very well. 
There is one thing I think should be improved: the opening hour for breakfast on Sunday morning is 8 o'clock. I think this is too late for people who have to get to the airport or would like to leave for early sightseeing. It seemed like a beehive just around that time.",4,2008,08,11
236,Brooks has it all,"Brooks Hotel is located in a perfect spot to get out and walk and see the side streets and shopping of Dublin. Every area is accesible including DART for day trips to Howth. Our room was roomy, clean and quiet. My 17 yr old son and I stayed for 2.5 days and enjoyed the room and the included breakfast. The front desk staff were very helpful and warm. We didnt try the Jasmine Bar but it recently won a prestigious ""whisky bar"" honor and looked very chic.",5,2008,08,04
236,"Great location,and quiet!","The Hotel is situated down a side street, and even though our bedroom was on the road side and it was a friday night that we stayed here, it was quiet.

The room was ment to have a King size bed, but it was 2 singles pushed together. That would be my only gripe about it. But I would definitly stay here again. 

We booked through 1800hotels.ie . Got a better deal than booking with the hotel, and our breakfast was included as well.

Grafton Street is only about 2 minutes walk from the hotel. So if youre in the city for sight seeing, this would be a brillent base. 

There is a carpark across the road. The hotel offers discount on the parking. I think it was €6 to cover the hours between 5.30pm-12pm the following day.  Qutie a good deal concidering how expensive parking can be in the capital.",4,2008,07,27
236,"Good value for money, excellent staff","Dublin is not a cheap city, but this hotel offers very good value for money. In other words its not cheap, but for Dublin its very reasonable! We stayed for 4 nights

A central location means that the whole of central Dublin is within easy walking distance.

Special mention for the staff (ironically many are not Irish) who offer service beyond that normally given by city centre hotels. Very friendly as well. The door is opened by the doorman, everyone has a smile and the place is alive and happy.

Our room was excellent, of a reasonable size and comfortable to sit in.

We did not use the hotel restaurant, choosing instead to eat in the multitude of very good local restaurants within a couple of hundred meters of the hotel.

We left feeling that we had been treated as individuals and not processed like peas in a pod. A hotel to use if you are in Dublin",4,2008,07,25
236,Hit & miss,"I stayed at Brooks hotel in June.  On arrival the door was opened for me and I was greeted pleasantly.  -Hit

I booked my package online and made some special requests which were email confirmation acknowledged this, but on arrival firstly my booking could not be found then when it was none of my special requests were stated.- Hit or so I thought

Firstly I asked for a twin room, but a double was awaiting.  This would not suit as I was sharing with a  collegue.  The gentleman at reception asked me to take a seat while he rectified this . After a few minutes I was told My room would be ready in half an hour . I had just arrived on an early flight from London  and had hoped to check in quickly as I had another conference in Dublin so the half hour seemed very long.- Miss

I went for a walk & its great how central the hotel is.- Hit.
 When I got back my room was ready.  The room was really spacious and very well decorated but the twin bed arrangement was not very good. The beds were right beside each other.- miss

my next request of a quiet room with no street noise was done thankfully- hit

One robe in closet & two guests -miss

Bedroom book stated iron in room but there was none- miss

Water pressure very bad at one stage I was scalded & another I was frozen-miss

Package booked ""champagne & shopping"" to include breakfast but when we went down for breakfast the first morning we were told this was not included  & were left standing there not knowing if we had to wait to be seated or not. There were lots of staff running round and no eye contact made to acknowledge we were there which was very frustrating- miss

Breakfast was lovely, fresh breads and pastries & cooked breakfast so lots of choice- hit

We got back to the hotel at around 10 each night & felt  like an inconvenience in the bar- miss
however all reception staff were very polite-hit.

In the bedroom book it mentioned footspa's were available so I decide I would ask for one .  It was broken-miss

on check out I was shown a receipt for breakfasts seperate to the package and I had to explain again it was part of the package. I had to find my print off of my booking and prove this which annoyed me as staff should know what is included in the packages they sell.-miss

Turndown service was very nice- hit

Ok my review seems very negative but 90% of the staff were very pleasant.  It was the confusion that really bugged me.  The staff were quick to rectify things but my problem was these things should not have happened. There were too many little things which made it a big thing. Better structure is needed & I would happily go back.",3,2008,07,23
236,Some good some bad,"Some Good

The hotel is very central and close to all the action and places of interest..  Most of the staff are very friendly and a special mention to Stephen who greeted us and explained the city when we arrived.

Some bad

As the hotel is very central it is very noisy on a Saturday night.  There is a disco on the corner of the block and this continued to boom until 3.00am on the Sunday morning.  Our room was on the first floor with no double glazing so we enjoyed the full benefit of the bass notes.  We were then kept awake for a further hour as the drunken revellers wended their way home.  

For the second night we were moved, and were undisturbed especially as the disco was shut.  Both rooms were adequate, but a little on the small side.
 
The quality of the cooked breakfast was poor with flaky scrambled egg – weird!",3,2008,07,18
236,Great Hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"Personal service at the Brooks Hotel was outstanding!  The wonderful doorman, Conor, introduced himself immediately and remembered our names each time he saw us.  They could not have done more to meet our needs during our stay.  The hotel is beautiful and anyone who enters is immediately made to feel special.  We had quiet rooms on the inside of the hotel and had a great night's sleep.  

The only suggestion for improvement would be in their email correspondence and pre-check in service.  We asked if the hotel could make arrangements to have our six person party picked up at the airport and were told that we needed to telephone the taxi company ourselves.  Also, I emailed several times regarding one member of our party who would be arriving much earlier.  I requested that this member be permitted to check into any one of our three rooms as soon as one was available.  He was told that his room was not available and it did not seem like an effort was made to get him into any of our rooms prior to the check in time.  I was told that the only want to guarantee early check in would be to reserve the room the night before.  If the room was available the night before, presumably it would have been available earlier than the 2:00 check in.  I was told by a member of the hotel staff that the hotel was not full.  I wish they had accomodated our early arriving guest.  Lastly, when I contacted the hotel to add the third room, they told me that they did not have my earlier reservation.  I had the email confirmation and the reservation number, but their only response was ""that employee is no longer with us.""  Although I was able to rebook the rooms, I wondered what would have happened had I not needed to add the third room.  No apology was offered.  

Although the above paragraph is long, the pre-arrival events did not in any way spoil our stay.  I can't emphasize enough how nice everyone was.  Everyone we spoke with, and particularly Conor, was genuinely concerned about our satisfication as though they were personal friends.  The hotel is lovely and we will absolutely stay here again.  I couldn't imagine finding a nicer hotel within easy walking distance to Temple Bar with such a high level of service.

236,Great Staff,"We stayed here two nights in January 2008.  Great service, excellent hotel.  Breakfast was included in the price of the room through a package listed on the hotel website. Turndown service with candy/chocolates each night.  Easy walking distance to all the sights.  The front desk kept our bags after checkout until we returned to the airport.  Bar in hotel is modern and friendly, but it took them a while to figure out how to pour a pint of Guinness (in Dublin!) Would stay here again for a short break in Dublin.",5,2008,07,06
236,Excellent location,"We only stayed one night before travelling on for a short break near Cork but definately would like to return for a longer stay and sample the hotel restaurant. The hotels location is fantastic for visiting shops, temple bar and tourist attractions such as trinity college. Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was nice too but no seperate shower, we had a shower over the bath with shower curtain. We stayed in a standard room the decor was bright and flowery rather than contemporary/modern which is a style we usually favour however it was still a nice room and even though we were in the centre of Dublin and in a front facing room on the 5th floor,little noise from the streets was experienced. The breakfast was excellent and we found the staff very friendly. Would definately stay again and recommend.",5,2008,07,01
236,Good Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 3 nights and would recommend it. The location was great, everything was within walking distances but not too close that it was loud at night.  Breakfast was include which was very convenient and the front desk was very helpful with everything. Would stay there again!",4,2008,06,24
236,Will definitley visit again,"Booked an executive room for my husband's birthday.Read reviews before booking and we were not dissapointed. 
Our flight was an early arrival, however as I had mentioned this prior to booking, the room was made available on our arrival. The french assistant duty manager was delightful and very helpful. We were given tips and places to visit, Maps and umberellas provided we set off and enjoyed open top bus tour. 
Room was spacious and the balcony useful as we had a sunny couple of days, rare in Dublin. Wine, which I preordered, was left with a nice note from management and staff for my hubby,s birthday.Breakfast plentiful. Staff very helpful.
Have recommended this hotel to several people already and we will def visit again.",5,2008,06,23
236,Great Hotel !,"What a great hotel ! Excellent location.Walking distance to Grafton St.,Trinity College,Temple Bar....Yuk ! Hotel rooms are well maintained and comfortable.Breakfast is excellent..A great stay in Dublin.",5,2008,06,05
236,One stop boutique hotel,"We were very pleased with this hotel:  location, size and amenities.  Everything is within good walking distance, especially since Dublin is a small city.  Plenty of options at your feet for dining and shopping from vintage shops to upscale retail.  We found our best Irish coffees made here in the bar, breakfast was very good quality and we also had dinner in the dining room one night and were very pleased.  The rooms and common areas are beautifully appointed and I appreciated it being a smaller hotel.  I would not hesitate to return to this hotel and would suggest it to anyone.",4,2008,06,03
236,Perfect,"Great boutique hotel in fantastic location.  This hotel can not be beat for it's style, cleanliness and location location location.",5,2008,05,05
236,A little gem.,"Excellent location on a quiet street but 2 streets away from grafton street and all its amazing shops and bars.
Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance and a fab comedy club at the end of the street.
Hotel very clean, good sized rooms and very friendly efficient staff.
Breakfast was included in our rate and was fantastic with a choice of cooked breakfast or continental buffet.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2008,05,02
236,Perfect - Perfect - Perfect,"Stayed at this hotel in April for a short romantic break with my husband and what a fantastic hotel.

Firstly it is very well located, right in the centre of Dublin. It was very easy to find too as it is located on the third street behind Grafton Street. It is opposite the Dury street car park, so makes it ideal if you have your own transport while you are there. 

As it is so central, you are never more than a short walk away from the shops of grafton street, to the bars and clubs of Temple Bar, and many other attractions such as ST Stephens Green and Trinity College.

The inside of the hotel is very impressive and very clean. All rooms very well furnished and comfortable. The bedrooms themselves are fantastic, bright, airey, comfortable and clean. The bed was huge and soooo comfortable, in fact I found it quite hard to get out of it on a morning! The Pillow menu, turn down service with chocolates on the pillows and the toilertries in the bathroom just made it all extra special. There was also ample storage space and all other hotel ammenities that you would expect such as, safe, tea/coffee facailities, TV, ironing board and hair dryer. 

Breakfasts were really nice and a good way to start the day. The hotel bar was a haven to relax in at night and even more special with the table service. After 11.30pm though they can not accept cash payments so all sales go onto your room number. 

Each and every member of staff that we met were truely fantastic, very helpful and extremley friendly.

We had a room at the front of the hotel and even though it was opposite the carpark, not once was our sleep disturbed.

We loved this hotel and when we next return to Dublin we will certainly being staying here again.",5,2008,04,23
236,First visit to Dublin but I will be back to stay at the Brooks Hotel,"I have just returned from a four day visit to Dublin with my mother. The hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a huge choice at breakfast and the service was first class. 

The location was great for us - not too far from shops, buses, trams etc and we managed to do a lot of sightseeing.

I would certainly return to Dublin and hopefully stay at the Brooks Hotel again.",5,2008,04,22
236,"Excellent Stay, Service, Location, Breakfast","This hotel was simply excellent.  The location is in the heart of all things to see in the Dublin city, within close walking distance to all sights, but on a pretty quiet street.  The rooms are lovely, on the small side but nicely laid out and decorated ( rooms tend to be smaller in Europe overall, so this was no exception), with Gilchrest and Soames bath products and nice bathroom.  The service is excellent.  Above all, my favorite thing about the hotel was the free breakfasts-- an AMAZING spread to choose from, from continental to full Irish, and all included in the hotel rate.   In summary this is a great hotel to base your exploration of the city of Dublin.",5,2008,04,07
236,Back for a second helping,"We loved this hotel when we stayed last year and so decide to come again. We love the atmosphere, the quality of the rooms, the private lounge and the great breakfasts. The staff are helpful and attentive. The location- close to the centre and loads of good bistro and shopping- is perfect. We preferred the high floors, which avoided any of the street noise that others dont care for. Feels like a second home now.",5,2008,04,03
236,Great Location / Great Hotel,"We arrived in Dublin on the morning of St Patricks Day. This meant that most the roads were shut & the buses didn't follow their normal routes. Therefore finding the place was slightly problematic. However it was well worth it. The reception was clean & modern, and all the staff were very friendly & helpful. Once in the room we have a Super King sized bed and the room was huge. We were pleased to be situated at the back of the hotel (room 407 I think) as other reviews have mentioned the noise of revellers in the early hours passing the front. The slight problem with the back is that there is a view of an office block and some air con units. Anyway this didn't damped our stay as we didn't come to Dublin to enjoy our hotel window view!! We were there to see our favourite band (The Eels) at Vicar Street. (That was superb but probably best if reviewed on another site!!) The great things for us was that upon checking out, the band were in the lobby too, so I managed to get my ticket stub signed which capped off a fabulous time! All in all, this hotel is slightly expensive but well worth it. Stay here and you will not be disappointed.",5,2008,04,03
236,The Brooks is wonderful,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel for four nights and found it to be very comfortable.  All of the rooms have large beds and the breakfast is great (included in the price).  It is located very close to museums, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity, Gaiety Theatre, Grafton St, and the sites we wanted to visit.  Although it is near the action, it is on a quiet street and it was perfect for our anniversary celebration.",5,2008,04,02
236,Brooks Hotel Dublin,"Stayed here for a long w/e over Easter 2008. Hotel is city centre & just 5-10 mins from most tourist attractions, walking distance is ok, and Temple bar is 5 mins away. The Liffey is very near but can tbe seen from Hotel.

Hotel very good, food excellent, rooms great but no views; still the space is terrific and beds very comfy.

Staff brilliant, longe downstairs is an oasis and the gym is ok if thats what you want!

We would stay again and room 609 is very nice.

Plenty of pubs, clubs, restaurants, shops and whatever very close by, as is Grafton St.",4,2008,03,25
236,Biggest Comfiest Bed Ever with the Warm Irish Welcome,"Me and my husband (both early 40s) stayed for Easter weekend 2008 at the Brooks Hotel, Drury St, Dublin, after redaing great reviews about it already on Trip Advisor. It just goes to show what a great website TA is, for it was rated by the majority really highly and i could not fault it. It's in a fab location, just a 2 minute stroll from St Stephen's Green and Grafton St; fot the fitter among you it's also easily walkable (about 20 mins) to the Guinness storehouse and another 10 mins will take you to the jail. Reception checked us in quickly and efficiently with a big smile and our room (507) was fantastic. No views, as it looks onto another grey building (bear in mind this is central city Dublin, not a beach loaction!) but the bed was ENORMOUS, and so comfy!! In fact, we spent a great deal of time just chilling out in our hotel room as it was so lovely. For an extra 3 euros it's also well worth having breakfast served in bed which we did both days that we stayed. What a treat! When we did venture into the hotel bar for a drink and snack, the service, again was brilliant, my wine nicely chilled and the bar food very tasty indeed! Oh, and the bathroom was spotlessly clean, with the hottest water so it's well worth relaxing in a full bathtub of bubbles with a glass of wine from the very well stocked minibar.
Overall, a fabulous hotel where we would definately stay again!",5,2008,03,25
236,A Sanctury,"Having been unwell we were looking for somewhere quiet but within walking distance of the the centre and we certainly found with this hotel. Situated down a side road it was easy strolling distance of the centre, the buses,a hop on & hop off service around the principal places, & the train stations. The staff were both friendly & efficient, replacing a broken light bulb within minutes.Breakfast was served from 7-10  and was more than adequate to keep us going for most of the day. We ate in Francescas where the menu changed monthly to reflect seasonal produce, you may have a wait for your food as everything is cooked to order. Rooms had everything you need, although if we returned we would avoid room 103 as the air-conditioning units were outside our window making it impossible to have the window open even a crack. Also we did find the hot water was erratic, having to leave the tap running before any came through. And as some of your other travellers have commented on the beds are very firm! However if we returned for another visit  this hotel would be our first choice every time.Thank you for a most relaxing stay.",5,2008,03,18
236,Great Hotel,"Great hotel, love the library, super friendly staff, great bed, rooms are nice, the bathroom was nice, but the shower was small. wish they had irons in the room instead of that press thing that did not work.  I did NOT like the breakfast and it was way over priced.",4,2008,03,16
236,Birthday Treat,"We stayed at this hotel for a few days to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It turned out to be a good choice.  The room was great with a massive bed which was very comfortable, slept like a log!  The bathroom was well appointed and everywhere was very clean.

It was very cold and windy in Dublin but we managed to enjoy ourselves as there are many restaurants within a short walk.

The bedroom was warm and comfortable at all times and the room we had was very quiet at night.",5,2008,03,11
236,Good but with flaws,"I stayed for one night in the Brooks hotel, and for the location it really seems excellent. Nice in the center of Dublin, within walking distance to all the main attractions.

Entering the hotel I was very nicely welcomed by the receptionist, which made checking in very pleasant. This was accompanied by a nice music coming out of the bar.

Arrived in my room when turning on the TV, I was experiencing a case of no sound. Trying to get this fixed I called the reception who told me the concierge would come within a few minutes, as he was first helping out another guest. I then waited more than half an hour, before I called again to the reception, this time complaining about the fact that it took so long. Then within a few minutes someone came. He ended up unplugging a plug from the back of the TV, which is supposed to give the sound of the tv also in the bathroom, stating something about different voltages or something likewise. End result was that I did have sound on the tv and not the option anymore of hearing this in the bathroom.

In the morning when taking my shower then I had quite some trouble getting a nice temperature out of the shower. Even though it had a thermostatic tap, over the course of my shower the temperature had big fluctuations, so didn't give the nice shower I was expecting. The nice soaps however did compensate quite alot.

My last problem point was the connection point for the shaver, which only worked if you held the plug pushed to a certain position. If you let it go or moved your hand only slightly, it would stop working again, so I ended up using my converter which I wisely took with me and using a plug somewhere else in the room.

The room number was 202, so advise is to try and get a different room.

In all though the hotel gave also the nice ambiance and breakfast, which was included in my booking, was very nice and well arranged.",3,2008,03,10
236,Great time at the Brooks,"We stayed at the Brooks Hotel, from the 29th Feb until 3rd March 2008. Our stay was first class, and what a welcome we got from Connor the Concierge a real star. 

We were upgraded to an Executive room which was large, rear facing and very quite with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star hotel, we took advantage of the pillow menu which was a lovely touch.

It was our first visit to Dublin and unsure where to eat, but Connor made suggestions and booked The Bistro on the First night for us, which was about 100 yards away from the hotel, and an excellent choice, he also booked Boxty Gallaghers in Temple Bar area (10 minutes walk)  for us which served traditional Irish food also excellent.
Had Connor not booked these places for us I am sure we would not have been able to get a table.

All in all we were very pleased with our choice of the Brooks hotel for our first visit to Dublin.",5,2008,03,08
236,First time Ive been offered a Pillow menu!,"My husband was doing a group wiskey tasting in the bar at Brooks so we decided to stay there. We both had a fab time. He enjoyed the Wiskey tasting and I enjoyed the bath and then joined him in the bar later.
All the service was great, breakfast was very nice and room was lovely and clean.

The bed didnt seem very big, but was comfy. We were given a pillow menu, but didnt use it - nice touch though.

We had internet in the room which was great. In the evening a basket of cholotates were brought to the room. We returned to Brooks a few months later, just for drinks, when we had friends from NZ and we again enjoyed the wiskey bar.",5,2008,03,02
236,Home from Home,"The staff at the Brooks are kind, friendly and efficient.  I travel to Dublin on business and usually on my own yet at the Brooks I feel relaxed and at ease.  I always sleep well in the cosy accommodation and enjoy the healthy well prepared food.  Because there is wireless internet connection in every room and good workspace, I find my room to be a good place to work in when required.  The location is ideal for both business and leisure purposes.  The hotel is extremely well managed but in a quiet non-intrusive way.",5,2008,02,29
236,A birthday surprise!,"Having consulted Tripadvisor I decided to book Brooks for a ""surprise""  trip to Dublin for my husband and I to celebrate his 60th birthday.  We were not disappointed - the hotel was ideal - great location, excellent, friendly service, good food and very comfortable.  The only complaint we would make was that our room, on the first floor at the front of the hotel, was very noisy (street noise) at night, but having said this, it was the Six Nations Rugby weekend!  If we go again, as we hope to, we may request either a room at the rear of the hotel, or one on a higher floor!",5,2008,02,25
236,great location and room,"This is a great location and a lovely hotel.  Our room was beautiful and had a large bathroom.  The lobby bar is worth a stop and we liked the internet availability downstairs.

Breakfast was yummy too.

The only problem was the restaurant recommended by the front desk. It was one of the worst meals we have ever had.  The hotel was very embarrassed and made it right which makes sure we will always return to the Brooks Hotel.  

Bottom line, stay at The Brooks Hotel while in Dublin.",5,2008,02,21
236,ok rooms- just don't eat the cooked breakfast,"My husband and I booked this hotel last minute.  We needed a hotel close to Trinity College and this was ideal.  We  paid £130 for a classic double room bed and breakfast.  

We arrived late evening and the receptionist was pleasant.  The hotel doesn't have a carpark, but there is a carpark across the street where there is an arrangement with Brooks that guests get a reduced parking rate between certain hours.

Our room was a classic double ie flowery curtains and traditional style. It was clean and there were plenty of toiletries, towels and tea,coffee facilities etc. 

As it was too late to eat a meal we ordered a sandwich from room service, which arrived quite promptly.  The bill was over 16 Euros for a coke, a plate of chips and a round of chicken sandwiches with lettuce drowned in olive oil. (extortionate)

I would agree with the other reviews that the matresses are really hard and not in the least bit comfortable.  I also realised that a room at the front of the hotel means lots of noise at night from people on their way home from the pubs, and early morning delivery vehicles.  If you get given a room at the front of the hotel either ask for ear plugs or change rooms!

We arrived down to breakfast around 7.30 and had a choice of cereal, fruits, juices as well as toast, coffee or tea.  As we had paid for a full breakfast we each ordered the cooked breakfast of potato bread, eggs, sausage, bacon and mushrooms.  Being from the North of Ireland we know how to do a decent fry, but what we got would put you off them for life.  My husband's cooked breakfast was so saturated in oil he couldn't eat it, and mine wasn't much better.  We were disappointed to say the least.  Ironically, the head Chef of the restaurant is from the North of Ireland and should have his staff trained in how to do a proper fry!

For location the hotel is as central as you can get.  The staff are pleasant.  If you order a classic room you get a classic room- and don't eat a cooked breakfast in the place.",3,2008,02,15
236,"Lovely Hotel, Great Staff, Clean and Central","We had booked two triple rooms at the rear of the hotel (mainly due to reports of passing noise at night especially if you are situated in the front rooms).  We arrived at 9am knowing that checkin time was 2pm.  Sebastian (very nice and helpful) who was on the front desk immediately said one room was ready and the other one would be ready at 1pm.  That was great news as it meant we could store our luggage in one room and use the facilities especially as we had a small baby.  Sebastian also gave us access to the Residence Lounge on the -1 floor.

After dropping our luggage and feeding the baby we walked around the corner to Metro Café for a nice breakfast.  We returned to the hotel around 12midday to be told the 2nd room was now actually ready, we had insisted on a travel cot for the baby and sure enough it was there when we entered the room.  

The first room 201 seemed recently renovated and was immaculately decorated and very clean.  The second room 205 was not as nicely decorated as the first but still clean.  The beds were very comfortable and had a pillow menu which was a good point.  Bathroom were big enough and had a large bath and shower.  We heard no noise from the road and passing people as pointed out by previous people but the rooms were at the rear of the hotel as we requested.

We had breakfast in the hotel that was included in the room price, we were looked after by Noel who was very good, he was very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.  He also chatted to the baby and kept her smiling. 

We had a few beers in the bar on an evening, it was quite expensive (4.95 euro for a shot of Cognac) and at times the bar staff seemed to be understaffed, especially when groups of residents entered the bar area.

We never used to restaurant other than for breakfast, instead we ate in Captain Americas (excellent), Eddie Rockets (not so good) and a Chinese (good) just off Exchequer street.  We also used the residence lounge on one occasion.  We did not use the gym.  The hotel is very central with most sights within walking distance.  We even bumped into Louis Walsh while walking around the city on the Sunday afternoon, seemed a nice guy.

A good comparison for the Hotel would be the Casablanca Hotel (New York City) both are very similar, although the Casablanca slightly shades it (but is / was rated No 1 in NYC).

Positive points, staff very friendly especially Sebastian (front desk) and Noel (Breakfast waiter).  Rooms very nice and fully equipped (even included a DVD player).  Bathrooms big and clean.  Centrally located.  Turndown service and chocolates.

The only negative point was that on checkout I had not realised that the agreed room rate did not include the tax so I was presented with a bill about 70 Euros more than expected.  In all fairness this was either something I had missed and / or not made clear when booking.",5,2008,01,30
236,Great Hotel in Centre of Dublin,"Have stayed here twice and can recommend, the best part is the friendly and helpful staff all of who go out of there way to make you feel at home.
Hotel is spotless.
Breakfast is fantastic yes you only get 1 rasher of bacon but if you ask for more when ordering you'll get it.
If flying get the aircoach as recommended by others.
I would not recommend the restaurant as we found much better value elsewhere, if you like your cooked dinner try O'Neills pub on Suffolk Street a 5 minute walk away.
Yes it's expensive but a 4 star hotel right in the middle of a capital city what do you exspect.
Would not hesitate to go again and recommend to all.",5,2008,01,05
236,Loved it!,"Booked somewhat last minute and had never heard of the hotel so we were a bit unsure as to what to expect. 

The hotel itself is really nice. The room wasn't massive but there was enough space for the three of us to fit comfortably. Beds were massive and very comfortable! 

Lovely touch was the sweets delivered in the evnings. Just gave it that extract little personal touch. 

The hotels location seems a little confusing a first but once you get to grips with your bearings you soon realise that you are actually in the heart of things! 

There is a bar  which does some lovely cocktails, however dont expect a lively night in it, it is very quiet! There is also a restaurant but as we only stayed for one night we didn't get to try it. However, the menu looked lovely!

The breakfast was amazing! Best breakfast i have ever had in a hotel! The staff were very attentive and pleasant.  

All in all a great hotel that i will most definetly return to!",5,2008,01,05
236,"Great hotel!!!! Location, Location, Location!!!!","The hotel is clean and stylish. It is walking distance from most major
tourist locations in the city. Several bars and restaurants to choose from near by. Staff was VERY helpful and polite. Will stay there every
time I visit Dublin from now on!!!",5,2008,01,03
236,Great Hotel,Stayed at the brooks for one night in Dec 07 and had a really great stay.  The staff are really helpful both before and during your stay..our flight got into Dublin really early in the morning and they promised to try their best to have our room ready for when we got there and they did.  Its only a small hotel but perfectly formed.. the breakfast is fantastic... would reccommend booking a room rate that includes this as its well worth having.  We were xmas shopping in Dublin and was very pleased with the location.. overall a very enjoyable stay.,5,2007,12,29
236,Good central Dublin Hotel,"the Brooks is in a really good central position. the common areas, bar and restaurant are good. the room was very clean, although the bed was not particularly comfortable. Staff very helpful especially the Concierge. Good spot to tour Dublin",4,2007,12,24
236,Incredible service,"Fantastic.  Arrived from NYC on the red eye and went straight to the hotel to drop our bags.  Check in time wasn't until that afternoon but we just wanted to clean up a bit in the lobby restroom.  Because our room wasn't ready when we arrived (although it was HOURS ahead of time) the front desk staff upgraded us and had tea laid out for us in the parlor since the cafe wasn't open yet. 

The room wasn't the biggest or fanciest I've ever stayed in, but it was comfortable, clean and cozy.  And the location is fantastic - right in the middle of the action in Dublin.  You can walk most everywhere you'll want to see in Dublin.",5,2007,12,18
236,Brooks is the best,"We spent three nights in this excellent Central Dublin hotel, and greatly enjoyed the stay. Our upgraded room was well-equipped, with a nice bathroom, DVD player, retro radio and flatscreen TV. Free mineral water and nightly chocolates were also provided. On the fourth floor, it was quiet, and the aircon/heating was very efficient. As Dublin was full of office Christmas parties, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant one night - there are plenty of good ones nearby: try Pasta Fresca on Chatham Street for a really tasty Italian lunch - and we enjoyed excellent food not unreasonably priced. Breakfasts were equally good, with lots of fresh fruit, breads and cereals, and a good freshly cooked Full Irish also available. Residents have access to a quiet basement lounge with free coffee and Internet facilities. The hotel bar, though busy, is also a pleasant comfortable alternative to some of the city's rowdier hotel bars. As others have said, Brooks is ideally situated for shopping and many sites south of the river. All in all, we would highly recommend it.",5,2007,12,17
236,"Great Hotel, Great Location","My wife and I stayed at the Brooks for two nights.  Its greatest asset is its central location.  Dublin is a bustling, exciting city and the Brooks is smack dab in the middle of it all.  Easy walking to Trinity College, Grafton Street and Temple Bar.  Lots and lots of fun pubs with very good food and music to match.  

We were upgraded to a suite on the top floor, so the room was very nice, clean, comfortable and spacious.  The bathroom was equally as nice.  Downstairs, the lobby, lounge and restaurant was very warm and inviting with very friendly people.  The staff, for the most part, was friendly  and eager to make sure that our stay was pleasant.  

I say ""for the most part"" because we had an interesting conversation with the young gentleman who transported our bags to our room.  He noticed our luggage tags and immediately remarked ""oh, I see that you are from ""Bush"" country.""  And then follow that comment up with ""where I am from (middle east), we think that he is the devil.""  And then he proceeded to spend the next 5 minutes bagging on the US.  It made my wife very uncomfortable.  I, for one, enjoy a good, reasoned debate on world politics.  But one must know the time and place to engage in such a conversation; after all this is the ""hospitality"" industry.  

Other than that brief exchange, we truly enjoyed ourselves and would recommend the Brooks to anyone traveling to Dublin.",4,2007,12,11
236,Excellent Hotel,"A lovely hotel suitated in a back street which was a little difficult to find initally, never having been to Dublin before.  The rooms we were allocated, we had 4 different rooms, 3 of which were updgraded, were all beautiful.  We had a boutique style room with mauve decor looking out to the street,which was a bit noisy during the night if you left the window open.  The bathroom had a tv at the end of the bath, though the bath was tiny, it had a shower cubicle also and was lovely.  The turn down service was a nice touch and we were left some sweets on our pillows too.  The breakfast was lovely, help yourself to fruit, cereal, breads, pastries, waffles, yogurts and you were served the hot options of cooked breakfast, kippers, american pancakes, anything you wanted really, it was not a problem to the staff.  Bit pricey at 200 euros per night, but seems to be average prices in Dublin.  The reception staff were really helpful and arranged a taxi to take us back to the airport, which was a cheaper option for 6 of us rather than taking the airport bus for 6 euros each, so if there are a few of you travelling I would recommend taking a taxi as it takes you right to the door.
We ate at Mona Lisa Restaurant on D'Olier street beside Trinity College and had the 19.95 euros 3 course meal, which was great , you can check the menu on line and I booked our table on line which was no problem.  Great value and we wished we had gone back the 2nd night.  We also visited O'Neills bar (the oldest bar in Dublin?) it was okay but not very traditional, surprised there was no Irish music playing, it was spoiled by the fact the football was being broadcast on all the t.vs in the pub.  The food was not great, so if you like canteen food, fine, but if not go elsewhere.
Temple Bar was good during the day and we visited Oliver St John Goegarty, which had traditional irish music playing on the 1st floor.  Wouyldn't recommend Temple Bar at night though, it has a completely different atmosphere, which was quite intimidating and even the men folk that were with us were a bit unsure of it.  Okay maybe if you are young though, I'm sure you would love it. 
Visited the Guinness store house, which was a good trip to do.  Get there early though, as we got there at 11.am and got straight in.  When we came out at 2pm the queues were right round the corner for about 1/4 mile.  Free pints of guinness went down well though and views from top floor over Dublin were superb.
The only complaint about the whole weekend was that we were disappointed that most of the staff in pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants were not Irish and we had expected more Irish ""crack"".",5,2007,12,03
236,Very nice,"Very nice hotel that we used for a few days while in Dublin.

Not as nice as some of the guesthouses and bed and breakfasts that we stayed in in other parts of Ireland but a good choice to explore Dublin.",4,2007,11,29
236,"OK, but not as good as we'd hoped for","My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel from November 12-15. Reading previous reviews, I can see that experiences seem to vary depending on which room you stay in. Our room was one of those that desperately need some TLC.

Basically, I was disappointed with the quality of the room considering what we were paying for it (€160/night, b&b) -- in my opinion, it certainly didn't live up to its 4 star rating. We were staying in a standard double room, and while the bed was very comfy and the pillow menu was fun, there was peeling wallpaper, the cabinets were scuffed-up, the carpet was stained and the bathroom sink didn't drain properly (we complained about the latter, but nothing was done about it). However, the staff were friendly and the breakfast was superb -- the wait staff were very attentive and didn't mind us taking our time. Also, I loved the opportunity to borrow a foot spa for the night. 

Whilst the location is certainly about as good as you can get -- right by Grafton Street and Trinity College (plus there's a carpark opposite for which Brooks provides a discounted rate), we'll try a different hotel next time we're in Dublin.",3,2007,11,27
236,Great Stay,"What a refreshing change the Brooks was. From the arrival to time we left.
All the staff were attentive, friendly and courteous, without being over bearing.
The rooms were of a very high standard and the beds were so comfortable.
Breakfast a delight you could almost have what you wanted ( my fathers only complaint, no Marmite !!!)
The Brooks is a hotel I would highly reccommend and return tomorrow given the chance.",5,2007,11,27
236,Great stay at the Brooks!,"I just returned from a great trip to Ireland. We stayed at the Brooks from 15 - 17 November and again 22 - 24 November. I loved our room, small but fresh and elegant. We were always greeted by the front desk as we came and went and had some great help from the concierge. The bar is a bit short on vodka choices (as is all of Ireland) but we loved the ambience. The breakfast was above average as far as hot food went and most excellent for cold choices. Many breads, pastries, cheeses, cereals, fruits and juices to pick from. I was disappointed in their tea offerings, it was bags, not loose. The coffee was just tolerable.
     You cannot beat the location and we will definitely stay here on any future trips to Dublin. It is expensive but so much more enjoyable than staying at a large hotel in the same class.",5,2007,11,25
236,"Brooks Hotel, Dublin","Just arrived home from the Brooks Hotel, Dublin.  Stayed there from 10 to 12 November 2007.  

The hotel is in a great location in the middle of Temple Bar (for drinking) and Grafton Street (for shopping).  Less than 5 minutes walk to both these areas.  

I asked for a quiet room and was allocated room 614 on the top floor.  It was indeed very quiet and we slept soundly (the guinness might have helped as well !!).  The view wasn't very good - a multi storey car park - but I only looked out the window twice anyway to see what the weather was like.  The room was quite small but probably because we had a very large bed in the middle of it.

The staff were efficient and friendly and helpful with any questions asked.  The whole hotel is really clean and comfortable and I would certainly want to stay here again if I returned to Dublin.  It is a bit pricey for what you get, but then it is in the middle of Dublin so it is only to be expected.  

The full Irish breakfast was included in the price we paid and the variety and quality was very good, although the quantity of the cooked breakfast disappointed my husband - he wanted more than one rasher of bacon and some beans!  

We took the Aircoach from the airport to Trinity College and from there it was a 5 minute walk to the hotel.  This is a very good bus service which gets you to the middle of Dublin in about 30 minutes with no other stops.  When returning to the airport we had two other stops en route.  I would certainly recommend it.

Overall had a very enjoyable trip and if you want a comfortable stay in Dublin then choose the Brooks Hotel.",5,2007,11,12
236,Perfect stay,"My husband and I spent three nights at Brooks 31 October - 3 November.  We had booked one of the basic rooms and requested a quiet room at the back or side of the hotel as we had read reviews saying the rooms at the front were noisy with revellers late at night.  Unfortunately, when we arrived no rooms were available at back or side but we were offered one of the newly renovated rooms for a small supplement (30 euros).  Although this room was on the fourth floor and at the front of the hotel overlooking a multi story car park we found it to be very quiet - perhaps the double glazed window helped!  The room was spacious with a flat screen TV, dvd player and radio and had a very nice bathroom.  

As part of our package we had full Irish breakfast included.  You could also help yourself to the vast array of options including cereals, fruit juices, fresh fruit, cooked meats, smoked salmon, assorted breads and preserves.  There was plenty of choice even if you were only on the continental breakfast arrangement.
We also enjoyed an evening meal in the restaurant and a bar meal - both of which were delicious.

On the lower ground floor there is a residents lounge (accessible by room key).  From here you can ring upstairs to the bar and order drinks.  There is also a computer with internet connection and printer available in the small room off this lounge.

The location is ideal - just a short walk to the Temple Bar area.  

We arrived by air and took the Aircoach to Stephens Green and it was then only a short walk to the hotel.   Cost of Aircoach was 7 euros per person single, or 12 euros return.  Can recommend the Aircoach service, bus ran every 10-15 minutes with a speedy transfer into the city (traffic permitting).

All in all we considered our few days in Dublin and at Brooks Hotel to be perfect.   All the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Certainly a hotel we hope to revisit in the future.",5,2007,11,12
236,Great Hotel - very relaxing,Stayed at Brooks after long trip from Australia. Upgraded to deluxe room as a treat and it was a lovely room with great bathroom.  Air con did not work well and room a bit warm as a result.  Everything else superb.  Breakfast I reckon the best I've ever had.  Fabulous local produce.  Staff generally friendly and efficient.,5,2007,11,11
236,"Good, But Not Great","For what I paid to stay at Brooks, I was expecting a lot more than I got. I travel a lot for work and all I usually want from a hotel is a
friendly staff, clean room, and comfortable bed. However, since I was
on vacation (my first time in Ireland), I thought I'd treat myself to
something nicer than the Hampton Inns I'm used to.  

Brooks Hotel came highly recommended by an aquaintance and the reviews on this website are generally favorable, so I made my reservations without even considering I'd be disappointed.

I will admit, the staff were for the most part very friendly and helpful whenever I needed assistance, my room was clean, and the hotel is in a very convienent location.  

Still, the furniture was pretty dated, at night I was usually stared down by whoever was at the front desk (sorry, but most hotel front desk employees make it a point to familiarize themselves with their guests...whether it's learning their last name and offering a greeting or plain saying hello when the person enters), and like I said earlier, I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth.",3,2007,10,31
236,"Great location, overpriced","Great location, hard to get to if you are driving yourself.  Room was nice but small.  We were a family of four and felt very cramped in the space given. Reception was nice and bellhops helpful.  The breakfast was not good and you were charged for nearly everything.  Given the cost of the rooms, it should all be included ,not just a few muffins. Overall, good experience but much lighter in the wallet.",4,2007,10,30
236,Nice hotel,"We ended our Europe trip at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin.  Overall, the hotel is nice, but we thought just a bit spendy for what it is.  The location is great, walking distance from most of the typical Dublin attractions.  

The ""negative"" of the hotel is the underlying need to be remodeled.  We felt things were ""covered up"" and weren't completely done with the remodel.  The trim was old with newer paint on it, among a few other things.  We found daily that the vacuum usually sat outside our door, which the hallways are not real wide to begin with.

We did not eat at either of the restaurants, we ventured out to get a real ""taste"" of Dublin.  There is a great Irish restaurant about a 5-8 minute walk away (across the street from The Temple Bar) called ""Gallagher's Boxty House"".",4,2007,10,28
236,Brooks is a a good location,"With the weak U.S. dollar, this hotel was a good choice for location, great breakfasts and decent rooms. 
We had two rooms for two nights with breakfast included.
It is close to the main Tourist Information office, all bus tour pick up points, Grafton Street, Powerscourt , and a short walk to the Temple Bar area.
The staff was friendly and courteous, and, with the exception of a less than efficient check out service, it was a very enjoyable stay.
The highly-recommended bar crawl was a great disappointment.  The two musicians that conduct the tours change often and it is the luck of the draw as to which ones you happen to get.  
While the two that we had were good musicians, they lacked the personality that is required to entertain the group and make it a memorable experience.  We left after the second bar stop.
However, dinner at Gallagher's Boxties on Fleet Street and Anglesea was quite good (reservations are a must).  Some of the Dublin guides call it Touristy, but we did not find that to be the case.  There was live Irish music, but it stayed in the background and was not intrusive--a thouroughly enjoyable evening.",4,2007,10,25
236,Not Bad,"I have just returned from a one night stay in Brooks Hotel which i booked as a special treat for myself and my mother along with a theatre visit. I chose Brooks after reading the reviews posted on this site and paid extra for a 'delux' room as it was meant to be a treat.
While the hotel was nice and the service pretty good, i was a  little disappointed with my 'delux' room. I think all i got for the extra money was a radio (which we didn't listen to) and a dvd player (we didn't use). Maybe this was my mistake for booking it. The room was nice and the beds were lovely and comfortable although the decor could have been more exciting. There were some nice touches too, like the pillow menu and sweets on the pillows, however this was spoilt for us a little as the staff member came to our room as we were preparing to go out to the theatre and were still getting dressed after having had showers. I then had to pass pillows out of the door in my towel etc. It would have been nice if they could have done this a little later when most people would be out and we would have welcomed the surprise upon our return. 
On the plus side the rooms were comfortable if a little small and the shower was great. The staff were very friendly and efficient in the bar and restaurant, etc. We didn't eat in the restaurant although we had breakfast the following morning. This was not included in the room rate and was very over-priced! It's worth noting that i could have booked an ordinary room with breakfast included on several other websites for a lot less than i paid for this room without breakfast. The buffet was lovely but the cooked breakfast nothing to write home about. 
The bar was nice and relaxing compared to the hustle and bustle of the Dublin bars. However, our room over-looked the street and we could hear all that hustle and bustle until after 3am!
It is a lovely hotel, the beds are the most comfortable i've ever come across and i'd certainly recommend it, but i don't think it was special enough to warrant the extra money, especially not for the delux room.",4,2007,10,23
236,great location,"This hotel has a great location but ask for a room at the back  or you will have alot of noise disturbance until 3.00 a.m  from people leaving the nearby clubs.
Our only other complaint was that if you have an early flight home dont order breakfast in the room because it doesnt arrive on time and the price is not deleted from the bill!
The staff are very friendly and helpful as are all of the people you meet in Dublin, especially the taxi drivers. 
We would also recommend taking one of the river cruises as you find out lots of interesting facts about Dublin.",4,2007,10,22
236,Great Location,"Stayed over a weekend on the 6th floor at the back of the hotel (ie not overlooking dury street).  Overall happy with accomodation.  

The hotel is very welcoming but I would have preferred to have been met with an Irish accent rather than a polish one and that is not to prejudice against the polish who work very hard to please it's just it somehow loses the Irish charm a tad.  

Room was pleasant with modern decor.  Breakfast ok although appeared to differ from one morning to the next even when you ordered the same thing.

Hotel is expensive but so is Dublin.",4,2007,10,21
236,"Nice, noisy hotel","Our room was nice.  The hotel is in a nice location for tourists.  The service was good.  

However, be aware of the street noise, particulary on Friday and Saturday nights.  There is a pub on the corner that seems to have live music regularly.  The drums were thumping at my brain until 3 a.m.  

In the Brooks' defense, I've heard this is a common issue at Dublin hotels.  On the other hand, the front desk clerk had little to no sympathy when I brought the issue to her attention.  She kind of shrugged and said, ""That's how it is.""",3,2007,10,20
236,Luxury accommodation in centre of Dublin,"Excellent hotel.  Had deluxe room on quiet side of hotel.  The rest of our party had rooms on the front of the hotel, which were noisy at night from the revellers outside.  The breakfast was excellent - lots of choice of healthy options and lovely breads and scones.  Cooked breakfast was very good - probably one of best I have ever had.  Good location very close to all the central Dublin attractions.",5,2007,10,08
236,Great traditional Irish hotel,"Our first trip to Ireland started off with an outstanding 2 night stay at the Brooks. We arrived exhausted after a long flight, and it was a treat to find that the hotel was what I had anticipated - a traditional, fine Irish hotel with excellent service and great location. Our room, although small, was elegantly furnished with a very comfortable king bed and modern bath that supplied all the necessary amenities. Not only is there ""pillow service"" available that allows you to choose the type and firmness levels of your pillows, but they will also provide a foot spa (complimenary) for in-room use to soothe aching feet (so luxurious after a long day of sightseeing). We thoroughly enjoyed the Irish breakfast, which was deliciously prepared. The dining and public areas are tastefully decorated and comfortable, especially the lounge on the lower level which shouldn't be missed. I really can't stress the level of service
enough. The staff was professional, well trained, and efficient, reflecting the high European standards that are usually missing in the US. In summary, a stay here will not disappoint. Almost everything you'll want to see and do in Dublin is within easy walking
distance. It was such a pleasure to return to the comfort and style of this hotel at the end of a very busy day of shopping and sightseeing. We would definately stay here again.",5,2007,10,06
236,Great hotel & great location,"Just returned from a two night break in Dublin at the Brooks Hotel.

We went for a double deluxe room and we weren't disappointed.  We had a Plasma TV, radio, tea & coffee making facilities. en-suite bathroom with plasma and all essentials you could need.

The hotel provides a pillow menu service, I would recommend using it straight away as the pillows provided are not that comfortable.

Room service and fully stocked mini bar was available but this was not cheap, but all hotel mini bars are the same.

We had a full Irish breakfast on both mornings and it was delicious and set us up for the day.

Location was excellent, easy walking distance to Temple Bar and surrounding areas.

The only negative comment I would have is it rained throughout the duration of our stay and the umbrellas provided by the hotel were as good as useless, broken and falling apart.

Catch the aircoach if you are travelling to the airport from outside the tourist information centre on Suffolk Street.  For 7 EURO this seemed the quickest and easiest way to get to and from the airport.

The Guinness storehouse is a must visit.  Great and informative tour of Irelands number one export.

Avoid an Indian Restaurant called 'A Taste of India' as it is extortionate and for what you pay the food is not that great.

We highly recommend the Temple Bar area for great food and drink.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definately come back again.",5,2007,10,06
236,"Good location, average hotel.","I have just spent 2 nights here with a friend. The welcome was good and throughout our stay the staff were pleasant. Our room was big enough, as was the bathroom, but was not particularly special in any way. The bed was comfortable and it was quiet (especially for a city centre hotel). The air conditioning worked but was noisy when on.
Our main problem was with breakfast, we went for the continental option, the coffee was tasteless and the buffet was depleted although there was an hour left of service. We ended up with some fruit and toast, the cheese and ham on offer never materialised. It was not included in our room rate and we had a much better breakfast elsewhere on the second morning.
We would return here as the location is excellent. We could walk easily to all the main attractions and the main shopping areas. There were a number of good restaurants, bars and shops within 5 minutes walk, Trinity College took about 15mins.",3,2007,10,05
236,Fantastic central hotel,"Stayed here for three nights and was not disappointed - staff were extremely friendly and helpful, room was quiet (we had a room at the back of the hotel away from the front road) and the evening meal we had in the hotel's restaurant was great. Well worth the money to stay in such a central city location teamed with the luxuries you get as part of the package.",4,2007,10,05
236,"Central, Convenient and Classy!","We were greeted with exceptional service as soon as we arrived. The Concierge showed us through tourist maps and was ever so helpful. Thte hotel itself is extremely comfortable, rooms were lovely with luxurious pillow menu. Staff were very curtious and helpful. Restaurant was great, breakfasts delicious. Loved the guest lounge with free internet access.
We stayed here on arrival in Dublin and then again two weeks later after travelling around Ireland - felt like we'd arrived home when we arrived back. A great hotel experience.

236,Elegance in the middle of Dublin,"Very classy hotel. Great position away from the hurly burly of temple bar. Very helpful staff.
",4,2007,09,11
236,Great hotel,"This is absolutely the place to be in Dublin!!! Central location, helpful and friendly staff, beautiful rooms and a grand breakfast.
Perfect place for business or leisure. We had a wonderful weekend.

",5,2007,09,07
236,Great stay at Brooks Hotel,"We spent one night in Dublin celebrating our wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere central and 'special'. We certainly found a treasure!

We were immediately impressed by the well decorated clealiness of the hotel. On arrival at our room we were delighted to find it was spotless and well equipped ( and my wife is a neurotic when it comes to cleanliness!) From the bathroom, to the bed, to the minibar; it was truly an oasis to relax in. There was even a note on the bed inviting us to choose other pillows if we required, down, feather, even triangular!
 
We ate out in the evening but we did have breakfast included next morning. We would have given a 5* rating but although every taste was catered for our full cooked breakfast was, at best, only average and the dining area's decor, with mirrors all around, off-putting.
Overall a very pleasant, good value stop over! We have no hesitation recommending Brooks Hotel.",4,2007,09,06
236,Bang Smack in the centre of Dublin,"First stayed in this hotel about 10 years ago when it was all chintz and Laura Ashley, - you can't beat the location which is about as central as you can get it. the hotel was renovated since then and it much more modern/sleek - well appointed rooms, comfortable beds, even a 'pillow service' if you have a request for a specific pillow type - goose, duck feather etc! Reception friendly and bellman wonderful. Did not breakfast there as there are too many other great cafes in Dublin for recommended. this place is relatively expensive however you cannot beat the location
",5,2007,09,05
236,Really lovely hotel ,"After reading  and checking through the list of Dublin hotels we finally decided  to try Brooks Hotel.The previous reviews seemed good and the location of the hotel perfect for us.
We were not disappointed ! The staff here were so friendly and seemed to take a real pride in their work.The public areas ,including the restaurant were well furnished in a contemporary style.Breakfast s were excellent with fresh fruit,fresh breads etc. as well as the full cooked Irish breakfast.
The bedrooms were cosy with lovely good quality soft furnishings.There was good air conditioning and plenty of hot water. 
There were lots of little cafes' and bars near the hotel and about 10 mins walk away were the many pubs and restaurants at Temple Bar. In fact most of the attractions were just minutes away. 
We would have no hesitation at returning to this hotel.
",5,2007,09,01
236,Absolutely wonderful!,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks for 6 nights and loved everything about it.  The location is wonderful, off a quiet side street yet extremely easy to find.  No major attraction is further than a fifteen minute walk away.  We took taxis twice to the train station, which the desk staff scheduled for us, and they were fifteen minutes early both times.  The room was extremely comfortable, stylish, and well-appointed with a great mattress, pillows, and linens.  The pillow menu was a nice option!  It's obvious that the staff pays close attention to detail and takes pride in satisfying their patrons.  As for the bathroom, it was a nice size and we especially loved the high-power shower.  As others commented, the breakfast, which was included with our room, was excellent.  There is a wide selection of hot items made to order as well as a full traditional Irish breakfast, and the continental breakfast buffet was well above par, with a wide variety of choices.  You can also have breakfast delivered to your room, which is nice.  I can't emphasize enough how friendly and helpful the entire staff was, especially the concierge (as mentioned in other reviews).  They were so knowledgable and efficient!  If we return to Dublin again, we'll stay at the Brooks again without thinking twice!
",5,2007,08,15
236,Disappointed...,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and we were disappointed.  The location was good for shopping and attractions but the view from the bar and reception areas is out to a car park and the view from our room was a brick wall!  On both mornings there was no hot water for either a bath or a shower - the manager informed us that this was due to a faulty boiler.   The manager did offer us a free lunch in compensation but we had already made plans for the day and we would have rather have just had hot water! Each morning we were awoken at 6.30am due to deliveries being carried out below our room.   I notice that one of the review comments on the excellent Irish breakfast.  Well my husband and I did not think the breakfast was anything other than 'okay'.  I have stayed at another hotel outside Dublin and there breakfast was far far better.  On the plus side the staff were excellent - nothing is too much trouble and they are very friendly.
",2,2007,08,12
236,Amazing Hotel,"My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves and stay a night at Brooks. It is an amazing hotel. The staff were so friendly and eager to help. Our room we got was amazing!! We stayed in the delux double room. It was very clean and the beds were just so comfy. My partner would have taken it home if he could. 
Its in a handy part of the city, which was fantastic as currently I am on crutches.
The breakfasts were just lovely. You had an amazing choise of food, from fresh fruits, to your traditional Irish breakfast. 
It is quite a pricey hotel, but for what you get its value for money. We intend to come back over again for a short stay and will without doubt be coming back here again.
",5,2007,07,25
236,We're coming back soon!!!!!,"My husband, I and three daughters stayed at the Brooks for a week in mid July. I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel was! I used to design 5 star hotels before I had three children, so I am pickier that most about accommodations...Firstly, I loved the location! It is on a small street and is SIMPLE to find...and there are signs all over posting arrows to the Brooks in case you do get turned around. It is so close to everything yet, in it's private quiet place. The staff were so accommodating and so kind to my children. We didn't need many taxis as it was so easy to walk everywhere...but when we did it was not a problem and we always need a bigger car/van as there are a total of five in my family.The availability of larger vehicles for parties of five or more is scarce so be prepared for that all over Europe. One day we went to Powerscourt and Glendalough (sp?) and took a private driver on the reccommendation of Conner and J.J. This was the most pleasant was to see some of the beautiful Irish countryside and the driver was absolutely wonderful. Now to the rooms...I found them to be nicely sized by American and  European standards and beautifully appointed with charming interiors. They have fabulous beds (matresses) and fantastic linens. My three daughters loved the Pillow Menu and went a bit overboard ordering pillows for their room!! The staff couldn't have been more patient and kind. Breakfast was included in our reservation which was made directly with the hotel. It is a fantastic hot and cold breakfast which I highly reccommend.
The concierge was wonderful as many previous reviewers have commented about!! Conner is filled with wisdom and great advice about this beautiful country.(We just love him!!) We just arrived back last night from a three an a half week trip but we want to get started soon planning our next visit to the Brooks Hotel.
",5,2007,07,24
236,great hotel in fab location,"Stayed here for 4 nights in Jan 2007.  It's a really nice hotel, staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to many attractions, but the street it is on is still quiet.  The bar has a fabulous selection of whiskeys, which my boyfriend really enjoyed!  It's a very nice bar to relax in after sightseeing, and although the prices are not cheap (this is Dublin!!), they were the same as the bars and pubs we went to, rather than the inflated prices you tend to find elsewhere.

Top tips: ask the concierge for recommendations for dinner, we went to a lovely little restaurant around the corner, which was really nice and exactly what the concierge said it would be.  Also the airport bus is very good value and handy for the hotel. Last tip: avoid the Clarence hotel (U2's hotel).  We went to the octagon bar there for lunch and a drink and it was one of the most disgusting meals I have ever had.  I'm really not fussy but it was simply fish and vegetables, the fish was watery and so lacking in taste I couldn't deduce what kind of fish it was.  Other than that, all the bars/restaurants we went to were lovely (but pricey!)
",4,2007,07,22
236,Good location for walking to central Dublin attractions,"We spent two nights at the Brooks as a base for seeing Dublin.   The location is great for walking to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College and the rest of central Dublin.  The room and bathroom were fine but not as grand as I expected given the price and hotel rating.  Our room was on the Drury Street side and we were awakened briefly by loud drunks on the street at 3:00 a.m. Saturday night.  An interior room would be a better choice, especially since the view on the street was of the back side of a parking garage.  

The bar and restaurant are very nice and the visitor's lounge would be a great place for a group to gather.  

The staff were nice and very helpful with suggestions for area restaurants and tours.
",3,2007,07,12
236,Nice but not a 4 star!,"Returned home yesterday from a 3 night break at the Brooks Hotel.  On arrival from the airport by the aircoach (€12 return - and definitely worth taking), we were dropped off in the centre.  It was quite difficult to find the hotel as it's down a side street as already mentioned by other reviewers but we eventually found it by friendly locals giving us directions.

On entering the hotel we were met by the receptionist who was very nice and friendly and then Connor (consierge) took us to one side and gives you a map and a few words of wisdom (he's a really nice chap and knows his stuff).  First impressions were very good.

Was a bit disappointed with the hotel room as it wasn't very big at all and not what we expected for a 4 star.  I know we didn't spend much time in there but we've stayed in travel lodges with bigger rooms!  On a positive note though, the power shower is the best one we've ever experienced and wish we could have taken it home.

Dublin City Centre is a very large town and we wish we'd have stayed an extra day as we came across some things on the last day and it was too late!  We did the sightseeing tour which was on the hop on/hop off bus and is well worth the €14.  Kilmainham Gaol is an absolute must see (€5.30 and takes about an hour), we really enjoyed it and had a great tour guide (James).

All in all the hotel is in a great position as you can walk to all the local shops,bars,attractions etc within a few minutes and we would definitely stay at the Brooks Hotel again (maybe try and get a much cheaper deal though).
",4,2007,07,12
236,"Cozy hotel, in a GREAT LOCATION!","Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for 3 nights in Dublin in early June. It has comfortable accommodations in an excellent location. It is right at the foot of Grafton Street and a short walk to Temple Bar. The nice thing is that it's tucked away on a more quiet street, but you are still so close to all the action that  Dublin has to offer. We didn't have to take a cab anywhere. You should stay here if you want to stay at clean, cozy, hotel that's in a great location, but won't break the bank.
",4,2007,07,10
236,Nice Hotel but limited,"Stayed three nights at the Brooks Hotel in June/July. 

The staff are a mixture of Irish and East European, all very freindly and welcoming.

It's location, though in a graffiti adorned scruffy back street, was very central.

The room we had was classed as superior and was slightly dissapointing. Nothing really specific, it was clean and not a bad size however for the price it was quite average and lacked some of the basic things we like. Housekeeping was not totally sharp either as used coffee cups were still in the room after it had been serviced and we had to ask for things to be replaced in the bathroom

City centre hotels can be bland and characterless irrespective of what you pay and we think this is the case with the Brooks. The view from our window was of the back of a restaurant, all steam pipes and beer barrels making so much noise the window had to stay closed.

The staff whilst very smiley and freindly are a tad unproffessional. When we wanted a 7 seater taxi (to go to the Joe Cocker / Al Green concert with our friends) the receptionist rang one company without success and gave up until we suggested the yellow pages and two calls later we got our cab. On our return from the concert at midnight we went to the bar to get a snack. It took 20 minutes to get a cup of coffee as ""the machine is new and nobody knows how it works"".

The staff it must be said were very young. The oldest we saw was under 30 and this may have had a bearing on our experience. Whilst these youngsters did their best the management should perhaps consider a mixture of more experienced staff to acheive the class they are charging for,

Dublin is a great city and we've enjoyed several trips here in the past. However, we think the Brooks reflects a malais which has crept into the City best decribed as "" Charge as much as you can and give the least "". It's a shame because Dublin has much to offer and being probably the most expensive city in Europe would be acceptable if it tried a little harder.

236,Made our trip to Dublin special,"Stayed here last weekend and it has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff are very friendly and it has a nice bar and restaurant with lovely food.
The hotel is in an excellent position just mins walk to Temple bar and the great shops in Grafton Street. 
The room was spacious and well decorated with tea/coffe making facilities. There are even speakers in the bathroom so you can listen to what ever is on the tv.
Would recommend to all it certainely won't dissapoint.

236,very average.,"we have just spent a week in this so called luxury hotel, staying in a 'classic' room. Whilst the hotel is clean and comfortable it is certainly nothing out of the ordinary, except perhaps the residents lounge in the basement, which is certainly a most attractive room but too cold to sit in for more than about 10 minutes. if you go expecting something special, i think you will be disappointed.

236,bunking at the brooks,"this is a centrally located hotel with easy access to some great restaurants, trinity college, st. stephan green, etc.

The rooms are very comfortable but do  ask to get off the street (i did but was not accommodated) as there is a little bit of street noise.

The breakfast is above average and the bar a wonderful place to unwind at the end of the day.

Would stay again.

236,"Nice Place, Great Location, Excellent Service","Great service from the front desk, to conceriege, to restraunt servers.  Quick walk to Dublin Castle, Guiness Factory, Temple Bar, Grafton shopping, Trinity College, and St Patrick's Cathedral.  Pillow menu was nice.  Easy Internet access in room.  Food and lodging in Dublin is expensive.  People are very friendly to american's.  For best exchange rates use local ATM's (you get the true exchange rate).  Some of the Guiness Store shirts at the factory were cheaper on Grafton Street.  Contact your credit card fraud departments prior to going to Europe (if you live in the US).  Chances are they will put a hold on your card after several purchases if they don't know you are out of the country.

236,Wonderful breakfast at the Brooks!,"We had two separate stays at the Brooks Hotel last week.  We stayed for one night after arriving in Dublin late in the evening and then returned after a weekend in the countryside to stay for another four days.  I was very pleased with the hotel and our experience there.  Considering its location in the center, the hotel is quiet and we slept well there.  (There was some noise from the corridor so you may wish to pack earplugs.)  We booked into a superior room both times and the rooms were roomy and comfortable.

The breakfast each morning was easily the highlight of the day.  In particular, the cold buffet was fresh and tasty.  Some of the hot food was not as exciting, but it was easy to pick and choose what we wanted each day.

Some of the small details could use a bit of work.  Although there was supposed to be an iron in the room, one needed to be brought to me.  But it arrived quickly and worked well.  When we left the hotel at the end of the first stay, I left a garment bag with clothes that I would not need until the next week when we returned.  When we came back on Sunday, I asked that the bag be brought up to the room.  The woman working at the desk assured me that it would be.  When I got to the room, the bag was already waiting.  It would have been very easy for the staff at the desk to impress me and to score extra points by letting me know that they had taken care of delivering the bag. 

 As noted in other reviews, Connor is fantastic and I'm sure that this would have been noted in the computer during the week.  The hotel was well-located for our sightseeing as well as my work commitments the next week.  I was very glad to have selected the Brooks Hotel over the hotel where my conference in Dublin was being held.

236,Lively Dublin with a Great Hotel,"Recently returned from a 3 night stay in Dublin at the Brookes.  Took early flight from Liverpool - Which basically means you go up - you come down.  Travelled with my sister and my mum.  Got a taxi from the airport lovely driver very chatty and great sense of humour.  On arriving at hotel (time pre 9.00am) we met Connor who so kindly took care of my mum arranging a seat and some tea for us all.  Room not ready until afternoon but no problem left cases and with some directions and advice from Connor made our way to Grafton Street.  On returning around 2.00 pm room ready.  Hotel has lovely comfortable rooms, enjoyed meal in hotel that evening.  We dragged our poor mum (in her seventies) to Temple Bar every night.  Had a few nice meals in a resturant called The Shack in Temple Bar.   Connor from the Brookes is an absolute gem,  he came to see us every morning,  made a big fuss of my mum always made the beginning of her day special.  

The problem we did have with the hotel (and I hate to moan) was that it was my sisters wedding anniversary on the day we arrived.  It was the only time we were all able to travel together and my sister and her husband agreed to celebrate upon our return.  However my sisters  husband had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be delivered to our room which did not arrive until our last evening (monday).  This was  only after her husband contacting the hotel and me speaking to reception staff. I was phoning and texting home whilst needing to keep it all a secret from my sister. It was very dissappionting as it was so long after the event and we had been in our hotel room most of Saturday afternoon and ate dinner at the hotel that evening, so plenty of time for it to be delivered.  Not what you expect from a city centre hotel of that level.

 Visited the university, the library and display of the Book of Kells.  Enjoyed City Bus Tour, one of the drivers was so funny we did not want to get off the bus.  Dublin is very expensive which may deter some visitors but the people of Dublin are the friendliest and funniest people who make it all well worth while.

All in all would like to say a big THANK YOU to Connor and everyone we met in Dublin with whom we laughed and  talked and talked and talked, love to you all.

Karen, Maria and June.

236,"Well situated, reasonable stay.","The Brooks Hotel is very close to lots of the attractions in Dublin but is conveniently situated down a quieter street that isn't too noisy. The hotel is quite trendy and boutique like and obviousy suits business persons as well as tourists. Not too many children.

Positives: clean, large rooms that are well furnished, bathrobes in room, nice dining and breakfast menu, helpful staff, the hotel will look after your bags after checkout (and before check in) so that you are free to explore Dublin, responses to calls to reception were prompt.

Negatives: room was not ready until 4.25pm (suposed to be ready at 2pm), packages (I did the girl's night in) are not always as organised as they might be, a 50 euro charge will be added to yor bill provisionally incase you use mini bar / room service (but we weren't told, I asked about the excess provisional charge).

The Brooks is a good hotel and I would stay again; the rooms are comfy and if you get a room at the back of the hotel, it is quieter still. It is a good base and with a bit more organisation and thought (if you book a 'special package') the minor hiccups would disappear. Make sure that you ask for clarification if you are unsure about what is available to you; the staff are helpful.

Value for Money? The hotel is a bit pricey BUT it is a 4* and in Dublin you get what you pay for.

We booked direct through the hotel; efficient.

(see my other reviews for other hotels; honest fair reviews)

236,A Hidden Gem!,"Brooks proved to be a superb choice, which we selected for some quality 'chill-out' time together (partner & I), away from the more mundane daily life of home and work!  

Central location between Temple Bar (for oubs and traditional live music) and Grafton Street (wicked for shops!).

Bedrooms were spacious, beds were huge, decor modern, and clean, bright bathrooms.  Everything you could wish for and more.  

Ample choice for breakfast (I'm afraid only a long w/e stay meant we didn't have time to eat dinner in).

First class service from the frienly staff.  The hidden gem in this hotel, is the lounge in the basement - a beautiful room which clearly not many residents find.  Go and enjoy!
",5,2007,05,30
236,Great Location,"Myself and my partner travelled to Dublin for an overnight stay mid May. We wanted a 4*/5* Hotel in the Temple Bar area. We decided on Brooks as it was a member of the small luxury hotels of the world, having stayed in a hotel belonging to this group before we had high expectations. We were slighty disappointed with several aspects of the hotel. The room was just ok with the bathroom being extremely small despite having upgraded to a luxury room. There is no car parking attached to the hotel but there is a car park just across the street but parking charges can add up. Breakfast was good and the location of this hotel can not be faulted. It was quiet at night and the bed was very comfy. If you are looking for luxury look elsewhere. If you want a hotel right in the thick of things but yet you want to get a goodnights sleep I couldn't recommend anywhere better!! You are a five minute walk from the heart of Temple Bar and Grafton Street/Dawson Street are a short stroll away. Just don't bring the bubble bath or many clothes as there is no where to hang them and you can't lie in the bath as its not big enough!!
",3,2007,05,30
236,Excellent location and staff,"Stayed here over May Bank Holiday weekend and had a fab time!
The hotel is tucked away just off Grafton Street and could not be in a better location - close to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Museums etc.

Room was extremely comfortable with super king size bed and well equipped bathroom. 

It was pricey but I guess you get what you pay for and I would definitely stay here again. 

Unlike many of the pubs/restaurants we visited, all the staff we encountered at Brooks were English or Irish and could not have been more professional. Excellent all round.
",4,2007,05,20
236,Great location,"Found this hotel through Tripadvisor, and was not disappointed.  It was a short combined business/pleasure trip, and Brooks has a great location in the heart of downtown.  Temple Bar was minutes away, and great shops around the corner.

Everything is pricey in Dublin, and this hotel was not out of line.  The room was well-sized and well-equipped, with four-star accessories.   An expensive breakfast, but it was excellent, including hotel-made Irish breads.
",4,2007,05,16
236,"Nice location, great staff","This hotel is nicely located within walking distance to all major Dublin attractions.  The street the hotel is located on is a bit run down, but the hotel it self is quite nice, comfortable rooms except the bathroom needed a makeover.
",4,2007,05,10
236,A great find!!,"A diamond in the rough on a tough-to-find street around the corner from Grafton Street. With a car park directly across the Street, Brooks is one of the more convenient places you could stay if you want close access to both Trinity College and Grafton Street. Rooms are very clean, the restaurant is good and Connor (concierge) is FANTASTIC. Highly recommended for a stay in Dublin proper.
",5,2007,05,04
236,chic city base,"This stylish and very friendly hotel is a great base for enjoying Dublin.

It is compact and dont expect views, but the staff and the quality of the rooms and lounges are excellent . Parking is just opposite and a breeze. Be prepared for the task of navigating inner Dublins narrow one way streets, but it is worth it.   Lovely atmosphere,  great location, and very comfortable
",5,2007,05,01
236,Great location,"We stayed here over Easter for the Irish Grand National and can't fault it.  As everyone says, the location is excellent - close to good restaurants, bars, St Stephen's Green, Trinity College etc.  The pillow menu is certainly novel (choose from a selection of different pillows) and aids a good night's sleep in a comfortable room.   The hotel is very tastefully decorated and we enjoyed dinner here one night in Francesca's.   The Dublin city bus tour is worth taking and Kilmainham Gaol is definitely worth visiting.   Cafe en Seine in Dawson Street is worth a visit one evening for its spectacular decor and cocktails.  Would definitely recommend Brooks hotel and stay here again.
",5,2007,04,25
236,Nice Stay-Great location,"This hotel is a jem.  Location is outstanding and the staff was outstanding, especially Conner.  He met us at the door and called us by name through out our stay.  Great Pubs near by and an easy walk to all of central Dublin.  Nice Grocery/wine bar just around the corner with a large cellar downstairs.  Very good for and afternoon glass.  Sorry I don't recall the name, but I know Conner will! This made it easy on three gererations of family traveling together. Considering how expensive Dublin is, if you can book early and get a good rate this hotel is a great value.

236,GREAT!!,"Stayed at this lovely hotel with my husband for 2 nights before easter in April, 2007.
A most prof and worm welcome with really serviceminded concierge.
We had a superior/delux room which was newly renovated and with everything you look for in a ""getawayweekendroom"".
Breakfast delicious, although the Full Irish cooked breakfast was made when ordered, it was a little bit .. boring. But everything else ..... LOVELY. Bar is quiet in evening, but classy, made great drinks and had a vast selection of whiskeys from all over the world. Bartenders with knowledge.
Hotel has a perfect location on quiet street but with a few steps walk from Graftonstreet and all nearby restaurants and shopping and cafees.

236,Fab stay In Dublin,"I've just returned from a wonderful stay at Brooks Hotel. I travelled with my mum and as it was her first visit to Dublin I was anxious the hotel would match other reviewers great experiences. It did! We arrived very early because of flight times but the hotel booked us in anyway and we had breakfast, one hour later our room was ready. Breakfast was lovely, the hotel has a soothing  and calming air about it.
The room was spotless and beautifully decorated- situated towards the back, the view wasn't much but who goes to Dublin for a hotel view? The location is great for shopping and walking around the sights. We had a drink in the gorgeous bar before going out each evening, it's cheaper than the pubs in Temple Bar! The staff are professional and warm and made our stay stress free. A great hotel which I would gladly return to.
",5,2007,04,04
236,Nice friendly hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Brooks in March. We stayed in a spacious room which was on the 5th floor.  Overall the hotel was great.  Agreed, it doesn't have fantastic views (multi-story car park) but the view wasn't high on our agenda.  Staying here is a great position, right between Temple Bar and St Stevens Green / Grafton Street (Brown Thomas!!!) and easily walkable to the Guiness storehouse and all the main sights. Phoenix park is about 40 min stroll. Couldn't have picked a better location.

Main Positives were :

. Location 
. Relaxed and friendly staff, no stuffiness
. Lovely decorated, spacious room with great climate control.
. Great Breakfast, wide choice, good quality and prompt service
. Great Whiskey bar to retreat to in the evening - well done to Michael who knows his stuff ! 
. Pillow menu - fabulous
. Tea and cofee in the room (seems to be getting rare nowadays)
. Bottles of water in the room
. Deceivingly comfortable  huge beds with wonderfully crisp clean sheets.
. Marvelous bathroom - heated mirrors which don't steam up when one of you is in the shower
. TV piped into the bathroom room (made me jump out of my skin!). 
. Piping hot water and powerful shower at all times.
. Taxi booked for us for return to Airport - on time, no probs.
. Room was spotless 

Slightly disappointing :

. Bit disconcerting that our luggage wasn't in our room as promised (we arrived too early to check in and they told us our bags would be in our room by 2:00pm).  They found them eventually, but it took a while.
. Although incredibly warm and friendly, the concierge told us that the Jamesons whiskey tour was closed.  We were initially very disappointed :( but later thrilled when a bus driver told us it has re-opened :) SO - don't always believe all you are told. ..
. TV signal was sometimes poor and we couldn't get Channel 4 at all.

Reading the  diverse range of reviews on this website is rather interesting. Having only stayed here once, we can only comment on our own room, but the room rates do seem to vary and there is some re-furbishment going on. We payed 210Euros a night for B&B, which we booked via an independent site on the Web and it was classed as a Superior room. So, in terms of the overall package, I think we got exactly what we paid for and we would not hesitate to stay here again.

Hotel aside, we would recommend the following local restaurants :

The Bistro - Castlemarket. Great lunchtime menus, friendly staff and fish and chips to die for.
Yamamori - Georges St - great Japanese / Sushi
Siam - Andrew Street - Thai - really good quality food, nice setting, great service.

Our favourite Guiness - Conways on the corner of Parnell St (off O'Connell st) and Moor St. Really creamy.
OR
Gravity Bar at the guiness storehouse - gets very busy up there, so go early if you can.

Obviously these are just our views and we didn't visit every bar and restaurant (despite trying).

If you don't fancy walking I would recommend you use the circular tour buses which have commentary (quality varies depending on the driver). For 15 EU you get a 24hr pass and the buses run every 10 minutes, so you can jump off, do the sights and back on the next one - or if you get a witty driver, stay on for the circuit !

Shopping in Grafton street is fab and Brown Thomas has wonderful designer gear - not to be missed. Alternatively, Henry Street (off O'Connell St) offers more affordable alternatives.

Lastly, don't miss the Guiness Gravity bar and if you like Whiskey do the Jamesons tour if it is open (and make sure you volunteer for the tasting at the end).

Hope you find this useful.

236,Great hotel,"Stayed here for two nights in late February.  The hotel was difficult to find but we were prepared for that based on the comments.  Once we found it, we parked across the street in the lot.  That was our one mistake for the trip.  When we checked in moments later, the desk staff did not ask us if we had a car or any of the usual questions.  I do have to agree with some of the recent comments that I thought the girls at the front desk lacked a spark or any real personality.  The problem we discovered was when we went to leave at 5:30 AM a couple days later we found the car park was closed.   Luckily we hadn't left much in the car - nothing important.  The man on duty in the hotel took care of everything (arranging to have the car picked up by the agency, etc. and got us a van to the airport).    Not a huge deal but it could've been a problem to others.  Other than that, the room was fantastic - comfortable beds and every ammenity you could need.  We were on the 5th floor and had a slight view which, in Dublin, was something.  I loved the location.  So close to everything but on a quiet side street.  We didn't eat at the hotel but did have drinks in the bar.  The service and quality of the drinks was very disappointing but that certainly wouldn't stop us from recommending the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.

236,Poor Choice,"My Son and I reserved a room for Feb. 28 and March 1,2007.
We checked in and the receptionist was not helpful or friendly. When we went to the very small room, we constantly had trouble with the heating system throughout the stay. They had cheap wooly scratchy blankets on the bed.   We had been charged double what we were offered by Hotels.com. Originally 85 euros night, but
it became $175 euros.They wouldn't change our United States
currency to euros because they had a policy against accepting $100
bills.  Then the restaurant: We sat down and there was only one 
table occupied in the entire restaurant. After being served it took 15 mins.from the time we finished to get coffee.  The server was busy taking care of a take out order. It's no wonder they were empty. They took our coffee order and that took 10  minutes. We wrote a note to the hotel about it but they didn't respond.  The only redeeming thing about the hotel was the bar.They were well stocked and outstandingly helpful.  A male customer was being hassled at
the desk. He had reserved 6 rooms and he wanted  to pay for them.
They wouldn't let him. They told him each one would have to pay.
It was a nightmare.

236,"Nice Hotel, Dark Street","We stayed in the Brooks Hotel on March 18th, 2007. The hotel is well accommodated and clean but the front desk staff  with whom we dealt had few social skills.  The concierge, by the name of PJ was wonderful, friendly and possessing all the people skills the front desk lacked.  The hotel itself was difficult to find and at night was on a dark street.  We would not stay here again as there are many other hotels easier to locate and in a better neighborhood.  Our arrangements were through the Irish Tourism group.

236,Dublin a city Paradise,"Just got back from a fabulous break in Dublin. My partner and i stayed at Brooks Hotel for 2 nights. I have no idea why I haven't visited sooner. From the moment we walked into the hotel the staff were great. Our room was not quite ready when we arrived at 8.00am (checkin is not until 2.00pm) however they got the room ready for us by 12 midday and it gave us a chance to explore, and find a place to eat a full Irish Breakie! 

The food in the hotel is brilliant, we ate both from the Jasmine Bar Menu at lunch time and the Francesca’s  A La Carte Menu in the evening. (Try the beef noodle salad, Yum!) The breakfast is the best, such a wide variety of fruit, pastries, cooked breakfast, cereal, porridge, toast, scramble egg, boiled egg need I go on. (Special thanks to Adele who made my birthday evening a pleasure to dine in the restaurant)

The rooms were well equipped with hair dryer, iron, trouser press, safe, power shower (as someone mentioned in a previous review the temperature did drop a bit but not long enough to make showering uncomfortable), massive double bed, pillow menu, tea/coffee, TV, air con, lots of towels and mini shampoo etc. Our room was on the 3rd floor and looked out onto the road with a car park opposite for a view, however not noisy at all and what sort of view do you expect in a city! (We were not in the room long enough to even want to look out the windows as there is so much to do and see)

We spent 3 days walking and discovering various parts of the city from the National Gallery, St Stephens Green, shopping in Henry and Grafton Street, Temple Bar (which is just as fab in the day as it is at night) to finding little market stalls off St Georges Street and the Photography Library in Temple Bar.
You can get buses but the taxi driver said that they were not very frequent and we did not want to miss anything.

The hotel staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. On my birthday they brought to our room a Foot Spa and Champagne. Which were both very much appreciated after the long day walking around the amazing city.

I loved Dublin and do not think as many told me that it was expensive, the Dubliners made our trip and their city manages to be quirky, busy, sophisticated, cultural, relaxing and fun all at once.

If you decide to go to Dublin, definitely stay at Brooks Hotel for a central location, it is far enough away from the noise of temple bar but close enough to experience the whole city centre. Without a doubt I would stay at Brooks again when I come back to Dublin.

236,Fantastic!!,"Having just literally returned form a 2 night stay at the brooks hotel I wanted to write and say how fantastic we found the hotel.  This is the first time I have ever stopped and taken the time to do this which for me highlights how good we thought the hotel was. The hotel is situated in a fantastic position for all the main highlights Grafton Street/Temple bar and close for bus tours and getting to main attractions, however the hotel is situated just far enough away to avoid all the husstle, busstle and noise! We had a room on the top floor at the rear of the hotel and although the view was nothing exceptional it was very quiet. The room itself was very spacious with excellent facilities.  On arrival the first thing that struck us was the friendly staff and I must mention Connor the head concierge who was absolutely fantastic!! No he isnt after money as a thankyou he really is that friendly and nothing is to much trouble.  The brooks hotel has added to what has been a truly fantastic weekend away to Dublin.  It was recommended to ourselves and I would recommend it to anyone.

236,Super Central Dublin,"Our first trip to Ireland from South Texas. Stayed 3 nights. Hotel staff was very attentive and gave us great advice regarding local dining and attractions. In house retaurant and bar were great. Room was small but my wife absolutely loved (!!) the pillow menu. We were a bit worried about noise in the heart of Dublin but the Brooks is off any of the main streets and traffic, etc was not an issue.  Location is superb for folks who like to walk a city and really see what's around.

All in all I highly recommend this hotel. It fully lived up to expectations and was reasonably priced for all it had to offer.  We are a couple that has traveled extensively and do not seek low end bargains. So our opinions are colored by a bias toward service and quality. The Brooks lived up to those expectations.",5,2007,02,28
236,Faultless,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin which was absolutely fantastic.
The room was luxurious with great touches such as the option to choose the type of pillow you would prefer, the CD's left for you to play in the CD player and the TV on the wall at the end of the bath.
The service was faultless from the day we arrived until we left.
Breakfast was good and the service there was excellent too.
The hotel is located a very short walk from Grafton Street in one direction and Temple Bar in the other so it is ideal for visting all areas of the city.
I can't honestly think of a negative thing to say about the place and I would definitely stay there again.

236,"Comfortable, Convenient Stay at the Brooks Hotel","We just finished a one week vacation stay at the Brooks Hotel during our visit to Dublin.  We selected the hotel based on reviews on this website.

Overall, we had a really pleasant stay.  The hotel location is perfect for exploring Dublin's dowtown neighborhoods, which are all within a short walking distance.  There are a number of excellent restaurants in the immediate vicinity.  

The hotel exudes a casual elegance.  

We had a superior room with breakfast included.  The king size beds are very comfortable, and the rooms are cosy with good temperature control.  We enjoyed the ""power"" shower in the bathroom, as this is an unusual feature in most hotels, particularly in Europe. The hotel is clean, and the staff are pleasant.  We thought the reading room available to guests in the lower level of the hotel was very comfortable.  

We were wakened by street noise on the front of the hotel when the neighbourhood pubs emptied out around 3 am on Friday and Saturday night.  Dublin does a fair amount of streetcleaning, often in the wee hours, and this also woke us up.  Overall, noiseproofing was a bit of a problem in our room, perhaps the rear of the hotel would be better.

We ate at ""Francesca"" restaurant in the hotel one night, and had a great meal.  The bar is pleasant for a drink, with a fireplace and a sophisticated atmosphere.

The breakfast in the hotel was a bit disappointing, with limited variety, and bad coffee.  I suppose if you're interested in a heavy traditional Irish breakfast, the cost might be worth it, otherwise, I would go elsewhere.  We did not feel that this was particularly good value.

The front reception staff were hit and miss, with mainy trainee staff at the time of our visit, and some difficulty making our requests clear due to language differences.  Concierge staff were very pleasant, but the service level fell short of a first class hotel. 

We used the local bus service to get around town, when needed, and did the Wild Wicklow tour, which was fun. We also hit a week of clear skies and some sunshine in February, so we are feeling fortunate!

With some reservations, I would certainly recommend this hotel, and would consider staying here again.

It was a lovely room (we were upgraded to a superior or deluxe room) and very clean - lots of extras including flat screen TV in the bathroom.
We went to the Temple Bar Pub that night and listened to a band - absolutely fantastic.

236,"A great hotel, to be sure!","I booked this hotel as a surprise for my fiancee's 30th Birthday and we both loved the hotel. It is in a great location, our room was lovely and it was just a standard room, you even get a pillow menu so you chose what type of pillows you want!  The staff are all very friendly and the service at Breakfast is great. The breakfast menu itself is extensive with the obvious full irish breakfast which was superb to the brooks style traditional porridge which is made with cream and a shot of whiskey. If you like whiskey the bar has over 75 different sorts!   Another bonus is that breakfast is served til 11.30 at weekends so you can have a lie in and check out is 12pm. We would recommend Brooks as a great hotel in a great location with lovely staff and service.

236,Brooks Hotel – Wow!,"My husband, sister and brother-in-law and myself all agree that this place was superb. We all stayed at five other properties throughout Ireland and agreed that this was amongst the best!
We arrived in Dublin at 8:00 a.m. and caught a cab almost immediately after claiming our luggage. The hotel is a short ten to fifteen minute ride and enjoyable if you have the cab driver we had. 
Upon our arrival, we were greeted by three staff members with a quick check-in process and a wonderful host by the name of Clarence who informed us of all of the must sees before being able to get into our rooms. His suggestions were wonderful for a short stay in Dublin.
We returned to our rooms to find our luggage had been placed in our beautiful and elegant room. We napped to try to help our jet lag when we heard a knock at the door. Suprisingly we had been sleeping for three hours and were wakened to turn-down service and chocolates. yum!
The following day we wlaked miles through Dublin and enjoyed the spectacular sights. We were glad that our hotel was in walking distance to almost everything, without the noise and traffic. 
We would definitley stay at the Brooks Hotel again. It was elegant, cozy and home away from home.
p.s. Don't miss out on the food either.

236,A weekend of luxury,"I bought my husband a weekend in Dublin as his Christmas present. We had a great time and Brooks Hotel was the perfect choice. When we arrived on Friday evening we had been upgraded to a suite - very comfortable with a very inviting bed and pillows - just what we needed after travelling after a day at work. The breakfast was excellent - home made bread, jam, fresh fruit and a large cooked breakfast if you wanted. The service was good, everybody was very friendly and helpful. The noise outside was what I would have expected for a city centre hotel - didn't keep me awake after all that walking around. I would highly recommmend this hotel and would definately stay there again!

236,Great Location,"Great Location, very polite and professional staff, rooms were a little small and no water provided. We stayed on first floor and there was a lot of noise from street.  Excellent breakfast
",4,2007,01,29
236,very nice hotel,"Stayed one night in Jan. we were given an upgrade to a large comfortable room. Welcome was professional and all staff were pleasant. Breakfast good with plenty of choice and cooked food produced to order. I would highly reccommend this hotel. my only minor quibble was the scrambled egg. This was truly unpleasant(looked like it had beem microwaved ) Avoid at all costs

236,Dublin in Winter,"My Wife and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel Dublin over the 20th January weekend 2007.
Over the years we have stayed in all types of hotel in Dublin. Indeed our first trip was in 1980 when we stayed in the nearby Blooms Hotel before the Temple Bar area was reinvented as a major tourist venue.
Through the years we stayed, with our children, in most of the major hotels for short breaks or airport or ferry stops.
We have seen the explosion of hotel numbers over the years and charted the increase in price. Gone are the days when hotels advertised extra nights free over the weekend and room only was an hoteliers dream.
So to the review - Brooks is difficult to find if you are arriving by car. The one-way system makes finding the hotel a challenge but luckily there is a large car park directly opposite. 
The hotel operates a voucher system with the car park, which allows one to park from Friday evening to Sunday lunchtime for only 19 euro.
We were able to avail of this service because the hotel is very close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Stephens Green and the Luas. 
We used a taxi there and back to see Willie Nelson in the Point Depot.
Our room was excellent and the bed was one of the largest and most comfortable we've experienced. A turn down service was available but I’ve never seen the point to this. 
I would much prefer if hotels invested in, say, softer bath robes or suchlike as I’ve never yet come across a bath robe that I would like to take home with me.
Staff at the hotel was friendly and efficient especially the cleaning staff who were unfailingly friendly when met on the corridors doing their tasks.
A small gripe was with reception staff on arrival. 
Whilst trying to check in I had great difficulty in making myself understood. Surely this is a key position in the hotel and no one should be in this role without a very clear grasp of the spoken language.
We enjoyed the breakfasts in the hotel and could only admire the speed and efficiency of the catering staff.
Sterling is strong at the moment against the euro, but don't be fooled, Dublin is a very expensive city to stay in: but then, we've known that for a very long time now and we are still happy to return to sample the friendliness, history and facilities.
Brooks is an excellent hotel; we enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Recommended!
",4,2007,01,24
236,"Good hotel, great location","The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierges always took the time to help us get around the city and give us recommendations on places to go and things to do. They went out of the way to send us fresh fruit and a card when they heard this was an anniversary trip. The location of the hotel was perfect. It was an easy walk to many attractions and very convenient to transportation. If the package that includes breakfast is offered definitely take it. The meals are filling and delicious and there is a sufficient selection to choose from.
",4,2007,01,23
236,Lovely Hotel,"Me and Boyfriend stayed at Brooks hotel on the 13th Jan. We got to the hotel at about 9.00am as we landed very early and checked into the hotel but we couldn't go into our room until 2.00pm. The hotel staff greeted us and allowed us to store our bags until we came back later. The hotel is in a great location and we really enjoyed the tour bus. Def visit the Gunniess factory as it was lots of fun and you are able to pull your own pint! When we checked back into the hotel we got the room (206) our bags where already in our rooms for us. The room was nice the decor could have done with a bit updating. When our bath didn't work reception was called and someone came straight away. Shame about the view as we over looked a car park, but thats what you expect with being in a city. The reception area in the hotel and the resturant and the bar where lovely and def a 4*. The breakfast in the morning was gorgeous and lots of choice and variety. Overall we had a fantastic stay and we would def return to the Brooks Hotel.
",4,2007,01,19
236,A bit shabby,"This hotel is in a good location but struggles to maintain its 4 star rating.  Our room (202) was quite small with poor accessibility and no ventilation in the bathroom.  It’s the little things that make a visit special or disappointing.  The broken hair dryer (clearly broken and badly patched with tape a long time ago) and the worn bedspread just pushed us over the edge into disappointment.  For 140 Euro per night I think something better could be found.  Keep looking.
",3,2007,01,18
236,"Great location, needs improvements","My Wife and I stay at the Brooks Hotel for 4 nights over New Year.  The Hotel is in a great location, with a number of wonderful restaurants within walk distance.  Our room was very large, with funky decoration, and two large arm chairs.  The bed looked huge, but was actually two separate mattress strapped together which was a little annoying.  The bathroom was ok, but a heated towel rail would have been nice!  

The water pressure was great however on the morning of New Year Eves my wife was forced to endure a cold show, and when I contacted reception I got an apology but nothing else. That day we both got very wet waiting to enter the Guinness Store House, which is well worth a visit, but buy your tickets on-line before hand, to both safe money and time.  When we got back to the hotel we were gutter to find out there was still no hot water, therefore my wife had to wash her hair using the small kettle which was in the room, and took forever.  When I contact reception again, I was told that the problem was due to the fact that the boiler was not filling up, and was properly due to high demand, within the hotel.  The next morning the water situation had appear to have been resolved, however this is not the kind of service I expect from a 4 star hotel, and at no point was I able to speak to the Manager.

We only had breakfast in the hotel one morning, and we found both the food and service to be very disappointing for the high cost, however we found a place in Grafton Street which server great food and have a nice atmosphere, Brewley’s.

Overall, I think I would only return to this hotel, if it is was out of season and was at an unbelievable low price.

236,faultless,"me and my husband are just back from a few days spent at brooks hotel  and i was glad to see that it definitely lives up to the great reviews that i saw on tripadvisor before i booked out trip.

DIRECTIONS
we followed the direction that were laid out on hotels.com but by following these we got completely lost, but we got there eventually. after this we found that when you come out through the front doors of the hotel, you need to turn right and go down to the end of the street where you will see a hairdressers called the zoo straight accross the road, when you see this you take a turn to the right and this will bring you out onto grafton street, the hotel is so central and is in a great location

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
the outside of the hotel is impressive and it looks kind of out of place on such a small street, we walked into the reception area which is very small and cosy and isnt over fancy or over posh in any way.
we got  a really friendly welcome  from the receptionist who checked us in really quickly and without fuss.

BEDROOM
we booked a deluxe room which was 218 on the second floor
we were welcomed into the room with music playing on an old fashioned radio, there was a plate of fruit and on the bed there was lots of rose petals shaped in a heart, this i had ordered beforehand and it was done just perfectly.

the room was spacious and done in lots of dark wood, the bed was king-size and made up lovely with a nice quilt and matching cushions.
there is the usual tea/coffee making facilities which were hide away in the wardrobe but could be pulled out like a tray for convenience. there was a trouser press and an iron also.

but my favourite part of the room was the keypad on the wall which controlled the heating and could be switched on/off to suit and changed to whatever temperature we  wanted.  i really loved this because the last time we stayed in  dublin, the hotel room we stayed in was always freezing and it ruined our stay.

the room was so cosy and beautifully decorated, but not over the top in any way, it was just perfect., and as for the bed i wanted to bring it home with me, it was so large.

BATHROOM
the bathroom was large and had a separate shower cubicle, AND  a bath. it was beautifully tiled and had black shiny surfaces and was done in pine coloured wood, there was beautiful smelling toiletries and also bathrobes, the bathroom is very ultra modern and beautiful.
  
JASMINE BAR
the bar is very cosy and relaxing after a day walking around dublin.  there is a gorgeous fire at the back of the seating area  which makes it very  homely and  a lot of time could be spent sitting in there with just a book and a drink to realx, is very quiet and peaceful, and beautifully decorated in dark colours, also the drinks are reasonably priced.

OVERALL OPINION
this was my first time at brooks but it definitely wont be the last, i just did not want to leave and me and my husband cannot wait to go back again. i highly recommend it to everyone, i have stayed in a lot of hotels but none as nice as this one, its such a beautiful hotel hidden away in just the right place and the staff cant be faulted.
if you ever visit dublin then stay at brooks and you cant go wrong.

236,Great boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel and I would absolutely stay there again.  It's quite modern but cozy nonetheless, with a great bar and nice-sized, comfortable rooms.  The breakfast was incredible every morning.  During lunch there was a pianist there who added to the environment.  The beds were great, the bathroom had a nice array of products and the staff was helpful.  You're just a few blocks from all of the sights in downtown Dublin and the hotel is a good refuge for when you just want to relax and be pampered a bit.  Highly recommended!
",4,2007,01,11
236,Brooks hotel is magnificent,"Spent three luxurious nights at the Brooks Hotel in November for part of our honeymoon.  Arrived about 10AM and figured that we would just drop off luggage and roam the streets of Dublin until the afternoon.  Instead the friendly staff showed us to the loungs downstairs and provided us with tea and coffee.  Ten minutes later they were showing us to our room that had been made up for us.  We looked into the room to find rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us by name everyday.  They provided us with maps to get around the city and gave us hints as what to avoid and what to check out.  Would definitely recommend..
",5,2007,01,05
236,Worth Its High Rating,"I just returned from my stay at the Brooks Hotel over the Christmas season. I booked this hotel based on its high rating on Trip Advisor and I was not disappointed. 

First, the service is simply outstanding. From the front desk who took the care to print out train schedules when I asked about visiting Howth, to the restaurant during breakfast, everyone goes out of their way to provide exceptional service. But by far and the jewel of the hotel, is their concierege--Patrick. All reviewers are right about his willingness to help and expertise on Dublin's attractions, restaurants and transportation. When I asked about New Years Eve suggestions, he called several restaurants  (without my asking) and even escorted me halfway to my location. Without any doubt, he has spoiled me for any future hotel. I have yet to meet any concierge who was as willing to lend assistance as this gentleman. He takes the time to learn about his guests and their needs from the moment of arrival. I can honestly say that I was sad to leave the Brooks Hotel and the attentiveness of Patrick!

In regards to the room, although small , it is very comfortable. I didn't expect anything larger since  I had a discount rate booked through travelocity. The bathroom, on the other hand, is fairly large. That, along with the pillow menu and second turn down service (that includes chocolate) makes the room seem quite luxorious despite the size.  Included in the rate, the breakfast is also delicious. The cold buffet is extensive and they individually serve you from the hot menu which means having warm eggs and black/white pudding that hasn't been sitting out all morning. I also recommend trying the porridge that they make with whiskey.

Finally, the location, as other trip advisor reviewers mentioned, just can't be beat. It is in walking or public transportation distance of all sites, restaurants, shops. There is a good pub around the corner, Hairy Lemon that serves a fine Guiness Stew. Other pubs, including The Old Stand, O'Neils and Davy Byrnes are all in walking distance. I had originally booked at Cassidys on O'Connell and am quite relieved that I changed. With the location of the Brooks Hotel, I only took one taxi and walked or took buses during the rest of my stay. I definitely think that I would have been forced to take far more taxis or not have traveled out at night  had I stayed on O'Connell Street-- that alone makes up for the difference in rates as a single female traveler.

Based on its location, service and attention to every detail makes The Brooks Hotel one of the finest hotels that I have had the pleasure to stay in.   The service alone makes one realize how other ""four star"" hotels fall short in this category.  I look forward to a return visit to Dublin and this gem on Drury Street.

Suggestions:  Brazen Head Pub (although on the tourist trail, has an unbelievably friendly and fun local crowd and bartenders).
Summit Inn Pub (in Howth), Leons Cafe (bettter than Butlers Chocolates),   Literary Pub Crawl, Hop On/Off Bus and a visit to Kilmainham Gaol Prison.
",5,2007,01,04
236,Did Not see the Charm!,"The Brooks lacked in many respects compared to my stay the Morrison.

The hotel is cozy and right in the middle of the happenings of Grafton but lacks in other respects.

1. Small Bathroom
2. Small TV for a hotel charging over 250.00 Euros a night
3. Currency Exchange charges a commission and can only be done with cash no credit cards like the Morrison
4. Bath Tub is small
5. Shower in room 215 does not have hot but warm water with a ton of pressure
6. Lots of noises coming from outside sounds like bottles breaking and scenery is not there at the Morrison I could see the Liffey at least
",2,2006,12,22
236,"Great Location, but not 4 star","I booked this hotel because it was so highly recommended here and I guess I expected more.  Perhaps it was because we had an older room (not refurbed), but having done a fair amount of business travel I can honestly say this was not a 4 star room.  However, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the location can't be beat.

236,Very Nice,"The Brooks Hotel in Dublin is a wonderful small boutique hotel.  Our recent stay there was in the first week of November.  I booked this hotel on Orbitz and am I ever glad that I did.  We arrived at 09:30am with the purpose of just dropping our luggage off until check in.  Imagine our suprise when the receptionist stated that our room was ready and that we could take possession at that time for no additional cost.  That meant the world to us we were exhausted from a trans-atlantic flight and  5 hour time change.  The room was small and beautifuly appointed.  Wireless internet was included in the price and there was an extensive cable selection.  The location  was great for sight seeing in Dublin.  My favorite is the reading room on the ground floor.  A heavenly little respite from the busy city with great planning books about Ireland.  I would definantly reccommend this hotel.  It is quite a little gem.

236,Spot on,"Just comeback from Weekend in Dublin.

236,A fantastic experience!,"Serendipity led us to this absolutely wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin. After finding that the B&B we booked in Dublin had raised their prices to double what we had expected, we drove around the block & stumbled on to the Brooks Hotel. They must have taken pity on three weary travelers because we ended up paying less per person at this 4 star hotel than the B&B wanted to charge. For 60 Euro per person per night we were able to stay in a triple room (3 twins) and eat breakfast each morning in their dining room. 

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom towels were gigantic (love this!) and the shower also had a large tub to soak in if one wished. The bathroom amenities were wonderful and plentiful. The only thing in the room that needed a little help was the hairdryer, which heated up so badly upon using it we had to wrap it in a towel to finish drying.

The bar service was great, they had an amazing selection of beer, wine & liquors with what had to be the largest selection of whiskeys' we had seen! Room service was excellent on a number of levels, great food, prompt service with a smile and reasonable prices. Breakfast each morning was fabulous with a huge variety to choose from and outstanding service from all of the staff. Turndown service was lovely, with yummy fudge & chocolates being laid out for us each night.

The front desk staff was out of this world...not only did they take care of us in our ""hour of need"", they were consistently courteous, helpful and down to earth. The concierge asked our names the night we checked in and upon check out remembered us, used our names & offered to sit down & help map out the rest of our journey. Tips about getting around town were clear & directions were precise. Management was in the lobby speaking with guests each morning making sure that all aspects of their stay were above expectations. At check out there were no less than 3 gentlemen assisting us with loading our 50# suitcases in to our car and wishing us a good and safe journey.

There is convenient parking right accross the street from the hotel and the Temple Bar district as well as Grafton Street (killer shopping) are both within easy walking distance.

As I am employed at a 5 diamond (AAA) hotel, I am well versed in service standards and the Brooks Hotel hit every one of them and exceeded some. No matter the price, I would stay there again on my next trip to Dublin.

236,Execllent hotel in a great location for the city,"We were recommended Brooks by some friends and it's certainly the best city centre hotel I have ever stayed in. Right from the moment you walk in the door on arrival until the time it comes to leave the service is both very friendly and good. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for any member of staff.

My only criticism of the hotel is its restaurant which is adequate for breakfast (which was good) but is not a very appealing room for dinner as it lacks character and is somewhat small. Still, like most people, we ate out in local pubs and restaurants each evening so I can’t say we missed it. The hotel’s location is idea for the city centre as it’s just 5 minutes from Grafton Street and, if you are lucky like us, get a room at the rear (ours was 601) then it’s very quiet.

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.
",5,2006,11,14
236,Class,"My wife and I stay at Brooks approx every 6 months for a romantic weekend. I picked it through Tripadvisor about 3 years ago and it was even better than the reviews.
Don't want to give much away as the less that know about it, the easier it'll be to get rooms( on the cheap!).
The best city centre hotel in one of the best locations (3 minutes walk from Grafton street).
",5,2006,11,02
236,No Joke: This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in,"My wife and I were given reservations to the Brooks for our honeymoon and we were blown away by the service, the quality of the rooms and the hospitality that we were showed. The staff there is amazing and very helpful. A quick story: when they discovered that we were on our honeymoon they quickly remade our room with chocolates, fruit, and rose petals arranged in the shape of a heart.  The rooms are fantastic and we were fortunate enough to stay in both the normal room and the suite and both were impressive. The suite was an upgrade and while we could not have afforded it I am very glad that we had such an experience because it was true luxury. 
The location of the hotel is also ideal for tourism and shopping. Located right off of Grafton St., you are situated in the heart of everything and within walking distance to a great deal more than we anticipated. I would suggest that everyone stay here even if it means that you miss a meal or two during your stay because it is well worth it.
",5,2006,11,01
236,Excellent Hotek,"Well worthy of a four star rating this hotel is in a good location being only 3-4 minute walk to main shopping streets and an easy walk to the main attractions in Dublin. The airport shuttle bus is only 5 minutes walk away. You may feel a little apprehensive as you walk away from the main streets towards the hotel as it becomes rather quiet and deserted and doesn't feel like you're going in the right direction, it does seem a little isolated but this proved a good thing. The room and bathroom were very nice, clean and roomy. The view from the window overlooked offices at the back unfortunately but this did not bother us. Our room was adjoining another and the locked door let in quite a bit of sound. Best to ask for a non adjoining room. Breakfast was included and was very nice indeed. Staff were helpful and polite as were all the Irish people we met. We paid about £100 a night which seemed quite reasonable. I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone. Dublin can be quite an expensive place but it's well worth a visit.",5,2006,10,28
236,Lovely ambience and great location!,"You couldn't get a handier location for Dublin City Centre except for the Westbury Hotel or the Shelbourne Hotel.  The hotel is cosy and very tastefully decorated.  I loved loved loved the gorgeous twin room we got with luxurious bathroom.  They provided a Pillow Menu which we availed of as well as the foot spa therapy which was fantastic after a long day in the shops and a heavy night on the town in new high heels.  The breakfast I have to say was probably the best I've had anywhere.  The buffet offered fresh creamy natural yoghurt and a huge variety of nuts, fresh and dried fruits, and fresh home made compote, and the hot menu was lovely.  The service is excellent.

236,"Nice, but loud","My husband and I stayed here for two nights at the end of our honeymoon.  We thought it would be a nice splurge (we previously were at the Berkeley Court).  The room was nice, the bed was large (which took up most of the room) and the bathroom was spacious.  The turn down service was a nice touch.  The one really big negative was the noise.  We had a room in the front of the hotel on the second floor and we could hear every drunken person leaving the bar downstairs in the middle of the night.  When I called down to see about changing our room (once that night and once again in the morning) I was told several times that my room had been upgraded for free.  While I appreciated the upgrade, I would have appreciated it if the staff didn't keep reminding me that I should be grateful for my upgraded room, even if it was loud.  But nevertheless, the location was great and I would stay here again. I would just make sure I was either on a higher floor or in the back of the hotel.
",4,2006,10,23
236,"Good, but some mishaps","My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Brooks, celebrating our 24th wedding anniversary.  I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews on this website.  
We arrived early and the room was not ready, which we expected.  However, when we returned at 3pm, we were given the key to our room and told the luggage would be inside.  It was  nowhere to be seen.  At 4pm I rang back and was assured it was on its way.  By half past four I was marching down to reception and demanding to take the luggage back to the room myself!  Eventually we recd our luggage, it had been put in the wrong room.
The room itself was very nice, but not as luxurious as I would have expected for a deluxe double.  The remote control was faulty, not many channels working on the tv.
Breakfast extremely good.  Only problem we had was that the waitress spilled hot tea down my brand new t shirt.  The hotel did clean it for me, but I had to ask for this, and then verify it with a different member of staff who queried how this happened.  I know neither of these were major incidents, but we had been looking forward to this weekend for a very long time, and werepaying a lot of money for the room.  We were glad it was only two days in the end.  I don't think I would actually stay there again.
",4,2006,10,23
236,An excellent Luxury Hotel,"This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in.  The staff were very friendly! I couldn't fault the room, it was spacious and very luxurious.  Definitely where you want to stay for a great location and great quality accomodation.  Ideal for shoppers and for couples.
",5,2006,10,23
236,Great combination of location and (almost) quiet,"The Brooks Hotel is a great combination of being easy walking distance of most everything you want to walk to, while being mostly quiet. I think the price is a very good value for Dublin. A very good breakfast was included in the price, although I think it may be optional if you don’t want it.

Favorite feature besides location: if you like good temperature and water pressure control in the shower, our room had the best shower I’ve ever encountered (not the flashiest, biggest, sexiest, but the most functional).

Rather than repeat the other reviews, for the features I know of (I never saw a foot spa), I agree with the other reviewers. Highly recommended.
",5,2006,10,21
236,Fantastic location,"My fiance and I had a fantastic stay at The Brooks.  We found the location excellent.  It was our first time in Dublin and we took the aircoach from the airport which was very easy.

We arrived early and went to take our bags in.  The reception staff were very helpful - our room wasn't ready which was fine as we hadn't expected it to be. She told us it would be ready in an hour which it was!   They had also given us a complimentary upgrade as it was my fiances Birthday.  On the day of his Birthday we arrived back in the room to a note wishing him a ""Happy Birthday"" and some fruit - a very nice touch.

Our room was great, dreadful view (but what can you expect in the centre of a City), great facilities - CD player, TV, video, great bathroom, huge bed and generally very high standards.

The turndown service was great and I took advantage of the foot spa after wandering around the streets of Dublin - Bliss! - sat in my robe(brovided), eating the fruit!

We didn't eat in the restaurant except for breakfast which was fantastic - a huge selection and really superb!

All in all our stay at the Brooks was great!

The rooms are well appointed and clean. The beed was very comfortable and the idea of the pillow menu is fantastic. The pillow that stays cool all night was a God send. 

I recommend Brooks very highly and personally look forward to staying there again.

236,Awesome Location,"In late September / early October my wife and I, later joined by my parents, visited Ireland.  The Brooks Hotel was the first place we stayed at and set the standard for the remainder of our vacation.  The Brooks Hotel was truly comfortable.  The hotel had the feel of an upmarket residence (current, clean, lived-in) and it was small enough that you were recognized and remembered by the staff.  We stayed on the 5th floor in a newly renovated room #518 and it was a good size, massive bathroom, safe, plenty of closet space, desk, flatscreen, chairs, table, separate shower and even a balcony (but do not book this hotel for the view).  My parents had a traditional room at it was very well appointed.  We were about three streets up from Temple Bar, although the partying travels up to the area surrounding the Brooks (still quiet in the rooms) and we were walking distance from virtually everything!  Grafton Street was three blocks away, Trinity College four or five, Temple Bar three, restaurants and shops everywhere, tour sites and buses close by... just an awesome location.  One big plus was it had two major parking facilities close by i.e. Dublin is a hard place to find a parking spot in.  I am sure many believe there are better and fancier hotels available and also at significantly higher prices, but why stay there when you can feel at home here.  Ireland is about the people and the Brooks is a complete winner in that regard.  Conor is the Concierge ""jack of all trades.""  His memory is incredible... when we arrived he had known that we cancelled some months earlier because of an illness and his second sentence after welcoming us was ""How was my father?""  To me, someone whom takes their role that seriously and works to impress and exceed your expectations is a rarity and a true luxury today.  It wasn't just us getting this VIP treatment!  Look around and he was everyone's ""best friend"" working away on dinner reservations, golf, shopping, etc.  He and the team at the Brooks aimed to please!  Nothing stuffy about this place, just a little oasis in the middle of Dublin.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit.  We ate at Roly's in Ballsbridge and it was very, very good and even managed a reservation, thanks to the Brooks, at the Tearoom at Clarence Hotel owned by Bono and the Edge. The Edge was sitting just three tables away... we wanted so much to ask for a photo or an autograph, but realized that he, too, has to have a day off!

236,Excllent stay at the Brooks,"My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Brooks from Oct. 7 to Oct. 10, 2006. It was excellent.  We booked it through Travelocity and got  much better rate in dollars, with breakfast included, than from the hotel's own website in euros. Only catch was we had to prepay.

The room was a regular double, and was spacious with radio, iron, fridge, pant press, iron, safe and small sitting area near the window. Only problem was that on saturday night there was considerable noise when the bars let out around 4am.

Otherwise, the service was amazing (including the 24-hour room service menu), breakfast excellent, and the location was GREAT for first-tme visiters of dublin. Near Temple Bar and Grafton Street without being in the middle of either.

Also, they had a fitness center, which we didnt use, but is rare in a euro hotel.  Finally, loved the pillow menu! It was a great touch.

236,A home away from home,"The Brooks Hotel is a quiet oasis perfectly located in the midst of bustling downtown Dublin. Our room was clean and relatively new, the bathroom spotless. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything from making dinner reservations to passing along phone messages to giving driving or walking directions. 

As with many hotels in Ireland, the decor of the rooms is sort of early grandmother in taste but the lobby area and bar were modern and stylish while still seeming warm and inviting.
",4,2006,10,07
236,Excellent hotel!,"Read about this hotel on Trip Advisor and can't say enough about it. In a pricey city this was a clean, comfortbale quiet hotel with excellent service and good-sized rooms (for Europe). Cost was very reasonable and location was excellent. Can walk to Temple bar, many pubs and attractions. Would advise staying out of the dining room for breakfast, very pricey. Better options a block or two away. Also, the food at the Hairy Lemon pub next door was certainly passable.
",5,2006,10,03
236,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"Only just getting around to writing this review after staying in the Brooks Hotel in January.  We loved our stay - from the moment we walked in the hotel, the service was exemplary.  When we got to our lovely room, a retro Roberts radio was playing nice music creating a really good ambience.  There was complementary spring water etc in the room.  Very comfortable bed, great bathroom and great bar for a quiet drink in the evening.

Just one tip though - we booked with Hotels.com and assumed breakfast was included.  It was not and we did not pay.  Not a major issue but it would have really perfected our stay if it was included.
",5,2006,09,30
236,Great hotel experience,"We were also very impressed with Brooks and would highly recommend staying at this boutique hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom well outfitted with good water pressure in the shower and excellent towels, linens and toiletries.  The rooms were very clean and turn down service offered nice treats on the pillow at the end of the evening.

The concierge and staff were kind, professional, and helpful and provided great suggestions as to where to visit, where to eat, etc.  Nice breakfast, included with our stay, and bar area that made a great mojito!

The location of the hotel was excellent--a short stroll to all the popular attractions (Trinity College, Christ Church, etc.) and the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar.  Overall, we were very happy with our choice of the Brooks and would stay there again!",5,2006,09,25
236,Can't go wrong with Brooks,"We stayed there in August 2006 in one of the updated rooms.  The room and bathroom were immaculate.  The concierge staff was very helpful and took time to sit down to plot out our sightseeing strategy with us.  There is a nice guest lounge w/computer on the lower level.  The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar which worked out great for us.  Close to Graffton Steet, Trinity College and the visitors center.  We would definitely stay there again.
",4,2006,09,18
236,Good attention to detail,"We were very impressed with Brooks; they stood out from other 4-stars that we've stayed in because of their attention to detail. The toiletries, towels, linen, ornaments, fittings etc were all of a very high standard - there was nothing there that had the mass-produced look you often see in hotels today. In doing so they'd created a unique and luxurious style.
The service was good, dinner was good, breakfast was good, and they had nice little finishing touches - like old-fashioned radios in the rooms along with a modern mini-stereo and complimentary CD of a sample selection of Irish music.
",5,2006,09,16
236,Very good hotel,"Decided to pay a little more than our usual 3* hotel for our one night stay in Dublin and checked into Brooks. We were absolutely delighted with the room, the service, the breakfast and the ambience.  Great position right in the centre of town. In our opinion definitely worth the difference and would stay again.
",5,2006,09,15
236,Loved the Brooks Hotel,"I booked this hotel on the basis of excellent reveiws on trip advisor and i have to say, I was not disappointed. it is the staff that really make this hotel as wonderfull as it is. All staff members, imparticular Christina, were really helpfull and cheery and did everything within their power to ensure my stay was enjoyable. The reception staff were very approachable and helpfull. I arrived very early and they ensured i had a room ready within half an hour. The breakfast buffet available was one of the best i have seen for a 4 star hotel and the restaurant staff were very attaintive and efficient. We were appointed a very nice room which we were informed was a complementary upgrade, which was a lovely gesture as we were on our honeymoon.
The food in Francescas restaurant was beautifully presented but was good rather than great in flavor. However it was ok value for money. Frank was a delightfull waiter.
",5,2006,09,12
236,"Service not 4 star, but good location","We booked this hotel based on positive tripadvisor reviews.  The location was excellent, but I found the service lacking for a 4 star hotel.  

For example, we needed to print out our airline boarding passes, but the lounge printer was broken (and had been for a while, apparently, somethjing to consider if you travel for business.)  The front desk did not let us use their computers, and said we should go to an internet cafe.  Considering we were paying over $200/night, I thought this an unacceptable lack of effort.

In another incident, my sister asked for a taxi at the front desk, and was warned it might take 20 minutes.  Since she had to catch a train, my sister asked reception to check.  They called just one company and gave up, so my sister had to insist they call another, something that should have not have happened.  It's hard to believe the hotel does not have an arrangement with a taxi company, considering the size of the hotel

Finally, we asked reception to bring us up the foot spa and gave our room number.  After 45 minutes and no show I called reception, and heard the excuse that housekeeping had forgotten the room number.  Considering it was the front desk I gave the number to, this excuse felt like passing the buck and not terribly honest.

Again, the room and location were fine, but the service felt very lacking.
",2,2006,09,10
236,Highly Recommended,"I stayed here on my own on business.  I was allocated a lovely room, cosy and quiet with every luxury.  The breakfast was healthy and tasty with lots of variety.  Although it is quiet it is only a few minutes walk from Grafton Street and there are lots of lovely shops on the way to the centre.  Dinner was also welcoming and healthy with organic products included.  Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  Although I arrived early from the airport, my room was ready and I was able to freshen up before going on to my meetings.  I loved it here and will definately return and bring my family.
",5,2006,09,05
236,A very good stay,"This is a very good 4-star hotel right in the centre of Dublin. Most of the main tourist sights are about 5 or 10 minutes' walk away. There is temporary street parking and a garage across the road.

The rooms were small (normal by European standards), immaculate and tastefully decorated with tradition yet new furniture. The bed was top-notch; very comfortable. There was even a pillow menu. Rooms were well sound-proofed.

The service was excellent.

236,"Wonderful Hotel, Wonderful People","Having used tripadvisor to choose this hotel we could not be more pleased with our selection. From the moment we stepped through the doors we were made to feel incredibly welcome and this continued right through our stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful. 
We received an upgrade to one of the contempory rooms which was both spacious and clean with thoughtful touches. The hotel is in a great location - we walked to everywhere we wanted to get to - and has lots of great restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.
We had such a wonderful time we really didn't want to leave.

236,Shelter for the weary,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks on our first night in Dublin.  We arrived very early in the morning after a transatlantic flight.  We knew that we would be there too early to check in, but we did try.  We were warmly greeted at the desk, and told that they would work on getting a room ready for us as soon as possible.  While we were waiting the wonderful concierge, P.J., escorted us to the residents lounge to relax.  He asked us what our plans were in the city, and gave us quite a few pointers.  He was extremely helpful.  After he had us settled, he headed off, only to return with a tea tray for me.  Great pick me up!  
My only gripe with the Brooks, would be the fact that they had taken our cellular numbers and promised to notify us as soon as they had a room available.  After a few hours stumbling about the city, and then a half hour more of waiting in the residents lounge, I went to the desk to inquire on the progress of our room.  I was told that it was all ready.  It seemed to me that it had been ready for quite sometime, and someone had forgotten to tell us.   Our room was fine, and all of the rest of our experiences with the Brooks were splendid.  I would stay there again.
",4,2006,08,31
236,Impressive hotel and an enjoyable stay,"My wife and I stayed here in a standard room for 3 nights and then, after a few days spent on the west coast, a superior room for our final night.  Overall the hotel was impressive.

Its location is excellent - near both of Dublin's main shopping streets, also Trinity College, the Temple Bar area of pubs and restaurants, and most of the other main sights, yet in a street which was pretty quiet even on the Bank Holiday weekend!

We found Reception very friendly, welcoming and efficient, and the rooms were spacious, clean and well-appointed.  The superior room had a bottle of water for each of us, a larger bathroom, armchairs, and a few other extra facilities.

The bar was very comfortable and relaxing (though the decor seemed to be from the 70s!), with good service, and the restaurant was OK.  My only negative comments here would be that drinks prices were high and, when having the 'early bird' (cheaper) evening meal at the restaurant one night we had to wait over 45 minutes for our main course to arrive, which seemed excessive as there was only one other person there when we came in.

Also if you book 'room only' don't bother paying the extortionate price for breakfast as there are numerous places to eat in the area.  Similarly we only ate there one evening.

But these were minor issues and this is a pretty good hotel.  We would definitely stay there again.
",4,2006,08,17
236,Very Chic & Central,"Stayed in Brooks on a mid-week special break from the 13th to the 15th of August.  Very stylish hotel and a fantastic location close to Stephens Green.  Arrived early and though we couldn't book in they took the bags so that I could go shopping with ease.  Stayed in room 214 - thought we had only booked a standard room but we seemed to get a superior room - fab room from the king size bed to the old fashion radio (which was a nice touch but the reception was a bit crakily at the best of times so a CD player would have been a better choice).  The staff were lovely, helpful and non-fussy.  A really nice touch also was the evening service and the power-shower was wow.  A really special, highly recommended place to stay - booking based on reviews on this site and I must say I have no complaints at all.

For a great few hours (tourist and locals alike) go do the Guinness Hop store Tour.  Very sleek, well presented tour nicely finished off with a pint of the Black Stuff in the Gravity Bar with amazing, 360 Degree, views of Dublin.

236,Fab Hotel in a Great Location,"Just returned from 4 night stay in the Brooks Hotel, Dublin.

We booked this Hotel based soley on the reviews in TripAdvisor and we were not dissapointed.

Hotel can be a little tricky to find initially (unless arriving by Taxi), as Drury Street is not always listed on Tourist Maps.  We took the local bus from the airport with a family travel pass (Euro 8.50, upto 2 adults an 4 children all day travel).  The route we followed was the 747 service from the airport to O'Connell Street, hop off there and a few stops down the street take the 16A and get of in South Great Georges Street (as soon as you see the Dunnes Stores - get off at the next stop), head back to Fade Street, and at the end of Fade Street, turn right and the Hotel is on the left.  You could get the 16A all the way from the airport to South Great Georges Street without changing for about Euro 1.40 each.  Takes about 45 minutes depending on traffic.

We also got an upgraded room apparently (no idea why), but the room was superb.  Very large room with huge bed, AC, Safe, TV, DVD Coffe/tea making facilities etc.  AC worked fine, although a little noisy.  Large bathroom with separate Bath and shower and the room was spotless.  Hotel room pictures do not do the room justice.  We booked the room using the Hotel web site and Expedia.  In restrospect, should have just used the hotel web site as they list special rates which are as competitive as other web sites, plus you pay on checkout, rather than when booking as with Expedia.

Checkin staff and Conciegere were very welcoming, efficent and friendly.

The turn-down service in the evening was an especially nice touch and vey much apprieciated by my wife.

Breakfast was included in our room rate and it was fantastic.  It ranged from buffet style, cereals, fresh fruit (water melon, honey dew melon, mango etc), mixed breads and meats, yoghurts, home made scones, croisants etc, plus tradional Irish cooked breakfast (including porridge with cream and Irish Whiskey).  Cooked breakfast was cooked to order and delivered to your table, plus tea/coffee and toast.  We also ate in Franchesca's on the first night and I have to say the food and service was absolutely superb.  We had Duck Liver Parfait as a starter with toasted bread and the main course was a special of Pork Loin, gratin potates and organic vegatables.  The pork loin, just melted in your mouth.  I would definately eat in Franchesca's again.  It was without doubt the best meal we had in Dublin.

Location is brilliant.  Almost 5 minutes away from all the hotspots, but without being in the centre of the noisey hotspots.

We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and will be going back to the Brooks the next time we visit Dublin.

If you go to the Old Jamieson Distillery (recommended) do try the Irish Coffees, they are too die for  !!  We went back for seconds.
",5,2006,08,15
236,Good Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Brooks for 3 nights the last week in July.  I would reccommend staying at this hotel for several reasons-great location to St. Patrick's, Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and for catching The Dart.  We took the Dart to a town called Dalkey-beautiful scenery btw.  Takes a bit to walk from the hotel to the Guinness Brewery, but Dublin is a walking city and very enjoyable.  The room was very clean, good AC, frig included and in-room safe.  The turn down service w/ the chocs are a nice touch as well.  Breakfast was really good, great selection, especially w/ all the homemade items.  And the front desk is able to convert money if needed (euros to pounds-we went from Dublin to Edinburgh.)  And the front desk found me an electrical convertor to charge my camera batteries, seeing that the one I took w/ me still did not fit Ireland's plug-ins.  However-we did have 2 minor complaints w/ The Brooks.  We were not granted an early check-in.  After flying all night and being awake for almost 24 hours, the girl at the front desk wouldn't allow us to check-in when we arrived an hour early before check-in time.  She was rather short w/ us and while we were sitting in the lobby, we began talking to some older ladies (also from the States) who had been waiting for 4 hours for a room and were thirsty.  The front desk girls would not allow them to have any drinks for free while waiting.   Second, their phone lines are connected thru the power lines so make sure you don't flip the switch next to the phone.  I did on our first night thinking I was turning the lamp off.  In turn-our phone was turned off and we were not transferred any telephone calls we received from home that night.  Other than that-this is a great hotel.  Also-be sure to try The Bistro around the corner-GREAT food!!

236,Top Marks,"I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend, Friday to Monday. It was my boyfriends birthday and I wanted to take him somewhere special. 

Check In

The hotel is located on Drury Street, which is right near the shopping but also very quiet. First impressions of the hotel were good, the reception area was bright and modern. Check in was quick and effiecient and we were told we had a complimentary upgrade. Im not sure why, maybe because it was my boyfriends birthday. 

The Room

We had to get a lift to the 3rd floor, room 311. We were amazed when we walked in, the room was huge. There was a round table with two armchairs and 2 bottles of water and glasses. There was a plasma tv on the wall facing the bed. The bathroom had a bath and seperate shower with a tv on the wall (in the bath). There was a pillow menu and an old fashioned radio. There were tea/coffe making facilities. There was also an ironing board and iron built into the wardrobe. There was also a turn down service, so when we got back there were always toffees/chocs/mints left on our pillow. Our room was cleaned daily. 
We also had bath robes and there were loads of complimentary toiletries. 
We didn't have enough towels so we had to call reception. They sent them up to our room within 5 mins. 
We had air con in the room and it worked fine. 
There is no view, but you are in the city centre. 

Breakfast

Weekday served from 7.30 - 10.30
weekend served from: 8.00 - 11.30
This was included in our booking. You can choose from the selection on the buffet table (breads, meats, fruit, yoghurt, juice) and you could also have kippers, hot porridge with whiskey and a full breakfast. 
the full breakfast was lovely. It is made to order and they bring it to your table, no self service. I had sausage, bacon, mushrooms, grilled tomato, black and white pudding, hash brown and you could choose between scrambled/poached egg. They also bring pots of tea/coffee to your table. 
The service was excellent and you never had to wait long.

We didn't eat at Francesca's as we always ate out, although the menu looked good. 
We didn't drink in the bar as it looked really quiet and we wanted somewhere lively. 

We visited the residents lounge, it was ok, probably for older people to relax in. Lots of books, magazines for you to read. If you have forgotten your spectacles you can borrow them from the hotel.  
My boyfriend went to the gym and he said it was fine. They also have a sauna. 

The concierges, Patrick and Connor, were really helpful. 

Other services at hotel: 

CD/Video library - You can hire a film (comedy, action, thriller etc.) . It costs around 10 EUR. 

Footspa: If you have been on your feet all day, you can request a footspa in your room. 

Babysitting/ Baby listening - These services are available at a cost. 

We had a fantastic time, we would definately go back to this hotel, in fact, we didn't want to leave. 3 days wasn't enough.

236,Wonderful in every way,"My husband booked this trip as a surprise for our 10th Wedding anniversary. I was a little nervous as I normally chose the hotels etc but he could not have chosen a better hotel if he tried. It was very modern, clean and beautifully decorated. The staff were exceptionally helpful. Flowers were there for me when we arrived, a bottle of champagne was delivered from our in-laws on our actual anniversary and we even got a bowl of fruit from the hotel staff. The rooms are immaculate and the bathroom was one of the best I have seen. The location could not be better - down a very quiet steet but close to everything. We ate in the restaurant on our actual anniverary and the meal was superb. We loved Dublin and will be back and will certainly stay at this hotel again.

236,Faboulous Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel in April. The Hotel is in an excellent location. We caught the local bus from Dublin Aiport that cost about £4 for the pair of us, the journey took about 35 minutes but you get to see sites you wouldnt travelling by taxi.
The interior of the hotel is fantastic and the staff were extremley helpful from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The room was immaculate and even had  a TV in the bathroom, but the best thing about the room was the pillow menu. 
It may cost a wee bit more than other Hotels, but is worth every penny

236,An excellent find,"I booked this hotel on the basis of the reviews I had read.  They were spot on -  this really is an excellent hotel.  Fantastic location, staff helpful and unobtrusive, room beautiful and clean.  Can also recommend the Literary pub crawl and the historical walking tour of the city which leaves Trinity College at 11.00 and 3.00. These were both informative and amusing.

236,Wonderful Irish Gem!!!,"I use this site to quite literally travel all over he world, New York to the Lakes, Kenya and now Dublin and the Brooks Hotel. I use the reviews on this site to find the best hotels where ever I am visting etc and trust in the reviewers. It is the first time I have been moved to write a review myself! I find the shorter reviews more hopeful (or hours can be spent reading about towels, pillows and the size of the soap!!!)

So to the Brooks Hotel, Dublin. Purpose of our visit was a 3 day trip (mid week) for the girlfriends birthday celebration. We walked into the hotel 4 hours early to check in, from our flight. We were greeted by the hotel with the words NO PROBLEM SIR!

Room wonderful, walked in to classical music playing softly in the back ground. Bathroom beautifully finished with everything you would expect from a hotel that actually puts the guest first rather than for profit. The room was spacious, well decorated and immaculate. We had a standard room and it was ample for both of us. Huge Bed with great bedding and climate control for chilli or even steamy nights!!!

I am slightly asthmatic so not keen on feathers in my pillows - yes you guessed it - NO PROBLEM SIR!!! Can I try the foot spa? NO PROBLEM SIR!!! My girlfriends birthday, can you get us into the best Italian in town - NO PROBLEM SIR!!! (And it was!!!) and so it went on and on!!!

What a magical city Dublin is but the Brooks Hotel made the trip. We shopped, eat and drinked, sightseeing, even went down the coast on the DART. so did a fair bit but the hotel was not just a pad to return to for a couple of hours to re gather some energy for the following day but a real homecoming to a real IRISH GEM!!!

Have no fear with this hotel - its one of the best there is anywhere to be found!!!

I have just spotted that I can not leave my email for you if you have any questions but please be assurred you hard earned money is safe with this hotel with regards to getting exactly what you deserve, the best service in Dublin along with a great breakfast (they actaully put Irish whiskey in your porridge, now I am no alcoholic but the day is on to a winner before you start!!!!!) and of course the location - Dublin right outside the air conditioned lobby where Patrick the porter will become as invaluable as any guide or map of the city.

I have given this hotel 5 stars out of 5 - only because I cannot find 6!!!

Best  Wishes

236,Location and Staff Make it a Great Hotel,"Our family chose the Brooks Hotel for our stay in Dublin based on the excellent reviews at Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. After a long overnight flight we arrived at the Brooks in the early morning and were welcomed in to the residents' lounge until our room was ready. They knew we were tired and did their best to get us in to our room as soon as possible.

The people who worked there were particularly helpful and friendly. People in Ireland tend to be friendly and these people were surprisingly so. The manager even took the time to ask about our travel plans, review various details and make meaningful suggestions. He had spent time (years) in the west of Ireland and really knew what he was talking about. He shared his knowledge cheerfully and helped to make our trip memorable by steering us to some interesting towns and places we might have missed.

The rooms (we had two) were beautiful and comfortable. Our view was not memorable but we didn't go to Dublin to look out the window anyway. The whole place seemed clean and classy. The breakfast was excellent and the service was quick and efficient. The bar was upscale and classy in the evening and the bartender was friendly even to a group of drunken golfers who appeared and disappeared into the Grafton Street night.

The location of the hotel is great. It was only a few minutes to Grafton Street and countless restaurants, pubs and shops. I think the proximity to Grafton Street turned out to be really important to us and we hadn't really considered it when we made our reservations. We got lucky...

We spent our first two days and nights in Dublin staying at the Brooks Hotel and we had absolutely no complaints.

236,A truly delightful stay,"The Brooks Hotel in Dublin is the antithesis to Kellys, only a street apart. It's where we went after one night at Kellys, and I truly recommend it. The rooms are simple and elegant, the amenities and services plentiful, the staff cheerful, helpful, accessible. Just spent 5 nights there in comfort and quiet. The hotel made the vacation all the more enjoyable and fun just in the way it treats its guests. Conner, the concierge, is tops. Evening service was charming. Desk staff were all completely accommodating. Ambience was lovely. Nice gym, terrific residents' lounge, good breakfast & restaurant, well equipped bar. Worth  the price, which wasn't all that high to begin with, what with discount rates and such. A lovely luxury hotel.

236,The best hotel I have ever stayed at - perfect for my 21st Birthday :),"My wonderful boyfriend booked us on a surprise holiday to Dublin, and we stayed at the Brooks Hotel. I first noted its convinient location, in the city centre. Although there were some repair works being carried out, as we entered, the porter rushed to us to ensure that we had someone to greet us at the door, and direct us to the reception. The staff on the desk were very efficient, and although we'd arrived 2 hours early, the room was ready. My bf arranged for the room to be scattered with happy 21st birthday balloons, at no extra cost to him, which is the most hospitable a hotel has ever been to us! 

The room itself was spacious (my boyfriend paid for an upgrade), the bed was huge, and very comfortable. They offered a range of named pillows (!), which was a new thing to us! The room was tastefully decorated, with a large window. The bathroom was also huge, with a very large mirror (and the part that you need to use once you've showered doesn't steam up), a comfortable and clean bath, and a power shower. There is also a gym (which I had all intention to use...but sadly didn't) and a lovely residents lounge, where you can relax, have a few drinks and play scrabble/chess! The drink prices at the bar aren't ridiculously expensive, unlike the Hairy Lemon pub next door to the hotel!  We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. 

We went out for lunch, and on our return, noticed a bowl of fruit that the manager had placed in the room, gratis, with birthday wishes -  it just kept getting better. There was nothing the hotel couldn't do for us. I will recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely visit again. :)

236,Good enough for seconds,"We stayed here our first night in Ireland. Enjoyed it so much we booked our last night's stay here as well. Comfortable, convenient to all of Dublin's sights. Friendly and helpful staff. Use their website for the best deal on rooms.

236,This is not four-star!,"First impressions were not good. The doormats were grubby, and there were no doormen (doorpersons) or porters.

I booked a standard room, but was upgraded to a superior one (presumably because they weren't busy). Glad I was! The extras in a superior room are bottled water, bathrobes (although there was only one), a Robert's radio, and a tailor's dummy to hang your jacket on. One shouldn't have to pay more for such things in a four-star place! The mix of patterns in the furnishings did not create a calm environment. The view (out the back) was grim, and the noise from the air-conditioning plant meant you couldn't open the window. Being on the 6th floor helped, as you can see over the rooftops, rather than straight into the offices across the yard. Tiny bath. Tiny wardrobe. The trouser press was at the back of the wardrobe, so you'd have to empty the wardrobe to use it!

The breakfast was the usual buffet affair, with cooked stuff to order. OK, but it was spoiled by loud music. The ""Resident's Lounge"" (is there only one resident?) in the basement is advertised as a haven of tranquility. So why the piped music?!! There are no quiet areas to sit and read or converse. Best to go round the corner to the lovely Peter's Pub (at the end of South William Street).

The TV sound is piped into the bathroom. If you don't want it, you have to pull the cable out of the back of the TV. Why not a switch (like in the Fitzwilliam Hotel)? The little fridge is not stocked with the usual mini-bar items. If you want it stocked, you can decide what goes in it (or use it for your own wine!). The standard of cleaning was good, but the armchairs are worn.

Broadband is available, but they charge 24 euros for 24 hours. This effectively increases the room price if you need to use a laptop. Compare this with the gorgeous (and truly four-star) Fitzwilliam, where broadband is complimentary. Even Bewley's (at just 99 euros a night) offers complimentary Wi-Fi in the rooms.

The location is great. Minutes from so many good shops, restaurants and pubs in and around Grafton Street. Don't miss the Dublin Literary Pub Crawl, which starts from the Duke Pub in Duke Street at 7.30pm every evening (tickets on the door at 7pm).

236,70th Birthday Celebration - complete with footspa!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel where we celebrated my fathers 70th birthday.  The rooms we were allocated were fantastic, on the 5th floor facing the road, but so quiet, no noise from either outside or the other residents.  The rooms are tastefully decorated with quality furnishings and really comfortable.  A pillow menu is available if you would prefer an alternative, the usual safe, kettle, hairdryer, ironing board, iron are all present.  A turn down service is offered early evening with a little gift of chocolates or sweeties placed on your bed.  You can also order a foot spa in your room foc.  Check out/in is currently 12 midday.

We ate in Frencesca's (the hotels restaurant) for both nights, the food and service being absolutely excellent on the first night, a slight decline in service and food on the second night due to a large party taking over most of the restaurant.

Breakfast also 1st class with a help yourself cold buffet and a hot selection served to your table.

An alternative is Jasmine's, a very comfortable bar/lounge in the hotel next door to the restaurant, with a good selection of drinks and cocktails, tea and coffees, they also serve food.  Here we found the service very good even though the staff are very busy and we were never kept waiting.

The hotel is very well situated for sight seeing and shopping with Grafton St being just round the corner so to speak,  Tourist Office and bus stop just a short walk and the DART about 10 mins walk.  We went to Mulahide and Howth on the DART from Pearce Station, both well worth a visit, especially the castle at Mulahide.  A taxi from/to the airport costing 25 Euros for the 3 of us, the Air Shuttle is approx 7 Euros each.

In a nutshell I would have definately stayed in this hotel again without a second thought, however because there will always be the possibility of the hotel being 'taken over' by a seminar, I will probably look for alternative which is a shame because everything about this hotel was first class.  Perhaps enquire first?

236,The quietest rooms...............,"The Brooks Hotel in Dublin is a lovely place to stay!  It is so easy to get to all destinations, and the people and the level of service are just wonderful.  The rooms are exceptionally quiet - you do not hear people above you, below you nor next door to you.  You do not hear doors slamming in the hallways, nor showers running in other rooms.  Francesca's is a great place to eat, also.  We enjoyed our stay with them tremendously, and when we returned a week later, for an overnight before our flight home, we had a note and welcoming plate of fruit in our room!
",5,2006,05,15
236,"Very comfortable, friendly and convenient base","I'm a regular traveller to Dublin, but last weekend found myself going at the last minute and the hotel I usually stay in wasn't available (bank holiday).  Did an internet search and the only place available was Brooks Hotel.  I'm glad I found it - it's right smack bang in the centre of town, the room was very clean and comfortable and the staff without exception were very friendly.

The only downside is the lack of parking and the extortionate rates and ignorant service in the carpark across the road.  Even with the discounted night rate available from the hotel, it worked out at something like €35 for a day!  It's the only reason I haven't given the hotel five stars.

When I stay there again I think I'd use the nearby College of Surgeons car park - I think it's cheaper.  It's certainly more friendly.
",4,2006,05,04
236,Fantastic,"This is a beautifully furnished and well appointed little hotel in the heart of Dublin, convenient for everything in the City centre including all businesses, shops and bars. I stayed for one night on business, and the staff were attentive and helpful beyond the normal call of duty, food was great and the Hotel was nothing short of perfect!
",5,2006,05,01
236,Fantastic hotel!!,"I had arranged a 3 night stay in The Brooks from 13th-16th April as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday. For arrival, I had also arranged for a bottle of champagne to be inculded in our room where they more than happily obliged. The staff were very friendly and exceedingly helpful. Since our stay was over Easter, we got a day by day guide as to what was shut/open over the Easter break, which really helped us plan our activities. On arrival we were upgraded free of charge to a larger room, which was beautiful! My boyfriend was very impressed! We were offered a turn down service every evening and given liitle treats of chocolate and sweets too, the pillow menu was brilliant and the chance to use a foot spa in the comfort of your own room was just wonderful! The location of the hotel was ideal, near enough to the centre but far enough out that we got a peaceful nights sleep! The restaurant was gorgeous, I would definitely recommend eating an evening meal here. Breakfast was lovely, but it's just as well it was included in my booking price as I would not have paid for it otherwise. Beautiful breakfast, but expensive for what it was. Apart from that, I do not have a bad word to say about this hotel. Oh, and the queen size bed was heaven! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone! Plus, I have earned serious brownie points with my boyfriend who adored this hotel! A real gem.

236,Brooks will lift your spirits,"A friend & I chose to stay at Brooks our last night in Ireland, and it happened to be March 16th. The location is great, and on St. Paddy's Eve, we expected it to be noisy, but we did not have any problems, at least where our room was located.  For a boutique hotel, I would have imagined the room to be a bit more trendy, but it was absolutely fine and comfortable.  The concierge, Connor, remembered our names both days, and all of the staff were...wait for it...IRISH..Not that common in Dublin..When the staff is Irish, the service is great and friendly,because there is pride involved...They serve a beautiful breakfast, and it seemed as if there were a team working hard to get us out of the city and to the airport before the parade trapped us.  

We felt very good about this hotel and would feel lucky to have the opportunity of staying there again.
",4,2006,04,15
236,Brookes Hotel Excellent,"Stayed at the Brookes after reading comments on trip advisor.  It lived up to its reputation.  We were upgraded to a lovely room.  It was spotless and the breakfasts very tasty.  Would definitely go again.
",5,2006,03,29
236,Perfect end to our trip,"We stayed at Brooks for three nights over St Patricks weekend after a week of touring round Ireland and found it as good as the reviews we had read before we booked. The room was a good size and very clean and the bathroom was in proportion (loved the scales in the bathroom - great for checking luggage weight). There was no view, but who needs a view with all the sights of Dublin on your doorstep. The breakfast was great and we had dinner one evening which was very good. The bar prices were comparative with the rest of Dublin and the staff were pleasant. My only gripe is that they undercharged us when we checked out and then subsequently debited the outstanding amout and wrote to inform us they had done - which is fine except the letter was rather curt and gave me the impression they felt it was our fault that they had undercharged us. I would have thought the letter should have been apologetic and the tone of it left a bitter taste which is a shame.
",4,2006,03,27
236,A true gem,"Brooks is a true find, many thanks to previous Trip Advisor reviewers.  It's relatively new and ""crisper"" than many hotels we found in Ireland on our vacation last week. This is a modern hotel -- no shabby genteel chic -- just first class service and accommodations. (A Four Seasons feel, at a much lower price.) The location is wonderful- right near both Temple Bar and the shopping district, but on a quiet side street so there is no noise.  (On the downside, there are also no views -- the best you get is the parking garage across the street.  By the way, the hotel has discounted coupons for parking available.) Inside, the rooms looks like large first class cruise cabins:  lots of built-ins and exposed wood.  The bathrooms are spacious and well turned out.  They even have what they call a ""pillow menu"" in case you'd like a different down/foam pillow type.  There is a lovely private panelled lounge in the basement that has comfy couches, backgammon boards, magazines, etc.  Breakfasts were excellent- a wide selection and a willingness to do special orders.  Perhaps the best part of the hotel for us, however, was the staff:  Collette at the front desk, Patrick and Connor at the concierge desk.  Everyone couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  We were welcomed by name each time we came in and they took the time to give us detailed driving directions, call ahead to confirm reservations at our next hotel, make dinner reservations for us - you name it.  We were so impressed that we came back for a third night after staying two nights and then travelling around outside the city...and were welcomed ""home"".  The highlight of our trip.
",5,2006,03,22
236,"Nice, personal service","First impressions of the Brooks are good.  The reception staff were efficient, the concierge gave us some good advice on what to do during our time in Dublin (remembering our names when we returned was a nice touch).  The standard room was ok, size was average, small bathroom with shower in the bath.  Everything was clean and in order.

Only small gripes:

- The room was very noisy.  We looked straight in to the Drury Street car park and the double glazing didn't block out the cars or conversations.
- I forgot toothpaste and had to pay 2.50 euro for a tiny tube - usually I would expect a good 4 star to provide these free.
- the electrics were a bit tempermental and flickered every now and then.

Overall, a nice place to stay in a location close to all places of interest.
",4,2006,03,16
236,Dublin New Year,"Stayed here with my wife and our friends for three nights at the New Year after reading the many good reviews on the Tripadvisor website and we weren't disappointed. There are always four things that I look for when booking hotels.....location, cleanliness, comfort and value for money.  Brooks Hotel provided them all (value for money via hotelstogo). A superb Irish Breakfast was included in the price, although drinks at the bar were expensive (but we found that Dublin is an expensive city anyway).
",5,2006,03,15
236,Excellent Value for Money,"The Brooks is a modern Hotel decorated to a good standard. The restaurant is excellent and the bar area comfortable and an easy place to relax. The room we had was well decorated, clean and quite large. Staff were helpful and friendly. 

The Hotel is nicely situated for sightseeing in Dublin, being close to Trinity college, the castle, the river and the shops. 

Dublin is a great city to visit. Loads to see and do.

Excellent.
",5,2006,03,13
236,Gorgeous hotel in great location,"I booked this hotel based on its popularity rating on this website and got a good deal via Expedia. I upgraded via phone before we left as I wanted a DVD player. When we checked in, we were upgraded again. The room was superb; tasteful decor, flat screen TV, TV above the bath. The hotel itself has a chic bar, a lovely lounge area/library with fire and small gym and sauna.

The staff were friendly enough and cleaned our room immediately when we requested.

Location wise it is excellent. 3 streets to the right of Grafton Street and walking distance to some great bars and restuarants.

I highly recommend the Literary Pub Crawl (meet in The Duke, Duke Street at 7pm); hilarious and a good excuse for trawling some great pubs. The bus tours around the city are fun, run every 10 minutes and a good way to spend a rainy day. Eating wise, Bistro 66 is lovely but you're spoilt for choice.

We'll defintely return to Dublin and we'll definitely stay at the Brooks.
",5,2006,03,07
236,Boutique Style Hotel close to the centre,"Stayed 3 nights at Brookes Hotel in February on Business and was booked into a superior room which was upgraded to an Executive Room.

The room was comfortale, quiet and they supplied complimentary small bottles of still and sparkling water. There was a fridge which was empty so you could actually stock it yourself which to be honest is mmuch more preferable to paying €5 or more for a small beer or coke...

It's about time that more hotels started to provide FREE broadband internet service to their clients and sadly Brookes did not. Though when I did inquire about it, the internet wasn't working and they offered to pay for me to goto an iternet cafe which was a good touch.

Although the hotel is fairly central you will need to give plenty of notice to reception if you want to get a taxi, especially if you are in a hurry as someties it would take 15 minutes for a taxi to arrive. No such issues at The Westbury which has its own taxi rank.

It's a place to stay for business or pleasure and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.
",4,2006,03,03
236,Brooks - not a 4 star,"Have just returned from a 3 night stay at Brooks.  Was disappointed with this hotel after reading other reviews.  This was more like an average 3 star hotel - very similar to a Travel Inn style hotel!  We found the staff to be very impersonal, inpolite and unfriendly.  Have stayed in many hotels and we were really disappointed with this one.  The room was small, decor was in need of updating, e.g. peeling wallpaper, grubby tiles in bathroom.  Twice when we came back to the hotel in the afternoon for a sleep - hotel staff walked into our room!  Have never enountered this before!  Also didn't agree that breakfast should be extra and the price was scandalous.  We had already decided to eat out after reading other reviews about the charge for breakfast!  We went to the Metro cafe for our breakfast and we loved it.  It is just round the corner from Brooks and very reasonably priced.  Staff are very friendly and we would definitely go again.  Also, can highly recommend the Hairy Lemon pub on the corner from Brooks and just up from Metro cafe, Pasta Fresca.  We absolutely loved this Italian restaurant and went back a second night.  Not only was the food outstanding but the service and staff were faultless - this is what was clearly lacking at Brooks.  They could learn a lot from the staff at this restaurant.  We will definitely go back to Dublin and will definitely go back to Pasta Fresca, Metro and the Hairy Lemon but next time will find a hotel with pleasant, welcoming, attentive staff like we found in the restaurants and cafes we visited.
",2,2006,02,23
236,Great Hotel,"Just back from a weekend at the Brooks with my wife.  The hotel is great and service from the minute we arrived was first class. It is superbly located 5 mins walk from Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area. Quiet but close to the action.

Executive rooms were clean and really comfortable, with nice touches like sweets left on your pillows. 

Breakfast was good, with the full Irish, which was freshly cooked, being a good choice.

I travel frequently overseas and would rate the Brooks as first class hotel which we would ceratinly return to.
",5,2006,02,21
236,What a treat,"We have just come back from a great 2 day break staying at the Brooks. We felt perfectly looked after from getting out of the taxi to getting back! The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful even when the guests (us) couldn't work the electricty, safe.. etc) The pillow menu was lovely, choccies at bedtime etc THe room was spacious and comfortable. Our view of the air conditioning was a little dissapointing but hey! THe food was a little fussy but great quality as was the breakfasts. Connor the concierge was like a old friend! I thoroughly reccommend this hotel!

236,Brooks 'The Best',"We have just returned from a 2 day break at the Brooks Hotel. Everything about this hotel is wonderful,the rooms are beautiful with extra touches like the pillow menu offering a choice of 5 types of pillow. Staff are friendly and very helpful.
Food in the restaurant excellent.
Good Location.
Aircoach from Dublin Airport offers excellent service to the centre with only a short walk to the hotel.
Cannot think of one single bad point.
Will definitely be going back.
",5,2006,02,13
236,Lacking,"The staff was very good and we were treated nicely.  The location was good.  The hotel also provided a very good map of the local area showing a large number of the tourist sites.  The biggest problems were as follows.  The mattress was of european quality, hard and stiff.  The amenities were lacking - I am use to hotels around the world providing free tooth brushes and tooth paste as well as a free razor (the hotel sells these amenities for 2 and a half euros each).  The hard mattress caused some back pain until I got use to it but my wife never did get use to the mattress.
",2,2006,02,12
236,Excellent!,"Our whole stay at the Brooks was perfect from start to finish.  Attentive, helpful staff always make the difference and in this case they make the hotel.  In particular Connor and Patrick for whom nothing was to much trouble.  We had a superior room which had plenty of space and was to a high standard.  The breakfast was great and plentiful.  The location was perfect for the centre of Dublin and visiting the main attractions.

I can't speak highly enough of the hotel and I would definitely stay here again!.",5,2006,02,08
236,Great hotel - fantastic location!,"I stayed at Brooks in January as part of a surprise weekend for my parents. After trawling through the Internet for deals in Dublin, booking direct with Brooks taking advantage of their 'Winter weekend' rate was the best value.  I wouldn't call this hotel cheap but it is good for Dublin and the service and food are fantastic.  I found the rooms small but very comfortable and the location ensures that all the key tourist areas of Dublin are within stumbling distance.  I pre-ordered champagne and flowers for my parent's room, both of which were presented beautifully.  The Manager had even sent a birthday card to my Mother!  Excellent - would strongly recommend.
",5,2006,02,03
236,Brooks is the best,"My husband and I have stayed in a few hotels in Dublin and having just returned from our latest trip, we have to say that the Brooks is the best we have experienced.  From the moment of arival the concierge met us wiht our luggage and struck up friendly chat-he remembered our names and was most helpful in suggesting little things like where I could get a manicure and a barber for my husband.  Our room was great-very comfy bed and the pillow menu was fantastic (I am very fussy about my pillows!).  Little touches like water in the room, robes and sweets on your pillow just add to the experience. Breakfast was superb-lots of choice and good quality.  We had a few drinks in the bar and some snacks, all of which were pretty reasonable for a hotel.  The location is perfect, central yet quiet.  All the staff were friendly and having stayed at some more expensive hotels in Dublin and getting poorer service, we would definitely return to the Brooks next time.
",5,2006,01,30
236,Comfort at the Brooks,"Found a midweek special at the Brooks through the internet, and spent three nights there. It was a treat.  Our standard room was comfortable, nicely decorated and, although not large was spacious enough for two, with plenty of storage space and a small refrigerator.  The bathroom is not large but it does have a full tub and shower and is modern and well-decorated. Our king sized bed was comfortable and there is a pillow menu with several choices.  Turn-down service with chocolates is a nice touch.  In the basement is a residents lounge with fireplace and comfortable furniture. Full Irish breakfast, cooked to order, was part of our package.  There is a parking garage across from the front of the hotel which gave us some noise but in general the street is quiet.  The location is terrific, close to all the major Dublin sights but not on a main noisy street.  The staff was friendly, solicitous and helpful.
",5,2006,01,26
236,"Excellent rooms, location, and service","Party of 10 staying at Brooks Hotel.
Rooms were excellent, The location is probably the best in Dublin. Restaurants and bars on doorestep.
Booked direct with hotel, great rates.
For a great nights entertainment book a table at the Arlington Hotel over the river.
",5,2006,01,24
236,A Great Choice!,"After reviewing many hotels in Dublin online, I was able to get a good package deal from the web site of the Brooks Hotel. We were quite pleased with this choice as the hotel is very centrally located as well as on a quiet street. The staff was very fiendly and the concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the city and its history. The breakfast was excellent ( buffet as well as cooked to order), the room while not large was comfortable and very clean. I would love to return to Dublin ( and I will as my daughter will be spending a year in the University there next year) and I would return to the Brooks.
",5,2006,01,23
236,Would stay again!,"We stayed at the Brooks for the first week of January plus New Years Eve.  The hotel was excellent.  Even prior to arriving they were more than accomodating, assisting my husband to have fresh flowers in our room upon checkin.  We were able to check into our room when we got there, which was suprising since it was 10am.  We had a complimentary upgrade to a superior room, but I managed to see the other rooms, and they all looked great.  Everyone on staff was extremely helpful, especially Connor, the concierge.  The breakfasts were lovely, and the lounge was relaxing and the prices were good.  The Gym was nice and clean, with a few pieces of cardio equipment, free weights and a sauna.  I did wish they had something more in that area, like an exercise ball, but there really wasn't space for it.  The location was excellent as well--just a few minutes from Grafton, and a few more from Temple Bar.  I'm sure we'll be seeing the folks at the Brooks again.
",5,2006,01,08
236,"Excellent, very relaxing","I chose the Brooks hotel on the basis of the reviews on this site and I have not been disappointed. I spent 4 nights in a superior, contemparary style room with my wife, and we enjoyed it very much.
We were welcomed by friendly staff, and concierge Connor provided us with maps and tourist tips. He is a kind man, he remembers guests names and makes a little chat every day, but also knows when to stop.
Sure, the room was not what you would call big, not the size I had expected. But it was comfortable, very clean and had a relaxing atmosphere. Bathroom also not very big, but again very clean and smart layout. Our room was at the front of the hotel, facing the street (don't expect a good view!) but inside it was very quiet, even with the rowdy weekend crowds outside. The bed was nice, we slept very good.
The hotel is modern, but not to 'hip', all in all it put me at ease. I only had breakfast at the hotel, and that was fine. In the basement we found a relaxing lounge for guests. It looked nice, and newspapers, books and even reading glasses are provided.
The location in central Dublin is great, all the must see places, shopping streets and restaurants are within walking distance, but the hotel itself is in a quiet street. And it's not at all a grubby street, as someone here mentioned before! Try the pub next to the hotel, 'The Hairy Lemon', for good beer and food, trendy bar 'Hogans' is just around the corner.
We have enjoyed Dublin very much, and it was always nice to get back to the Brooks after a busy day and evening. If you want to escape the city for a few hours, take the DART train for a 20 minutes trip to harbourtown Howth. You can walk around the cliffs, enjoy the vistas and have some great fish and chips at Beshoffs.
So, if you go to Dublin and you can afford it, I recommend the Brook heartely.
",5,2005,12,26
236,Nice Touches,"Couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer, I just spent 3 nights there and found it to be one of the better 4 star hotels I have stayed in.  The room was of good size, the bathroom very spacious and well equipped and nice cosy decor.  Nice little touches like turning the bed down, little bags of sweets on the pillow, bowl of fruit made it just a little bit better than the normal chain hotels I stay in.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Ivana and Ovvy in the bar which was also welcoming and not overly expensive.

The location is perfect, Temple Bar, Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green are minutes away and the hotel is in a fairly quiet area with a few nice pubs and coffee bars.  Metro just around the corner opposite the Grafton Capital is my favourite for breakfast and good coffee.

Having stayed at other hotels in Dublin - the Fitzwilliam, Grafton Capital and Jury's, I will make sure that in future I always stay here.
",4,2005,12,11
236,"Great location, friendly staff, good food, average rooms","We decided to stay here after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. I agree that the location is excellent, that the staff are friendly and efficient and that the food is good but I was extremely disappointed with our room. It was tiny. New York hotel rooms are generous by comparison! There was barely enough room to turn around in the bathroom and showering was difficult. The room was heated via aircon and was cold on our arrival. The bathroom was freezing throughout our three day stay as the aircon unit heated the bedroom area only. The room decor was drab. In my opinion this hotel is not worthy of its 4 stars and offers poor value for money.
",2,2005,12,08
236,"Great hotel, great food, great location","Just back from my first visit to Dublin, having decided to stay at Brooks after reading really positive reviews.  The hotel is in a fantastic location - a quiet street close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar, with ample long-stay parking opposite if required.  I received a truly warm welcome at the hotel and through my three night stay all my expectations were met and in some cases exceeded.  There is a first class restaurant, providing a splendid dinner and excellent breakfast.  Brooks was immaculate in its presentation - both in decor and cleanliness.  There was a concierge service to assist you in any way that was  required, quickly and courteously.  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would always choose to stay here on my return to Dublin.
",5,2005,12,05
236,Fantastic shopping girly weekend,"I stayed at the Brooks with my friend. We are both mid 20's and booked the Brooks after reading such good reviews about it and they are all true! We stayed in a contempory twin executive room. The cheapest I found it was through the hotels website directly using one of their special offer deals.

The location was fanastic, 3 streets back from Grafton St and 2 mins walk from St Stephens Green shopping centre.

We didn't eat dinner there at all but breakfast was really nice. We had it in our room on one day which was only 5 euros extra and we had a table that we could sit at to eat.

The room was a bit on the small size but we didn't actually need anymore space. And the fittings and fixtures were of really good quality. The bathroom in general was really luxurious.

The best thing about the hotel was the service. Connor on the concierge was really friendly and went out of his way to remember our names and ask us what we'd been up to. He even tried to get us to go out on the town (not with him mind)! 

The lounges were great and the bar prices were reasonable.

The pillow menu was also a really nice touch as was having a DVD player in our room. I suggest requesting one and taking our own dvd's. 

I've stayed in alot of 4 and 5 star hotels and I have to say the Brooks is one of my favourite. This was my 7th time in Dublin and I will definitly go back to stay at the Brooks next time.
",5,2005,11,28
236,very luxurious hotel stay here!!!!,"Just returned from this hotel, which I spent 2 nights in, fab!!!  The room I had was upgraded to deluxe so we had a dvd player and comfort chair and table in the bay window.  We had a 'pillow menu' to choose duck or synthetic filling and lovely toiletries also. After a hard days shopping we also we given a foot spa in our room! Ideal!  This hotel is in a great location 10 min walk to Temple bar, 10 min walk to grafton st and 15 min walk to o connell st.  There are shops and restaurants within 50 metres too!!  No problem with any 'dodgy' areas, and all staff were very hospitable.  Breakfast served was also lovely.  Would recommend and definately stay again.

236,Ideal Location,"I have just returned from a 2 night break in Brooks Hotel which I thoroughly enjoyed. A bit tricky to find, but parking straight opposite the Hotel entrance at a cost of €19 for the weekend, which ain`t bad by Dublin standards. I found the staff to extremely efficient / friendly but not over fussy. The rate we got for a rugby weekend was also good value. If you are looking to shop it is in the ideal location ...2 mins from Grafton St. The rooms were beatifully done & breakfast was excellent... we also dined one evening in the restaurant which we really enjoyed and was decent value at roughly €35.00 per head for 3 course dinner. If you are looking to catch a show when visiting Dublin ( which I did ), the Olympia Theatre is less than 5 mins walk from the Hotel.I will definitely return to this Hotel.
",5,2005,11,22
236,Great Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Brooks hotel on our honeymoon and it was wonderful.  We got a great deal as we were there at the beginning of the off season.  The staff at the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel location is great and within walking distance of most of Dublin's attractions (eg -Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street).  The room was beautiful, the bed was very comfortable, and everything was very clean.  We would definitely stay at the Brooks Hotel again if our travels take us to Dublin in the future.
",5,2005,11,17
236,friendly little Gem,"Stayed for three nights over a weekend.
On arrival Connor sat down with us and gave us a map of the city marking all the places that might interest us.  He asked our names and then remembered and used them throughout our stay.  He even remembered our daughters name (even though I could not remember telling him). His friendly efficiency alone would make me want to return.
  We were unlucky in that all superior rooms were booked, so no upgrades for us! Something we had read was strongly advised.  The room was small and I would have expected fresh sheets each day for the rates paid. However the bar was buzzing on Sat night and dinner sunday was good. V. nouvelle cuisine but tasty.  Wine good and reasonable. Waitress very friendly and efficient (from York).
  Position is excellent for all the attractions.
",4,2005,11,04
236,Brooks was great,"We just returned from 3 days at the Brooks last week. We really enjoyed our stay there. It's a few minutes walk to Grafton Street, not too far from Temple Bar Area ( believe me, you don't want to be too close. It gets too noisy at night). It's within walking distance of tons of other things to see and do as well. The only time we took a bus was to get from the Airport to the Brooks and we did the the Hop on-Hop off tour. Otherwise, everything is close enough to walk to: Temple Bar,  Grafton Street, Christchurch Cathedral.  Phoenix Park (zoo). It was a great location.
The staff is helpful and friendly. In fact, on the bus on the way from the airport we ran into an ex-employee of the Brooks and he escorted us to the front doors of the hotel! Our rooms were cleaned everyday and then another person came to make sure our room was clean. In the evening, 2 staff members came to make sure everything was ok and offered little squares of chocolate as well.  Our bed was huge and comfy and they even offer a pillow menu so you can order up the kind of pillow you want.
The breakfast was wonderful also. I would definately stay there again.

236,"Would Stay Again, In a Heart Beat!","We stayed three nights and enjoyed every moment of it.  I work in a small five star boutique in the states and am very picky when it comes to hotels.  I was not disappointed one bit and would recommend this hotel to any traveling friends or guests of my hotel.

We were greated by  Marvin, who escorted us to our hotel room and laid out a map and marked all the hot spots of Dublin for us.  He asked us our names and later during are stay when ever we saw him he greeted us by name and asked about our latest adventure in the city.  The whole staff was gracious and extremely friendly, we felt very well taken care of.

Our room was quaint, not too small but, just perfect!  It sat on the 5th floor on the main street side and noise was not an issue one bit, and we slept with the window open as well.  The room was also cleaned daily, and turn down service was prompt and completed nightly.

The continental breakfast that was included in our stay was outstanding, the best continental breakfast that I have seen by far.  On the third morning, we had to catch a early flight and were going to miss the breakfast but, the front desk made us aware that they could deliver it to our room for us.  Sure enough, at 4:30am there was our breakfast, delivered with a smile.  We also enjoyed sitting in the lounge and quickly made friends with the bar staff who delivered drinks to our rooms when requested.

Perfect location for all the site seeing.  We walked to every place we needed and wanted to see.  Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Stephens Green, Trinity, St. Patricks Cathedral & Christchurch.

When we return, we will not hesitate and will book our reservation with ""The Brooks"" every time.  The Brooks should be proud, they have a beautiful hotel with a great staff.

236,Wonderful!  Hope to come back!,"Stayed at the Brooks Hotel for our September, 2005 Honeymoon.  We absolutely loved it!  We booked this hotel based upon reviews from TripAdvisor and used Expedia to create our flight/hotel package.  We stayed in a Superior Room, on the 6th floor on the back side of the hotel (non street side).  It was quiet, comfortable and spacious.

Helpful, accomodating, nice--doesn't even begin to describe how great the staff and their accomodations are.  The hotel is 6-stories, approx 120 room hotel situated right near Trinity.  

We found that the hotel was walkable to everything--pubs, sights, great restaurants, Grafton Street shopping, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green.  Our room was spotless when we arrived, a tidied everyday by housekeeping.  They also offer turndown service in the evening, and leave a few sweets by the bed.  

We visited the restaurant for continental breakfast the day we left, found it to be a little on the expensive side, but I'm aware that their room packages can include breakfast daily.  The bar area was rather small, but quaint, and given the size of the hotel, perfectly appropriate.  

My husband and I didn't use or visit the gym facilities, but I glanced in once and it appeared to be rather new, hardly used equipment.  

Definitely worth it!

236,Brooks Hotel,"After reading the excellent reviews we booked a room at Brooks Hotel for a 3 day stay in Dublin to celebrate my birthday and we weren't disappointed.  We had a really nice, comfortable room with a stylish bathroom and great shower!  The room was cleaned everyday and replenished with towels, mineral water and tea/coffee.  There was also a DVD player in the room and a good selection of TV channels.  The hotel is in a central location and in walking distance to all the main areas in Dublin (Grafton Street, Temple Bar etc.).  The bar was a little on the expensive side but to be expected.  We tried the continental and cooked breakfast which were both very nice (although the cooked breakfast was quite small).  The receptionists were all really helpful and advised us on the best time to leave for the airport etc. and also offered to send tea and toast up to the room as we had to leave very early for our flight.

The day of my birthday we went out for the day and when we arrived back to the hotel we discovered the manager had left a bowl of fruit and a 'happy birthday' message in our room which we felt was a really nice touch, the cleaners had obviously read my cards as the message wished me a happy 30th!  We really enjoyed our stay at Brooks and would definitely stay there again.

236,Great Central Location,"On the western edge of SE Dublin...  GREAT location - easy walk to Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Square, Trinity College, and the Temple Bar area.  Tons of restaurants and pubs in the area.  Nice room, very good staff - friendly, hospitable, efficient.  Breakfast included - both continental and cook to order.  A bit difficult to get to the hotel driving, but that's probably true of most places in downtown Dublin - traffic is bad, even for the locals.  Parking is in a public garage across the street - with special rates for hotel guests.  Some occasional street noise at night, but not a big problem..

Overall, the great location really makes this hotel a choice place to stay.  Just park the car when you arrive, and leave it until you depart.
",4,2005,08,28
236,"Tiny room, far too expensive!","My boyfriend and I booked a double room but were given a room that was so small it was obviously only meant for 1 person.  Although there was a double bed there was only 1 chair and no space to move without bumping into things.  There was also only 1 cup and saucer in the room which certainly indicated that the room should have only been for 1.  We complained but the manager would not move us, instead she offered us a free drink which I did not feel was adequate compensation.  The room was also very expensive.  This hotel did not match its description in any way.  The only redeeming feature was the central location.

236,Brooks Hotel,"I really enjoyed myself, so did my wife.  We went to celebrate my birthday like we do every year.  My birthday is so special.  I love my birthday.  If i had my way my front room at home would be like the lounge room in the hotel.  Lovely, Well done.  Paul.
",5,2005,08,25
236,Great boutique hotel,"I booked this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor and was not disappointed.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. It's a small, cosy hotel which was very tastefully furnished.  The rooms were small in size but again cosy and fully equipped with iron, tea and coffee facilities etc. Breakfast spread was fantastic here, good variety. Downstairs they have guests only reading room which was great to relax in.  All in all, no complaints about this hotel, definitely value for money, great service and excellent location only minutes away from the main shopping area.
",5,2005,08,25
236,"Wonderful Location, Very Nice Rooms","Spent a long weekend at the Brooks in early August.  

While Brooks is located down a rather unprepossesing street (at night the street was populated by rather dodgy looking people skulking in building corners) it really is in a wonderfully convenient spot - very easy walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green.

The staff were friendly and very professional.  Rooms was of good size, well decorated, and spotlessly clean.  Pillow menu was definitely a nice touch.  Only downside to the room was the fact that you had to request the mini bar be stocked in advance - really inconvenient when you're feeling thirsty and peckish at 2 am.  Another nice feature were the multiple country power plugs - very convenient for travelers.

Did not eat in restuaurant, however did order room service at 2am.  Menu quite limited, but the food was delicious - the greens were so fresh you'd swear they'd just been picked -  and it arrived v. promptly; just be sure to request condiments if you want them on your sandwich!

We'd definitely recommend Brooks for your Dublin stay - we'll definitely be back!",4,2005,08,18
236,Overall a hotel just like any other in Europe...,"Myself and Mum stayed at the Brooks Hotel for a week, which I suppose is unusual as I think most people stay only a couple of nights.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Superior room at no extra cost, which was a good start!  We were located on the First Floor, which has not been modernised yet, but even so, the room was huge, 2 very big beds, the bathroom was ok but not brilliant, but there was plenty of storage place plus a fridge!!!  The fridge was definitely an added bonus as it stopped milk, etc from the shop going off.  Did we use the Pillow Menu?  We sure did, and the next day I received a different one...and had a better sleep than the first night, so you make your own minds up if different pillows work or not!  There was no extra charge for this service.

The Brooks Hotel seem to have many Concierges and the one who we spoke to the most was an Oriental chap called Martyn.  He gave us advice on Tours, etc we could go on and he was a right laugh, always smiling.  The rest of the staff were also very pleasant but the staff in the dining room could not cope with large numbers of people, i.e. getting breakfast orders wrong, etc.

If we had paid for the breakfast it would have cost 17 Euro each, which is extortionate for what we got, which, to be honest, wasn't a lot.  A traditional Irish Breakfast it was not.  Cooked breakfasts seem to be a dying art in ""posh"" hotels and I am sure that if we had stayed in a Guest House instead the breakfasts would have been more traditional...they are supposed to be ""legendary"" after all.

We took the Half Board option, initially, as we knew the restaurants were expensive in Dublin.  The first night I had food from the ""Early Bird Menu"" which costs no more than 20 Euro.  This involved eating Corn Fed Chicken on a bed of...well, I don't know what it was but there was no choice of vegetables.  Mum had the salmon and we both had the Rhubarb Crumble and Ice Cream.  All this cost 37 Euro which was payable on the final day.

Fair enough.

Then came the second day.  The ""Early Bird Menu"" was the same all week (and I suspect, all season) so I had no choice but to pick from the A La Carte Menu instead.  Yet again I picked chicken, this time of the organic variety.  It was no different from the chicken I had the previous night but this one cost me 21 EUROS!!!!!!!  Once my Mum's order and the rhubarb choice was added on at the end it came to just over 50 EUROS!!  Apparently, 60 EUROS is the norm for 2 A La Carte choices.  If there had been a choice of vegetables each time I would have enjoyed the meals more.  After the second day we did not eat any more in that restaurant and chose to do our own thing.

Granted, it is a 4 Star Hotel, but having a choice of vegetables should be the norm, in my view.  Not everyone enjoys eating what I call ""arty-farty"" food, although there were many Spaniards and Scandinavians staying there, no Brits whatsoever, so I suppose they love all that.

But why should we?

It's not fair!!!

So, to sum up, great hotel room, air-conditioning fabulous, but the food was a total rip-off I'm afraid (like everywhere else in Dublin...and the drinks, don't mention those)!!!!!!!!

Would I stay there again?

Nope!

Would I stay in Dublin again?

Nope!

Roll on Las Vegas in December, can't wait for that one!

236,warm friendly hotel,"My sister and I stayed at Brooks Hotel on the 22nd July,2005.
Our mission was a shopping trip. We were delighted with the warm reception we received on arrival. We arrived at 11.30am and we were allowed check in and avail of our room at that time. 
The room was beautifully furnished. In particular the air conditioning was appreciated as it was a very humid hot day. The toiletries were lovely. We could not fault anything. We had a meal in Francescas Restaurant that night and it was lovely. After a very comfortable sleep we had a lovely breakfast. Everything was homemade, freshly squeezed juice and fruit salad and lovely scones. 
We will definately be back. Its so perfect for a shopping trip or any occasion. Keep up the high standards.

236,My Favorite Hotel in Dublin,"I've traveled to Ireland a few times and the Brooks is my favorite hotel in Dublin.  I stayed there with family in the fall of 2004.  The rooms are good sized when compared to most city European hotels.  It is so convenient to restaurants and pubs.  It was so nice to be able to walk to everything in Dublin because driving in the city is often confusing.  The staff was wonderful.  The check-in process was fast and the desk clerk gave me a European charger for my mobile phone.  Each day we had questions for the concierge and he always had great recommendations for us.  The absolute best part about this hotel was the beds.  My family members agreed:  They are the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in.  The only drawback is there was a bit of street noise, as our room faced the street.  But that is to be expected when staying at a mid-city hotel.  I can't recommend the Brooks enough.
",5,2005,07,31
236,Loved the Brooks!,"Stayed at the Brooks with my wife for three nights, following two nights at the St. Stephens Green Hotel.  The Stephens Green was nice, but somewhat sterile.  The Brooks was much more comfortable and inviting, while offering the same high standards you would expect from a four star hotel. The staff were pleasant and very helpful.  I've seen comments that the rooms here are a bit small.  I thought they were actually on the large-side by European standards.  It could be that the king-size bed makes them seem a bit smaller than they are.  In any event, the rooms are certainly large enough that you don't feel cramped in any way.  The bathrooms are a little small, but very, very clean and very modern.  Again, not small enough that you feel cramped in any way.  I would compare the rooms to what you would expect if you checked into one of the nicer, modern Hiltons in the US.  The rate we had was a bed and breakfast rate.  The breakfast was fantastic.  Full irish cooked breakfast and full buffet, until 10:00 am!  The hotel bar in the evening is nice, as well.  It is very cozy, and it is a great place to have a drink after being out during the day and before heading out for the night.  Best of all, the location of the hotel is as good as it gets.  The Brooks is on a quiet side street that spans a long block between two busy streets, and it is literally minutes from anything and everything you want to see in Dublin.  Temple Bar is less than a five minute walk.  Grafton Street is less than five minutes.  O'Connell Street is less than ten minutes.  Trinity College is less than ten minutes, etc., etc.  You won't find a better located hotel in Dublin.  All in all, this hotel was a great find.  Great accomodations, fantastic location, wonderful staff...it has it all.  You will love the Brooks hotel.

236,Fantastic.. highly recommended,"Stayed at the Brooks hotel 2 weeks ago. Planned it as a suprise for my boyfriend's birthday. I was a bit wary as I never make the arrangements but was pleasantly suprised.

Great Location, 5 minutes walk to Temple Bar.. far enough to be away from the crowds. Just behind Grafton St. great for shopping ! and St Stephens green is just around the corner.

Service was excellent, everyone was very friendly and helpful (yes Conor was great too !). Room was great.. 6th floor and I think we were given a superior room. Very spacious and accomodating.

Would highly recommend.. the other hotels looked like nothing in comparison. The only downside are the views.. offices one side, car park the other.. but what can you expect in a City !!

236,Hotel Concierge Made Our Stay in Ireland!,"Brooks Hotel is excellent.  It is clean, beautifully appointed with unusual Asian art and antiques. The rooms are cozy, warm and inviting.  But, what makes the hotel so inviting is the main concierge.  He couldn't be more accomodating.  He will greet you as you enter and assure that you receive everything you need- and more.  Even if you should require nothing, he is warm, concerned, and informative.  We will return there because of his service and friendship!

236,great hotel,"We have just returned from a three day break in Dublin. This is the first time I have written a review but i just thought I should given the excellent location, staff and food in this hotel. Connor must have read the reviews since he asked what he should call us - Mr.Mrs or just first names. The bar has an excellent choice of whiskeys - ask for the Welsh one. A great location yet quiet, nice rooms - I recomend staying here

236,Great area and very friendly staff,"I stay at the Brooks Hotel in July for a few days.  I have to say my stay was quite enjoyable and fun.  The staff was very helpful, especially Conor.  If you need to do anything, go anywhere, or need a simple question answered he is the person.  The location of the hotel is awesome because it is right by shopping and the Temple Bar area which is a must.  I also recommend the hotel restaurant which was very good if you want to try traditional Irish food with a flare.  I would totally stay there again.
",5,2005,07,05
236,Great hotel in great location,"We stayed here for only one night and really enjoyed our stay.  The staff was friendly and accomodating.  Our meal in the restaurant was outstanding.  The Brooks is in a great location.  There are health club facilities that we would have used if we'd been there longer.   Yes, the rooms are a little small but we expect this in a large city.  There was plenty of room for luggage and to move around comfortably.
",5,2005,07,04
236,Would stay here again,"I was very pleased with the Brooks hotel. The only drawback was our room was across from the parking garage and it could be a bit noisy, but I would definatley stay here again. The staff was very helpful and kind, and thought the hotel was in a good location. It was a welcome relief after a less than pleasant stay at Jury's Galway.
",5,2005,06,13
236,Strange Mix,"I recently had two stays at Brooks Hotel in Dublin and would stay there again only if nothing else was available.  On the plus side, the hotel staff is quite good although the main concierge is too aggressive in his offers to assist, and way too personal (e.g., he calls you by your first name).  The rooms are incredibly small.  The rooms with modern decor are dark and garrish.  The pillow menu is a nice touch, but the hotel uses inferior linens, including vinyl mattress pads.  In one bathroom, the door was spring mounted which prevented it from staying open, a towel bar was loose as were the faucets, and the toilet handle interferred with the seat staying up.  The cooked breakfast is far better than the cold portion which was poor in quality.  Overall, Brooks is not a good value for the money.
",2,2005,06,07
236,Perfect accomodation in a beautiful city,"We stayed at the Brooks hotel in April and were pleasantly surprised, even after reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor.

Brooks is situated in the perfect spot in Dublin - right in the middle of the trendiest area, near tonnes of gorgeous boutiques and the best bars. It is located in a quiet side street, which is certainly not picturesque, but was fine with us.

The room was fairly small, or maybe it was just that the bed was so huge, and very comfortable.  Everything was very well equipped and well designed and the decor was very modern and clean.

The staff were great; very friendly and gave us detailed directions to wonderfully traditional Irish bars in Temple Bars, which is only a couple of minutes walk away.  Breakfast was lovely - my mother-in-law would have appreciated the crisp white tablecloths and pristine service.  My only recommendation would be to get to the buffet breakfast in good time to ensure you get a full choice.

If you enjoy good food, an excellent selection of bars, a drink or two and a bit of shopping then Dublin is the place for you.
",5,2005,06,05
236,fantastic staff,"Stayed here with my wife for a weekend in May.I have to agree with all the positive comments about the quality of the beds and pillows, and the power shower was great.We missed Connor on the concierges desk but Damien his colleague did us proud with some recommendations for pubs and restaurants.It's a laid-back luxury hotel and we hope to return soon
",5,2005,06,04
236,Brooks was terrific,"We stayed at the Brooks for 4 nights May 13-16 2005.  We had a room on the fourth floor, towards the back.  There is a restaurant below, on that side, but noise was not a problem at all.  The room was nicely decorated and comfortable.  The Brooks staff, especially Connor, was very helpful in all aspects.  The breakfasts were wonderful.  The best thing about the Brooks is it's central location.  You can walk easily to all Dublin locations.  We used the Resident's Lounge to write our post cards.  It is very cozy.  If we go back to Dublin again, we'll definately stay at the Brooks again.
",5,2005,06,01
236,"Lovely Hotel, great location, but do upgrade if poss","My husband and I have just returned from a weekend in Dublin, and stayed at Brooks Hotel as a direct result of Tripadvisor reviews.  The hotel is modern, very well appointed, with a comfy bar/lounge area and great fire.  The little touches such as turn down service, chocs on the pillows are nice (but in the price!).  The unstocked fridge was great, the shower was powerful in a great bathroom but take your own hairdryer, as the one provided is useless.  We couldn't swing a cat in our standard room, hardly room to walk round the bed.  If I was staying again, I'd upgrade to an executive room.  The beds are kingsize in a large room, with extras like DVD player (take your own if you intend to watch one as the hotel's list for hire is a bit poor). 
The location is first class, right next to Temple Bar and walking distance to all the main streets, with shops, restaurants etc.  The Hairy Lemon pub is a few steps down the road, and offers the rustic charm of an Irish bar. Try Farringtons bar in Temple Bar.  It does a tremendous pub lunch, with huge portions.  
There are no ""views"" to speak of from this hotel.  Drury Street is not picturesque, but the inside makes up for the multi-storey car park opposite, and I believe, rubbish bins at the back!  
One downside to this place was that the B&B status is only continental breakfast.  The hotel aren't very upfront about this, and we only realised on checking out. If you want a cooked breakfast to set you up for a day's shopping, it wil cost you 35 euros per couple.  My advice is to suffice with the cereal/toast and get a breakfast or lunch elsewhere.  There are loads of places to chose from, and you will not be charged that price, which was poor value, for the plated semi-warm breakfast that arrived.
The Consierge, Connor is all he is made out to be on tripadvisor! Friendly, chatty, and helpful.  He gets 5 stars, the rest of the hotel gets 4, mainly for the breakfast, as the room size was our fault, for preferring large but not asking for it! I would still stay here again, and visit Dublin again.  The best part about Dublin was the non-smoking in the pubs (if you don't smoke!) it was a welcome relief to not have your hair and clothes stinking of smoke after a night out, unfortunately, in the UK, not something that occurs usually.  An enjoyable trip, and great hotel, location spot on.
",4,2005,05,31
236,Nice but flawed,"We stayed at the Brooks in mid May. The hotel itself is quite nice, but there were several flaws that made it less than satisfying. First, be careful where they put you in the hotel. We stayed in rooms 111 and 115 which back directly to a rear entrance of a restaurant. At 1:00 am the staff was cleaning up and dumping trash right outside our window. Any room on that side and end of the hotel will have the same issue. The other side, which faces a relatively quiet street would be far better. 
Second, the staff was young and most were well-meaning, but inexperience is not a good thing in a four star hotel. Most of the time there didn't seem to be a senior person overseeing what went on.
Finally, the parking situation is ridiculous. The hotel charges 6.5 euros per night for overnight parking. That didn't sound bad, but it did not include daytime parking which costs 2.5 euros per hour! And if you want to leave early, the parking lot does not open until 7:30 am. There is a 24 hour lot nearby, but the cost is similar.
The positives are that the smallish rooms are quite well done and the beds are great. Terrific location to walk old Dublin.

236,Great Reception Staff at the Brooks Hotel !,"My bride and I just returned from our first trip to Dublin, and the Brooks Hotel staff made our trip memorable.  One of our suitcases was lost and for three days the staff contacted the airline to find it, sent e-mails, wrote notes, and they finally were successful in having it shipped to our next destination in Waterford. Keith, Brendan and Ger and the  others were so genuinely gracious in helping us.  And the room was wonderful, the restaurant superb, the neighborhood in The Temple was quiet at night yet great for dining and shopping.  The Brooks Hotel is a modern one, built on a few years ago, and with its superb staff makes any trip a joy, We shall always stay at the Brooks hotel on our returns to Dublin.

236,Great location,"Small hotel but offers the amenities of larger luxury hotels.  Was impressed with their pillow menu and very comfortable beds.  Location was great and very central to the shopping district, restaurants and Temple Street.  

Staff was very accomodating but did not quickly respond to inquiries or requests... possibly due to the fact that the hotel was fully booked and busy at the time.  

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for central location and very comfortable accomodations - loved the bathroom and plasma TV!
",4,2005,05,06
236,"Superb, centrally located hotel.","We stayed in a large, clean and comfortable double room on the 4th floor with king size bed and superb bathroom.  The hotel is located in a quiet street close to many interesting places and landmarks within the city centre.  Although we were advised that the street itself is not the most enchanting, this turned out to be relatively unimportant.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and Grafton Street is also close at hand.  The staff provided an efficient and friendly service throughout our stay.  The 'pillow menu' and evening check-up to ensure continued satisfaction were both welcome touches.  The hotel provides an excellent breakfast - one of the best I have experienced.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.

236,Well worth it,"Stayed at Brooks Hotel in a standard double for 3 nights. The foyer and bar are nice, as was our room. The room had a hugh double bed and a blissfully powerful shower in the bathroom. Breakfast was lovely. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly at this hotel which is what makes it stand out from other 4* hotels. The only negative thing I can think of is that our bathroom was a little small. However, overall a great hotel and excellent value for money.

236,"For Sure, One of the best in Dublin !!!","Just returned from a long weekend in Dublin and can't wait to go back again.  Stayed in many hotels and none I feel go out of their way to make you feel as welcome as Brooks. There was always fresh apples on receiption, mini chocolates eggs as it was easter and sweets on your pillows at bedtime.  The hotels was spot on for accomodation and cleanliness.  We had a standard room (far better than some superiors of others!) with a bed you could have had a party in (room 207).  Every member of staff knew their role and played it to natural perfection.  Brooks is in the ideal location for shops, nightlife and sightseeing.  I don't have a negative word to say about both the hotel and it's staff and can only say that one would'nt be as good without the other.
To all at Brooks, Thank you and hope to see you all again soon.

236,Nothing short of excellent,"The Brooks Hotel is an intimate boutique hotel with excellent attention to detail: they offer a pillow menu for every sleeping taste and comfort (at no extra charge).  Their hearty and varied Irish breakfast menu (included in the room price) will well set up any traveller for a day of wandering this wonderful city. A beautifully appointed downstairs lounge offers a library and a quiet civilized respite from the daily hubbub. We (myself, husband and teenaged daughter) found the staff exceedingly friendly and helpful and we always felt our multitude of questions were welcome.  The staff offered friendly and detailed attention to any request or query - much more than we expected.  The location is terrific - a walk to most sights/restaurants/music etc.  I would definitely return here and am confident in recommending The Brooks to others.

236,Great Break,"My wife and I stayed at Brooks for 4 nights on the recommendation of the reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not to be disappointed, even the taxi driver congratulated us on our choice. Very friendly and helpful. Lovely rooms, especially the Superior rooms. Excellent, central loction, just minutes from Grafton Street. Lots of restaurants and bistros near by.
Any drawbacks? Not the most elegant of streets, the entrance is opposite a multi storey carpark, but if the inside is more important than the outside to you, then this is a good choice.

236,Fantastic!,"Recently returned from a 2 night 'girlie' break at the Brooks and coudn't recommend it highly enough! The location is spot on - right next to Grafton Street ideal for shops, bars restaurants, theatre etc.

The room we had was very comfortable and so quiet at night, considering how close the hotel is to the nightlife.

One of the nicest things we found was the service. After a long day shopping we arrived in reception exhausted and were offered the use of a foot spa, which 10 mins later was brought up to our room by 2 staff, who set it all out for us, gave us instructions, lotions and fluffy towels and left us to it! Bliss! 

The breakfasts were great and were served until midday - great after a late night out!

All in all the perfect weekend break hotel - would definately recommend it and I am sure we will be back. And the Irish are just wonderful and so friendly!

The location of the hotel is excellent, the staff very friendly and most efficient.  The only fault I could find was that the rooms were smaller than expected.  We did have a drink in the bar where the bartender was most helpful in recommending us a very good restaurant, and she then booked it for us, we were most impressed.  Would definitely book this hotel again.

236,Fantastic Location,"We have just returned from our first visit to Dublin and what a blast! The Brooks is probably the best located hotel in Dublin, literally minutes from the vast selection of bars, cafes and restaurants and just around the corner from Grafton Street.
    The staff at the hotel were simply the best and the concierge (Connor and Patrick) were the most helpful we have ever met. Don't forget to use the residents lounge in the basement, it's really cosy. The breakfasts were delicious.
    There is a fab little bar about 25 metres from the hotel called the Hairy Lemon, great to start off a night on the town.
    The only down side to Dublin are the extortionate prices, we ate in reastaurants on the two nights we were there (Le Caprice and also an Indian restaurant we found) and the prices were crazy.
    We were advised before we went to experience the pub food in the traditional Irish bars and we will do this the next time as the food is equally as good and less than half the price.
    ........and finally, the Irish people are simply the best in the world and made the holiday for us - all the taxi drivers have a story to tell.

236,Fantastic little hotel!,"wonderful staff, breakfast, location and rooms!  I would recommend the Brookes Hotel to everyone!

236,Superb!,"Spent just 1 night in brooks on Dec27th with my wife escaping from the kids. Although irish ive been out of Dublin a good few years and find it difficult to find reasonable accomodation for a break when i'm back.

Brooks is certainly a find and i will return. It doesnt get any more central, staff are plentlyful, the rooms spotless and the breakfast 10/10. 

Also if your looking for a classy/quaint restaurant to add to the mood you wont go wrong with the trocadero which is only 5mins away.

Best rate i found on -----------------",5,2005,01,05
236,This should definitely be your No.1 choice!,"I stayed at Brooks for three nights over New Year with my girlfriend and my old folks. They had stayed there before but I wasn't really sure what to expect.

The first thing that hits you is the excellent location. It is located about a five minute walk from the heart of this wonderful city and is within easy access to a great number of bars, pubs and restaurants. While I'm on the subject, try ""the Hairy Lemon"" pub which is next door to the hotel for a really atmospheric, Irish pub.

The hotel itself is extremely welcoming. It is impeccably clean and extremely cosy. The recently refurbished bar area is modern and really comfortable with dark leather sofas and a wide open fire. The perfect place to unwind if the weather is not great!

Overall, I cannot fault this hotel. To sum up, the service was truly excellent, the common areas very clean and cosy, the bedrooms very spacious and inviting and the location perfect. You also don't have to break the bank to stay here. Give this hotel a go and you will not be disappointed.

236,Deserves the good reviews,"Just back from a couple of nights at Brooks. Doubt if you can have a more central location in Dublin. Friendly staff without being pushy. All gave the impression that they enjoy working at Brooks. Immediate upgrade to superior room. Very modern without being too minimalistic. Shower and tub. Spacious room. Comfy bed with good linen. The Pillow menu was amusing. Yes you can actually choose the type of pillow you want. Breakfast was good and cooked to order, plus buffet. Breakfast til 12 on the Sunday. Bar is a bit hotel like, but plenty of choice nearby including slightly hidden Stags Head which is well worth finding. All in all a stress free and enjoyable place to stay. Would return.
",5,2004,12,01
236,"Terrific location, accomodations, price","We stayed at Brooks for three nights last week and it was really terrific. I travel a lot for work, but this was a vacation and my husband and I were very impressed. Staff was friendly--every hotel needs a guy like Connor on their team--the location was fabulous...just a short walk to pubs and restaurants and some really great nightlife. Rooms are immaculate, bathrooms in marble and very nice. This isn't a 5-star, but a very good 4-star--especially for the price and location. A very positive experience.
",5,2004,11,30
236,"For once, a hotel to actually recommend!","We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Brooks.  The hotel is situated in an area with numerous good eating opportunities whilst still only being a stone's throw away from the main sights.  We had a standard room that was a decent size with good facilities and a very comfortable king sized bed.  Apart from Saturday night (the day Ireland beat S.Africa at Landsdowne Road!), there were no noise problems whatsoever.  Breakfast was good and very well organized, as were all of the hotel staff that we dealt with.  The area around the hotel came alive at night and we did not consider it to be in the least bit threatening like some other TripAdvisors.  All in all, a very good hotel in a great city.
",5,2004,11,16
236,"Excellent Hotel, would definately recommend","I took my mum for her birthday on 13/14 November 2004.  As soon as we arrived the staff were very welcoming and the porters were on hand immediately to show us areas of interest on a local map.  We had booked a standard room, however they actually upgraded us to an Executive Suite which was very modern and clean with all the mod cons you would expect from an Executive Suite.  The beds were enormous and very very comfy!  The bathroom was also very good with both a shower cubicle and a separate bath.  After speaking with other guests, we were told that the standard rooms were also very nice and clean.  The actual area of the hotel was also excellent and minutes walk to all the major attractions ie. Grafton Street, Temple Bar etc.   I would also recommend the City Bus Tour as the drivers are very entertaining as well as giving a very good insight to Dublin.  All in all we had a lovely stay at Brooks Hotel and would definately go back if ever I was to visit Dublin again. 5*'s

236,Overpriced but pleasant,"Euro/boutique style hotel in a central location a few blocks from Grafton. Small, semi-claustrophobic yet semi-luxe rooms. Nice restaurant and lobby bar but these are overpriced along with the hotel.
",4,2004,10,28
236,Will definitely be going back,"Just back from a fantastic two nights in Dublin and the Brooks Hotel could not be faulted. Excellent staff and facilities and can't wait to go back to stay longer
",5,2004,10,20
236,Brooks a gem!!,"I have stayed at several hotels in the Dublin area within the past year and recommend Brooks Hotel highly.  The bed, turn down service, breakfast are comfortable and nice.  The staff are so very friendly-  Especially Conner and Ashley.  The lobby level bar is lovely and a nice place to meet friends for a drink. The hotel is centrally located- quite close to Grafton and Wicklow streets.  The hotel is located in the heart of the city, near businesses and pubs.  In response to an earlier review all storefronts in Dublin are shuttered and boarded up when they are closed.   Give Brooks hotel a try.  You will be glad that you did
",5,2004,10,16
236,Loved the Brooks,"My friend & I just returned from our stay at the Brooks on September 29, 2004.  I've stayed at several other 4* Dublin hotels & the Brooks is  absolutely the best.  The location is great althought the street isn't the prettiest of streets but it is nice & quite with a short walk to the best Dublin shopping on Grafton Street, Temple Bar & St. Stephens Green.  Connor & the rest of the hotel staff were awesome & did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.  The full Irish breakfast which was included in our room rate was terrific with both cold & hot food cooked to order.  Usually you just get a cold continental breakfast not at the Brooks you get it all.   The staff at the restaurant even rushed our breakfast order so we could quickly eat before we left for the airport.  The rooms were decorated nicely with all the standard amentities including some nice upgrades radio, unstocked refrigerator, DVD player, in-room safe.  My friend's description of the bed, linens & the pillow menu as being scrumptious.  The bed was so comfortable you didn't want to get up in the morning to start the day of sightseeing.  The Brooks is my favorite Dublin hotel and can't wait to return.  Everything was A+.",5,2004,10,14
236,Review from Boston Traveler,"My husband and I just returned from a week stay at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin.  The Brooks Hotel proved to be an excellent choice for us.  We arrived at the hotel about 7 AM after an overnight flight from Boston.  The front desk asked if we could just wait a few minutes while they tried to secure us a room early.  Within 10 minutes we were assigned our room ... which is super after the long flight, little sleep and the early morning hour.  We were able to catch a nap before heading out for our first sites of Dublin.

The staff at the hotel is very friendly and helpful.  The Conceirges - Patrick and Conar were both helpful with some side trips we wanted to take, and dinner reservations.  The hotel is on a side street and very quiet.  There was no street noise that might interrupt sleep at night and that's a plus when in a big city.  We paid for a Superior Room and it was quite nice.  The rate was 215 euros per night and that included a full breakfast for 2.  We didn't consider that to pricey and enjoyed our stay.  The room was larger than some we've had in other cities in Europe, there was plenty of space to store a week worth of clothing.  There are king sized beds that are very comfortable, turn down service each night.

While Drury street is not the prettiest street in Dublin we never felt afraid even later at night when walking back from dinner or a pub.  The hotel is within a 5/10 minute walk to Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green or over the Liffey to O'Connell or Henry Street.  There are many nice restaurants within a 10 minute walk as well ... just ask the Conceirge for a recommendation and they will make your reservation for you.  And for a quick drink or lunch ... right on the corner from The Brooks is the Hairy Lemon Pub ... we stopped for a drink on the way back later in the afternoon and one day had lunch.  Give it a try.

Overall, our experience at the Brooks was Very Good to Excellent and we would recommend giving it a try.  Don't be put off by the side street location ... we found that to be a plus.",4,2004,10,09
236,Lovely hotel in good location,"We have just spent 5 days here and it was lovely.  All staff are very proessional and extremely helpful.  We had a standard room and although not the biggest room we had ever stayed in, it didn't need to be - smallish but perfectly formed! The beds are huge and really comfortable and there is a pillow menu! A unique touch. Dury Street is certainly not the most stylish street, but we definitely didn't feel unsafe and it really didn't worry us at all. It is a perfect quiet, central location. Like a lot of Dublin, it is a developing street. When we return to Dublin, we will be staying here and so should you!
",5,2004,10,07
236,Rooms small with few plugs!!,"Nice service from the staff and a great location but there are no plugs for computers or even my wife's hair curler.  We had to unplug the TV to turn on my laptop or to curl her hair.   Rooms are really pretty tight in terms of space for the price, too.
",2,2004,09,27
236,"Very nice hotel, scary area","I hate to say it because it's not the hotels fault but I wouldn't recommend staying here.  The hotel itself is wonderful.  Beautiful lobby, spacious rooms for European standards, nice little extras (like a speaker for the TV in the bathroom, a small sewing kit and shoe shiner on the bathroom counter basket, chocolate on the pillows) but the area was not so good.  Dublin is small so we only had to walk a few blocks before it started looking better and actually, if you exited the hotel and made two quick lefts, it got good rather quickly. However, we usually had to go one of the other three directions and that was what was bad.  The hotel is in an ALLEY that had garbage dumpsters and spray paint.  Walking down it wasn't too reassuring.  If you turned off half way through, that street wasn't too appealing either as half the store fronts were boarded up.  If you're on your honeymoon where you won't be coming out too much :o) or if you are one who likes to call a cab for everything, then I guess you could consider this hotel as it is nice  but if you do any amount of walking around, I would recommend staying somewhere else.  It's a shame but the area just didn't stay up to the hotel's standards.",2,2004,09,18
236,A terrific hotel in a great location,"We spend 5 nights at the Brooks Hotel in late July.  The hotel is in a terrific location, a couple of blocks from Grafton Street.  The staff is extremely helpful, in particular Connor, the concierge.  The hotel offers a great breakfast.  A really nice touch was the ""Pillow Menu"" in the room.  One could order different types of pillows that were delivered when your room is next made up.  

The hotel staff was terrific even when we had our plans change.  We had reservations for three nights in a standard room.  When we had an opportunity to get to Dublin two days early, we called the hotel to see if they could accommodate us.  THey not only found us a room, but they gave us a deluxe room for all five nights, and charged us the standard rate for three of them.
",5,2004,09,13
236,Okey,"We stayed here after reading good reviews at this place. And the hotel is nice, good reception, friendly staff etc. We got a room that was a bit small, but clean. Unfortunatly, our room was right with the elevator - and a door - that woke us up every morning while it slamed back and forth.
But, quiet hotel - with superb loaction. We got a great deal on the hotel price, but that didn't include breakfast. So we were chared for breakfast - 35 Euros for the two of us! Not worth it.
",4,2004,09,04
236,Great Service,"Having stayed in many hotels in Dublin over the years and knowing what they promise they dont always deliver I was pleasantly surprised upon my arrival at Brooks.  The rooms were modern and a good size and hotel centrally located but what made it so enjoyable was the friendliness of the staff. They made my stay at  Brooks one of my most enjoyable hotel stays anywhere in the world. 

As for people marking the hotel down because it was in an obscure back street, that is hard to understand. It is in an excellent location, handy to sites, shopping, bars and clubs but not affected by the street noise that many Dublin hotels suffer from. It is in a side road but hey thats what maps are for.

I will be staying there again and have already recommended it to many friends and would happily recommend it to anyone else visiting Dublin.
",5,2004,08,31
236,careful in choosing rooms!,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks Hotel over the August 2004 bank holiday. Since the city was booked solid, and we knew that there were a lot of questionable hotels in Dublin (as well as some very fabulous and expensive ones) we thought we'd found a pretty good deal: an average of about $200 US/night for 2 nights, through hotels. The picture on the websites showed a lovely ""boutique hotel"" room: white walls, flat screen tv, clean-lined furniture, etc. We had also specifically requested a non-smoking room (we later discovered that due to the new laws, all Irish hotel rooms are technically ""non-smoking"" now, but it's all about the room history...). Imagine our surprise when we were shown into a dark, cavelike room with an ancient bed (albeit kingsized, as promised), covered with a horrible flowered yellow cover out of a motel horror flick circa 1965. The room was right on the street one floor up, which is a BIG problem on the weekends in party-hearty Dublin, and it was close to the elevator, the service station and the stairs; it was small and cramped, with a teensy bathroom even by european standards; it felt dirty; and it REEKED of cigarette smoke. When I went downstairs to see if anything could be done (even my easy-going husband was displeased), I was told that ""only superior rooms are left,"" and that an ""upgrade"" would cost 40 euros per night. Feeling that we had no choice ,we coughed up the cash. Lo and behold! We were whisked up to the third floor, to a section at the end that had clearly been renovated: flatscreen tv, clean white walls, lots of space, gorgeous bath, etc. We were very pleased with this room and had no other problems whatsoever with the hotel--but clearly, there's a just-legal bait-and-switch going on. The ""standard"" rooms in the middle part of each floor are totally unrenovated, and the price charged for them is nowhere near worthwhile. If you can snag a deal on the ""superior"" rooms, great: the hotel is well-located, staff is very helpful, nights are quiet away from the street...lovely. But under no circumstances should you ante up for a ""standard"" room. Ugh.

236,Absolutely wonderful hotel and staff,"We spent 5 nights at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin and had a wonderful experience!  The hotel is beautiful, with a good restaurant and nice bar, the rooms were large, with king size beds, decorated very tastefully with refrigerators and in room safes. The staff was great - very polite, helpful and extremely friendly. The concierge recommended two restaurants which were both wonderful - The Bistro, just a block away from Brooks and Le Caprice, a few blocks away. From our experience in Dublin, the nicest people in the world live here!  We wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend the Brooks Hotel and hope to return ourselves soon.
",5,2004,08,16
236,Great Place,"From the moment the conceirge, Connor, helped us with our bags, until the time we checked out our stay here was top-notch. Can not say enough good things about this hotel. Room was comfortable and the bathroom superb. While the hotel is on a side street, I did not find it that hard to find, in fact the hotel is within walking distance to shopping on Grafton St and the bars and restaurants of Temple Bar.
",5,2004,08,16
236,Great Service and Location,"Just spent 2 nights at the Brooks and really enjoyed it.  We found the hotel without a problem and parked right across the street.  The service was great, and the location was perfect; central to everything but tucked away on a side street so it was quieter and more private.  Room and bathroom were pleasantly large (compared to what we have seen elsewhere in Europe); no view though and I felt that the bedding/linens were sub par for the hotel price.  We did not try the restaurant but had a nice drink next to the fireplace at the bar. Overall, a good choice to stay.
",4,2004,08,13
236,Loved the Brooks,"My husband and I stayed at the Brooks for 2 nights and loved it.   The location was great, just off the main shopping area.  Initially we were going to stay at The Clarence in the Temple Bar area and we are so glad we didn't, way to crowed in that area!  The Brooks location was much better.

The rooms were ok...bedding was nice but the view was not great and the decor was only ok.  The bathroom was fine.

Staff was good...but the breakfast was really great!

The common areas of the hotel were also great, overall I highly recommend this hotel.
",4,2004,08,12
236,dublin great-hotel bit of a let down,"The hotel is located in a weird back street and was quite difficult to find but once there was in quite good proximity to the tourist attractions. The hotel is definatley over priced especially considering the deal didnt include breakfast and so a lot of the spending money we had went on the very expensive buffet breakfast which was not really worth the bother! The room was satisfactory and the bathroom was quite nice, however during the night we got little sleep due to the constant sound of a water tank filling up somewhere, which sounded like it was right above us, when i mentioned it to reception they seemed uninterested and not bothered by our lack of sleep for two nights. Dublin is an amazing city and i would love to go again but i would save my money and stay in one of the many cheaper hotels which probably offer the same if not a better stay.",3,2004,07,28
236,Disapointed at great expence,"I just returned from Scotland where I spent two nights in Dublin, one going and one returning. I had decided to stay at the Brooks one my way to Scotland because of reviews I had read.  On the return trip I discovered a better place to stay at a third the cost.  The Brooks is over-priced for the accomodation I recieved.  200 US per night and I was charged an additional 17 for a paulty breakfast buffet  on top of that.  Look for the review for The Townhouse, a far better bargain and just as nice as The Brooks.
",3,2004,07,23
236,felt letdown by the brooks,"After reading other peoples comments after staying at the brooks,I felt quite letdown. Dublin itself was fantastic but the hotel is very difficult to find due to poor signposting and location. The room was small and not well decorated. The pillow menu and speaker in the bathroom were a nice touch but I would of happily swapped them for channel 3 and 4 on the tv which didnt work and the indignity of having the maid entering our room whilst we were sleeping to put a chocolate on our bed. It would have been nice to have the minibar stocked also but it would appear that was not the brooks policy. would not stay there again but would thoroughly recommend dublin for a weekend.
",3,2004,07,18
236,"Helpful friendly staff, lovely decor  & great location","I booked The Brooks hotel for myself and three friends, from the moment we arrived the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially the concierge who straight away came up to us and asked if we would like a map of the city.  The location is perfect.  The night staff were also helpful we fancied a night cap on our return from our night out, the bar was shut but with a flick of the light switch they opened it up for us.  A great time was had by all.

236,Excellent Stay in Dublin,"This was our first stay in Dublin, and this is one of the best hotels we have ever stopped in anywhere.  The staff were very friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.

The room was clean, spacious, and the beds were VERY comfortable.

Ideal location, just on a side street away from all of the noise, yet close to all the attractions.

Excellent Hotel - 10/10 !!!

236,Well Done!,"Had a great stay at the Brooks. Friendly service and welcome atmosphere, plus, on a side street so not too noisy while being close to everything.
",5,2004,07,08
236,Not perfect but highly recommended,"Overall a very positive experience (great location, excellent breakfast, good price through activehotels, very nice staff), but there were a few little things that added up and detracted from the stay.

- Booked a superior room, but it turned out not to have all the superior facilities listed (not huge, no dvd player).

- Very few electrical sockets in the room, which made it impossible for two people to work with laptops without unplugging the tv, video, etc.

- They have a pillow menu (nice idea!) but we didn't get what we asked for, and one of the pillows they did deliver smelled awful (mildew, possibly).

Despite these hiccups, we would recommend the hotel for the breakfast alone!
",4,2004,06,28
236,Great!,"I was in Dublin for work and enjoyed a very pleasant stay. The hotel is decorated with taste, the superior rooms are welcoming, with a choice of 4 type of pillows for a king-size, orthopedical double bed. The hotel seems to have been refurbished very recently, all is clean and spotless. These superior rooms have facilities like ironing board, iron and trouser press; safe; minibar (upon request); hi-fi set; videotape machine; vintage replica radio. The staff is valid and very welcoming without being obtrusive.
",5,2004,06,19
236,Outstanding Service,"The Brooks offers top shelf facilities and the most friendly and accomodating staff. The hotels central locations affords east strolls to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and the Trinity College area. Their conceige, Connor made our stay so enjoyable with his ""perfect"" recommendations and suggestions on ""must sees"" on our short 2 day stay in Dublin.

236,"Excellent, Classy, Central Dublin Hotel","After much hair pulling and research from this source and others, we chose the Brooks Hotel.  Great location, handsomely decorated rooms and the best breakfast selection we received on our entire trip.  Helpful, pleasant staff except the bellmen who were either excellent or non-existent.  Excellent large beds, which my 6'3"" boyfriend truly appreciated. Only drawback was that our room overlooked a first floor roof covered with Heating & A/C equipment and across from that was an office building.  We were, however, so busy being tourists we really didn't care.  Check your room first if a view is important.  We would not hesitate to return there in a future visit.

236,Great location!,"I was traveling by myself and stayed at the Brooks Hotel in Dublin.  They made me feel so welcomed.  The concierge was especially helpful in giving me tips on where to eat as well as where to get a good massage at the last minute.

The breakfast that came with the price of the room was terrific.  The room was a little small, but that may have been because I had a single.  Location, Location, Location....you can't beat this hotel.  I was within walking distance of everything fun to see in all of Dublin.   Will stay there again when I go back...",5,2004,04,23
236,Complete luxury!,"Wow! I have just come home from a 4 night break at Brooks hotel. This hotel was amazing, as soon as we arrived, the concierge, Connor welcomed us and treated us like we were his own personal guests! The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful.

The room I was in was newly refurbished, and was immaculate- complete luxury! Everything was extremely comfortable, and breakfast was wonderful as well. The hotel has such a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere about it.

I really don't have anything other that commendations to say about this hotel. It is very centrally located, and I hardly needed to use public transport, as everything was easily within walking distance.

I would fully recommend this hotel to anyone looking for someone to stay in Dublin, as I had a fantastic time break there!",5,2004,04,17
236,Brilliant Stay,We stayed at Brooks a few weeks ago and we found the hotel and staff fantastic. We arrived in the hotel very early in the morning and Ashley who was at the desk was able to check us into our room which was great after a long trip. The rooms are spacious and ours had a plasma tv in the room and mineral water. The beds are extremly big and very comfortable. Connor who is the head porter told us about where to go and booked us dinner and he was a great help to us during our stay in Dublin. The street is very quiet so noo noise at night. We shall be back again as the staff are so friendly and accomodating and service is second to none. With staff like Connor and Ashley we will definately be back to Brooks,5,2004,04,11
236,Hard to fault....,"My wife & I had a slight mishap at the start of our stay when we wished to cancel our booking but were told we could not and would have to pay in FULL (our flight was cancelled). To the hotels credit, it was Valentine's night and we did not give 24 hours notice but we thought they may bend the rules or give us some compensation as we had to drive to the hotel instead ! But no - they gave us a heart shaped chocolate sweet instead. But don't let my moaning put you off ! We were in a superior room which was probably the best hotel room I've stayed in - and I've stayed in quite a few. Massive bed, plasma TV, TV tiled into the shower, his & her sinks etc. The food a Franscesa's, the hotel's restaurant was fantastic, best fillet steak I've had for a while, and beautiful breakfast. Hotel is handy for everywhere, although it is in a bit of a grubby street, but I would still fully recommend this hotel to everyone.",4,2004,02,16
236,A fantastic stay from start to finish,"We booked this hotel as a result of reading the reviews on this site and we were so glad we did.

The hotel really is a gem and we were more than pleased when we arrived.

It is situated just off Grafton Street and is really well placed for everything in the city.

We could only get a 7.30am flight to Dublin and so arrived with our 2 year old daughter at the hotel at around 9am.

As soon as we arrived, the staff did their utmost to accomodate us and, despite rooms usually being ready for 2pm, we were allowed into ours at 9am where we all immediately fell asleep for a couple of hours!

Connor, the concierge was lovely and made our stay. From the moment we set foot in the hotel from the taxi, he made us feel really welcome, couldn't do enough for us and was really normal and down to earth instead of being the normal ,formal concierge type.

The hotel itself is spot on. Huge beds, central location, big hotel feel with small hotel service, fantastic staff, lovely breakfasts, cosy bar etc, etc, etc, etc.

This place has really opened my eyes to how poor the service from the supposedly 'big' hotels can be and how the accommodation and staff can make or break your stay.

By the way, don't go to Dublin for less than 7 days as you'll be wasting your time. There's just so much to see, do, eat & drink that you'll need at least a week to even scratch the surface.

I can't recommend Dublin & Brooks hotel enough.

Fantastic.",5,2004,02,09
236,Stay at the Brooks hotel,"Have just come back from a long weekend, stopping at the Brooks hotel. 
We chose it for our silver wedding anniversary. This was the first time we had visited the city and we were not dissapointed. The Brooks made us feel very welcome and the rooms were top class. Everyone was friendly and most helpfull. Not your usual stuffy hotel. This was fairly modern and well equipped hotel even though it was set on a small side street.It was quiet enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of hectic Dublin city centre.Should we return to Dublin we will be booking into this hotel again.Thankyou Brooks.",4,2003,12,10
236,Superb Hotel - and a good nights sleep,"We came across this hotel from the tourist office. We asked for a quiet hotel on a quiet road (you don't find many of those in Dublin!), and this hotel delivered. We had a superior room, which had a wonderful huge bed, 4 types of pillows to choose from and although the room overlooked an office block, it did ensure that Dublin late night life, didn't come directly into your room. The staff were all so friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was wonderful and set you up for the days sightseeing. Keep up the good work Brooks - I certainly will be spreading the word about your hotel.",5,2003,10,31
236,First Class Stay,We stayed at the hotel as part of our Silver Wedding celebrations....the staff found this out and left us wine and chocolates!!! beautiful room very friendly staff...concierge Connor was extremely helpful.......close to all main shopping areas and WONDERFUL traditional Irish Pub...the Hairy Lemon,5,2003,10,24
236,Wonderful Hotel,"Just had our second stay in Dublin - & second stay at Brooks - re-confirmed our view that it is a wonderful hotel, great location, superb rooms & breakfast, but above all, excellent staff - who just cannot do enough, are helpful, charming & focussed on making your stay great.

An excellent hotel.",5,2003,10,15
236,Good hotel - spread thew word,"Booked Brooks Hotel for the All Ireland weekend of the 28th of September 03. I told friends where we were staying and the majority had not heard of the hotel before, so this was a little worry for us. The taxi driver had never hard of it either.

However on arrivial we were pleasantly surprised and the rooms were lovely and very modern. The staff especially the concerige were very friendly. The cooked breakfasts were very tasty also.

The downstairs lounge/gym should be advertised on arrival as we only found aout about it when we were leaving. This area looked very relaxing with large sofas/small tables and a great colour scheme.

All in all we would definitely return - spread the word and advertise!!",4,2003,09,30
236,Great Dublin Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for one night. Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable (for us this means very cool temperature which we were able to achieve very quickly!). The front desk staff and the Concierge, Connor, were all extremely friendly and helpful. While our room was perfect, we had a bad experience in the hotel restaurant. The food itself was superb but overshadowed by some of the worst service we had in Ireland. There were only 3 other tables of customers in the restaurant yet my husband had to get up 3 times just to get someone to bring us more bread/water - very disappointing!",4,2003,07,20
236,Service is #1,"Brooks hotel is in as great location (difficult to find), but very centrally located. The rooms were spacious, clean, and warmly decorated. The staff will go out of there way to make you feel welcome. 
The service was some of the best we saw in all of Ireland, and that is saying something, considering how wonderful the people are there.",4,2003,07,11
236,Wonderful Hotel ; Confusing location,This hotel had small rooms compared to standard in the USA but were extremely well-kept. Staff was cordial and extremely helpful. I'd stay there next time in Dublin. Breakfast was good but not excellent. Who would have thought black and white pudding is really sausage. Only issue was that hotel was on a 2 block long street and was confusing to walk to.,5,2003,05,15
236,Excellent Dublin hotel,"An excellent, warm, comfortable hotel, near fantastic bars and restaurants.

Clean, classy and well staffed, it was a delight to stay in.

236,Ottimo in hotel in una posizione molto strategica,"Bella struttura moderna nel cuore di Dublino, veramente vicino a tutte le principali attrazioni di Dublino che si raggiungono comodamente a piedi in pochi attimi. Di fronte all'hotel è anche presente un parcheggio multipiano convenzionato con la struttura. Il personale molto gentile e disponibile. La stanza comoda, letto fantastico e davvero grandissimo. Buona pulizia. Non eccezionale l'insonorizzazione delle camere verso l'esterno. Secondo me il neo è la colazione che è buona e varia, ma molti piatti vengono preparati direttamente dalla cucina al momento. Il problema è che durante il nostro soggiorno era caotica e lenta nel servizio. Secondo me comunque un'ottima struttura molto strategica per visitare Dublino.",5,2022,10,18
236,"Wo ist das ""small luxury hotel""?","Die Lage des Hotel ist ausgezeichnet, Parkhaus für den Mietwagen gleich gegenüber. Rezeption ist sehr nett, die Zimmer und Bäder sind alt und müssen renoviert werden. Das Hotel hat keinen Charm, schlechtes Service beim Frühstück, das Angebot ist wie bei einem 3 Sterne Hotel. Der Preis passt absolut nicht, extrem überteuert!!",2,2020,01,10
236,Muy bien ubicado ! Falta mantenimiento,"Hotel perfectamente ubicado, le falta invertir un poco de plata , canillas q se mueven , televisores viejos , mala internet pero salvo estas cosas en gral esta bien , tendrian q invertir un poco , atencion muy buena del personal ",3,2019,02,25
236,"Gute Lage, jedoch keine 5 Sterne","Sehr gute zentrale Lage, nettes hilfsbereites Personal an der Rezeption, schlechter Service an der Bar (man wird komplett ignoriert und muss den Kellnern nachlaufen), Zimmer okay - alle Zimmer zur Straße extrem laut, Straßenlärm die ganz Nacht, bei Buchung geäußerter Wunsch nach ruhigem Zimmer wird ignoriert, Zimmer in den Hinterhof ebenfalls laut wg. Lüftung, jedoch monotones Geräusch und deshalb besser als Autolärm & Personen auf der Straße. Schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen. Zimmer aber ganz schön, gute Betten. Frühstück sehr gut. ",4,2018,12,09
236,Preis-Leistungsverhältnis schlecht,"Das Hotel ist sehr zentral und ideal gelegen. Rezeption und Concierge sind sehr zuvorkommend. Unser Zimmer war nach hinten zum Innenhof gelegen. Bei offenem Fenster nervten die Geräusche der Klimaanlage in Hof und die Küchengerüche über die Abluftanlage, die sich ebenfalls im Hof befand. Das Badezimmer war extrem klein nur mit Badewanne und Duschvorhang ausgestattet. Diese Kategorie nannte sich ‚Deluxe Superioir‘!!!! Das Frühstücksbüffet  war in Ordnung. Allerdings wurde bereits um 9.30 Uhr nicht mehr nachgelegt und alles war schon sehr abgegrast. Das Servicepersonal war zudem recht unaufmerksam. Alles in allem ein schlechtes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis.",2,2018,10,01
236,Gutes Hotel mit Tücken,"Das Hotel ist ein moderner Bau in der Innenstadt, daher sind die Sehenswürdigkeiten gut zu erreichen. Gleich an der Ecke liegt der Pub Die haarige Zitrone und ist mein Tipp zum Start in den Abend. Auf keinen Fall sollte man ein Zimmer in den ersten beiden Etagen nehmen. Die Klimaanlage läuft beständig, somit entfällt das Schlafen mit offenem Fenster.",4,2018,06,25
236,Posizione decisamente strategica,"Albergo moderno, comodissimo al centro e alla gran parte delle attrazioni dublinesi: nel raggio di poche centinaia di metri c'è veramente tutto per il turista, non serve chiamare taxi o usare i mezzi pubblici. Assolutamente da considerare per chi ci va come turista.
Camere sufficientemente ampie e molto ben insonorizzate tra loro: unico problema il lato strada che è piuttosto rumoroso soprattutto il sabato sera (vicino all'hotel ci sono almeno un paio di pub e 3-4 ristoranti bar). Parking coperto esattamente sul lato opposto della strada (che è a senso unico).
Il personale è gentilissimo (qualcuno parla anche italiano), ogni richiesta viene immediatamente accolta.
Non esiste la SPA, ma al piano interrato ci sono una palestra e un salotto molto confortevole (con divani, poltrone, scaffali colmi di libri e arredi molto ricchi) dove gli ospiti dell'hotel possono fermarsi a bere un whiskey o una birra (al bar dell'hotel si contano oltre 130 etichette di superalcolici!).
La colazione è completa anche se un po' troppo contenuto il buffet: in un posto del genere si potrebbe fare di meglio.
La qualità del sonno dipende dal cuscino (c'è il menu apposito, con 4-5 tipi diversi) e dalla temperatura della stanza: occhio a regolarla bene. Il bagno è sufficientemente ampio, anche se la mia stanza non disponeva di doccia (vasca con doccia) e ovviamente non esiste il bidé. In camera (versione classic) c'è comunque il bollitore per tè/caffè, un'asse da stiro con relativo ferro. Cassaforte ampia elettronica, radio, TV e friogobar (che però va fatto riempire dal personale al piano, all'arrivo è vuoto).
In definitiva un buon rapporto qualità/prezzo con un jolly per la posizione.",4,2018,04,26
236,"Buona soluzione in centro, da ripetere","SI tratta di una buona struttura in centro a 5 min dall'are Temple Bar. Personale cordiale, camere pulite, letto molto grande e comodo. Soprattutto buonissima colazione. Lo raccomando per chi vuole stare in centro ed avere un buon rapporto qualità/prezzo.",4,2018,04,15
236,Coccolarsi in hotel a Dublino,"Il Brooks hotel è un albergo molto centrale che ti accoglie in un ambiente moderno e classico al tempo stesso. Letto comodissimo, pulizia eccellente, bagno ampio, servizio pronto. Il bagno al piano seminterrato merita una visita. Buona scelta a colazione. Consigliatissimo.",5,2018,03,04
236,Hotel Brooks for ever,"Das Brooks ist legendär. Super guter Service in allen Bereichen. Die Bar hat ausgezeichnete Whiskey - wer keine Ahnung hat wie ich, der soll sich vom Barkeeper beraten lassen. Garantie: Man(n) und Frau geht nicht falsch.",5,2018,01,03
236,4 giorni di relax in famiglia,"Hotel assolutamente in linea con le mie aspettative. Era il primo viaggio all’estero per mia figlia di tre anni (che non mangia quasi nulla anche a casa e difficilmente assaggia nuovi sapori). La camera al nostro arrivo alle ore 15 era già pronta (e dopo un viaggio non dover aspettare fa la differenza!), una Deluxe con letto king size, molto spaziosa, con un piccolo angolo di salotto in cui mia figlia poteva giocare e disegnare al tavolino. Il bagno molto comodo con box doccia e vasca. Pulizia ottima, le inservienti passavano anche due volte al giorno. Tutto lo staff molto gentile e professionale. Noi avevamo la colazione inclusa e devo dire che la scelta tra continentale e irish breakfast era vasta, qualità del cibo ottima e molte cose erano homemade inoltre la cucina del ristorante “Francesca”, dove si fa anche colazione, è a vista e questo secondo me è sinonimo di pulizia e qualità. Abbiamo spesso pranzato e/o cenato al lounge bar “Jasmine” e da “Francesca” per permettere a mia figlia di mangiare una pasta al sugo e, seppur non a buon mercato (ma se si vuol mangiare benino qualcosa piú del normale bisogna spendere), il cibo era molto buono.
Per tutti questi motivi consiglio questo hotel a coppie anche con bambini.",5,2017,12,10
236,Hotel con clase y perfectamente ubicado,"En septiembre de 2009 hice una crítica de este hotel, que terminaba diciendo que volveríamos de nuevo si surgiera la oportunidad. Y así ha sido, como teníamos muy buenos recuerdos, nos hemos alojado de nuevo en una escapada que acabamos de hacer a Dublín.

Al hacer el check-in nos dijeron que nos daban una habitación superior a la que habíamos reservado, y nos dieron una que estaba en la tercera planta y que daba a la fachada principal. Era de tamaño suficiente para estar muy a gusto en ella y poder desenvolverse cómodamente. La insonorización era muy buena, porque en la calle había mucho jaleo por la noche y no se notaba. El baño, muy completo, era igualmente muy cómodo de usar.

La ubicación es perfecta, junto a Grafton, por lo que estás a un paso de cualquier sitio interesante de la ciudad.

El desayuno es un buffet, no excesivamente variado, pero sí completo y de calidad. Destacaría por ejemplo los diferentes opciones de pan: de soda (buenísimo), de limón, de banana, los típicos “scones”,…que con la mantequilla irlandesa son todos una delicia. Los platos calientes los eliges de una carta y te los hacen al momento. Nosotros probamos los huevos revueltos con salmón y el típico desayuno irlandés de huevo, salchichas, tomate, morcilla, champiñón, etc. Y esta vez, a diferencia de otros muchos desayunos irlandeses que hemos tomado a lo largo de varios viajes por la isla, hemos probado por primera vez la “potato farl” en sustitución del “hash brown”. Imposible traducir estos términos, todos a base de patata…

Respecto a la anterior visita, el trato que te dan no ha cambiado, es excelente y atento, tanto en recepción como en el restaurante.

A ver si se puede cumplir el que no hay dos sin tres.

Gracias, Brooks.",4,2017,09,04
236,"Sehr gute Lage, Preis scheint für das Gebotene eher hoch","Das Brooks-Hotel liegt im Herzen von Dublin und viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu Fuss erreichbar. Das Zimmer war i.O., wenn auch z.B. eine Minibar fehlte oder die Handwerksarbeit im Bad sicher noch zu optimieren wäre. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist reichhaltig, die Esstische sind aber eher klein.

Abbiamo apprezzato l'accoglienza e il piccolo souvenir in ricordo della Proclamazione dell'Indipendenza del 1916.

Il servizio alla hall è davvero fantastico, cordialità e gentilezza sempre al tuo servizio. Molto bella la camera, accogliente e calda, la colazione davvero ampia e la qualità del cibo medio alta. Nel cuore del centro di Dublino, venire a soggiornare qui significa fare due passi ed essere già a Temple Bar.

236,Posizione centrale ed alta professionalità.,"Trovare una stanza doppia nella settimana di San Patrizio a Dublino non era cosa facile per cui ho scelto di buon grado questo hotel **** stelle.La posizione è strategica,in una via tranquilla ma vicina a George street,College green,Grafton street.Numerosi pub,ristoranti e take away in zona.Nelle vicinanze della statua di Molly Malone.Stanze molto belle con bagno provvisto di vasca e doccia.Phone,Wi-Fi gratis,TV a schermo piatto,asse da stiro etc.caratteristiche presenti in tutti gli hotel **** stelle in Irlanda.Letto confortevole.Accoglienza eccellente,molto attenti e premurosi.Eccellente la colazione.Magari il lato bar è un po' minimale.Non offre altri servizi all'interno,non mi sembra di aver visto palestra o parcheggio auto privato eccetto uno di fronte presente in un'altro edificio.Il giudizio rimane positivo anche se abbiamo avuto un problema con l'acqua calda nel bagno;il primo giorno nessun problema poi assenza di acqua calda nella doccia,segnalo la cosa alla reception.Era il 17/3 e sarebbe stato difficile risolverlo.Ma la mattina successiva assenza di acqua calda nel lavandino e doccia e molto debole ma presente nella vasca.Segnalo la cosa ad una supervisor e quando rientriamo dopo colazione il problema dell'acqua calda nel lavabo e vasca era risolto.Certo in un hotel di questo livello mi aspetterei un maggiore controllo preventivo specie durante festività particolari.Al di là di ciò lo consiglio.È di certo un hotel che ha classe e storia soprattutto con un alto standard di professionalità del personale sia irlandese che non,sempre molto disponibile ed attento.",4,2016,03,20
236,ottimo ma in certe cose un po' vecchiotto,"l'hotel è molto bello e curato soprattutto nelle parti comuni. Ottimo servizio e personale decisamente cordiale.
Le camere sono belle anche se in alcune cose forse un po' vecchiotte (è comunque lo stile dell'hotel), soprattutto, nella mia, il bagno era decisamente vecchio e non comodissimo. Pulizia ottima, quindi nulla da dire, però direi che il bagno necessitava una rinfrescata. Non so dire se tutte le camere siano così o se alcune siano magari già rinnovate",4,2016,03,15
236,Ottima posizione ,Il pezzo forte di quest hotel è la posizione nel pieno centro di Dublino . Pulito accogliente personale molto gentile.

236,como los hoteles de antes...,"Buen hotel aunque un poco anticuado... buen restaurante y en el mismo centro de Dublin. Tiene Wifi, un bar muy coqueto con piano y todo (No he coincidido con el pianista muchas veces), y el desayuno, aunque es continental, los platos calientes (el famoso e ineludible Irish Breakfast) lo tienes que pedir en la mesa, es decir, no hay bufet caliente.

236,Schönes Hotel in guter Lage,"Am zweiten Adventwochenende haben wir zwei Nächte hier verbracht. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral zwischen den Einkaufsstraßen und Temple Bar, dem Ausgehviertel. Alles ist fußläufig erreichbar. Trotzdem war es relativ ruhig auf der Straße. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zur Straße hin und haben trotzdem nichts gehört. 
Das Hotel ist sehr schön und die Zimmer waren von ausreichender Größe. Abends lag ein Stück Schokolade auf dem Kopfkissen! (Übrigens, man kann verschiedene Arten von Kopfkissen haben). Die Mitarbeiter sind aufmerksam und sehr hilfreich. Wir haben uns pudelwohl gefühlt!
Wir hatten Frühstück gebucht und hatten ein wundervolles kaltes Büffet mit verschiedenen Brotsorten, Obstsorten, Müslis und Joghurts. Das warme Frühstück (wie z. B. Eier, irisches Frühstück, Porridge etc) konnte man sich von der Karte bestellen und es wurde frisch zubereitet. Was will man mehr.
Abends gab es an der Bar Live-Musik (Klavier) und man konnte alle möglichen Whiskeysorten probieren (das Hotel ist für seine vielen Whiskeysorten bekannt). Da wir schreckliches Wetter hatten, war uns das Hotel lieber statt in die Pubs abends zu gehen.
Kleiner Tipp: die Bushaltestelle von dem Flughafenbus war ca. 5 Min. zu Fuß entfernt. Der Bus fährt jede Viertelstunde.

Es besteht aber ein Abkommen und einem Parkhaus, so dass die Parkkosten überschaubar bleiben. Das Zimmer war klein. Es war ruhig. Leider hörte man nur den Lift, der gerade daneben lag.

236,Tolle Lage - das war es dann auch,"Das Hotel liegt in ausgezeichneter Lage in der City. Wir haben hier 4 Nächte verbracht und waren ob der Lage mit der Wahl zufrieden.
Das Hotelpersonal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Leider haben wir eines der vermutlich schlechtesten Zimmer bekommen (bei Buchung über einen deutschen Reiseveranstalter). Das Zimmer lag direkt gegenüber der Fahrstühle. sollte Ihnen dies angeboten werden, lehnen sie sofort ab. Der Fahrstuhl kündigt sein erscheinen mit einem akustischen Signal an - Tag und Nacht. Das Staubsaugsystem muss über einen zentralen ""Port"" gesteuert sein, der - wie mag es anders sein - direkt gegenüber unserem Zimmer lag. Sobald irgendwo auf der Etage gesaugt wurde, war es deutlich zu hören. Vermutlich hätten wir das Zimmer wechseln können, aber wir haben gar nicht gefragt. Wie es immer ist, denkt man, ach wird schon gehen. Dank Oropax sind wir dann auch zum Schlafen gekommen.

Das Zimmer war sauber, aber auch hier sollte einiges renoviert werden. Die Badezimmertür, des winzigen Raumes, blieb nur unter Zuhilfenahme eines Keils offen stehen. Die Holzmöbel rochen alt und muffig. Das geht bei einem 4* Haus definitiv besser.

Frühstück war ok, mit 19,90€ allerdings recht kostspielig. Der Service in der Tat wie hier auch schon öfter angemerkt manches Mal recht langsam. Das störte uns allerdings weniger, wir hatten ja Urlaub.

236,Schönes Hotel an bester Lage,"Für einen Familienurlaub buchten wir das Brooks Hotel und waren beeindruckt vom Service schon bei der Buchung und beim Check-in. Alles hat geklappt, die drei unterschiedlichen Zimmer waren je richtig zugeteilt, die kleine Überraschung lag im Zimmer, das Personal war sehr freundlich. Die Zimmer waren vor kurzem neu gestaltet und eingerichtet worden - zeitlose, etwas anonyme aber schöne Möbel, gutes Bett, alles was man braucht war da. Für ein Stadthotel auch anständig grosse Zimmer mit genügend Platz für Koffer und Taschen. Keine Sicht (Hinterhof), dafür total ruhig. 
Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral, man kommt überall gut zu Fuss hin. Trotzdem ist man auch rasch beim Flughafen oder auf der Autobahn. Fürs Nachtleben muss man nicht bis Temple Bar (nur 10 Minuten), schon in den Querstrassen beim Hotel hats lebendige Pubs. Dafür ist die Hotelbar ohne Leben... Das Frühstück im Restaurant ist ""ok"", aber nicht mehr. Teilweise recht schleppend/langsamer Service.
Insgesamt eher teuer.",4,2015,07,28

Das Zimmer war groß und sehr sauber. Leider war die TV-Senderauswahl äußerst eingeschränkt (kein Sky, kaum englische Sender). Frauen sollten einen eigenen Fön mitbringen, der im Bad angebrachte Fön liefert kaum Druck. Ansonsten gibt es nichts zu beklagen, das Frühstück war ebenfalls lecker, wenn auch die Büffetauswahl größer sein könnte. Die Crepes vom Menü waren aber super.
Mit allen Reklamationen und Fragen wurde vom gesamten Personal hervorragend umgegangen.

236,Week end a Dublino,"Buon hotel in posizione centrale, personale all'accoglienza molto cortese e disponibile, buona camera ma migliorabili taluni servizi forse non indispensabili ma comodi( ho richiesto per due volte accappattol e ciabatte da camera ma non sono mai state consegnate, forse non disponibili o non previste nella dotazione dell'hotel). 
Lo consiglio per tutti",4,2015,04,02
236,Muy recomendable y fantásticamente ubicado,"La primera impresión al verlo no fue muy buena: por fuera no es bonito y está en la parte más fea de la calle Drury. Por dentro, es otra historia. El personal amable (aunque sólo uno sabe español), habitación limpia, no muy grande, cama fantástica enorme y WC con bañera y ducha separadas. Radio tipo ""vintage"" en las habitaciones. Desayuno buffet y ""a la carte"" que preparan individualmente para cada huésped recién hecho. Incluía Kippers (pescado), porridge y el más demandado: Full irish breakfast. Por las noches un señor ameniza el hall de entrada tocando el piano.
Localización inmejorable, está a 5 minutos (o menos) de todo: Molly Malone, Grafton, St Stephen Green, Temple bar, Trinity College, etc..
La vida nocturna de la calles adyacentes es importante, pero la del hotel es tranquila.
Terminada la estancia, todo el grupo de amigos que viajábamos nos felicitamos por la elección de este hotel, y eso en nuestro caso no es muy frecuente.",4,2015,03,26
236,Fantástico,"Excelente hotel, habitaciones muy comodas y lujosas. Magnífico restaurante de uno de los mejores chefs irlandeses. Los camareros muy atentos y educados. Situado en una zona bastante céntrica. Dispone de un bar con servicio nocturno de sanwiches y bebidas.",5,2015,03,24
236,Un accogliente  buon hotel,"Come già rilevato da altri viaggiatori, il punto di forza del Brooks hotel è la sua posizione centrale, a due passi dal Trinity College, da Temple Bar e Grafton Street. L'accoglienza al nostro arrivo è stata calorosa, il personale è sempre stato molto cortese, ottima la pulizia di tutto l'albergo e buona la colazione, anche se alcune mattine, quando le sale erano più affollate, il servizio è sembrato poco organizzato e un po' lento. Gli arredi della nostra stanza erano, però, piuttosto datati e sia in camera che lungo i corridoi c'era l'odore di una fragranza, a mio avviso, troppo intenso e persistente.
Consiglio, certamente, di prendere una stanza ai piani più alti (la nostra era al sesto ed ultimo piano) perché è più silenziosa. Di fronte all'albergo vi è, infatti, un grande parcheggio.
Complessivamente è stata una buona esperienza.

236,BUENA SITUACIÓN Y PERSONAL MUY AFABLE,"Hotel pequeño localizado en el Centro de Dublín, a pie de cualquier sitio de interés,muy bien restaurad, con una decoración sencilla, pero exquisita, con un servicio bastante aceptable, un personal muy amable y afable, que se agradece bastante, cuando se tuene dificultades con el idioma. Restaurante con buena comida, desayunos y cenas. Sólo una pega, la calefacción muy alta.",4,2015,03,17
236,Im Ergebnis empfehlenswert,"Die Eindrücke des Hotels waren durchaus etwas gemischt.
Der Service an Rezeption und beim Frühstück waren kompetent und professionell, jedoch nicht zwingend herzlich. Die Zimmer in ihrer Kuschelathmosphäre sind für Kontinentaleuropäer vielleicht etwas ironiefähig: wo gibt es sie noch die Betten in die man versinkt und die Retroradios im Zimmer ?
Sauberkeit war kein Problem, die Qualität des Frühstücks war auch in Ordning. Ein Parkhaus ist gegenüber (die Straße ist sicherlich kein Schmuckstück), die Innensatdt und die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind um die Ecke.
Kann man, muß man aber nicht buchen.",4,2015,02,19
236,Hotel con alma,"Muy recomendable, muy cuidado, bonito, muy buen servicio, esta muy bien gestionado poniendo mucha atencion en los pequeños detalles. La ubicacion es perfecta muy centrico. Las habitaciones son acogedoras y elegantes. Si hay algun problema lo solucionan rapidamente.",5,2014,11,23
236,Ottima posizione,"Albergo e un classsico 4 stelle con qualche vantaggio in più.
Per quelli che viaggiano per affari o turismo e una posizione ideale.
Si trova nel cuore della città e tutti punti chiave si raggiungono a piedi.
Una particolarità anche la possibile scelta di cuscini.
Davvanti un ottimo ristorante apperto di recente.",4,2014,11,18
236,Bien ubicado,"Hotel cómodo y en muy buena ubicación

236,"Bello, comodissimo e spazioso","Siamo stati in questo hotel durante il Web Summit 2013 e abbiamo trovato veramente una bellissima struttura, comodissimo e centrale, con stanze grande e un buon rapporto qualità prezzo. Nn abbiamo mangiato all'interno e quindi non so valutare il ristorante, però l'hotel è' veramente da consigliare.",5,2014,09,08
236,Zu laut,"Wir hatten über Small Luxury Hotels ein special offer gebucht, 1 Nacht zahlen, eine Nacht gratis.
Da wir 6 Nächte blieben, mussten wir "" nur "" 3 Nächte bezahlen, aber bei der Hälfte von EUR 450
immer noch ein stolzer Preis für eine sogenannte Junoir Suite, die aber von der Größe wie ein
nicht sehr großes Doppelzimmer war. Schöner Balkon, aber mit Blick auf ein großes Parkhaus,
in dem nachts ständig die Alarmanlagen von geparkten Autos angingen. Ausserdem waren in direkter
Nachbarschaft mehrere Pubs, in denen Gäste bis morgens um 4 Uhr lärmten zusätzlich zu
dem Lärm von der sehr schmalen Strasse. Wir mussten wohl oder übel bei geschlossenem Fenster
schlafen. Aber auch hier war in der ersten Nacht nicht an Schlaf zu denken, denn die Aircondition
war so laut wie der Krach auf der Strasse. Nach Reklamation am nächsten Morgen kam ein Monteur,
was zur Folge hatte, dass die AC etwas leiser war. Trotzdem mussten wir mit Ohrstöpseln schlafen.
Das Angebot in eine Suite gegenüber zu wechseln, schlugen wir aus, da auch hier die AC laut war,
und man auch hier nicht mit offenem Fenster schlafen konnte, durch die vielen Aggregate von ACs
der genüberliegenden Gebäude.
Am 2.Morgen  standen wir unter der Dusche und es gab nur kaltes Wasser im ansonsten sehr großen Bad. Wir reklamierten und erhielten als Antwort: sorry, aber der Boiler war leer. Nach 1Stunde gab es wieder warmes Wasser,aber das half uns wenig.
Als nächstes hatte man uns über eine getätigte Reservierung für ein Restaurant nicht informiert,
auch nicht nachdem wir reklamiert hatten.
Das Frühstücksbuffet war nicht sehr umfangreich und auch von der Qualität nicht wirklich als gut zu
bezeichnen. Lediglich die ungesalzene Butter hatte man am dritten Morgen für uns organisiert. Aber allein die Tatsache, dass ein 4 Sterne Hotel in Europa nicht automatisch über ungesalzene Butter bei
vielen mitteleuropäischen Gästen verfügt, war schon merkwürdig.Der Service beim Frühstück war sehr langsam, die gewünschte heisse Milch zum Kaffee kam immer erst nach zweimaligem Anfordern.
Der Service an der Rezeption war sehr bemüht, mit Ausnahme einer sehr jungen Kraft, die nichts
auf die Reihe bekam. Ein besonderes Lob verdient der Concierge, der äusserst hilfsbereit
war.
Meine Frau hatte am dritten Tag Geburtstag und wir erhielten neben Süßigkeiten eine Flasche guten
Champagner, wohl auch als Entschuldigung für die vielen Pannen.
Auch eine gewünschte Wärmflasche erhielten wir, allerdings mit dem deutlichen Hinweis, das diese
besorgt werden musste, da das Hotel so etwas nicht vorrätig hat. Man bedenke, dass dies ein
4 Sterne Hotel ist, das zur Gruppe Small Luxury Hotels gehört
Eine weitere Wiedergutmachung - ein Abendessen im Hotelrestaurant - schlugen wir wegen der
Erfahrungen beim Frühstück aus.
Am vierten Tag unseres Aufenthaltes war ich auf einem Ausflug schwer gestürzt, der Manager on
Duty organisierte Krücken, aber auch mit dem Hinweis, das man dies im Hotel nicht
vorrätig habe.
Zu guter Letzt durfte ich die Krücken behalten und auch das Taxi zum Flughafen wurde vom Hotel
bezahlt.
Trotzdem würde ich das Hotel schon allein wegen des Lärms nicht empfehlen.",3,2014,08,27
236,hotel molto carino,"personale cortese
siamo stati in 2 camere deluxe, entrambe ben arredate (delizioso tocco vintage della radio) ma in una il bagno non era all'altezza (piccolo)

servizio in camera buono, posizione centrale

peccato che non puliscano la hall con frequenza (sia i tavolini del bar che il tappeto di ingresso)",4,2014,08,13
236,Ohne Fehl und Tadel,"Nach einigen Fehltritten mit größeren Hotelketten und Marketingzusammenschlüssen ( Leading blah blah usw . ) wurde mir dieses Hotel zusammen mit dem Hinweis ein ruhiges Zimmer zu verlangen empfohlen . Eine gute Empfehlung und Erfahrung , das Hotel liegt in einem lebhaften Teil Dublins in einer ""ruhigeren"" Strasse. In dem Zimmer im 4 Stock war es wunderbar ruhig kein Lärm von der Strasse ,schlagende Türen , Fernseher . Die Zimmer sind hübsch branchenüblich in schlammigen brauntönen eingerichtet . Betten erstklassig und alles sehr sehr sauber wie alles in Dublin in der etwas kleineren Ausführung . Personal nett und hilfsberteit . Empfehlenswert",4,2014,07,17
236,comodo,"Albergo un po' vecchiotto ma bene organizzato, buon servizio, wifi gratuito, reception molto gentile e dispensatrice di consigli. A due passi da tutto il centro e dalla zona di Temple Bar dove ci sono pub e ristoranti. Prezzo non molto basso, ma adeguato al posto.",4,2014,07,12
236,Spiegeltische....,"Das Zimmer ist verhältnismäßig groß, und schön eingerichtet. Einzig die Spiegltische fand ich seltsam. Das Zimmer hatte ein weitere Tür, welche vermutlich ins nachbar Zimmer führte, Geräusche konnte ich aber nicht wahrnehmen. Das frühstück ist sehr gut und umfasst auch ein full irisch breakfeast. Das Hotel liegt im Zentrum. Ich komme gerne wieder.",4,2014,06,29
236,Ottimo hotel,"Ho trascorso due giorni a Dublino in questo hotel, ottima posizione, camera spaziosa e ben attrezzata, pulizia impeccabile, personale gentile e qualificato, wifi ottimo, molto tranquillo anche se locato in pieno centro a due passi dalle maggiori attrazioni e locali della città, ci tornerò senz'altro",5,2014,05,29
236,Mehr als ordentlich.....,"... ist dieses charmante Stadthotel, das wirklich von der Ausstattung und der Atmosphäre alle unsere Erwartungen erfüllte. Die Lage ist in der Tat ideal, manchmal war das Personal etwas knurrig, aber na ja, alles in allem haben wir uns sehr wohl gefühlt.

Aber: das Hotel-Restaurant sollte auf jeden Fall gemieden werden!,,",4,2014,04,15
236,Decepcionante,"Los hoteles en Dublin son caros para lo q ofrecen en comparación con España,por ello nos decidimos por este q era algo mas caro.la primera noche tuvimos q cambiarnos de habitación a la 1am pq el aparato del aire hacia un ruido infernal. Al día siguiente el agua caliente no funcionaba.aunque lo arreglaron se veía q la caldera era vieja pues el agua pasaba de fría a a caliente durante algunos segundos continuamente (pasaba lo mismo en nuestro posterior alojamiento una semana después). Es un edificio bien situado y de aspecto renovado por fuera pero con problemas de instalaciones serios q conocen perfectamente y ocultan. El personal es muy atento y las habitaciones se hacen pequeñas llegando a agobiar si una pareja va con dos maletas",2,2014,02,05
236,Céntrico y muy confortable,"El hotel está situado en pleno centro pero en una calle muy tranquila, sin ruidos. Confortable, familiar y con un servicio personal de calidad. El desayuno maravilloso. Buena habitación 100% recomendable.",4,2014,01,25
236,Ottima scelta,"In occasione del Natale, abbiamo trascorso 4 notti in questo hotel a Dublino. Ottima la posizione centralissima, in una zona con ampia scelta di pub e ristoranti (proprio di fronte c'è Fade street con qualche ristorante proprio niente male). Non è grandissimo, ma molto accogliente, con un vago sapore ""old british style"" che non guasta, Gentilissimi gli addetti alla reception. La stanza, standard, dotata di tutto l'indispensabile, compreso bollitore con tè e caffè,possibilità di scegliere il cuscono da un ""pillow menù"", bagno non grandissimo,ma assolutamente funzionale. Molto bene la pulizia, la televisione non riceve canali italiani...ma possiamo farcene benissimo una ragione.
Colazione (se compresa nel prezzo) ottima e varia, con possibilità di provare anche le diverse formule di breakfast. Simpatica ed accogliente la zona lettura, con computer gratuiti, libri, riviste, occhiali di cortesia. Abbiamo pranzato il giorno di Natale nel ristorante dell'albergo (il Francesca's), sicuramente buono, ma piuttosto caro...Dispone anche di sala fitnes ad uso gratuito degli ospiti.
Consigliato sicuramente!",4,2013,12,31
236,Buen Hotel bien situado y tranquilo,"El Brooks es un buen hotel, bien situado a 5 min de la estatua de Mollly Malone y del Trinity College, eso si en una zona muy tranquila, por lo que estás céntrico pero sin ruido. Buena habitación y buen desayuno.
Recomendado 100%",5,2013,12,27
236,Tutto positivo,"A partire dalla posizione, centrale e ben collegata con le principali attrazioni e aree commerciali, tutto si presenta con le carte in regola.
Dall'arrivo alla partenza il personale è attento e disponibile, camere accoglienti e ben arredate, lettone confortevole con menu per la scelta dei cuscini. Come in molti alberghi anglosassoni bollitore per preparare caffè e tè a disposizione così come ferro da stiro e relativa asse, un particolare utile per essere sempre a posto per un incontro d'affari.

236,Fantastico,"A tiro di schioppo dal centro, hotel veramente fantastico, con personale molto competente e disponibile. Vacanza settembrina assolutamente da rifare e certamente prenoteremo qui. Consiglio il periodo poco dopo Natale, a Dublino i saldi iniziano il 26 dicembre!!!",5,2013,10,12
236,Zentral gelegenes Stadthotel mit hoher Qualität,"Das Brroks Hotel liegt ideal, um die wesentlichen Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß zu erreichen. 10 Min. bis zum Viertel Temple Bar, 5 Min zu Stephens Green und Grafton Street. In unmittelbarer Umgebung befinden sich einige sehr gute Sznee Pubs und Restaurants. Ein Parkhaus ist direkt gegenüber, aber dies ist nicht die preiswertestes Alternative, sondern es besteht eine Kooperation mit Stephens Green, was dadurch etwas umständlich ist. In diesem Punkt ist das Hotel nicht Spitze. Das frische Obst beim Frühstück ist sehr gut, jedoch zu grob geschnitten. Ansonsten gibt es die Klassiker wir irisches Frühstück, jede Art von Eiern a la carte im Frühstückspreis inbegriffen, wie überall in Irland ( ein echter Vorteil gegenüber den USA). Zimer geräumig mit schönem nicht sehr großem Bad, aber sehr sauber und gepflegt. Hochwertige Zimmerausstattung und sehr gute Betten. Wir hatten ein Zimmer zum Innenhof mit schäbiger Aussicht und etwas Lärm durch die Küchenabluft und Leergutlagerung. Klimaanlage macht Nachts Geräusche, aber die haben wir sowieso ausgeschaltet. Schwaches WLAN in unserem Zimmer, andere Gäste hatten ähnliche Probleme. Viele Spiegel, und Wandfön im Bad (der für die meisten Frauenfrisuren nur bedingt hilft/ diese ¨Staubsaugerariante¨). Aber da kein englishces/irisches Hotel nach Norm mit Fön Steckdosen im Badezimmer aufwartet, war dies wie erwartet und kein Hotelproblem. Gute Auswahl an Shampoo und Hautcreme. Das Frühstückspersonal ist etwas schläfrig und konzentriert sich ab halb zehn auf das Abräumen, auch wenn man auf Nachfragen auch nach zehn noch alles bekommt.",4,2013,09,20
236,Gutes Stadthotel in zentraler Lage,"Wenige Gehminuten von Temple Bar entfernt in einer ruhigen Seitengasse. Personal freundlich und hilfsbereit, Zimmer hübsch und sauber.

Ich würde hier beim nächsten Dublin-Aufenthalt durchaus wieder buchen.",4,2013,09,05
236,100% Recomendable,"Hotel muy muy céntrico, a escasos 10 minutos andando del Trinity College. Muy limpio, moderno y con multitud de detalles, como por ejemplo que todas las tardes te abran la cama, te cierren las cortinas y te dejen una chocolatina encima de la almohada.

236,Limpieza en la habitación y desayunos mejorables,"Estuve del 8 al 12 de julio de 2013. Ni el aparato de televisión ni el mando lo limpiaron durante esos días. Una noche ensució mucho una gaviota el cristal de la habitación. Así estuvo el cristal 2 noches, hasta el día 12, en que abandonamos el hotel. El buffet del desayuno escaso, puedes pedir a la carta, pero al estar en inglés no sabes que vas a comer, por lo que no pides.",3,2013,07,22
236,Und ewig tönt der Ventilator,"Hotel in der Stadtmitte, nur für englisch sprechende Gäste zu empfehlen. 
Keine einziges Hotel Dokument in einer anderen Sprache.
Das Deluxe Zimmer 114 wird dem nicht gerecht. Ein unnötiges drittes Bett im Zimmer, Duschabfluss verstopft, Duschschlauch Defekt.
Der Ventilator vom Nachbargrundstück tönte unablässlich, das Flaschenentsorgen sehr geräuschvoll.",3,2013,07,21
236,Gutes Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Grundsätzlich ein gutes Hotel in sehr guter Lage.
Das Personal ist zum Grossteil sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Dies gilt insbesondere für Empfang, Concierge, Bar und Zimmerservice.
Die Hotelbar ist sehr gemütlich.
Wirklich zu bemängeln ist das Frühstück. Die Auswahl ist relativ gering. Dies wäre noch okay, wenn das Personal im Frühstücksbereicht ähnlich gut wäre, wie im Rest des Hauses. Bedauerlicherweise ist dies nicht der Fall. Unkoordiniert, teilweise sehr langsam (15 Minuten auf Kaffee bzw. das Nachlegen von Speisen warten, Bestellungen wurden trotz Nachfrage ganz vergessen). Es ist ausreichend Personal vorhanden, aber die Zuständigkeiten sind teilweise nicht geregelt.
Ausserdem besteht etwas Renovierungsbedarf.
Vier Sternen wird das Hotel nur teilweise gerecht.",3,2013,05,06
236,ottima posizione!!!,"Sicuramente se dovessi tornare a Dublino, prenoterei ancora in questo hotel soprattutto per l'ottima posizione a pochi passi dalla famosa Grafton Street (Via dello shopping)  e vicino alle principali attrazioni della città quali Trinity College.....
Per il resto tutto ok ma abbastanza nella media ; giudizio positivo/buono.
Personale alla reception cordiale; colazione con assortimento di dolce e salato (ricordatevi di chiedere le pietanze che propone il menù della colazione in quanto incluse nel prezzo); camera abbastanza grande e pulita (peccato per l'affaccio fronte garage); nota negativa mancanza di riscaldamento nel bagno ; buona la cena al ristorante  e ottimo il servizio al bar!!!",4,2013,03,15

Vicino a tutte le principali ""attrazioni"";
Ottima colazione;

Pulizia ottima;
Cortesia del personale eccellente.

CONTRO
Arredamento della stanza non all'altezza della struttura;
Vasca da bagno, phon e porta del bagno in pessime condizioni.

236,"Als ""De Luxe"" Zimmer 416 und 418  bezeichnet, nicht gerecht","Zimmer 416 und 418 als ""De Luxe"" nicht gerecht. Kleines Bad ! Die Ausstattung
müsste mal erneuert werden ( in die Jahre gekommen). Badewanne inklusive
Dusche. Größer als 1,80 m darf man beim Duschen nicht sein. Unser Sohn
konnte in der Wanne unter der Dusche nicht stehen, da er 1,95 m groß ist.
Ich bin 1,68 m groß und konnte in der kurzen Badewanne nur sitzen. (sehr kleine Wanne). Die Fenster sind schon etwas älter und halten den Straßenlärm, der
sich jedoch in Grenzen hält, nicht wirklich ab sowie die Kälte die durch die
dünnen Fenster dringt.
Klimaanlage im Frühstücksraum direkt über dem Tisch zu kalt!
Keine schöne Sicht auf das Riesenparkhaus. Im Vergleich zu anderen 3-Sterne-Hotels in Irland hat dieses 4-Sterne-Hotel das schlechteste  Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis!!
Der Empfang kannte nicht die Öffnungszeiten vom Parkhaus gegenüber (""Drury Street Car Park""). Die Öffnungszeiten sind sehr unterschiedlich, hat nachts geschlossen und war am 25.12.2012 ganztägig geschlossen.
Die Öffnungszeiten waren nicht am Parkhaus ersichtlich. Wir erhielten ein ""Christmas Programm 2012"" beim Empfang, wo auf der letzten Seite die Öffnungszeiten aufgelistet waren. Glücklicherweise haben wir dieses Parkhaus nicht benutzt. Der geplante Ausflug am 25.12. wäre sonst nicht möglich gewesen. 
Beim check out erhielten wir nur einen Kassenzettel vom Kreditkartenleser als Rechnung und keine ordentliche Rechnung vom Brooks Hotel. Dies ist kein 4-Sterne-Niveau!!!
Speziell eine Dame am Empfang war beim Check Out sehr unfreundlich, sprach ein flottes und undeutliches Englisch. Mein Hinweis ""no speak english"" wurde von ihr nicht beachtet und sie steigerte noch ihre Unfreundlichkeit und hatte kein Verständnis.",3,2012,12,31
236,Eccellente sistemazione,"Sono stato in questo albergo per tre notti con la mia bimba di 16 mesi e la mia compagna e ci siamo trovati benissimo. Avevo prenotato con booking.com una matrimoniale classica e ci hanno assegnato una stanza grandissima completa di salottino, bagno enorme con cabina doccia e vasca (separati), cabina armadio con ferro e asse da stiro. E senza maggiorazioni di prezzo. La posizione è ottima, l'albergo è a pochi passi dalla strada dello shopping, dai ristoranti del centro e da Trinity college. Dall'aeroporto si puó raggiungere facilmente in bus o in taxi (spesa intorno ai 30 euro). Il personale è molto cordiale, la colazione abbondante. Pulito, ambienti sempre profumati e wi-fi libero (a Dublino è una costante). Ti accoglie un tizio in uniforme (non ricordo il nome) che ti spiega tutto su Dublino e ti aiuta a entrare nel clima irlandese. Unica pecca per noi arrivati molto presto con l'aereo da Pisa, il check-in alle 14... Dentro c'è anche un ristorante e un bar molto accoglienti.",5,2012,10,25
236,Gutes Hotel absolut zentral,"Das Hotel liegt in Mitten eines Bar und Restaurant Bezirks im Zentrum von Dublin. Die Ausstattung ist eher etwas old fashioned und müsste mal erneuert werden. Die Betten sind bequem und das Frühstück qualitativ hochwertig und reichhaltig. Um die Ecke gibt es außerdem einen Supermarkt für die, die sich gerne selber versorgen. Der Preis ist je nach Rate die man bekommt angemessen.",3,2012,09,27
236,strategico,"l'hotel si presenta bene,anche il bar ed il ristorante sono buoni: il cibo e' di buona qualita'.sicuramente il suo punto forte e' l'ubicazione:davvero strategica! a pochi minuti da temple bar e dallo shopping! il servizio e' buono e il personale cortese. inoltre se hai noleggiato un'auto puoi usufruire del car park convenzionato che si trova di fronte all'hotel. se invece preferisci un car park aperto h24 a due passi ne trovi uno enorme e neanche carissimo(6 euro dalle 17 alle 10 del giorno dopo). l'hotel e' ottimo per una vacanza in coppia o da single in quanto ti permette una piena autonomia negli spostamenti! la colazione e'nella media. per noi italiani la scelta c'e':buon cappuccino ed espresso,pane, confetture,nutella,frutta fresca,i croissant sono pieni di burro (come del resto in tutta europa al di fuori dell'Italia) e frutta fresca(melone anguria ananas pompelmo arancia). lo yogurth e' greco. i gadget da bagno non sono tantissimi(mancano ciabatte e salviettine struccanti e manicure kit).complessivamente il giudizio e' positivo",4,2012,08,12
236,Céntrico y acogedor,"El hotel está muy céntrico, a un paso de la calle comercial Grafton Street. La única pega es que las vistas dan a un parking y la calle no es muy bonita. Pero se compensa con la acogedora decoración del hall, de la sala de lectura y de las habitaciones. Tiene wifi gratis en estas y la limpieza es impecable (aunque sobra la cortina en la ducha). El personal es amable y atento, sobre todo el conserje. Nosotros desayunamos todos los días y la comida es variada y de excelente calidad, con platos típicos a la carta incluidos en el buffet. Aunque resulta algo caro, desde luego merece la pena.",4,2012,08,06

236,Muy céntrico para moverte por Dublín.,"Es muy céntrico.
Solo hablan inglés. El problema está en el desayuno. Resulta escaso el buffet, por lo que hay que elegir algo de la carta y es complicado y lleva a confusión al tenerlo solo en su idioma; y además no ponen ningún tipo de tortilla.
Tiene un salón, solo para clientes, en la planta -1 que es una delicia.
En conjunto resulta bien la relación calidad-precio.",4,2012,07,11
236,DAS Hotel,"Es könnte nicht zentraler gelegen sein, dieses kleine, top Hotel. Schon bei der Ankunft wird man herzlich willkommen und alle Fragen über die Stadt werden beantwortet. Zusatz-Diensteistungen werden sofort erledigt und die Leute bleiben freundlich. Die Zimmer sind top, jedoch nicht ganz ruhig, je nachdem, wohin die Fenster liegen. Im Hof gibt es laute Klimaanlagen, welche die ganze Nacht laufen, Wenn man jedoch das Fenster zu hat, hört man nichts mehr.",5,2012,07,01

236,Perfecto: ubicacion y calidad.,"El hotel tiene una ubicación perfecta, en el centro pero en una calle menos transitada. A un paso de trinity college y temple bar y justo detras de grafton st. Aún así el fin de semana hubo un poco más de ruido por la noche, pero nada que no se pueda soportar (y nosotros somos bastante especiales). Nos dieron la habitación 100 (quiza por eso tenia mas ruido exterior), que es enorme, con su salon y todo. La limpieza muy bien y tienen carta de almohadas! 
El baño pequeño pero bien. Nos llamo la atención que no se oía el tipico ""ruido de pasillo"" por las mañanas, a pesar de estar al lado del ascensor.
Para nuestra sorpresa, teníamos incluido el desayuno, buenísimo el irlandes. El personal muy amable pero tampoco tuvimos mucho trato. Una opción muy buena.",5,2012,06,28
236,"Super zentrale Lage, Zimmer klein wie eine Schuhschachtel","Während unserer 12-tägigen Irland-Rundreise waren wir auch die letzten vier Nächte im Brooks Hotel in Dublin. Vorweg: die Lage ist top - zwei Mal umfallen und man ist mittendrin. Wir hatten das Zimmer 604 - wenn man mit zwei großen Koffern unterwegs ist, dann ist das Zimmmer klein wie eine Schuhschachtel - noch kleiner ist allerdings das Bad. Die Zimmer sind relativ altmodisch eingerichtet und eine Modernisierung würde nicht schaden. Im Vergleich zu den anderen Hotels in denen wir übernachtet haben, war dies sicher das mit dem schlechtesten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis (Earls Court House in Killarney sowie the G in Galway waren unsere anderen Stationen - beide TOP). Das Frühstück ist gut - man kann vom Buffett wählen und aus der Karte. Damen an der Rezeption waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Alles in Allem - es gibt sicher bessere Häuser in Dublin um den Preis - vielleicht dann aber nicht mit der Lage.",3,2012,06,09
236,Buona soluzione,"Ciao sono rientrata ieri sera da Dublino, dove ho soggiornato per 3 giorni in questo hotel scelto dopo avere letto le recensioni..,
Ed ecco il mio contributo: sono atterrata al terminal 2 e con il bus di aircoach sono arrivata in città in mezz'ora circa, costo 7 euro, sono scesa alla fermata di trinity college e magia, l'albergo è proprio lì a pochi passi a piedi...
Zona splendida comodissima vivace, ricca di pub e negozi.....
Si pranza si cena ovunque, e si beve la mitica guinness
Ma parliamo dell'hotel, una stanza al 5° piano con un bell'affaccio, doppia uso singola, piccoletta e strapiena....
Quattro lampade, una poltrona, un'asse stiro, frigobar....ecc....
Bello il bagno, grande nuovo, con vasca e doccia e ahimè con tenda e niente scopino....
Personale gentile, affabile ma neppure una parola dico una di italiano.
Ora è vero che noi non siamo il centro del mondo, è vero che molti di noi, io compresa pensano sempre di viaggiare alla Totò....ma in un hotel 4 stelle credo sia doveroso assumere almeno un operatore con una conoscenza di italiano, così almeno per gentilezza, per un saluto.....
Buono il ristorante con cucina a vista, bella scenografia dei piatti, equo il rapporto qualità/prezzo....
La colazione a mio avviso poteva essere più ricca, ottime le materie offerte, frutta yogurt, pane di diversi tipi, pochi dolci....ma insomma, niente di eccezionale..........nella media...
Dublino merita, con i cambi repentini di clima e di umori e di colori, gente disponibile e accogliente...
Alla prossima!",3,2012,04,30
236,Ci aspettavamo di più,"Dalla lettura delle recensioni sembrava che l'hotel facesse proprio al caso nostro. Così è stato, ma da quanto letto ci aspettavamo qualcosa di più.
Le camere standard sono molto piccole, con poco spazio per riporre i propri effetti,ma in ogni caso il tutto era pulito.
Colazione molto buona, anche se con un servizio abbastanza lento.
Carino il bar, anche se i prezzi, rispetto ad altri bar e ristoranti è caro.
Personale molto professionale, disponibile e gentile.
La posizone è favorevole in quanto in pieno centro ma in una via tranquilla.",3,2012,03,10
236,un pò casa,"Bello, caldo ed accogliente.
Hotel situato nel pieno centro di Dublino. A piedi si può raggiungere ogni luogo, mezzo di trasporto, ristorante o negozio.
Il personale è cordiale, l'ambiente amichevole, come se si entrasse a casa di un amico.
Non è super trendy come alcuni hotel di Londra ma fa piacere alloggiarvi.
Unica pecca, la colazione. Bella da lontano, non troppo buona una volta mangiata.",4,2012,02,29
236,La classe con humor,"Appena rientrato da un breve soggiorno di lavoro a Dublino, confermo l'ottima opinione a riguardo dell'hotel Brooks, accompagnandola dai ringraziamenti per la cordialità dell'accoglienza e per la qualità dei collaboratori dell'hotel. Trovare un cameriere che riesce a coniugare da show man capacità professionali e houmor alla Benny Hill è davvero piacevole e raro.",4,2012,01,30
236,Ottimo hotel in posizione perfetta per visitare Dublino,"Ottimo hotel in posizione perfetta per visitare Dublino! Questa frase riassume tutto. La posizione è strategica per potersi godere la città a piedi. La struttura è molto buona: nulla di cui lamentarsi. Stanza pulitissima e confortevole, direi anche molto spaziosa. Il bagno non è grandissimo ma comunque pulito. Ho trovato lo staff molto cortese e sempre disponibile. Mi hanno anche fatto fare il check-in anticipato e non è da tutti. La colazione è forse un pò cara, ma in linea con il livello di un 4 stelle e comunque davvero meritevole. La scelta è molto ampia e devo ammettere che anche la qualità è ineccepibile. Trovare della buona frutta a Dublino non è cosa da poco. Mi sento davvero di raccomandare questo Hotel.",4,2011,11,21
236,Buena opcion,"Estuvimos 2 días conociendo la ciudad y nos hospedamos en el Brooks. Buena ubicación, buena habitación (quizá lo peor el baño), buen servicio. Un hotel correcto vamos.",4,2011,11,16
236,Il migliore!,"Abbiamo alloggiato in questo albergo per tre notti! Il soggiorno migliore che avessimo mai fatto!
Il personale accogliente e disponibile, pronto ad ascoltare ogni richiesta del cliente cercando di soddisfarla al meglio! 
Le stante sono accoglienti, luminose e dotate di ogni confort che si possa chiedere!
All'arrivo la stanza ""ci ha accolti"" con un sottofondo musicale, facendoci trovare sul letto un menu adibito alla scelta di 5 diversi tipi di cuscini!!
nella stanza, subito all'entrata, è presente un safe di sicurezza, un mini angolo con asse da stiro, bollitore e ""accessori"" per farsi un te o un caffe'. 
La stanza è anche munita di phon e televisore lcd con lettore DVD!
Il bagno davvero bellissimo! 
Per non parlare del letto, stupendo, comodissimo e accogliente al massimo!
la vista dalla finestra non era delle migliori, ma questo perche' l'hotel è situato in una via senza troppe attrazioni turistiche. Nonostante cio' è vicinissimo a tutto cio' che si puo' voler vedere a dublino di interessante!
Nel caso in cui dovessimo tornare a Dublino, cosa che spero vivamente, non manchero' di contattare questo splendido albergo per l'alloggio!",5,2011,11,05
236,Nicht ganz preiswertes Hotel in sehr guter Lage,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral.
Einige der wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten sind problemlos zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Das tolle Frühstück ist (sehr) teuer wenn es erst vor Ort gebucht wird.
Tipp: Zimmer inkl. Frühstück buchen, dann wir nur 10€ pro Person und Tag aufgeschlagen.
Ich hatte ein sehr schönes und großzügiges Zimmer.
WLAN/Wi-Fi setzt ab und zu aus oder ist extrem langsam.",4,2011,08,13
236,Jederzeit wieder!,"Das Brooks Hotel ist wunderbar. Wir hatten ein akzeptabel großes Doppelzimmer nach hinten raus. Die Aussicht war zwar nicht so prickelnd, dafür waren die Nächte sehr ruhig. Auch auf den Gängen hielt sich der Lärm sehr in Grenzen. Obwohl das Zimmer nahe am Aufzug war, haben wir davon nichts mitbekommen. Das Zimmer selbst war sehr schön eingerichtet. Gewiss nicht abgewohnt, aber auch nicht ganz neu. Die Matratze war sensationell gut. So gut habe ich in einem Hotel schon lange nicht mehr geschlafen. Das Bad war sauber und mit allem an Shampoo und Seife ausgestattet, was man benötigt. 

Meine Frau hat sich in das Hotel verliebt. Wenn wir wieder nach Dublin kommen, wird das Brooks die erste Adresse für uns sein. Nicht nur weil und das Hotel selbst sehr gut gefallen hat, sondern auch, weil das Brooks ausreichend weit weg vom Trubel ist um die Ruhe zu haben, aber auch nahe genug dran ist um innerhalb von 5 Mins mitten drin zu stehen. Die Bar ist übrigens auch traumhaft.

Da wir kein Internet benötigten, und kein Auto dabei hatten, kann ich über diese Verfügbarkeiten nichts aussagen.",4,2011,07,05
236,Netter Service in toller Lage,"Für die ersten zwei Nächte unserer Irlandrundreise hatten wir uns für dieses Hotel entschieden. Über die Homepage haben wir ein Angebot inklusive eines Drei-Gang-Menüs gebucht.
Die Lage des Hotels ist für einen Dublinaufenthalt optimal. Die Einkaufsstraßen sind ebenso leicht zu Fuß zu erreichen wie auch einige Sehenswürdigkeiten wie das Trinity-College mit dem berühmten Book of Kells.
Der Service der Mitarbeiter war immer sehr gut. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen und uns wurden einige Tipps gegeben, wo man gut essen kann und welche Verkehrsmittel wir benutzen müssen, um z. B. zur Guinness-Brauerei zu kommen. Auch im Restaurant war das Personal stets sehr freundlich und entspannt. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist übrigens auch sehr abwechslungsreich und bietet neben einem kalten Teil auch immer noch ein warmes Essen, welches separat bestellt wird.
Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und nett eingerichtet. Wir hatten um ein Zimmer in den oberen Etagen gebeten, welches wir auch bekommen haben.
Alles in Allem ein sehr guter Auftakt für unsere Reise und ohne Einschränkung zu empfehlen.",5,2011,06,07
236,Gehobene Qualität im Zentrum von Dublin,"Für unseren ersten Aufenthalt in Dublin wollten wir gerne zentral wohnen. Das Brooks Hotel liegt 5 Fußminuten von der Einkaufsmeile Grafton Street, der Universität Trinity College und Dublin Castle entfernt. Das Kneipenviertel um die Temple Bar ist auch nur einen Katzensprung entfernt. Das Hotel liegt in einer etwas ruhigeren Seitenstraße gegenüber einem eher hässlichen Parkhaus. Die gute Lage heisst auch, dass es Samstagnacht eher laut in der Umgebung war und wir nur mit geschlossenem Fenster schlafen konnten. Unser Zimmer lag etwas weiter oben, sodass wir den Blick auf andere Dächer genießen konnten. Die Einrichtung war gemütlich und Funktional. Das gratis-WLAN im Zimmer war auch ein willkommener Bonus. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und das Frühstück bot eine große Auswahl an kaltem Buffet und leckeren warmen Speisen inkl. Dem obligatorischen ""Full Irish Breakfast"". Bei unserem nächsten Dublin-Besuch werden wir sicher wieder hier absteigen. Wir hatten übrigens ein Paket aus 2 Übernachtungen und einem Dreigangabendessen gewählt, was ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war!",4,2011,06,03
236,Ottima posizione,"Hotel situato in centro in posizione strategica, in una via piuttosto tranquilla ma dalla quale si raggiungono facilmente tutti i luoghi di interesse della città. Aree comuni arredate con gusto, camera e bagno discrete. Colazione piuttosto cara, 15 euro la continental, 20 la irish. Presente ristorante interno abbastanza caro, assente saletta computer pubblica. Wifi gratuito in tutto l'hotel. Proprio di fronte all'albergo c'è un grande parcheggio pubblico multipiano, utile per chi noleggia la macchina per qualche giorno. In conclusione vale il prezzo pagato.",4,2011,05,05
236,"hotel molto carino, buona posizione e ottimo servizio","L'hotel è in una posizione centrale e vicina a tutto quello che c'è di interesse nel centro (si arriva ovunque a piedi), la zona rimane comunque tranquilla e senza la vita frenetica di Temple Bar (che comunque resta a un tiro di schioppo). Ho scelto l'hotel anche per le offerte sulle camere in quel periodo, ma mi ha comunque sorpreso per la buona condizione e per il servizio molto buono. Non ho provato la cucina perchè abbiamo per lo più mangiato nei localini dei dintorni, ma mi dicono che anche lì non è male, soprattutto la colazione. Sta molto vicino a grafton street, che è la via dello shopping, e si trova tra st.stephen green e il trinity college. 
Nelle camere c'erano tutte le comodità, nonostante fosse una doppia standard, e i letti erano più larghi del normale e con piumino e cuscini con piume d'oca. Si dormiva molto bene. Il bagno è ben tenuto e con una doccia come si deve. 
Assolutamente consigliato, magari dando un'occhiata alle offerte nei vari periodi.",5,2011,04,27
236,Semplicemente perfetto,"L'hotel è situato in ottima posizione: tranquilla ma a due passi dalla zona pedonale di Temple Bar e da tutte le altre attrazioni turistiche.
La nostra camera,che si trovava al terzo piano non aveva una vista eccellente ma era spaziosa, ben curata, elegante, pulita e molto accogliente. Al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato  un menu con la scelta del tipo di cuscino, inoltre, essendo il giorno di  Pasqua l'hotel ci ha gentilmente offerto in camera degli ovetti di cioccolata!!
Il personale dell'hotel è stato gentilissimo e disponibile ad ogni nostra richiesta. 
Torneremo sicuramente in questo splendido hotel!!!",5,2011,04,26
236,sehr angenehmes Hotel,"Das Hotel Brooks liegt sehr zentral in der Altstadt. Hauptsehenswürdigkeiten fußläufig zu erreichen. Die Zimmer des Hotels waren zwar klein aber gut ausgestattet. Die Betten waren sehr gut. Wir waren im 6.Stock untergebracht. Dadurch sehr leise. Auch kein Lärm vom Flur zu hören. Das Personal war ausgesprochen freundlich sogar noch bei unserer Ankunft um 24 Uhr. Das Frühstück war sehr gut. Viele Pubs im Bezirk Temple bar  fußläufig zu erreichen.
Wir würden dieses Hotel wieder auswählen.",5,2011,02,13
236,Che delusione!!!!,"Per la prima volta i consigli degli altri viaggiatori hanno rovinato una nostra vacanza, in questo caso a Dublino. Sicura che il Brooks Hotel non ci avrebbe deluso, abbiamo prenotato 2 notti.
Una volta arrivati, la delusione: una stanza al primo piano con vista su un cavedio tristissimo, fredda (12 gradi al nostro arrivo), sporca (capelli e macchie nelle coperte), logora (moquette che si staccava), rumorosa (il riscaldamento ad aria calda ha scricchiolato tutta la notte impedendoci di dormire). Il bagno era assolutamente inadatto ad un quattro stelle. Abbiamo chiesto un upgrading, anche a pagamento, ma ci hanno risposto che eravamo già in una camera Deluxe, una delle più belle. 
La promozione prevedeva dei biglietti per il bus turistico della città, ma non li hanno trovati!
Ce ne siamo andati la mattina seguente, senza che ci abbiano fatto il minimo sconto per gli inconvenienti. Da dimenticare... e da NON consigliare!",1,2011,01,08
236,Wahrscheinlich die beste Lage in Dublin,"Absolut alles, was einem wichtig sein könnte, ist innerhalb von 5 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar. Ein Parkhaus befindet sich direkt gegenüber des Hoteleingangs. Bushaltestelle ebenfalls keine 5min entfernt. 

Personal ist sehr aufmerksam, sehr freundlich, sehr hilfsbereit und sehr zuvorkommend.

Zimmer im klassischen Stil eingerichtet, jedoch moderner LCD-Fernseher (allerdings mit nur 14 empfangbaren Sendern) vorhanden. Leider kein vernünftiger Schreibtisch/Schreibtischstuhl im Zimmer - einziger Nachteil.",5,2010,11,26
236,Boutique-Hotel der gehobenen Klasse in Dublin,"Das Hotel liegt zentral, so dass vieles zu Fuss erreichbar ist. Es ist ein klassiches Boutique-Style Hotel mit Restaurant und Hotel-Bar. Die Hotel-Zimmer sind etwas plüschig, aber gemütlich. Das Bad ist für ein Hotelbad sehr gelungen. Zusätzlich gibt es einen kleine Fitness-/Wellness-Bereich. Das Pros-Niveau ist hoch aus meiner Sicht, ich war im Radisson gebucht, das mich aber wegen Überbuchung transferiert hatte und hätte das Hotel auch bevorzugt.",4,2010,09,30
236,Questo hotel si e' rivelato un'ottima...,"Questo hotel si e' rivelato un'ottima scelta: ottima location nella zona più cool di dublino, camere belle e pulite, personale gentilissimo e una buonissima colazione. Cosa volere di piú: ecco un ottimo rapporto qualitá prezzo. D a ritornare sicuramente",5,2010,07,04
236,merita 5 stelle,"L'hotel merita senz'altro più delle sue 4 stelle: una posizione eccezionale, silenziosa ma centralissima; camera deliziosa arredata con gusto e tutti confort, personale gentilissimo. Davvero molto curato: dal menu per la scelta del cuscino all'idromassaggio per i piedi in camera. Il letto è forse il più comodo in cui io abbia mai dormito in un hotel. C'è anche una sauna e una piccola sala fitness. In stanza c'è addirittura il wi fi gratuito. Veramente consigliatissimo!!! Pensavo che i giudizi sul Brooks fossero esagerati, ma merita davvero tutti questi complimenti. Vale tutto il prezzo (che poi non è eccessivo).",5,2010,03,15
236,Pub Tour,"Bereits 7x im Brooks gewohnt und immer 1A!! Die Zimmer sind duper, das Irish breakfast genial und das Guiness an der Bar schmeckt!!!",5,2010,01,16
236,Incantevole,"L'hotel è incantevole. A pochi passi dal centro offre tutto quello che uno potrebbe desiderare. L'ambiente è suggestivo e molto elegante, ma ccogliente. Il ristorante propone prelibatezze a prezzi assolutamente ragionevoli. Vi è una sala lounge meravigliosa con camino, quadri e libri antichi, una piccola palestra, una sauna ed un mini cinema. Il personale è altamente professionale e molto discreto. Le camere sembrano mini suite, arredate con estremo gusto. L'ospite è ""coccolato"" nei minimi dettagli, tra cui la preparazione della camera per la notte, con tanto di cioccolatino riposto sui cuscini (dei quali si può scegliere la tipologia), nel letto appositamente preparato per il riposo. Un 4 stelle con la qualità di un 5 stelle.",5,2009,12,26
236,Lage OK --> Zimmer schrecklich,"Die Lage ist OK, nahe zu vielen Attraktionen und Pubs (aber in einer nicht gerade einladenden Seitenstraße)
Das Zimmer war sehr sehr klein und ungepflegt, nicht historisch sondern einfach alt ! Das versprochene wireless Internet ist viel zu schwach um sich anzumelden.
Ich würde hier nicht wieder übernachten, schon garnicht für den viel zu hohen Preis.
Dieses Hotel hat höchstens 3 Sterne Niveau.",2,2009,10,12
236,"Estupendo hotel en el centro de Dublín , junto a Grafton St.","Después de una semana viajando por Irlanda, devolvimos el coche en el aeropuerto y pasamos nuestro último día en Dublín. Escogimos el Brooks por las buenas críticas que habíamos leido en TripAdvisor, y estamos encantados con la elección que hicimos. 
La situación es inmejorable, a espaldas de Grafton Street, la calle más comercial de Dublín. Es un 4 estrellas que realmente ofrece servicios de 4 estrellas: la habitación era de un tamaño razonable, con una cama muy grande y muy confortable, El hotel cuenta con un ""Menú de Almohadas"" disponible para todos los clientes con una gran variedad a elegir. El cuarto de baño está bien equipado, y te ofrecen las ""amenities"" necesarias para no echar nada en falta.
Puedes elegir un Desayuno Continental o el Desayuno Irlandés. Nosotros elegimos el Irlandés, que venía con la oferta que contratamos por internet. Es un buffet no demasiado abundante en variedad pero sí muy bueno en calidad de los productos, que son los típicos del país (variedad de panes recién hechos, algo de bollería, cereales,...) Y al momento te hacen en la cocina el plato que elijas (el típico desayuno irlandés de huevos, salchichas, bacon...o huevos revueltos y salmón ahumado...)
El trato de todo el personal del hotel es muy amable, y puedes dejar la habitación a las 12 de la mañana, lo que nos permitió hacer unas compras de última hora antes de salir de nuevo para el aeropuerto. 
Especial mención quiero hacer del Conserje, Connor, que nos recibió con un apretón de manos y un plano de la ciudad, y nos trató como si nos conociera de toda la vida y con muchísima educación. 
Si tengo oportunidad volveré-",4,2009,09,28
236,Muy céntrico. Confortable. Agradable.,"Hotel muy recomendable. Muy céntrico, excelente ubicación. Confortable. Agradable. Muy buen desayuno.",5,2009,08,29
236,Felicissima scelta,"La posizione è meravigliosa, a due passi da Grafton Street, pedonale, tra Trinity College e St. Stephen's Green, ristoranti, localini, negozi e pub tutt'intorno, ma in una zona elegante e tranquilla, non presa d'assalto da turisti e orde di ragazzini come Temple Bar. L'hotel è molto confortevole, con grande attenzione ai dettagli, pulitissimo, il personale estremamente gentile e prime colazioni squisite e abbondanti. Le nostre camere erano piccoline, ma forse perchè avevamo prenotato con una tariffa ridotta speciale (credo che le camere del secondo e terzo piano piano siano più spaziose, noi eravamo al quinto).
La mia era una vacanza tra amici, quarantenni , in cerca di relax e svago. Non avremmo potuto scegliere di meglio.",5,2009,04,15
236,capodanno a dublino,"Con un gruppo di amici siamo stati per alcuni giorni ospiti del Brooks. Tutto perfetto la posizione, il servizio, la colazione, le camere estremamente confortevoli. Si dorme benissimo senza alcun rumore. L' albergo mette adirittura a disposizione un ""Pillow Menu"" in cui si può scegliere tra circa sei tipi di cuscino da letto!
Occhio al prezzo che sale per il capodanno !",5,2009,01,03
236,Un hotel all'altezza delle mie aspettative!,"Ho prenotato questo hotel in base alle recensioni lette su tripadvisor e vi ho soggiornato per una notte a giugno 2007.
Come tutti gli hotel presenti nella top-list da me in precedenza collaudati anche questo si è rivelato un'ottima scelta sotto tutti i punti di vista.
Una location perfetta a due passi dai punti nevralgici della città e dalle vie principali per lo shopping.
La camera poi mi ha soddisfatto pienamente per spazio, arredamento non sobrio ma gradevole (eccezion fatta per il manichino porta-abiti che non amo particolarmente), silenziosità e qualità dei servizi igienici.
La reception poi si è dimostrata amichevole e gentile nel soddisfare ogni mia esigenza anche di tipo informativo.",5,2007,09,27
236,Mittendrin,"Dublin ist eine quirlige Stadt und das Brooks liegt mittendrin.
Nach vorne ein Parkhaus, nach hinten wenig attraktive Rückseiten von geschäftshäusern.
Jedoch so ist es wenn man mittendrin übernachtet. Die Wege zum Einkaufen, zum Pub und zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten sind kurz.
Hier guckt man nicht raus, sondern hier kann man in Zimmern mit hohen, weichen Betten und dicken Teppichen Station machen zum nächsten Dublinabenteuer. Solider Service, ordentliches Frühstücksbuffet (die irische Frühstückskarte sollte man zumindest einmal todesmutig probieren...) und ansonsten viel Ruhe.
das Preisniveau liegt für diese Güte auf Dublintypischer Höhe und ist angemessen.
Das Hotel ist empfehlenswert, so wie die Stadt. Wir haben diese Woche sehr genossen.

236,Super Lage,"Wir haben drei Nächte in dem Hotel geschlafen. Die Lage ist sehr gut, man kann alle interessanten touristischen Ziele schnell zu Fuß erreichen. 

Personal an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich, Service beim Frühstück war meistens überfordert mit dem Andrang der Gäste. Frühstück war gut. 

Unser Ausblick vom Hotel ging in ein Bürogebäude gegebenüber und auf die Klimanlage vom Hotel, man läßt die Vorhänge besser zu. 

Super Betten.
