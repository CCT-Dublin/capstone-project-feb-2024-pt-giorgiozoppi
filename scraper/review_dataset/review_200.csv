200,Wonderful Stay during a Trinity College Visit!,"We had wonderful stay at the Merrion.  We arrived very early in the morning, and while the hotel was fully booked and they could not accommodate early check-in, they made sure we were comfortable and provided use of the spa to relax and change.  The staff was kind, courteous and extremely knowledgeable.  Room was lovely- VERY comfortable bed and a beautiful art collection around the hotel. Location cant be beat- close to the National Gallery and Trinity College and shopping. We had dinner and breakfast in the Garden Restaurant and both were very good.  Would have loved to try the pub, but only had one night there.   Look forward to returning!",5,2024,10,16
200,A luxurious hotel that will make your Dublin experience unforgettable.,"A remarkable luxury classic hotel in Dublin with personalized service that pays attention to even the highest expectations for detail. Delicious food, hand-made with local natural ingredients in a refined ambiance. An unforgettable garden full of flowers and exuberant vegetation - nature and civilization at their best.",5,2024,06,20
200,Heavenly stay,Beyond the greatest place in Dublin to stay. It epitomises everything that is exceptional about Ireland from the style to the efficiency to the food to the human interaction to the comfort to the elegance to the kindness of everyone there. X,5,2024,10,16
200,Afternoon tea,"Our second time to have afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel. It’s a few years since our last visit. I had forgotten how good it was and the service is just incredible. 

The hotel is just fabulous and it is in one of the best parts of our city. Back to the food, it was just amazing. The pastries were works of art and every detail was perfect. The choice of teas and coffee, I don’t think any other hotel can match their afternoon tea package. 

The staff deserve a special mention, they made it special.",5,2024,10,14
200,Big birthday celebration,"Myself and my friend booked the five star steal package for our respective “big” birthdays. We could not have chosen a better location in which to celebrate it. The experience was five star excellence and luxury with a very relaxed vibe. 

It is like stepping into an other world when crossing the threshold of the Merrion. It is so beautiful from the rooms, to the bar to the restaurant, there is no need to leave the hotel at all during one’s stay. We did however bumble down to Grafton street on the Saturday but the ambience in the hotel was so good we could not stay away for very long.

We are in the garden room restaurant, the food was excellent and well priced for Dublin as was the wine list. 

The service from the staff in the bar, the restaurant, reception and housekeeping/ room service was outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble.

We did not want to leave on the Sunday but I was comforted by the fact I was booked again for January!",5,2024,10,13
200,Great hotel!,"My wife and I spent our last days in Ireland here.  The hotel is magnificent and chariming.  The location is easy walking from the quay as well as the grand canal.  The staff was professional and friendly as well as helpful for any need.  Housekeeping while being invisible was absolutely the best.   Our room was well taken care of and very comfortable (superior kind room - garden wing).   The restaurant they use for dinners and breakfast was friendly, the food excellent, the view nice and the staff wonderful.  You knew you were in a 5 star hotel where everything is so well taken care of.  We did have a problem in the restaurant but it was immediately taken care of and resolved.  The way things should be.  We enjoyed everything about this hotel.  We did not take the free tour but we did roam around to check out the extroidinary art and history.  If I ever find myself with an opportunity to stay here again I will not hesitate.  Thank you for being a very pleasant end to our 42 day stay in Ireland.",5,2024,10,12
200,A top five star offering in Dublin,"The Merrion is truly a five star hotel.  Indeed one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  It is understated elegance, from the common areas to the rooms, all wonderful.  Staff were uniformly fabulous.   Personable, and always helpful.  The breakfast area, with views onto the interior garden area, is great, as are the gardens themselves.  Location is excellent, with many sights easily walkable.  The only recommendation I would make for the hotel is to beef up their cold breakfast offerings.  A five star hotel really should have a larger cheese/meat/fish selection than we experienced.  Limited selections of all of those; we stayed at other four stars on this trip that had larger selections of the above.  Would also like real croissants and scones.  That said, the fruit/juice selections were excellent, as were the hot offerings.",5,2024,10,12
200,Understated elegance,"Hotel is very elegant in an extremely comfortable and warm way.  Very interesting art collection in the hotel.  Comfortable rooms, all room amenities were clean and in great shape.  Staff were excellent and very competent.  Cellar bar is a great place to have a nightcap.  Would recommend and stay again.",5,2024,10,11
200,Merrion Hotel: a Five Star Stop,"In my years of travel, I have never seen rooms made up with more ""extras."" They even rolled up my charger wires with a Velcro strap. The Concierge and Front Door folks were wonderful with great local recommendations and taxi services. I have been in Dublin a few times before but this will be my stop for any subsequent visits.",5,2024,10,08
200,Outstanding,"The Merrion is just fabulous, start to finish . The best customer service. Hotaru  looked after us for our afternoon tea and we couldn’t fault anything. She brings a certain charm with her.  
We will definitely return .
There is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel",5,2024,09,30
200,Luxury,"Pure luxury. This is one fine hotel you will not be disappointed. 
Room stunning and elegant.
Must try the restaurant best meal I’ve had in years
Definitely worth the price tag staff professional and look after you, nothing was to much trouble.",5,2024,09,30
200,Pure elegance,"Outstanding staff, they make you feel very special and welcome. We were celebrating a special occasion that was mentioned basically by everyone from the reception to the restaurant. The dinner and breakfast in the Garden Room were delicious. We got an upgrade which was really appreciated as well. Everything in the hotel is classic and elegant, I wish I had stayed longer to enjoy the pool and spa as well. Will certainly book a spa treatment in the future. Can’t recommend highly enough.",5,2024,09,28
200,"Very good location, one of the best in the city.","About a 4 star hotel, with 5 star staff.  Two quaint bars, one with a real fireplace burning real wood, very cool.  Bar food is good, wine list is very good.  Breakfast is pretty good, did not dine in the hotel itself.  Two star Michelin spot connected to the hotel, was very good, likely the best in Dublin.  Would likely go back to dine but get the smaller price fix, as we were there over 4 hours.  Staff needs some work for a two star, but food was very good, lobster was over the top spectacular.  The ownership group has been together almost 40 years, and one works on site as the maitre d’.",5,2024,09,26
200,Fabulous City Hotel In Perfect Location,"We toured Ireland for a week and started on the West Coast staying at beautiful castle properties and ended our stay here. Located in the most desirable part of Dublin and minutes away from shopping, pubs and attractions, The Merrion offers an oasis. 

Our suite was well furnished although it did not offer a balcony (most rooms and suite have a small balcony overlooking the inner gardens). It did offer a comfy king bed, stall shower, fresh fruit and candy. 

The basement level features a nice spa, small gym, locker rooms and beautiful full size pool with sauna and steam room. There are spa treatments available as well. 

Food in the Garden Room is excellent and we enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner here. Outdoor seating in the garden area is available. There is a formal two-star Michelin restaurant as well. We really enjoyed the Basement Bar, cozy hideaway that serves up excellent Guiness, mixed drinks and of course, Irish Whiskey. 

Overall, excellent hotel that offers all the conveniences you need away from home.",5,2024,09,23
200,5 star hotel,"An excellent hotel in a perfect location. The rooms are nice and well appointed but what really sets this hotel apart is the service. From the curb side with the Bellman to the reception and the staff in the restaurant, it really is a five-star experience",5,2024,09,22
200,Outstanding Gem in the Middle of Dublin,"The location was central and walkable to Dublin. The beds were extremely comfortable as were the pillows. The rooms were beautiful. The service was excellent from checkin, dining, the concierges and our departure. Really an outstanding place to stay. My friends and I were extremely happy there and will definitely return. They even had heated outdoor cabanas for an after dinner drink in the garden.",5,2024,09,21
200,Best hotel I’ve stayed in! Everything was perfectly.,This hotel got everything right! Staff went to extraordinary lengths to make you feel cherished and welcome. Intimate bar 23 served great cocktails. Housekeeping were amazing. Concierge extremely knowledgeable. Breakfast delicious. We’ll be back!,5,2024,09,21
200,2 night stay with family,"Lovely hotel, brilliant staff and food was delicious. Rooms spacious and very comfortable.  Gardens are fantastic especially for photos. Got lost a few times as it’s very big and spread out but staff always rescued me. I would highly recommend",5,2024,09,16
200,Merrion magic!!,"The experience was one to remember. We stayed for our wedding anniversary and we could not have picked a finer hotel to enjoy our special occasion.
From the courteous & attentive staff to the quality of the food, all was above par. We will certainly be returning next year.",5,2024,09,11
200,Beautiful hotel in central Dublin.,Very nice hotel with beautifully accented rooms and central location. Easy walk to many restaurants and sights. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable staff. Restaurant is competitively priced and food is excellent. The honeycomb on the breakfast buffet is a very nice touch.,5,2024,09,10
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I stayed here with my family in two connecting rooms.  This is a great hotel and I imagine it is the best place to stay in Dublin.

The hotel is made up of a combination of older buildings with old-world charm but modern amenities.  Our rooms were large and well-appointed.  The service was excellent and the food delicious.  Housekeeping and the turndown service provided were thorough and attentive.  I sent laundry out and it was returned with flowers which was a nice touch.

The location is excellent and within walking distance of the major attractions.  Every employee I encountered was friendly and helpful.

I really can't find anything to criticize except the TVs in the rooms were too small and the bathrooms in our rooms only had one sink whereas two would be better.

I would happily stay here again.",5,2024,09,08
200,An urban oasis,"This is a stunning property. The public rooms are lovely and welcoming and the outside garden/patio areas are beautifully designed. Do not miss the audio guide to the hotel's extensive and interesting art collection. Lunch in the Garden Room was fabulous: lovely staff, outstanding food, charming atmosphere. My room as large and spotlessly clean, with a nice relaxing bath and good shower. Staff throughout the hotel were outstanding without exception.",5,2024,09,06
200,A true GEM...,"This is a true historically updated five star property!  The rooms were impeccable, the staff professional and attentiion to detail always on point.  All of our needs were anticpated and accomodated.  

The Merrion is truly understated elegance, combining luxury and service.
Absolutely refreshing to see this level of hospitality is still accessible.",5,2024,09,03
200,Dublin for 3 days,The Merrion was surprisingly nicer than expected! The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive. We had and exceptional stay in comparison to a much pricier hotel around the corner where other family members were staying. Located in an area that is extremely popular for restaurants and sightseeing,5,2024,08,30
200,"If there’s anything better than perfection, this is it.","There is a reason it’s rated the number 1 hotel in Dublin, our stay was flawless. We had an amazing stay at the Merrion, it was a really fabulous experience and surpassed expectations. I had forgotten to ask for a room on a lower level as my husband doesn’t like elevators. When we were shown to our room on the 3rd floor I mentioned his dislike of them and how I forgot to ask for a lower room, the lovely concierge who escorted us to our room immediately said she would see if we could be moved. I’m so sorry I can’t remember her name. She went above and beyond to find us accommodation on the ground floor which was fabulous and so appreciated. The food was amazing, but the breakfast was really outstanding. The director of guest relations, Fiachra, came to see us at breakfast to see how our stay was and to say it has been noted for future stays that a ground floor would be preferred. Just touches of class everywhere! Patrick, who we learned has been with the Merrion since it opened was a pleasure to meet. I must also mention how kind the staff were to my little one. From beginning to end, The Merrion and its staff went above and beyond and showed why it has the stellar reputation it has. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,08,28
200,If you’re going to Dublin,The premier hotel in Dublin. Staff were amazing with a level of service that reminds you of an experience last century. Highly recommend for service and convenience. Staff made sure all our needs were met and had useful advice on things to do in the city since it was our first time.,5,2024,08,27
200,Outstanding experience,"My wife and I have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels around the world, but none have paid so much attention to small details as The Merrion. For example, spectacle cleaning cloths were left, as the person cleaning the room had noticed that we had left spectacles around. Plus a cable tidy was used to coil up loose wires that I had from a charging unit. Very small details, but very impressive and showed a high level of attention to detail.",5,2024,08,27
200,Five star service,Every detail about the hotel was above and beyond expectations. Perfect no question we asked was not accommodated. The transportation from the airport and side trips was wonderful. The concierge staff took care of her every need and private arrangements. Five star service. The only way to see Ireland With your family if you could afford it. Amazing trip we will return.,5,2024,08,24
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"Great decor and ambiance.

Staff are very attentive, from the doorman to reception to housekeeping to guest relations.

It's a premium vs other hotels but if feeling valued and having a memorable experience are important to you, then I would highly recommend.",5,2024,08,23
200,New Favorite Hotel in Dublin!,"Absolutely beautiful hotel! Perfect location, beautifully designed. I loved the Georgian history. The rooms were immaculate, and the bed is super comfortable. The Garden Room gave us one of the best meals of our trip. Beyond friendly staff. We will return.",5,2024,08,20
200,Exceptional experience.,"We stayed for four nights.  The stay was excellent in every respect.  The rooms were beautiful; the bar and restaurant were outstanding; and the staff made the stay perfect.  The cocktail bar, No. 23, was a perfect place to relax after spending the day sightseeing.  Daniel and Jorge can make the perfect drink.  In the mornings, we took Cappucino's in the Garden and enjoyed visiting with Caroline and Patti.  Highly suggest a visit when touring Ireland.",5,2024,08,19
200,My new favorite hotel,"The Merrion is simply the best. Spacious, comfortable and quiet rooms, impeccable service, faithfully preserved historic building in Dublin's lovely Georgian quarter. The museum-quality art collection is a real treat, as is the opportunity to enjoy the finest Dublin accommodation. I truly felt like a Georgian aristocrat for a few days as I lingered over tea and scones in the drawing room, sipped Irish whiskey in the bar and forgot about 2024 waiting outside the tasteful, subtle facade. The Merrion is an integral part of any Dublin holiday.",5,2024,08,16
200,Great bar,"The downstairs bar is such a cool experience. Loads of little cubbie holes that you can sit in if you want a quiet drink. And treated brilliantly by Dave and his team. Went for some food and a few drinks, fish and chips and burger was top notch. I would recommended it to anybody.",5,2024,08,15
200,Best customer service in Dublin,"The best customer service experience from the doorman, to the concierge, to reception, to housekeeping, was the best I've ever experienced in Dublin. They go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and special. The location is perfect, close enough to the St. Stephen's Green area, but not in the middle of the Grafton St. crowds. This will be my go-to hotel in Dublin the next time I come.",5,2024,08,14
200,Beware if you are not a VIP,"We used to love the Merrion because they were great at making everyone feel like a VIP.  On this visit we were treated as though they were doing us a favor by accommodating us. 

We rebooked a King room at the hotel for August at rack rate at check out during our short stay in May. 

Check-in at 7:45pm was not smooth, and there was no welcome beverage, bite, or any other welcome nicety, unlike most 5-star properties. Then we were escorted to room #101, which was directly across from the elevators and the ‘garden view’ not 4 feet from a group at the garden cafe. When we asked for a different room, we were told over several conversations over 30-minutes that they really couldn’t help because most guests had already checked in and they were saving this room for so-and-so, and that room for someone else, and this other for somebody who was part of a group who *might* show up, and they had a woman checking into this other room on Thursday so that was a conflict, but if we were prepared to take a twin room facing on the back alley for one night they *might* be able to find something better tomorrow when the manager arrived - but no guarantees. 

We had been prepared to overpay for the delight, comfort and convenience of a luxury experience at the Merrion. It was incredibly 
disappointing that we felt undervalued as loyal guests, so we left. 

While not all rooms at the hotel are the same, all guests at the Merrion should be treated as equally valued.  Unfortunately that is not the case.",2,2024,08,13
200,Fabulous experience.,"While my stay was short I had a wonderful experience staying at the Merrion.
I arrived at 5.00pm and check in was seamless, attentive and professional. My room overlooked the garden, spacious, well appointed. 
I met friends for pre dinner drinks in the fabulous Cellar bar, a must if you’re staying in the hotel, or in the area.
I booked dinner in the Garden Room for us on the high recommendation of the Irish Times who described it as an off the radar spot, rather than dining out, and it didn’t disappoint. The Garden Room is full of charm and character, the staff highly professional and friendly and had a window table looking out on the garden. The food is classic, solid cooking, well presented which we thoroughly enjoyed. The wine list is extensive and there are value wines available, which is great to see. The deserts were divine, the soufflé was just beautiful, even the vegan meringue was excellent……very talented pastry chefs.
After a very relaxing dinner we retired to the residents bar, a classic and cosy bar full of charm and were looked after exceptionally well by the staff. A first for me, I drank them dry of the value end of the Henessey brand but this didn’t take any of the shine off a wonderful evening as I transferred my affection to rum. It makes for a great story!!
Having dispatched my friends I retired to a great nights sleep. 
Breakfast the next morning was very good, again in the Garden Room.
After breakfast I checked out, settled my bill and reluctantly reentered the real world.
This was a great experience, and yes it is luxury at the higher end of the price spectrum, but I’m very happy to live on beans on toast for the next few weeks to experience Irish hospitality at its very best. Little wonder the Merrion is so busy!!",5,2024,08,13
200,An absolutely must stay!,"An absolutely fabulous stay! Beautiful accommodations, lovely staff, and perfectly located within walking distance of all the sites of Dublin. The restaurant as well as the pub offered amazing options and I even was able to enjoy some local performers. I cannot recommend this hotel any higher!",5,2024,08,12
200,A lovely stay in Dublin!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion. The hotel's location is an ideal base for visiting Dublin. Our rooms were spacious, comfortable, and quiet. We enjoyed the wonderful service and food in The Garden Room, as well. The Merrion lives up to modern standards and conveys a sense of tradition and understatement. We traveled with our college-age son and daughter and The Merrion was perfect for all of us!",5,2024,08,04
200,Wonderful stay at the Merrion!,"Our group of nine recently stayed at the Merrion Hotel. What a gorgeous hotel! We loved everything about it. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and helpful. Our kids enjoyed the pool both days. The rooms were decorated beautifully and very spacious. The breakfast was delicious! Many of our party are gluten free and they had a variety of options. The gardens are charming and you don't feel like you're in the middle of the city. My dad and I enjoyed a relaxing lunch in the garden. I told my husband that if we lived near Dublin, I could see us taking a yearly trip into the city to stay at the Merrion. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, quiet, and five star experience in the middle of Dublin.  It is in a nice location to explore the city.",5,2024,08,02
200,We just left and want to return asap!,"A repeat visit--We love The Merrion as it is a luxury hotel with an abundance of sophistication and quality.  The atmosphere is quiet, stately yet ever so friendly.  We always prefer hotels that are beautifully staffed and beautifully trained.  The Merrion hits all the marks: accommodation, dining--A pleasurable time!",5,2024,07,30
200,A highlight of our trip to Ireland,"A beautiful hotel with top-notch service (and a terrific sculpture of James Joyce in the courtyard). Wonderful high tea.  Very clean, comfortable room. Central location. Warm hospitality. Staying at the Merrion was a highlight of our week in Ireland.",5,2024,07,30
200,Another Excellent Stay,"Another fabulous stay  from the warm welcome , luxurious room . Dinner in the Garden restaurant  could not fault . A quiet drink on the garden patio . 
Some exercise in the spa and a long enjoyable breakfast before departure . We will be back when next in Dublin.",5,2024,07,30
200,"My first luxury ***** port of call in Dublin, Ireland","Been coming here for well over a decade and about 10 times annually. Hands down the best luxury hotel in Dublin where the greeting from the Doorman to checking in, the maid service to room service are all immaculate. Traditional but lacking no creature comforts. My first port of call in Ireland whether on business or vacation. Understand family run and if true it shows.",5,2024,07,29
200,Attention to detail and the best quality stay you will experience,Staff are outstanding. The cleanliness and attention to detail second to none. Very high standards in all areas including rooms and food. The best I’ve experienced. Great part of the city and it is walking distance to all you would need. Brilliant.,5,2024,07,27
200,Fantastic hotel.,"Fantastic hotel - perfect blend of tradition with stylish, contemporary interiors with extremely comfortable beds and pillows. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel literally ""at home"". I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2024,07,24
200,"Based on our 6 or 7 stays, The Merrion has continued to earn its reputation as the finest, luxury hotel in Ireland.","This was our 6th or 7th stay at the Merrion in the last 20 years. It is not inexpensive; however, it is a true resort & spa that has made it the only place we will stay when in Dublin.  The restaurants are among the Best in Ireland and the friendliness of & care provided by each member of the staff has always been superb.
Our special thanks go to Fouzia Alaou and Michael Murray, who made our stay even more relaxing and enjoyable.
The Merrion has continued to earn its reputation as the finest, luxury hotel in Ireland.",5,2024,07,24
200,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Very nicely cleaned, stunning rooms and absolutely wonderful staff. Service was brilliant. Food was delicious and there was plenty to do in Ireland. Will definitely visit in the future! I have no complaints at all!!!!!!",5,2024,07,21

200,Fantastic stay!,"My husband and I had a delightful 3 night stay at the Merrion. All of the staff including front desk, concierge, wait staff and housekeeping were friendly, attentive, and responsive. Katie at the Garden Room restaurant was especially helpful. She wrote down several places to go and see during our trip and asked about our travels the following morning. We had a delicious breakfast each morning at both the buffet and ordering from the menu. The French toast was superb. We also booked a dinner at two Michelin star Patrick Guilbaud which is located inside the hotel. We did the tasting menu with wine pairing. It did not disappoint. Our superior king room was spacious, clean, and well appointed.",5,2024,07,19
200,Wonderful accommodations! Friendly and helpful staff!,"If you are seeking wonderful accommodations, white-glove service, and incredible food, this is the place. Such friendly and helpful staff. So glad we stayed at The Merrion during our visit to Dublin. All of our expectations were greatly exceded.",5,2024,07,18
200,Terrific hotel,Delightful hotel. The pool is really beautiful and the staff were warm and kind to us. The art collection is extremely well curated. We liked the vegan breakfast but wished there were more vegan options on their lunch menu. The room itself was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. We were there with our three year old and had a great time. The staff even gave him balloons and a present for his birthday!,5,2024,07,17
200,We’ve been visiting The Merrion for 24 years and it never fails to impress!,"We’ve just returned from another fantastic visit to The Merrion. Our only choice when staying in Dublin. 
Every touch is so personal and well executed but in the most discreet of ways. 
A special mention to the fantastic team members. It’s such a simple yet special touch when they go out of their way to greet you personally and in particular Patrick the concierge who really sums up everything The Merrion has to offer. 
We would highly recommend the delicious Afternoon Tea. There’s something about loose leaf tea and yummy scones that just make a trip to The Merrion so special. We are already planning our next visit.",5,2024,07,16
200,Exceptional Stay,"Exceptional hotel and service. The public areas, both inside and outside, are lush and inviting.  The Merrion is truly a world within itself. On display is a notable art collection that in itself is worth a visit to this lovely property. One suggestion, however...at least one soft pillow per person would be nice.",5,2024,07,16
200,The loveliest hotel to begin our Ireland adventure!,"The Merrion was a spectacular hotel - probably one of the best we have ever stayed at in a major city. It was a wonderful mix of a historic property with all of the modern amenities. The art collection was particularly noteworthy... as were the incredible sheets, the fabulous slippers (random comment, I know... but trust me!) and the little treats left on our bedside table each night.

When we first arrived and were tired and jet lagged, the hotel staff directed us to a beautiful patio where we had a light breakfast of Irish breakfast tea and fresh scones. It was the perfect way to feel a bit refreshed before we headed off on the ""hop on / hop off bus tour"" to get acquainted with the city while we waited for our room to be ready. That night, we had dinner in the main dining room and it was fantastic. The food was wonderful and really highlighted local, in season ingredients. 

This was the perfect place to begin our exploration of Ireland. We definitely hope to come back one day! Thanks for helping to kick start our trip with such a luxurious and welcoming experience!",5,2024,07,14
200,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"This is a beautiful hotel which is perfectly located for walking to restaurants and museums.  The art work is spectacular.  Our room was light and airy with a huge bed and gorgeous bathroom.  The patio area is a lovely spot for a drink.
The staff are polite and friendly and made us feel very welcome. 

A couple of downsides.   We had asked the xo concierge to change a dinner reservation but when we got back to the hotel late afternoon it had not been done despite me calling to check progress, however the concierge who had come on duty fixed it for us.   

Our friends breakfast was put onto our bill which we discovered when we were checking out - I would have thought the breakfast staff would have checked at the table at the time of breakfast. 

The pool area is lovely but with no room to sit in the loungers by the pool. 

Overall I would recommend the hotel though.",5,2024,07,12
200,Best service you can get at a hotel!,"The accommodations and service at The Merrion is by far the best experience my husband and I have ever experienced at a hotel.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  The staff is attentive, friendly, and they pay attention detail.  Any time we walked past staff they made sure to say hello.  Staff members that helped us at check in continued to call us by name during our stay.  You will love every moment of your stay at The Merrion.  We went to The Cellar Bar and the staff were highly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.",5,2024,06,29
200,Comfort in Dublin,"This is an upscale hotel with extremely attentive staff, wonderful room accommodations, and spectacular food service. Very convenient to lovely part of the city.

200,Ray of sunshine in Dublin,"Behind the stately Georgian facade is a ray of sunshine at the Merrion!  Lovely gardens, lots of light and fantastic art.  Our room looked on on the gardens and a statue of James Joyce.  Staff were so helpful and food really outstanding.  Large indoor pool, which is important to me as a swimmer.  Super location.  Loved everything about the Merrion.",5,2024,06,21
200,Beautiful hotel with fantastic service.,The Merrion is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin . Accommodations are beautiful. The staff is is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Food is great.

200,Irish hospitality with elegance,Excellent hotel with Irish hospitality. Indoor pool and lovely accommodations. There is a tea room and fireplaces for a warm yet elegant experience. Five stars plus! The staff is friendly and professional. I feel welcomed and have visited many times. The food is excellent with healthy options as well.

200,A Lovely Place to Stay in Dublin,"Our trip with Brendan Vacations began at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin where we initially stayed for two days. We were greeted by two valets in top hats that were very welcoming. 

The lobby of the Georgian Hotel was lovely with period style rugs, furniture and Crystal chandeliers.

We had three rooms for ourselves and our three adult children that were traveling with us and they were all beautifully appointed, very spacious with views of the government building across the street.

The included breakfast was delicious and service was very good. We had dinner in the bar, restaurant and the lower wine cellar and each meal was delicious with great service.

The hotel was on the south side of Dublin and was walkable as we did a 3 hour walking tour of the city including parks, gardens, shops and historic buildings.

We went on a tour of the rest of the country and came back to The Merrion for our last afternoon/evening before returning home.
I would highly recommend this historic hotel for the excellent service, beautiful rooms and location.",5,2024,06,15

The ambiance is wonderful, calm and tasteful.  Service was absolutely superb.  An acknowledgement to both Adrian and Conor who provided subtle, professional and attentive service.  The cocktails were delicious with the Penicillin and Paloma being our favourites made by Jorge and Michele.

200,Luxury Hotel in Dublin for the perfect stay!,"We loved staying at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin! It is a lovely, very upscale hotel that is dedicated to ensuring you have the highest level of service.  
The head doorman was wonderful in helping us to navigate getting out of the hotel to our car on the day of the Women’s marathon . We appreciated getting the financial times brought to our room and the concierge was always helpful in advance of our visit in setting up our request. But it was the head of guest relations I believe his name is spelled Fiachra Hautin who made our visit particularly special.  He greeted us warmly and throughout our visit he checked to ensure that our needs were taken of.  It was delightful when he sat down briefly one evening and chatted with us about life in Dublin and beyond. You are very fortunate to have such a talented and warm head of guest relations who plays such an important role in creating the best hotel experience. Please thank Fiachra for us.",5,2024,06,06
200,Absolutely wonderful hotel. One of my best stays ever.,"The hotel is in a great location. We stayed in the main house. The room was beautiful with a good-sized sitting area.

200,May Visit,"Booked via AMEX for a five night stay in May. Did not get upgraded. The room we had was as promised. A large comfortable room facing the garden. This was our first visit to Dublin. Location of the hotel was very convenient for sightseeing. Staff was always polite and greeted you when we saw them in the hallway or by the front desk. Loved our vegan breakfasts at The Garden Room. Service could be a bit uneven on busy tour group mornings. While the dinner vegan options were not extensive, the chef was willing to come up with an alternative accommodating my allergy. We had a lovely dinner with family and friends one night there. Also enjoyed dessert in the Drawing Room one night with great service. 

Overall, a nice stay. Would consider returning if we visit Dublin again.",4,2024,06,04
200,Amazing hotel with exceptional service,My Husband stayed here for two nights while on a 10 day tour of Ireland.  This hotel was amazing!  Our suite was very roomy and beautiful.

200,Beautiful Hotel with Friendly and Efficient Staff,"I had this hotel on my radar since the 1990's when my parents stayed here and told me how beautiful the hotel was.  When my husband and I decided to take a trip to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I immediately booked the reservation through American Express. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the art collection fantastic. We stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of May. Breakfast in the Garden Room was always delicious and we had dinner one night in the Garden Room as well and that was also top notch.  One night we had dinner in the bar in the cellar and the food was great and the atmosphere great as well.  Our room had a view of the garden and was very comfortable.

I was happy to confirm they have sustained and even increased their standards. 

Elegant, large rooms, great food and drinks options, quiet gardens and reading area. Well trained and polite staff. Excellent location. And great art works. 

I will definitely be back!",5,2024,05,21
200,The Best in Dublin Hands Down,"This hotel is definitely worth the hype--in a city like Dublin which doesn't seem to really have a large luxury hotel category, The Merrion definitely stands heads and shoulders above its competitors. (And yes, I've stayed at quite a few of these competitors.) Although the price is high, if you are looking for a very comfortable stay then I'd say look no further than The Merrion.

I made the reservation using Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) and it was one of the best hotel bookings I've made through that platform--a wonderful upgrade (which was extremely appreciated) and the credit that comes along with the FHR booking was able to be applied to dinner which was also excellent. The upgrade we received was to a deluxe twin room in the ""main house"" or whatever it's called--part of the original townhouses that make up the hotel and they were stunning. Very well decorated in understated but plush decor with beds that were simply and utterly divine! (Right up their with a Four Seasons bed--wonder where they get them from!?) The room was spotless and the bathroom amenities (Asprey) and towels were also luxe.

Service was the best stand out in my opinion, from the restaurant servers (loved the Italian waitress at dinner in the Garden Room!) to reception staff, and especially the housekeeping staff. So pleasant and kind. Not to mention the hotel offered turn down service which I consider a sign of a ""true"" five star hotel--unlike the InterContinental in Dublin which also advertises itself as five star hotel but doesn't offer turndown service--they could learn a thing or two from The Merrion. 

The only areas of feedback for (slight) improvement is to consider replacing the very high shower/tub combo's--they're very challenging to climb in and out of--would be much better with just a modern walk in shower. Also, the breakfast ""buffet"" was somewhat out of line with what one might expect from a hotel of this caliber--fairly paltry selection and even the menu items (we had pancakes) weren't all that good either, unfortunately. 

However, these two little areas certainly didn't dim the luster of this hotel for us and I would love, love, love the opportunity to return in the future. Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,19
200,Exceeded my expectations.,"My wife and I stayed three nights. This  hotel exceeded my expectations. They deserve all the accolades they have received. The service is impeccable. Every member of the staff is happy and wants to help. The entire hotel is emmaculate, clean and updated. The room was quiet and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was delicious. You never feel that it's a large hotel with 142 rooms. It feels very intimate. It has quiet elegance. Loved it!",5,2024,05,19
200,The Merrion - A Cut Above the Rest,"Recently spent the weekend in The Merrion hotel in central Dublin. There are many excellent hotels in this area but The Merrion is a cut above the rest and a haven of tranquility a stone throw from the vibrant heart of the city. The accommodation, food, drink and ambience are all absolutely first class. Bars and restaurants are full of character and the outdoor terrace is wonderful for a quiet lunch or drinks. But it is the professional, attentive yet unobtrusive and extremely pleasant service and the attention to small details that make The Merrion stand out. Little touches like Merrion branded cleaning clothes and book marks left beside your book and glasses are just one example. For a luxurious stay in the heart of Dublin, I couldn’t recommend The Merrion highly enough. Outstanding.",5,2024,05,15
200,Simply Amazing,"I have never stayed at The Merrion before always using the other hotels in this category.  Fabulous hotel in every way, will definitely be back.

The team here are simply excellent and the ambience is very relaxed.

Highly recommend this hotel",5,2024,05,14
200,Solo trip to Dublin on my way to the Wild Atlantic Way for Beltane,I loved my experience at the Merrion. The art tea was a highlight and I felt fully supported as a gluten and dairy-free traveler. The spa environment was beautiful and relaxing. The pool was absolutely gorgeous and I wish I could swim in it every day. I especially enjoyed walking in the garden and admiring the hotel's art collection. I look forward to returning in the future.,5,2024,05,11

200,Excellent!,"Exceptional customer service, with a commitment to making our stay comfortable.

Special thanks to Fiachra for making our stay even more special!",5,2024,04,30
200,Classic luxury delivered with impeccable service,"We stayed at the Merrion for four wonderful nights in September 2023.

The Merrion is not an ostentatious or showy hotel; its façade is a row of town houses blending seamlessly into the streetscape. The public rooms house lounges and bar spaces that feel homely and elegant rather than grand. This is completely congruent with the warm, polished service that is unfalteringly offered, and the unusually welcoming and relaxed atmosphere for such an elevated luxury hotel.

We stayed in a deluxe king room in the main house. The room felt classic, but not dated. It was spacious, and really felt more like a junior suite with its separate sitting area. The marble bathroom was large, functional and luxurious.  There was no view (I suspect few of the main house rooms would) though was light and airy due to its significant size. A special thankyou to housekeeping with perfect morning and turndown service.

We enjoyed the hotel's services extensively. The concierge organised a wonderful walking tour of the city. They clearly choose their guides carefully. The pool and fitness facilities are excellent. 

We had multiple late lunches at the Garden Room- Dublin had beautiful weather for our visit- sitting in the sun in this immaculate setting, with a glass of champagne and perfectly prepared food were defining memories of our stay in the city. Breakfast was excellent. Food and drinks are not unreasonably priced (particularly in light of the quality).

The staff are simply wonderful- able to engage their guests without being overly familiar. The hotel oozes a sense of good management- enabling the impeccable staff to perform their duties with aplomb.

The hotel is perfectly located in Dublin. The immediate surrounds are dominated by public and government buildings, which makes the atmosphere, particularly in the evening, quiet rather than buzzy.

My only slight complaints from the stay were that we didn’t enjoy either of the restaurant suggestions from the concierge (I would particularly take care with Café en Seine), and that we missed booking Patrick Guilbaud in time.

For a much accoladed luxury hotel, The Merrion was notable for never feeling imposing, stuffy or self important. It felt friendly and comfortable, without sacrificing superb service. We would return to this hotel without hesitation.",5,2024,04,29
200,Best celebration dinner,Wonderful dinner in the Cellar Bar. It was my birthday. The food was amazing. The maitre very friendly. Very recomendable. We even got glasses of complimentary champagne. The ambience of the whole place down in the ancient wine cellars is just beautiful.,5,2024,04,28
200,World Class Luxury,"The Merrion is world class, first rate luxury in every sense of the word. All personnel are extremely attentive to the smallest detail. The concierge worked with me well in advance to assure that my family’s stay in Dublin has been absolutely flawless. They arranged for all the transfers and details of the trip, including a private guided walking tour of the city of Dublin which was fabulous. The furnishings and linens are as comfortable as any I have ever experienced. The service is extremely courteous and friendly. In short, we don’t want to leave, and we will certainly be back!",5,2024,04,23
200,We will go back!,"This hotel is amazing. The service was astounding. Our bags were immediately collected and dropped off at our room when available. The check in process was seamless. We arrived early, dropped our bags, and checked in, then toured the city. Upon our return our room was ready and our bags in the room. We booked through American Express experience program and received a room upgrade that was unbelievable. Stayed only one night but would highly recommend the hotel and will be back. It’s centrally located and very easy to walk around and see sights. We enjoyed the historic charm and the art.",5,2024,04,21
200,Outstanding anniversary experience,"Excellent food, excellent service,  everyone encountered was extremely professional and very friendly.

200,Simply amazing.,"If I could give it 6 stars I would! We love this place more every time I stay here. From the moment you pull up at the hotel each staff member is more attentive than the last, and particularly to our kids, which makes it even more special. The staff brought chocolates and balloons for the kids, and ice-buckets with soft drinks - above and beyond! 
The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious, and the turn-down service is a lovely touch. We usually eat in the Cellar bar or the Garden room, and the food is incredible. Breakfast is probably the best in the city. Can't speak highly enough about the place, it's a credit to the whole team.",5,2024,04,08
200,Welcoming hotel with excellent quality,Such welcoming staff and excellent hotel on all levels. As a business traveller to the Merrion regularly - rate consistently excellent.

In fact, all staff members we spoke to were just so lovely; very friendly, helpful and professional. We had dinner and breakfast in The Garden Room. The food was delicious. I had one of the most beautiful vegan breakfasts I have ever eaten, huge compliments to the chefs. The room was lovely, absolutely spotlessly clean, very spacious. It was the same with The Health Club, extremely clean, staff were lovely there too. Overall, we had a great stay and would highly recommend it.",5,2024,04,02
200,Just amazing!,"I feel you can always tell how good a place is going to be based on the staff to guest ratio, and when you arrive at the Merrion there are doormen, concierges and reception staff lingering discreetly in force. 

Check in was quick and very informative, and then you are shown to your room, which is luxurious and really well appointed, staff will offer to show you where everything is which is a nice touch. 

Breakfast is glorious - freshly cooked to order as you would expect. 

The public areas are delightful to wander through, helped by the collection of fine art on display.

For a more formal drink stay upstairs in the bar near reception, but make sure you also visit the Cellar Bar which is more informal and intriguing to see - old tunnels and lots of brickwork on display.",5,2024,04,01
200,"First class service, wonderful clean and comfortable rooms, excellent location",The best service I have ever experienced made the trip very special. I would definitely recommend The Merrion to anyone staying in Dublin. Rooms are tidied so well and everything is extremely clean.

200,The best of Dublin,"This was my first visit to The Merrion, and while I was expecting it to be exceptional, it actually exceeded expectations. This hotel employs dozens of people, and every single one of them was friendly, helpful, knowledgable, professional and kind.  I have never seen a more extraordinary staff, from the front desk to the housekeepers to the concierges, the doormen, spa schedulers, spa technicians, restaurant workers, bartenders....I could go on. Everywhere we turned, people were there to provide assistance, give advice and execute flawless service.

The accommodations are also astonishing - beautiful, comfortable, quiet and anticipating our every need. I had several treatments down in the spa and salon including the best massage of my entire life (thank you, Emma!), a perfect mani-pedi, anda shampoo and blow dry that helped me look polished for an important dinner out. 

Happily, the Merrion is in the perfect location, close to the center of Dublin for easy walking everywhere, yet surrounded by lovely parks - Merrion Square and St. Stepen's Green.  I cannot remember enjoying any hotel accommodation more than I did here. Thank you to everyone at The Merrion Hotel for making my stay so special.",5,2024,03,23

We were so amazed at the hospitality and kindness of the staff. Very welcoming from the moment you get out of your cab to the second you leave the Merrion. Every single detail was impeccable. We traveled with three 20-somethings who came to celebrate St. Patricks day and with the parade and all the noise in the streets, the Merrion was a great escape from the chaos. They had an indoor pool and spa as well as the most calming outside garden. They WALK YOU TO YOUR ROOM! and have nightly turn down service..WHO STILL DOES THAT??!!...The staff is the most accomodating we have EVER experienced. We had a super experience and would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2024,03,20
200,"Great location, Fabulous hotel","We loved staying at the Merrion while visiting our 21yo son who is studying at Trinity for a semester. The staff was welcoming and we enjoyed sipping cocktails by the fire in the lounge, swimming in the pool, using the sauna and steam room and the comfortable spacious room. We used the valet for our rental car and it couldn't have been easier. We walked everywhere and loved being close to great restaurants, shopping and sites. I'd skip the Guinness Storehouse tour if you don't like crowds. Felt like I was a herded sheep. Of course it was the week leading up to St. Patrick's Day so that may account for the crowds. Book it and enjoy..",5,2024,03,14
200,Everything a five star hotel should be . . . and more,"Would thoroughly recommend the Merion. The staff go out of their way to be helpful, probably the friendliest of any hotel stayed in.

We enjoyed so much spending time exploring the hotel and extensive art collection, which was so eclectic and interesting. We had such a lovely meal in the garden room …. Everything was amazing. We had a great nights sleep ….beds so comfy. Breakfast was delicious and such a great array of great food particularly as I’m a coeliac. I was spoiled for choice.

I can't think of anything more one could wish for.  If paradise is half as nice...",5,2024,02,27
200,Hoping we return again soon,Another fabulous stay! The staff were all so lovely and couldn’t do enough for us. Even in the corridor we were asked if we needed help from a passing member of staff who could just have walked on past us. Food was lovely and cocktails in No23 were the best👌🏻 we were left a lovely miniature robe and slippers for our grandson which we really appreciated - thank you Peter McCann for that.,5,2024,02,26

We will be back",5,2024,02,24

200,"Warmest, elegant hotel in the WORLD","We travel the world each year staying at three to four luxury hotels. I have to say (and everyone traveling with us agreed) that this was THE BEST hotel I have ever stayed at. From the exceptionally warm staff, to the problem solving, to the elegance of the rooms and the wonderful spa/pool and of course the location right in the middle of the city. The staff truly goes above and beyond. For our daughter they provided a lovely bed and even tucked in her stuffed animals each night.  The breakfast is unbelievable and the morning staff so warm. The bartenders on the first floor back bar are patient and interested in making sure you are satisfied with your choices. We will be back and we just can’t wait! Thank you for making our stay in Dublin beyond exceptional.",5,2024,02,24
200,Perfection -As always!,"Returning for a special birthday the staff excelled themselves in the attention to detail and care we experienced our stay!

The Merrion is an oasis of calm in the centre of Dublin! Thank you agai. For another unforgettable stay!",5,2024,02,24
200,I love this hotel and its team,"I wish there was a six star rating, or higher. At the Marrion, prepare yourself to go back in time to when service, effort, kindness and tradition mattered. Every member of Vanessa Lampe’s team made every effort to make sure that our group was incredibly well served. They remembered our faces, even if we were just passing by on the sidewalk on our way to our next meeting. I’ve not stayed somewhere comparable in forty years. Cannot recommend it highly enough… and if you don’t appreciate it… seriously, give your head a shake.",5,2024,02,23
200,Night out in town,"Stunning hotel, excellent location, from start to finish all staff were friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean.
All areas of the hotel are interesting, beautiful art , interesting areas for drinks, the cellar bar was lovely. We ate in the Garden room for dinner, it was buzzing, excellent food and service. There is a vibe in the hotel, very positive and warm.",5,2024,02,23
200,Highly recommend The Merrion Hotel.❤️👍,The Merrion Hotel lived up to its reputation. 5 Star Hotel with 5 Star Staff and 5 Star facilities. The location in Dublin is second to none. Great location beside a live and vibrant vicinity. Great bars and restaurants with music and good old Irish Craic!,5,2024,02,20

200,First time I have felt staff at the Merrion were under pressure,"Eighth stay. Normally an oasis of calm, exemplary organisation, quiet efficiency and top class service, the Merrion seemed visibly under pressure last weekend. We queued down the street to pull the car over. Reception was overflowing with people and bags and staff. I have stayed before when hotel was at full capacity and it never looked this chaotic before. Same experience on check-out. I had to reverse my car through a narrow gap to get it out. Concierge seemed to suggest too many people had arrived with cars…but my expectation would be that any pressure in a hotel of this calibre should be better managed so that it is not visible to guests. It makes the whole experience look and feel less personal. I hope things are better when we return next month!",4,2024,02,20
200,The Best Hotel!,"The Merrion Hotel was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.  The service was impeccable, the rooms were well decorated and very comfortable and the restaurants were out of this world.  The staff was so friendly we looked forward to our next meal.  I would absolutely reccomend The Merrion and will be staying here every time I visit Dublin.",5,2024,02,20
200,You get what you pay for!,"What an experience! From check-in to check out, the whole process is effortless. I’ve stayed at quite a few ‘luxury hotels’ but my experience has never been so effortless. They take care of you that well! The pool and spa area is very well maintained, and it’s nice they open at 6:30AM and stay open till 9PM.

Food was very good too. 

Overall, this is an experience that demands a high price tag, and you most definitely get what you pay for- especially with the staff.",5,2024,02,19
200,Fab family experience,"Quiet luxury where service is impeccable and all, including kids, treated wonderfully by all staff. Lovely breakfast, extremely comfortable beds and lovely touches in the room. Hotel is in excellent location and in walking distance to shopping and nightlife, museums etc. 

It was perfect for our stay as we had adjoining rooms suitable for family. The pool was lovely and relaxing and everything was super clean.",5,2024,02,10
200,Great hospitality in a classic historic setting.,"We really enjoy the total experience at the Merrion for special anniversary treats every year. The accommodation is excellent and the decor, especially the artwork in the public salons, together with friendly, professional and courteous staff always make for a great experience",5,2024,02,09
200,Never disappoints!!,"I have had the pleasure to stay at the Merrion many times and can only say that it just never disappoints. Old school luxury, beautifully run and maintained. It feels like a privilege to be able to settle in an enjoy it. 
But above and beyond the wonderful property and furnishings, it is the entire staff that take this hotel to the next level. They are so friendly and welcoming and well trained and professional. I love how every act of service is performed precisely and meticulously. Housekeeping is impeccable with the room always  such a pleasure to return to, with so many small personal touches to let you know how well you are being looked after.

Superb in every way. Well done to the management and very well done to the team. Can't wait to return.",5,2024,02,08
200,Just lovely!,"We stayed here for our 46th wedding anniversary and were so glad we did, it was just lovely!  We booked a deluxe king room in the Main House of the hotel. We love the charm of an older property, the history and ambiance but it must be maintained. Coming in from a previous booking elsewhere in Ireland that wasn’t nice at all, this was so refreshing. Our room was light, airy, beautifully decorated and had a view of the parliament building across the street so when looking out the window, the view was the beautiful sculptures that are on top.  There was every amenity you could want and then some. Shortly after arriving to our room there was a knock on the door with a bottle of champagne and a plate of fruit compliments of the hotel for our special occasion. What a nice touch. The furnishings in the room were not only well done but comfortable as well. The bed (rather tall for us short people) was firm and we slept well. The duvet was pillowy and so soft.  One of my pet peeves when traveling is a poorly lit bathroom. This was not - our bath was all white marble and was light and bright, with plenty of lighting for applying makeup without glasses. There’s also a nice soaking tub and everything was spotlessly clean.  Breakfast (which was very good) was included in our package. The first morning there was some confusion about it and they brought us a bill of 71 euros for cappuccinos, pancakes, French toast and sausages. So if you stay here (and I totally recommend you treat your self and do) book the bed and breakfast package. The hotel is well located - an easy walk to museums, pubs/restaurants and shopping. In my opinion you can stay in a beautiful 5 star hotel but it’s only as good as the staff that run it. It’s the people here that take things to a step above - from check in to housekeeping and everything in between the staff of the Merrion made our stay here a memorable one. We enjoyed our time in Ireland and hated to leave. It is such a beautiful place but it’s the people we met on our journey that made it memorable.",5,2024,02,07

200,The Merrion is my favourite in Dublin.,"Short walk to the centre of Dublin.Very comfortable sound-proofed rooms, so peaceful nights. Lovely food and wine. Very attentive, pleasant staff. Lovely spa. Can't really fault it. Only problem is TripAdvisors requirement to write a minimum of 200 words ;-)",5,2024,02,06
200,Vegan Afternoon Tea,"My partner and I visited the Merrion for Vegan Afternoon Tea. We were apprehensive after two woeful experiences at other 5* hotels, but we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. 
From the moment we walked in, the Food and Beverage team were so attentive. From pouring our water and tea, to rearranging our cushions for a more comfortable seating position, to ensuring the open fire was replenished with wood, the team could not have done more for us.
The server explained how the afternoon tea would be served and explained what each element was. We had five sandwiches, a selection of cakes and scones served with jam, cream and lemon curd. The final course included three beautiful mini desserts. We were unable to finish everything, so they kindly boxed up the remaining cakes. The afternoon tea also included a complimentary booklet of the artwork in the Merrion. This was such a special touch and keepsake of the day.
I have only given four stars as I believe the sandwiches lacked the imagination and skill you would expect from a 5* kitchen. Whilst the tofu mayonnaise was delicious, what amounted to asparagus on bread, grated carrot on bread and vegan cheese and tomato on bread, was lazy and requires improvement. Tofu, seitan and jackfruit can all be used to mimic a meat topping so that the vegan option isn't just vegetables on bread.
The highlight of our visit was the service. We were treated so well and each member of staff was so polite and friendly. A big thanks to the team for such a special afternoon. I would highly recommend a visit and we would return if the sandwich toppings improved.",4,2024,02,04
200,My favorite hotel in Dublin!,"The Merrion is the best! The main building is a collection of joined town houses with quite a cozy feeling. Off the reception is a small dining room for tea and such and then a bar. The room we enjoyed was on the main floor. Initially I was concerned because it was close to the elevator, but the room was quite and comfortable. We had a view of the garden. The hotel is decorated with original art throughout the hotel and we were advised that much  is a collaboration from the Public art gallery across the street on Merrion. The room was spacious and the amenities, bedding and  towels were luxurious.  Our stay included breakfast which was served in a comfortable room off the garden. Everything was perfectly prepared and served. I would recommend the French toast... spectacular. Now what is the best about this hotel?.....the Staff. The hotel I am sure is very proud of their staff. Everyone is friendly, welcoming and tries to anticipate the guests needs and wants. Service was perfect!!!!",5,2024,02,03
200,Simply the best!,"Simply the finest hotel experience I have ever enjoyed. Service beyond compare from the luxurious accommodation to the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. Set in the heart of Georgian Dublin, it's in the perfect location from which to explore the city and all it has to offer. If you choose the Merrion, you won't be disappointed.",5,2024,01,31
200,Engagement,"When we decided to get engaged on the 27th of January 2024 I could not think of any where better to celebrate than in the Merrion. I have stayed there on occasion over the years  and absolutely adore the hotel. It was the first time that my fiancee stayed there and now he is in love with not just me but the hotel. We intend to visit on the anniversary of our engagement every year, if not on more occasions. We were facilitated with both an early check in and late check out. We were surprised with a beautiful bottle of champagne from the management. The staff all acknowledged our special day and the restaurant had a congratulatory dessert for us. There are very few places like the Merrion. The attention to detail is second to none. It is my piece of Paradise.",5,2024,01,30
200,Home away from home,"Home away from home. The team at the Merrion have the perfect balance of professionalism and friendliest . The beds are difficult to get out of-most comfortable we have ever experienced!. Just a short walk from Grafton Stret, Trinity, St Stephen’s Green. Perfect location. Love!",5,2024,01,30
200,"Perfect, just perfect.","We stayed here for two nights over a weekend. Car parking valet service was availed of. This was a big help, as there was no headache looking for a parking spot. 
Our room was superb, the best equipped and most comfortable room we have stayed in for as long as I can remember. Every fixture and fitting, every possible guest  need has been thought about by management when furnishing the room. It's second to none. 
 We had drinks and lunch in the cocktail bar and the cellar bar too. Both bars are unique equally and as expected, service, premises, drinks and food were lovely. 
The gardens are beautiful as is the adjacent garden restaurant. We shall eat there next time we visit and we have more available time. The same has to be said of the spa pool areas. We just needed another night or two!!
We shall return for our next anniversary, definetly!
The reception and door staff require a special mention from me, I've never felt so welcome in any hotel than I did from driving up to the hotel, being ushered into the parking space outside the front door, to getting a wave from the same staff when departing.

It will definitely be our go to whenever we have the opportunity to visit Dublin.",5,2024,01,17

200,Great Stay at The Merrion!,"If you are in Dublin, this is THE place to stay. Centrally located and within walking distance to museums, great restaurants, pubs, parks, and the shops on Grafton Street.  The inside of the hotel is immaculate. I stayed solo in a Garden Wing Queen room, which was spacious, extremely clean, and had a large bathroom with separate tub and shower.

However, what really impressed me was the service.  The number of staff on hand as well as their knowledge and training is top notch. They are professional and proactive with helping in any way.  For the level of luxury and clientele, they do this in such a warm, welcoming, and unpretentious manner. 

Thank you to all of the staff - including concierge (Darren, who gave great suggestions on nearby sights and restaurants), the very friendly and helpful doormen, front desk, and staff at Drawing Room and 23. Also a special thank you to housekeeping for doing an amazing job with such attention to detail on everything.

I had a fabulous stay and looking forward to returning!",5,2024,01,13
200,Perfection,"This hotel is just perfection!  Booked a one night get away after the festive season and it was the perfect balm.  From the moment we stepped from our car we were treated so warmly.  We were early and not expecting our room to be ready but not only was it ready but a surprise upgrade to a deluxe King in the main house and what a room!! It was huge with every imaginable need thought of, for example, one of us had forgotten the toothbrush charger adapter for our 2 pin plug charger but of course there was one in the drawer. Elegant furnishings and decor made for a very comfortable stay.  The bathroom was also huge with big separate tub and stand alone shower and beautiful full size products to use during our stay. The facilities at this hotel are fabulous so make sure to take time to use them.  The drawing rooms are perfect for a comfortable sit down and snack or drink with lots of lovely offerings.  The pool and spa area are an oasis of calm and it was lovely to spend some time there.  Breakfast in the room is amazing and a wonderful start to the day and I would highly recommend. The very best thing about this hotel is the wonderful staff so caring, warm and friendly without impacting on their efficiency... I wish I was better at remembering names but each staff member without exception were fabulous.  I do remember Michael who helped us with our bags and car and he was as professional and friendly as the last time we stayed.  We loved our stay and hope to stay again in the future! ",5,2024,01,09

200,What a treat,"It is one of life's great pleasures to spend just one night in this Hotel. From start to finish the quiet care, and attention to detail is a joy.  While opting for breakfast in our room meant sacrificing another opportunity to enjoy the garden room, it was a true treat to sip morning coffees looking out at a sunny winter's morning and not miss a moment of our beautiful room.
Thanks to Jack and all the staff who made this such a pleasure.",5,2024,01,05
200,Very merry indeed:  staying at Dublin’s First Address.,"Specifics:  Five days and nights in a Queen Room (Garden Wing).

Check-in:  Slightly chaotic upon exiting my taxi; the staff seemed preoccupied with another customer but adjusted in less than a minute.  A top-hatted gentleman personally walked me into the hotel and to reception where I was checked-in by Maria Elisa.  This was a seamless process, and she was nice enough to give me a thorough tour of the common areas, walk me to my room, and described the features of both along the way.  I met the manager on duty who was also very gracious and recognized me throughout my stay.  (4/5)

Room:  Two words:  understated luxury.  Soft, neutral tones throughout with a sitting chair and small table.  Bathroom was spacious, Italian marble with a shower and separate bath.  Abundant toiletries with small touches like cotton balls and q-tips readily available.  Mini-bar was adequate and replenished daily.  Spacious wooden closet with umbrella, ironing board, and safe.  Light switches were easy to figure out, not a hidden puzzle like it is at some high-end places.  Comfortable but not-too-soft mattress.  Overall thumbs up here. (4/5) 

Facilities:  They make it very, very easy to relax at this hotel.  During my five days I basically did a loop between my room, Bar No. 23, and the spa/pool.  The latter was spectacular, and more often than not I had my own private swim with a sauna and steam room to boot.  I used the spa on two occasions (face and body massage) and they were nice enough to accommodate me at the last second for a haircut (thank you Jessica!).  Bar No. 23 was an absolute gem, like a private club and they do their best to accommodate hotel residents.  The head bartender (Daniel) was easily one of the most knowledgeable and accommodating mixologists I have ever met.  And the Christmas decorations?  Definitely a bonus for December travel.  Although I didn’t get a chance to explore the entire hotel the portions I did were easily (5/5).

Service:  To this reviewer the cornerstone of any hotel experience.  As a solo-traveler I truly enjoy interacting with the many porters, servers, bartenders, etc. that I have contact with.  The crew at the Merrion as a whole were easily a top five experience in my almost twenty years of travel visiting over fifty countries and staying at dozens of historic hotels.  Although I know I will forget some names Jordan, Caroline, Jorge, Olga, and Carissa were superb.  The staff as a whole has mastered the art of being friendly but never crossed the boundaries of professionalism.  (5/5)  

Departure:  Easy and efficient.  Luggage was removed from my room, my taxi was called and arrived within minutes, and I was ushered inside flawlessly.  (4/5)

Cost:  Not bad for a luxury hotel.  I don’t think I’ve ever rated a five star with a perfect score here on principal, so we’ll do (4/5).

Location:  Within walking distance of the National Gallery and the National Museum of Ireland.  Next to Merrion Park (go figure) for some relaxation, adjacent to one of Ireland’s two Michelin-starred restaurants, and across the street from the Prime Minister’s office. Enough said. (5/5).

Summary:  An overall great experience.  Dublin is a kaleidoscope of a city and the best compliment I can give the folks here is that it absolutely will become my home base for future visits, either bookending a trip to the countryside or coming for a long weekend to finish my list of must-sees.  It’s worth every penny (or Euro) and then some.  A special thanks to Mr. MacCann and his staff on a job very, very well done.  Go raibh maith agat.  (4.5/5... easily rounding up to the nearest integer)

Check in was quick and friendly.
We loved our room in the garden wing. The bed is so cosy. The attention to detail from housekeeping when servicing the room and at turn down is simply the best.
We were welcomed each morning by a very friendly lady Fiona for breakfast. The homemade pancakes, the Irish breakfast, the banana bread, the homemade granola all were my favourites.
Padraic in the lounge was very friendly.
I have to also mention Robert and Patrick the concierges. So kind and helpful.
Stephen the concierge also went out of his way to make us welcome.

We loved the location of The Merrion as it’s in a quiet area but a 10 minute stroll into the centre of Dublin and shopping area.

I'm afraid I can't remember their names but ?Catherine, a tall Panamanian German took me too my room on Thurs 30th and a diminutive Portugese porter who dropped off my case in Room 282 were absolute stars for their service, their professionalism and being absolutely fascinating people with remarkable stories to tell.

200,A beautiful stay from start to finish,"We had a truly lovely stay at the Merrion. All of the staff we met were genuinely friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, as are the bedrooms, which include all the in-room facilities you could possibly need. We were staying with our young son so a small robe, slippers and baby products were in our room for him when we arrived which I thought was a lovely touch. We ate in the Garden Room during our stay which was cosy and relaxed, and overlooks a lovely courtyard that I believe you can dine in also during summer. Everything was lovely - it is the extra detail that the Merrion cater to that made the stay extra special. ",5,2023,11,24
200,Amazing Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay here and can’t speak highly enough of the service we received. Excellent food and the staff went above and beyond for us. The breakfast in the garden room was delicious and the spa and pool area was a perfect place to wind down. Overall,  a great experience!",5,2023,11,24

The cleanliness and maintenance of the property was impeccable!  We were very impressed with this, in the rooms and in the public areas.
We had a stunning suite on the upper floor overlooking the street below and it was great being able to watch Dublin from a Birds Eye view.  
The food was delicious at dinner in The Garden Room, and again at breakfast.
Every part of our stay was perfect! Thank you to everyone!",5,2023,11,23

200,Dublin Gem,"Cannot say enough about this Dublin gem of a property. From the service to the room comfort, especially the bed, to the food and very yummy cocktails - 24 hours if you need it :) Just a lovely hotel, I’ll be back! Oh and the Cellar - look it up - so special!",5,2023,11,20
200,Perfect stay,"I had checked beforehand that it would be OK to drop our bags off early at the hotel and arrived around 11am to do this. Because of the time of day I had no expectation of an early check in. Bags were carried to the foyer while I was invited inside to the check-in desk to confirm our stay. Receptionist advised he would ring if anything became available before check in time of 3. On returning to the foyer my partner, who had been rearranging something from one of the bags, had got into conversation with a lady on the desk there. This lady was in fact a fairy godmother. YOU SHALL GO TO THE BALL. A room had magically become available and not an ‘ordinary’ room either but what turned out to be a named suite, one of the very best in the hotel.  As we had tickets for the Warhol exhibition at 2pm we may not have been able to check in til after 4 so this was very helpful. Other than on the way out shortly afterwards, we did not see this lady again. Thank you again so much. 

As reviews generally suggest, everything at this hotel is basically perfect. When the turn down service extends to coiling loose charging wires in Merrion Hotel velcro cable ties you can gauge the attention to detail provided. But all is done discreetly and with any staff interaction taking place conversationally. 

One very attractive aspect of this hotel and one of the reasons we wanted to stay there was to view its superb art collection. Originals by some of the most prominent Irish and Ireland associated artists are displayed in the public areas: Paul Henry, Sir John Lavery, Sean Scully, Roderic O’Connor, William Scott  to name but a few. Sadly the audio guide was unavailable but there was a printed booklet in our room. 

We ate in the Garden Room. Starters of tartar and prawns were excellent. Poached salmon was rather on the pink side and I would have preferred an excellent dover sole served in a more simple fashion but the overall experience was good. Afterwards we retired to the No 23 Bar for a nightcap. I opted for a Yellow Spot and was so impressed I bought a bottle at duty free on the way home. Glasses from the exclusive range range from 49 euros to a staggering 675 euros for a Midleton rarity. For my next visit perhaps … 

Irish Breakfast was excellent of course (somewhat thirsty later). Checkout is midday at this wonderful hotel. ",5,2023,11,07

They said they would be up in five minutes with a machine that would work for it and they were  at our door in less than 5 min!  Our room was very large with a beautiful large bathroom and every shower amenity you could possibly need.  Full size lotion, shampoo, conditioner , shower gel etc.  The day before we were ready to leave, a zip lock bag was left in the bathroom for my wet shower scrunchy.  I could go on and on.!

Breakfast every morning was in a light filled room with gorgeous flowers and artwork.  The food and service was superb making breakfast a delight.

From the welcome at the door, through reception,  to the restaurant staff,  there is a warmth throughout that’s natural, refreshing and increasingly rare to find. We recently made a quick decision to stay overnight in Dublin after a delayed flight as we were too exhausted to face the long road journey home at night. From the moment we arrived at the Merrion, we were put at ease, nothing was too much trouble….quick and easy checkin, genuinely friendly and helpful staff, no notice dinner reservations arranged,  wonderful food in the restaurant.

The location is superb without being hectic. The staff, many of whom are incredibly long standing, are proud of where they work and it comes through in their amazing service.

200,DEFINITELY STAY HERE OVER SHELBOURNE. Lovely staff gorgeous property!,"At first glance I wasn’t sure I was in the right location. But that quickly was confirmed the moment I entered the property.

It’s not the WOW of the Shelbourne when you walk in but it’s immediately apparent that it’s a much much better wow overall. 

Upon check in we were greatest by the sweetest woman whose tag said in training, I cannot remember her name and I apologize but she had straight black shoulder length hair, I only mention this detail because she was so unbelievably guest focused and professional that I want to be sure she knows this is for her and what a wonderful job she did. 

We were extremely early for check in and super jet lagged so they advised us that they would do their best to put us into a room asap and they did, within the hour in fact. The first room was much much smaller than expected so there was som shuffling of rooms but they eventually put us into a great room with enough space for two clothing obsessed woman. lol

The beds are heaven, the linens feel like frette and the pillows are just clouds. 

Unfortunately I did have an incident with housekeeper where they left a carton of milk on the desk then in cleaning broke that carton and never cleaned it, this leaked under the blotter and into both cards for the wedding I was going to and onto a very old and fragile leather jacket. 

I was admittedly LIVID and made no effort to conceal that, the hotel staff were not as receptive and responsive as I would have hoped for but in the end Jack turned out to be the absolute star and hero by dealing with some really mishandled clerical issues and resolving the property damage with me directly and made me excited to come back and stay at this property. 

The Bar 23 is open 24 hours and so quaint and comfy and coming back from nights of loud and crazy and the cellar bar is super cool and chic. 

I don’t think I’d ever eat dinner at the hotel restaurant that breakfast is served in as it’s a bit bland and the food was just average but everything else here is absolutely perfection..

The spa DEFINITELY needs a facelift and a proper relaxation room before the services as you feel like you’re in a waiting room in a hallway now with really terrible decor. 

In comparison to the Shelbourne it’s miles better on service, rooms and overall experience. Also you feel very private and not like your lobby is a stop on a bus tour when in the hotel so major bonus there. ",5,2023,08,24
200,A wonderful experience in every way,"The Merrion is pricier than most hotels in Dublin, but for us it was completely worth it.  The facilities are beautiful, the staff is always professional, and our guest room was everything we hoped for and needed.  We especially appreciated the attention to small details:  fresh bottles of water at different times during the day, ample sockets and usb ports around the room, a couple of extra plug adapters in the desk, and so on.  The location is great for exploring the south side of the river—we were able to walk almost everywhere.  Highly recommended.",5,2023,08,23
200,FANTASTIC! GORGEOUS! AMAZING! Another BRILLIANT STAY at THE MERRION," AAbsolutely brilliant--as usual!  We absolutely love The Merrion.  From the moment we arrive we are greeted warmly and by name.  Familiar faces throughout the hotel (staff) reflect the GREAT MANAGEMENT at the hotel.  Every staff member always has a smile on their face-calls us by name-just a fantastic experience.  The rooms are gorgeous and so well maintained.  This year we  brought a few members of our family and the little ones were treated so exceptionally well--they loved the mini bathrobes and slippers-as well as the balloons which were welcoming them.  Can't wait to return next summer!",5,2023,08,21

200,Garden Oasis in Dublin with Impeccable Service,"Having stayed at other nice hotels in Dublin, such as The Shelbourne and The Westin, we would say that The Merrion is the best for a luxury experience. The service is impeccable and the rooms, spa, and gardens are immaculate. You truly feel like a welcomed guest here, not just another person they are turning a room over for. 

This hotel looks unassuming from the outside, but once you step inside and see the beautiful garden area you'll be hooked. The restaurant looks out on to the garden and serves some of the best cuisine in Dublin. 

The spa is very well done and the staff were wonderful. 

The biggest difference we found at the Merrion was the service. From the escort and tour of the room to the room service staff, the experience was always great.

While the rooms are a bit smaller than at The Shelbourne, the service makes up for it hands down. The art collection is impressive and present throughout the hotel. The vibe at this hotel is elegant and relaxing. You feel that you have stepped into a space where you can recharge. Plus, the location is great. You don't need to be directly on St. Stephen's Green and there is another gorgeous park just a few steps away. We certainly recommend The Merrion and will choose it for our return visits to Dublin.",5,2023,08,14

While our room, a Superior King Room in the Garden Wing, was wonderful, it's the service at the Merrion that stands out.  Our stay included our son, daughter in law and 4 yr old grandson and they treated our grandson like a little prince.  Everything from ""valeting"" his stroller, to Fiona greeting him by name at breakfast, bringing extra whipped cream for his pancakes, to his own little robe at turn-down.  Not only was the service wonderful for our grandson but all the adults too.  
If you are in Dublin and are able to, stay at the Merrion.  The service is amazing and you won't regret it.",5,2023,06,20

200,A Salute To Excellence,"A Salute To Excellence:  Six months before we left for Dublin we booked our hotels and contacted hotel concierges to ask for assistance in planning our trip.  The Merrion was the first hotel to offer us the concierges service.  We were delighted and it proved to be excellent.  Not all Irish hotels have concierges or guest services so be mindful of that.  And not all concierges take their job seriously.  But if you go to the Merrion the concierges will provide you with assistance, ideas, suggestions and loads of information and help you set up with tour guides and tours.  Five star service!  After spending months of preparing and working with different hotels the Merrion has the best and the brightest.  Their doorman and bellman are friendly, witty and smart.  Every morning they made us smile.  The front desk was attentive.  The middle of the night there was banging that woke us up.  I called the front desk and the clerk said he would do what it takes to stop the noise.  He did it in two minutes.  
The hotel bar was quiet and nice.  The bar tender and his waitress provided excellent service.
The hotel is older but like an elegant lady is still looking great!  The location is great and in a busy city that's a plus!
The restaurant breakfast is fine.  To this day I can't figure out the Irish breakfast system.  They have an amazing buffet of cereals, cheeses, meats, yogurt, a half a dozen juices, fruit, breads, sweets and the list goes on.  The Marrion charges five euros for a hot breakfast on top of the buffet.  Some hotels have more of less but it feels like two breakfasts.  A lot of food.
It you go give a shout out to the waitress, Mary!  She is excellent.
Enjoy!

We were greeted by a liveried doorman and entered to a beautiful reception area.  All of the staff were polite and helpful.  The room was large, lavishly decorated, and scrupulously clean.  Some of the little touches were so classy, like heated towel racks, and our USB cords were coiled and bound by little velcro straps with the Merrion logo.  Breakfast was sumptuous, with a cold buffet and a choice of cooked-to-order dishes.  The full Irish breakfast was wonderful!  This was a marvelous stay while we explored Dublin.",5,2023,06,08

200,"Outstanding experience through 5 star plus facilities, outstanding staff and wonderful cuisine","The staff were amazing in their friendly, effective  and helpful service.

200,Memorable Anniversary!!!,"We returned to the Merrion to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and what an amazing experience it was. Despite not being there for nearly 10 years  we were greeted as old friends! Nothing was too much trouble. The addition of the Garden Restaurant
is an experience in itself. The Art tea was a wonderful way to celebrate prior to using the Spa and its exceptional facilities

The standards set by all the staff make this a hotel by which all hotels should be judged Thank you all. We are looking forward too returning next year

",5,2023,04,25
200,The Finest Hotel in Dublin,One of the finest hotels in the world.   What distinguishes the Merrion is the quality of the service.  From the door man to the maid service everyone went out of their way to be helpful.  Also very personalized service from the manager.  The bar and restaurant were also outstanding.,5,2023,04,24
200,Merrion Hotel is amazing,"This hotel is magnificent, starting with the staff at front door and continuing through every element, it is an amazing hotel and second time I was here.  The rooms are beautiful ,food is amazing, it is all great.",5,2023,04,21
200,Amazing experience,"We cancelled a trip to the Merrion because of the pandemic. The last time we visited was 2016. I really forget what an exceptional place the Merrion is. Best service, really good in hotel foodservice, great rooms. This is the best hotel at any price. I dare the Four Seasons at 3 times the price to try to compete. Thank you for a great vacation.What a great hotel and a great country.",5,2023,04,19
200,Love it!,"The Merrion’s staff were warm and helpful. Our room was immaculately cleaned and well appointed. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect for walking to most major attractions in Dublin, and is only a 20 minute cab ride to attractions on the outskirts (like the gaol). Concierge (Joseph) was super helpful and supportive as our arrival overlapped with a celebrity arrival, so things were non traditional for guests.",5,2023,04,18
200,A beautiful experience.,"Myself and my husband got married on the 12th April in the registry office and we stayed in your hotel for our wedding night. I work for Standard Life and many years ago I was on a tour of your hotel organized by one of our managers to show us what five star customer service looks like and I have wanted to stay ever since, and my word it did not disappoint. 
I have never felt more glamorous in my whole entire life getting out of a taxi and walking up the steps of your hotel, we were treated like royalty from start to finish. Our room was pure perfection, we sat on the chairs drinking our champagne looking at this giant marshmallow of a duvet afraid to put a crease in it! Two sinks in the bathroom, every woman's dream. 
There is not one thing missing from the room, even down to the starch spray beside the iron and the most special touch of all.... a bobbin alongside the shower cap - that's 5 star for me it's just common sense genius stuff.
Our parents loved the letters they received from us, I made full use of the beautiful writing paper and envelopes, and yes I'm sorry I robbed both of the pens from the room lol.
The manager of the restaurant who's name I can't remember began with M was brilliant, he shared our love of Guinness and Adam helped us with our bags, we ran out of cash for tips and I feel awful that we didn't have anything for him, not that it is expected at all but his help was very much appreciated as the street was closed off due to the Presidential visit.
We have middle income jobs, I work in an office and my husband works for Dublin Bus, but we most definitely will be squirriling away our euros to try and stay here once a year, its an experience that we deserve more than once in our lifetime.",5,2023,04,18
200,Better than the Ritz,The best hotel we’ve ever stayed in absolutely beautiful from the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service we received was phenomenal all the staff we met were so friendly helpful and kind to us ❤️ we are already planning to return next year to celebrate our wedding anniversary,5,2023,04,18

200,"Beautiful, old-school, classy hotel","Beautiful, old-school classy hotel right in the centre of town. Under-stated elegance. Staff were really helpful and friendly without being formal and over-bearing. Great food. Super clean, comfortable rooms. Loved it. ",5,2023,04,15
200,Wonderful stay and food with excellent staff,"We had a wonderful stay over Easter.  All the staff are excellent at their roles, attentive, friendly and very professional.   One of our family has sever allergies.  The hotel took great care with all the food and made it a relaxing experience as we did not have to worry about the food.  We highly recommend the hotel.  ",5,2023,04,15
200,OK but..,"Stayed several times now, rooms are exceptionally clean. this time the kitchen fan seemed to be on all night which disturbed the usual tranquillity but also meant the smell from the kitchen was coming up to the bedroom - quite a disappointment. we always loved the sound of the water in the garden heard in the room but we had to keep the windows closed. might need to try somewhere else if the problem persists ",2,2023,04,14
200,An exceptional hotel,"The hotel and staff are exceptional. All staff we encountered are warm, helpful and professional and everything we asked for was done promptly and exactly as requested. The room was gorgeous, spotless and luxuriously comfortable with a beautiful view of the gardens. The hotel really is an exquisite and peaceful idyll in the centre of Dublin. ",5,2023,04,12
200,5 Star Luxury,This is a 10/10 proper 5 star hotel  in a brilliant location . We Stayed for the Easter break with a family of  4 adults and 3 kids.

Overall an exceptional hotel-- will stay here on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2023,04,08
200,Perfect again. ,"Have stayed here recently again  with family ( older teenage/ 20s) and enjoyed our brief stay again. From arrival to departure, from greeting by doorman, assistance with luggage ( even though not much), attentiveness of reception staff, valet parking, moving luggage between cars on departure, room readiness, cleanliness, everything was perfect. 
While we did not dine in the Garden room on this occasion we did enjoy a few after dinner drinks in the drawing room on our return to the hotel. Cellar Bar was super busy but we were content in the Drawing room. 
While Garden Room was busy on Sunday morning breakfast  was good and enjoyed by everyone. 
It is an achievement to deliver consistent high standards and service once, but it is remarkable that it becomes the norm and exceeds expectation consistently. 
Looking forward to our next imminent stay. ",5,2023,04,05
200,A very special stay at a very special hotel.,"A very special stay at a very special hotel. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived and the team were exceptionally friendly.

200,Luxury for all the 5 Senses!,"Everything about this charming and luxurious hotel was an excellent customer experience.  The quality of service is impeccable and the staff is so welcoming and happy to please and meet your needs.  The food at all the venues on property is of very high quality and fresh.  My favorites are the Irish Soda bread, the smoked salmon, the soups and I love a good breakfast here as well.  The drawing room and Bar are very cozy and intimate. 
The Art collection is you love art and know your artists and works is even better than visiting the museum!!!
It is a special treat of luxury for all the senses!

200,Great stay at The Merrion,"We loved our stay at The Merrion. It was the best experience with hotel staff throughout our week stay in Ireland. The Georgian architecture, lovely interior and delicious breakfast made our last day in Ireland so enjoyable. Highly recommend if you’re traveling to Dublin!! Enjoy.",5,2023,03,28
200,The afternoon art tea is spectacular.,"We highly recommend the afternoon art tea in the beautiful drawing rooms of the Merrion. Options are available for all diets including a spectacular vegan option amongst a huge list of teas and coffees to choose from. 

Pattie was an amazing server who helped us navigate the extensive tea and pastry options!",5,2023,03,28
200,Great weekend stay,"One of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in, nothing was too much trouble, will definitely go back.

200,Anniversary trip,"What a fantastic hotel. Beautiful room we had a super king overlooking the garden. Attention to detail was perfect all the staff were so friendly and helpful. Food was great too. We managed to get a table at short notice at the Patrick guibaurd restaurant too. Spa and pool area was so relaxing. I didn't use it but they also have a great looking gym too. Would love to go back. Great location for galleries and walking to shops cafes etc.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2023,03,28
200,Hidden Gem in Dublin,"Wow, what an amazing hotel. We choose it for the location but would come back for the service and the amenities. Housekeeping not only left the room spotless they left thoughtful touches like a book mark, a cord wrap and a bag from a wet swim suit. 

The guest relations director Fiachra is the most welcoming individual I’ve ever met in a hotel. He was genuine in every conversation and taught us something about Dublin as well. All staff were alert and professional in each interaction. 

Well done Merrion. We can’t wait to come back. ",5,2023,03,24
200,Setting the tone with Tea,"We started with afternoon Tea. It's a not-to-be-missed experience.

200,Your 5 Star Comfy Home in Dublin,"Right when you arrive, you realize you're staying at a comfy and cozy estate that feels away from the action in Dublin and more like a country manor.  From the large and comfortable room to the first class dining and 5 star service, this is truly the top choice in Dublin.

First off, the design and art collection is stunning.  The place feels like a palace, but without being stuffy.  The location is central and within easy walking distance (or taxi) to sites.

Service was flawless.  We arrived mid-afternoon after an overnight flight from New York.  Our upgraded room (via Amex FHR) was not yet ready, so the hotel said to get lunch nearby at Max the Thresher (highly recommend).  We enjoyed a great lunch and were informed only 30 minutes after arriving at the hotel that our room was ready (we continued with our lunch and then came back to the hotel).  Throughout the stay, whether at breakfast, tea, the spa, or catching a taxi, service throughout was first class.  Even small things, such as requesting extra water bottles or ice for champagne, was completed promptly and without hesitation.

Food at the hotel is excellent.  Breakfast at the Garden Room was delicious, with a nice continental spread and cooked offerings (surprisingly, the Amex FHR benefit only covers the continental breakfast and not the $5 supplement for hot offerings, but that's a minor issue).  The cellar bar is really cool with a lively environment.  Tea is very relaxing and delicious.  And Patrick Guilbaud lives up to the hype as one of Ireland's finest restaurants!

We received an upgrade from a Garden Superior Room to a Deluxe King in the Main House.  The room was generally soundproof (which is key because you face the street), and huge.  Tons of closet space.  The bathroom is also very large and well appointed.

All in all, the stay was incredible from start to finish, and would not hesitate to return!",5,2023,03,22
200,Five star plus experience ,"Stayed with friends for two nights to celebrate a Golden Wedding Anniversary which happened to be on St Patrick’s Day. The service provided from arrival to departure was exceptional. If all businesses had staff like the ones here life would be so much nicer. Reception, housekeeping, restaurant and concierge all wonderful. Was handy for parade and Temple Bar area. Lovely spa and pool . Can’t fault anything and will return when I win the lottery!!",5,2023,03,19
200,Truly Special,"We have stayed at many incredible hotels around the world and the Merrion is truly a special experience. The gorgeous sitting rooms and bar areas transport you to another time as you sip tea or a cocktail and look up at the walls to see paintings by artists you've just seen in the National Gallery. The staff couldn't be nicer, from the front door to reception to the restaurant and everywhere in between. The rooms are beautifully appointed and comfortable in every way. ",5,2023,03,19
200,Weekend celebration,"Just returned from a weekend in Merrion. Had a wonderful time from the reception by concierge staff, valet car parking. Service levels are the highest standard, friendly, professional, creating an exceptional experience. Couldn’t fault it. Definitely recommend. Definitely return.",5,2023,03,15
200,Great location and staff,"Amazing hotel. Great location. Super friendly staff. Large sized room. I would definitely stay again.  One of the best places I have stayed at mostly due to friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. 

They have a Michelin star restaurant but if you want to eat there you have to make early reservations.",5,2023,03,14

200,The most comfortable classic 5 star hotel,Beautiful classic centrally located hotel with an amazing attentive staff. This place was so comfortable and buttoned up with  not a single  detail overlooked.  The star of this show is Catherine in reception who I wouldn’t be surprised if one day was GM or moved on to a hotel of her own. Simply amazing. ,5,2023,03,03
200,When you want to feel at home,"From staff to service and everything in between, the Merrion has an eye for details.  No request is too big or small.
They often initiate a request before you even ask.  Rooms are comfy and staff is super friendly.
It is worth the $$.
I have stayed several times in the course of a year and they are always welcoming and extremely friendly",5,2023,03,02
200,Flawless experience,This is a peak experience. The hotel is beautiful and has an amazing art collection! The spa is wonderful and the service from the front steps with the welcoming concierge to the housekeeping staff who always kept my room in tip-top shape was phenomenal. Breakfast every morning in The Garden Room was a delight and the best possible start to the day. Outstanding location to experience Dublin.,5,2023,03,01
200,Amazing hotel and amazing people,"Our stay was absolutely amazing. Checking in and out was easy and they were so kind to give us 30 more minutes for the check out. We were so excited about the stay and experience that we forgot the names. Tihomir was so kind, he carried our bags ans showed us our the way to our room. Room was beautiful and clean, pillows soft as clouds. Housekeeping lady knocked on our doors on the day of check in to see if we need anything changed and we just asked for a bucket of ice later on. She came in while we were in GR having our dinner and brought ice, but also tidied up the room. The make up that was left by the sink, she organised it that it looked like Brown Thomas. It was a small thing but we were completely speechless about it. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name. Our Waiting staff in Garden Room extremely professional and outgoing. We were treated like royalty for dinner and breakfast. Isobel was our waitress during the dinner and gave us great wine and food recommendations. Food was exceptional, cooked till perfection. Great katafi prawns with juicy mago salsa, special of the day bruschetta was so good! Medium Rare Beef perfectly done, my friend had chicken and said it was the best chicken she ever ate. Dessert were just perfect! We were struggling to finish them as we were so full, but they were too good to leave them. We went over to the bar and Vasileios made us some great cocktails to finish off the night. For the breakfast, Mary was our waitress and we didn't know if we loved food or her more! Her energy and smile is absolutely contagious! Whole GR team is exceptional, but Mary's energy is off the charts. It doesn't matter if you come for breakfast sleepy, hungover or just cranky, Mary is gonna light up the day! Thanks Mary and thanks to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable. If it was possible, we would give 10 stars, not 5.",5,2023,02,28
200,Top class,"The Merrion Dublin is a 5star top class hotel.
The service is excellent from all the staff they cannot do enough for you.
We got an upgrade on our room which was a beautifully room.
Maybe the ""check out"" box in the morning could be changed for a friendly face from a member of staff.
I will definitely be back at this beautiful hotel. ",5,2023,02,28
200,Exceptional The Merrion,"We had a truly wonderful visit to The Merrion.   My mother and I stayed for one night dinner, bed and breakfast and everything was just perfect from the moment we arrived until we left.   The Room allocated to us was perfect in every way and was close to everything, which is really important as my mother, who’s in her late eighties, uses a walking rollator.   The reception and reservation staff very kindly and generously upgraded our room.   The staff, the food, the bedroom, spa area, Dining and Drawing rooms were excellent.   We love going to The Merrion and we cannot wait to return to such wonderful surroundings, service and hospitality!",5,2023,02,26
200,Never fails to WOW ,We've been returning to this fabulous hotel since 2012 and it never fails to WOW us.  From the moment you step out of your car on arrival you are made to feel warmly welcomed.  Our room was ready early and a surprise of an upgrade which we loved as it had a fantastic view over the gardens and two lovely balcony doors which were used and enjoyed during unexpected sunny weather.  The Garden room dinners were just gorgeous with really lovely service from the staff.  We had breakfast in our room both mornings which is such a treat and the trolley turns into a fine table with a hot press to keep your food at perfect temperature.  I love the turn down service each night and it is so lovely to return to your room bathed in soft lamp light and everything laid out for a good night's rest.  The Spa is gorgeous and kept immaculately clean.  There are lots of little touches that make your stay 5 star including the complimentary shoe service at night which is fab... My boots never looked so good also my trailing wires were tided and a little tie placed around them and a bookmark placed in my book. The biggest asset of this hotel is the staff who are so professional yet warm and friendly a shout out to Michael who came for our bags on our checkout day such a lovely warm friendly man but I guess just like all of the staff really at this hotel.  I would highly recommend you treat yourself to a stay here... You won't regret it! ,5,2023,02,24
200,Cellar Bar,I had to take an urgent work call yesterday evening and I was in The Cellar Bar at the time. The staff could not have been more helpful and a special thanks to Kamila and Michael who went out of their way to make a quieter space available to me. Thank you. Excellent service,5,2023,02,24
200,Another great experience on our 4th visit. ,"Another visit to this wonderful hotel and still very appealing. It's always a good sign in a hotel to see faces from a previous visit, it shows the staff enjoy working there, We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite and enjoyed the Art Afternoon Tea, breakfast in the Garden Room and dinner on one of the evenings. The swimming pool and facilities are great and well presented. No hesitation to recommend the Merrion. The doormen are also very helpful and friendly.",5,2023,02,21
200,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Perfect stay— wonderful staff accommodations location and just everything
Everyone very helpful —-  rooms were spacious and well decorated —.   Great location could walk to everything — restaurants were good — especially breakfast.  — highly recommend",5,2023,02,21
200,Another amazing stay at the Merrion hotel.,Each time we stay at the Merrion we don’t want to leave…in my opinion it’s the only place to stay in Dublin if you want that 5 star luxurious stay….from the time you arrive at the door of hotel your every need is catered for by there amazing team…they have an abundance of extremely well trained polite and friendly staff who do everything to make your stay enjoyable…we stayed for three nights we had to met friends outside of hotel on second night otherwise we were quite happy to eat and drink inside of hotel it’s so fabulous…we were delighted they’ve reopened there ‘Cellar’ bar which is well worth a visit…as for breakfast it’s a must….the hotel also has a perfect location easy walking to all sights in Dublin…can’t wait to return…,5,2023,02,21
200,Really nice stay,"Fantastic hotel and might I say the best in Dublin, food in the restaurant was amazing as well as drinks after dinner. 

Couldn’t fault the room or service all around from check in to check out. Hotel is also spotless.",5,2023,02,16
200,Top quality service,Stayed here 27/01/2023 with my husband for the weekend.The staff were very welcoming and also the porters at the front door.The hotel room was immaculate and the bed amazingly big and comfy.The breakfast menu was huge definitely spoiled for choice and tasted amazing!!,5,2023,02,15
200,Top class hotel.,"I stayed in the hotel with my wife, the hotel was top class, the room was very clean, I was lucky to get upgraded. We went for dinner in the garden room, the service and the food were excellent, I just want to mention our waiter Jane, she was very professional and excellent. And also the rest of the team were very welcoming.",5,2023,02,15
200,A Haven in the city centre,"A relaxing luxury experience in a beautiful hotel. Consider booking a room facing the garden in the Garden Wing.  Attention to guest requirements is very important to all the staff, who are welcoming and courteous. The director of guest relations, Fiachra,  ensures that you are made feel welcome and important. 
Dinner in the Garden Restaurant was excellent. Breakfast is a treat. Great hotel.",5,2023,02,14
200,The Merrion makes it memorable.,"It was such a long time ago that Jayne and I stayed at the Merrion. The arrival process was slick and friendly. The upgrading to a junior suite was an outstanding touch. Every member of staff treated us like dignitaries with effortless assistance with everything from selecting wines and meals,to talking about the French Rugby team, that was staying at the hotel.

The public spaces are wonderfully peaceful and comfortable. The quality of the accommodation was outstanding and the attention to detail was second to none.

Service and hospitality are in the DNA of this fabulous hotel.",5,2023,02,14
200,Amazing ,I love the Merrion. It is such luxury. Everyone was so lovely to us. The pool and changing areas are so clean. Dinner in the Garden Room was really tasty. The staff couldn't have been nicer to my family. We had a fabulous time. Will have to save up again for a return visit. ,5,2023,02,11
200,Exemplary as always.,We have been coming for over 10 years and the extremely high standard of care and attention has been maintained throughout. The staff are all friendly and helpful. They offer the personal touch and attention that makes you feel like you are the most important person. The rooms and food are all amazing. Even a one night stay feels special. My favourite hotel in Dublin and one of the best I’ve stayed in in the world.,5,2023,02,05
200,Not worth the admission fee,"First things first, this is a nice hotel, centrally located, good amenities, spacious rooms (for a city centre hotel), friendly staff etc., so it ticks all those boxes. Where it fails and fails spectacularly is value for money, if I was just rating it on this, it would be getting no stars. The room was €375 for the night and I can say with hand on heart, it was most definitely not worth it. 

Upon arrival at 3:30 (check in is at 3), I was told the room wasn't available and told to wait in the bar (at my own expense). Once I did get to the room (not too much of a delay), it was well appointed and roomy, however the items in the room were questionable. There was a Roberts Radio that had an FM Radio (could only tune in two stations), DAB (switched off long ago in Ireland) and an iPod (yes iPod) dock (for the original ipod), but lacking BlueTooth connectivity. 

There is an Nespresso machine and kettle, which need to be taken out to be plugged in. I get this for a kettle (steam etc.), but not the Nespresso machine. Still a nice touch having a Nespress machine. 

The room has a mini bar, however the prices are extortionate. A 1/2 bottle of wine on sale for €42, when a full bottle sells for circa €22 (see pics). 

The shower oddly kept going cold for a few seconds then back to the temperature setting, apart from that, bathroom very well appointed. 

If I was scoring this for NPS, it would be a 3, i.e. I woulnd't recommend it to friends.",3,2023,02,05
200,ONE OF EUROPE'S BEST HOTELS,"My wife and I have just returned from four wonderfully relaxing and enjoyable days in Dublin, staying at the Merrion Hotel. 
My tip would be to book a room in the main house. 
The artwork throughout the hotel is a staggering collection of modern and contemporary Irish art.
The food in all of the Merrion's restaurants is incredible. 
The spa, indoor pool and gym are all fantastic. 
The rooms are beautiful and luxurious. 
But best of all the staff throughout are incredibly kind, welcoming, helpful, friendly, and professional. 
The Merrion is superbly located close to St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College, and most of Dublin's best shopping and restaurants.",5,2023,02,05
200,A Birthday treat,"I would struggle to find fault with the Merrion, and this trip for a special Birthday was even more perfect than we could imagine. 
The staff are simply the best in Dublin, the right blend of friendly, professional and attentive with a polish you do not find anywhere else. 
Our room was a real treat, and for once I got to spend a lovely lazy afternoon relaxing! 
In the Spa, Patricia was simply superb and I had the most relaxing facial in the longest time. 

The negatives? Packing and leaving! 

The best review I can give is that my favourite birthday gifts, were more vouchers to return to the Merrion and planning for that is well under way! ",5,2023,02,01
200,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"This is an exceptional hotel located in a prime location. The rooms and other areas of the hotel are very well appointed and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The Garden room is a great place for breakfast but does get busy on weekends and so I recommend arriving no later than 9.30am as otherwise there may be a wait. The porridge is particularly good and the staff are attentive. 
The Cellar Bar in the 18th century vaults under the hotel is well worth a visit with a good cocktail and wine list but keep in mind that it’s closed Sunday to Tuesday. O’Donoghues, the best Irish bar in Dublin (in my opinion) is across the road from the hotel and well worth a visit for the Guinness and live music. ",5,2023,02,01
200,Wow  A super stay.,"Excellent Hotel. Great attention to detail  relaxing ambience and overall a great experience.
Dinner in the Garden room was excellent. 
Staff including  the door men were very friendly and their customer care was exemplery. 
Keep up the high standards.",5,2023,01,29
200,Overall disappointing,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a romantic weekend away, upon arrival we were asked to come back shortly before 3pm and our room would be ready which was fair enough as check in was 3pm, we returned at 3:15pm to be informed our room wasn’t ready. The man serving us didn’t apologise for this or offer to show us to the bar or anything while we waited. He came across as rude and unwilling to help us. We asked another member of staff the way to the bar who immediately said are you hotel guests only hotel guests can go to the bar, it came across like this man didn’t believe we could be hotel guests. 
Once we made it to the bar service was very slow and several times I tried to grab waiters attention and he just walked past. Unfortunately when our coffees came they were cold.  
Dinner was very good in garden room restaurant. 
The room itself was nice and some nice touches with turn down service.
Breakfast was tasty but we were waiting a long time as the waitress forgot to put in our order, she did tell us this and she did apologise for this. 
Overall if you are a young couple I would not recommend this hotel as overall we felt we were treated as if we shouldn’t have been there by majority of staff. Many other 5 star hotels in Dublin offer a much better welcome and level of service and in future we will stay in one of those.",2,2023,01,23
200,Excellent hotel,"What an incredible experience!  Stunning art work lines the walls of this beautiful hotel.  We were greeted with the kindest hospitality, which last during our entire stay and even afterwards when we left something Rhonda in our room after checkout.   Absolutely recommend!!!",5,2023,01,20
200,Five Stars All Around!,We have stayed at the Merrion many times and will continue to return to this lovely hotel. It is very comfortable and has the amenities and service one would expect from a Five-Star hotel. We always enjoy our stays at the Merrion.,5,2023,01,17
200,A luxurious oasis in a busy city: definitely my favorite,"The Shelbourne is grand and The Westbury is glittering. But The Merrion offers a level of luxury and calm that you can't find elsewhere. Lovely public rooms, real fires burning in the vestibule, both drawing rooms and in Bar 23, attentive service, and lovely rooms. We like the Merrion suites, which overlook the garden and offer a separate sitting room. I particularly appreciate that the two drawing rooms and Bar 23 are limited to guests of the hotel (and their guests). Other hotels seem, by comparison, like train stations--so bustling and public.",5,2023,01,17
200,Beautiful Hotel,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel,  This was our last stay in Europe and we stayed in some very beautiful hotels and this was our favorite! The gardens are absolutely stunning and the art throughout the hotel is a splendid touch,   Their lounge is so cozy and the bartenders there are top notch and very personable.  The lounge and room service is available 24 hours a day in case travelers get in  late  at night.  We had dinner in their restaurant and it was the best lamb I have ever had.  The accommodations were top notch! Request a room over looking the gardens for sure!",5,2023,01,12
200,Great Hotel in the heart of the city,Great hotel with amazing staff and food was top notch. Ideally located right in the heart of the city. Great spa area. The only slight disspointment was that there was no Jacuzzi. Everything else about this hotel is exceptionally good and I would highly reccomend.,5,2023,01,12
200,Excellent again,"Another wonderful trip to the Merrion, the warmth of the welcome, the helpful staff and the fabulous decor make this oasis of luxurious calm my favourite hotel in Dublin. Just book it and see for yourself!",5,2023,01,11
200,The best of the best!,"We took our family (12, 14, & 15 year old kids) to Dublin for a Christmas trip.  The Merrion hotel was perfect! That means a lot coming from someone who finds fault in the best 5 star hotels. From the moment we exited our cab, we were greeted by name by the doorman and had our luggage taken. Every single point of contact was perfection. They were polite, friendly, accommodating & professional.  

We were on the fence between the Shelbourne Hotel & the Merrion. I am SO happy that we chose the Merrion. Don't get me wrong, the Shelbourne is lovely, but much more hustle & bustle. The Merrion felt like an elaborate aunt or uncle's country home. It was charming in every way, from the true linen napkins that you receive with your cocktails to the coffee service, always in silver with fine china.  

We arrive on an early flight and check-in was not until 4. We went to their Drawing Room to have a coffee & small bite to eat and before we were finished, they came to tell us that they were able to get into one of our rooms so that we could put our luggage away, rest, etc.  The beds in the rooms were exceptional. We stayed in the garden wing, overlooking the courtyard fountains & gardens. It was lovely. We had a king room, adjoining with one that had 2 twins and a roll-away for our 3rd kiddo.  The housekeeping was top notch and they even had treats waiting in our rooms after turn-down on the first night we arrive. 

They have complimentary sparking & still water daily. There is also a mini-bar that we did not use, but it was very reasonable with pricing. The hotel has a lovely spa & pool area. They also had a steam room, sauna & workout room. The locker rooms were great and well equipped to get ready if you wanted to get a jump start after your swim or workout.
We had a slight situation with the swim suit drying machine and my suit (the machine won) and the hotel could not have been more accommodating. They not only had my suit repaired (which I still don't know how it was possible given the damage) and it was returned in 1 day, they also credited our account for the inconvenience. All without a complaint or being asking. Exceptional service. 

The lower level of the hotel offered the Cellar Bar and it was awesome. We had dinner with the kids one night and the food was fine. I was not blown away by this experience, but it wasn't bad either. The ambiance was fantastic and the overall vibe was cool. We had after dinner drinks here twice and really loved it. They had live music twice while we were there. We even brought the kids down for a night cap and played cards.  

We celebrated NYE in the Garden Room and the food was great. They also had beautiful live music. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the price for what you received. It was 140 euro pp and that did not include any bubbles or a glass of wine. Overall, it was a lovely dinner.  

The concierge also helped arrange transport to the west coast to see the Cliffs of Mohr. The driver was outstanding and they billed directly through our master bill at the hotel. All recommendations from the concierge were great.  We will 100% stay here on our next visit and will recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. ",5,2023,01,11
200,Checked in with Rod Stewart!,"I now know why Rod Stewart (and others “in the know) choose The Merrion…First Class all the way! The bell men had great personalities! The Cellar Bar has a cool, historic wine cellar vibe. Loved the hotel bar as well. Breakfast was delicious!",5,2023,01,09
200,Truly a world-class hotel and experience,"Absolutely world-class, from the staff help to the accommodations, all of it made us feel very welcome, right at home, and that whatever we needed help with would (and was) taken care of immediately. Cannot recommend The Merrion highly enough! And special thanks to all the hotel staff, super-friendly, helpful, and just made this a wonderful (albeit brief) experience. We can't wait to return! (for longer this time :) )",5,2023,01,09
200,A truly wonderful experience,"I treated my partner Richard to a surprise trip to the Merrion for his 60th birthday, we had such a wonderful time.  This hotel will be hard to beat in any respect, the hotel is beautiful, its gorgeous Georgian facade hides a beautifully maintained interior, the rooms are beautiful with wonderful touches, there are not many hotels that provide an evening turn down service and a bucket of ice as standard.  There were apples in the  lobby outside the lifts, we thought they were artificial, until we took a closer look, how many hotels provide that little touch! As for the staff, they were all so friendly and professional, on arrival we were shown to our room by the lovely Jack Fitzgerald who gave us a overview of the hotel and our room.  However a very special mention to Fiachra Martin, the Director of Guest Relations, what a lovely charming young man who took time to chat to us, giving us interesting details about the hotel, he never passed us without stopping for a chat, he also very kindly arranged for a birthday treat in our room.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, we hope to return soon.  I set the bar exceptionally high by choosing this hotel for my partner’s birthday…he has a lot to live up to when my birthday comes along!! Thanks to all the staff at the fabulous Merrion.",5,2023,01,09
200,another great stay,"We had an 8 night stay over Christmas and it was faultless.
The Christmas Dinner was delicious.As part of the Irish Diaspora we always stay here when we are in Dublin and this was our 6 th visit in recent years.
One suggestion that we discussed with Fiachra the guest relations manager was a revamp of the wine list.In my opinion it needs work!!
Nonetheless a great stay—The Merrion is undoubtedly the best hotel in Ireland
Each staff member from doorman to waiters to spa staff were friendly happy and very accommodating—true Irish Hospitality 
Congratulations Peter McCann!!",5,2023,01,06

I chose to end our stay at The Merrion, because I wanted her last night in Dublin to be a memorable and authentically Irish experience.  The Merrion is a perfect setting in all of its serene and gorgeous Georgian beauty.  This would be equally great for a honeymoon or a special family experience.

The staff make you feel like a very welcome and special guest at every opportunity, a special thanks to Caroline at reception and Fiachra in this regard.

200,"couples night away, ","myself and my wife returned to the Merrion after 3 years to find the hotel was better than ever, we spent one night with evening meal, champagne in our room and a fabulous breakfast next morning.  We totally enjoyed our break but the dinner in the garden room was exceptional, the staff were very helpful and our room was pure luxury. We will be back. ",5,2022,11,08

200,A perfect example of true Irish hospitality,"A consistently impressive hotel which we have been visiting regularly for the last 20 years. The interior of the hotel is immaculate. As soon as you enter you are surrounded by beautiful architecture in the main house, original artwork from an array of great artists spanning from the late 1700s onwards (including Paul Henry) and sumptuous decor (sofas and chairs covered with fabric from artisan Irish weavers and eighteenth century furniture and mirrors). It is quite notable that the lovely people who staff the hotel always seem to be smiling, attentive and keen to do their very best for you. If I had to describe the hotel in four words it would be ""understated yet glorious luxury"". It always feels like you are well rested when you leave. Do book breakfast in the Garden Room - a contemporary light filled addition to the hotel, it is well worth it. You may also wish to book for afternoon tea well in advance as it is a mecca for afternoon tea afficionados. The pool is also a wonderful addition, as is the Spa. Worth saving up for, for a very special occasion. ",5,2022,11,04
200,Outstanding!,"One of the nicest hotels I have ever experienced. The staff was so welcoming and very accommodating. Accommodations were outstanding. Customer service a 10.

The hotel is managed with a very professional yet caring attitude with common sense as well.
My wife and I look forward to returning to the Merrion again. ",5,2022,11,04
200,Charming hotel with excellent service,The hotel staff is amazing. We ate and drank at all the restaurants and bars in the hotel and all were superb. Do ask the bellmen for a headset and go on the self-guided art tour. The Merrion has the largest private art collection in all of Ireland. Will definitely stay here next time in Ireland.,5,2022,11,01
200,Wonderful hotel,"A wonderful splurge hotel with excellent service. The staff was very attentive. We enjoyed a lovely and peaceful garden room that overlooked fountains. I loved being able to open the window and get some fresh air and hear the fountain. The bathroom was marble with a tub and felt luxurious as did the evening turn down service. The room was to be for a one night business conference but it was so lovely that we added on addition nights to stay on longer than expected.

The breakfast in the Garden room was also amazing. You can order something from the menu or enjoy the buffet.  They had a nice amount of marked gluten free items which was appreciated. The location is excellent and in walking distance to all we wanted to to. The Cellar Bar is a must for ambiance and delicious food. And lots of pubs and restaurants right around the corner.",5,2022,10,31
200,Above and beyond!,"A hotel that goes above and beyond to do the right thing even when it doesn’t make money! We were at the Dublin Marathon today with our 5 month old baby who was being minded by family while we ran. Their fantastic doorman (Brian) and other staff invited us in to change her and to stay in the warm as long as we wished. Sadly some of their other counterparts did not see the mileage in being kind for the sake of it! 

Thank you so much!",5,2022,10,30
200,Excellent and Perfect Dublin Hotel,"Excellent Hotel!  
I rarely give anything 5 stars because rarely is any one place absolutely perfect.  the Merrion Hotel in Dublin IS five star perfect.  The hotel is beautiful, perfectly located and the rooms are exquisite.  Every staff member was friendly and helpful.  The restaurant offerings in the hotel were terrific.  The hotel is a complication of 4 historic row homes so each area has a lot of character.  The Cellar Bar in the basement is really cool.  The Irish breakfasts in the Garden Room were fantastic.   All of this was in the perfect location - an easy walk to everything yet nice and quiet.  Don’t hesitate to stay here - you’ll love it.  We will be back!!!",5,2022,10,28
200,First Rate Accommodations and Service,"We stayed at the Merrion recently for a brief holiday as a couple and everything was fantastic.  Our room (a deluxe king in the main house) was spacious, beautifully appointed, clean, and very comfortable.  Everything was very luxurious.  

The location was perfect for us (although I will say that if want to be in the heart of all the shops and restaurants by St. Stephen's Green, there are closer options).  

Most of all, the staff was top notch, with everyone being cheerful, knowledgeable, and eager to assist.

We didn't find an opportunity to dine there, so I can't speak to the food.  However, we did find ourselves in No. 23 for a nightcap each night, and the selection and service was wonderful.

Only negatives:  I'm not sure if it was the floors or the guests above us, but it got a bit noisy each morning for 30 minutes or so.  Also, my wife would have appreciated an outlet in the bathroom.  

Clearly, this hotel is not in the ""value"" category, but I felt that the price was very fair.  Bottom line, when we return to Dublin, we will be staying at the Merrion without even looking at other hotels.",5,2022,10,28
200,A first class hotel near parks and museums ,This is a first class full service hotel.  My room was elegant and spacious.  This is a hotel that was created in a historic row of houses whose exteriors remain so don’t expect high rise hotel views from any of the rooms. It is located within easy walking distance of several museums of importance as well as two parks.  It very conveniently as a pull-in lane from the street for cars to use to pick up and discharge passengers.  It is a quiet and refined hotel with full services.  ,5,2022,10,28
200,You get what you pay for,"It costs. Breakfast is @ 30 per person. With that being said, this place is worth it. There is a prominent collection of Irish Impressionists of museum quality throughout the hotel. The Cellar Bar is terrifically staffed and a warm and inviting place. The service on arrival and departure is unrivaled. A scrumptious breakfast is served with sterling silver platings and coffee pots. Treat yourself.",5,2022,10,28
200,Lovely hotel in the heard of Dublin,"This hotel is very well located and the service and facilities are reminiscent of a more gracious bygone era.

200,A class act. ,"One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in, anywhere. Lovely, friendly, fully-stocked. A relaxing home away from home.

200,Great experience.,"Had the most wonderful experience in the Garden Room Restaurant in the Merrion Hotel. The food was very tasty indeed, the service was excellent. They gave me plenty of time between courses too. Had never been before but would absolutely go again. It is quite expensive but you are after all dining in one of the most beautiful hotels in Dublin too. It is a great place for a treat, go there you will not be disappointed.",5,2022,10,22
200,Simply the Best!,"Just simply one of the most outstanding hotels we have ever stayed in. A true 5 star where service, professional staff, amenities, decor, and every aspect of the hotel screams it’s the finest around. Having stayed at many similar hotels all across Europe, the Merrion is head and shoulders above them all.",5,2022,10,20
200,"Awesome staff, great location, disappointing rooms","I’m giving 1 -2 stars for the room and 5 for the staff. The room was a bit tired and worn and disappointing. The hotel itself is nice and in a great location but we didn’t feel our room was up to standard we expected.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and even made us a “take away” lunch on our way out which we really appreciated. Summary: awesome staff, great location, disappointing rooms.",3,2022,10,17
200,Home away from home with a touch of luxury!,"Exceptional service and experience as always at The Merrion. 
Fabulous food and drinks and the warm friendly atmosphere that the staff create make it a home away from home feeling, with a touch of luxury. 
The attention to detail was second to none, they even added a Merrion bookmark to my book during the turndown service! Very thoughtful and appreciated! Will definitely be back. ",5,2022,10,17
200,Great hotel,"Just a class one great hotel.  Both the breakfast buffet and menus in the Garden Room and The Cellar offered a good variety of food.  The staff was warm, attentive and have a great sense of humour.  Our rooms overlooked the inner courtyard and provided lovely views of the gardens.  It is easy to walk from here to a number of Dublin sites, including St. Stephen's Green, the shopping area beyond that, and the National Library and Museum to name a few.  We will definitely visit again, next time we are in Dublin.  ",5,2022,10,12
200,A wonderful stay.,Fantastic!  Wonderful hotel.  Staff are attentive and lovely.  From the moment we arrived from our long overnight flight we were helped to feel comfortable and welcome.  Shout out to Fiona in the Garden Terrace - she greeted us every morning with warmth and humor. The rooms were pristine and the facility was kept incredibly clean and tidy.  I would highly recommend.,5,2022,10,10
200,Great staff!,"Great location and the best staff I have experienced. The doorman, check-in, wait staff at restaurants were all very professional and  incredibly friendly. The concierge efficiently took care of shipping my golf clubs home.
Breakfast was exceptional, looked forward to it each morning. The rooms/shower are a bit underwhelming for the quality of the rest of the experience, the bar is quite small and stuffy.",5,2022,10,10
200,A real curate's egg of an hotel,"It actually proved quite tricky to decide what hotel to stay at in Dublin, so as a Leaders Club member and taking some solace in the number 1 Tripadvisor rating we decided to go with The Merrion.

We'd asked the hotel prior to arrival if they'd be able to accommodate an early check-in, so when we arrived around lunchtime it was great that they'd got the room ready in time and also given us a multiple category upgrade at the same time. So far, so good. Sadly, it pretty much went off a cliff from there...

Bizarrely, despite this being our first stay here, no one offered to give us a brief tour of the property or personally show us to our room.

Whilst the room was an upgrade to their junior suite category in the main - historic - building, it was incredibly disappointing. There was no lobby inside the room, and with a thin, Georgian door between the bedroom and the corridor, one could hear absolutely everything anytime someone walked past. During the day, one can shrug this off, although for a room costing approaching EUR 1,000 a night (if one had booked this category), is this really an acceptable state of affairs?

The other major issue with the room was the HVAC. It comprised an old fashioned unit that had an extremely loud fan noise - think jet engine volumes - so if you wanted heating or cooling you had to put up with the most awful fan noise. In this day and age, this is hardly acceptable and simply underscores the lack of proper investment in a property driven by complacent - or simply old fashioned and out of date - management.

The decor in the room itself was unremarkable and was a blend of both the more modern e.g. the fitted wardrobe interiors were a relatively new addition, and the mid 1990s. The fabric of the curtains had been damaged by the sun so was an off-putting cream/brown blotchy mess in places whereas the same fabric on the pelmet, headboard and valence was unbleached. The combination is again not what one would expect in a top hotel. The ceiling height was very impressive and gave the room very grand proportions, sadly no one had bothered to find paintings that fitted with the space, so some tiny prints graced the wall and quite frankly looked ridiculous.

The bathroom was another 1990s relic and bizarrely had a bidet - this is Ireland not Italy - that had been placed so close to the bathtub that one would have struggled to use it anyway. Why wouldn't you have forsaken the bidet for twin vanities?

The housekeeping was superb, with great attention to detail, even sorting out the mess of my cables with cable tapes when they came to service the room. The bed and quality of linens was excellent too. Although even that didn't aid my slumber when we were woken at 2.30am by our neighbours returning to their room. They weren't particularly loud, but as previously mentioned, the entrance door was so thin - and even slightly warped with great chunks of light visible around its frame where it didn't sit flush - you could hear everything. To further pour fuel on the flames of discontent, guests were smoking - and talking - at 4am just below our bathroom window. No staff had had the foresight to ask them to refrain from disturbing other guests.

The swimming pool and spa area continue the 1990s relic theme and just feel laughably out of date compared to what one expects from the best hotels these days.

The best thing about our stay was the breakfast. The service was attentive and friendly and the focus on local, high quality artisan produce was truly impressive. This was without question the single best thing about our stay here, it was a shame that the accommodation wasn't even half as good at this!

The other great thing about this property is the art collection which is truly world class and greatly adds to one's enjoyment of the public areas.

All in all, for around EUR 600 a night this hotel is a joke, and after a night with just a few hours' sleep, we had a sense of humour failure. I know that Dublin is not a cheap city, but we would have had a better night's sleep and a whole lot less aggravation at a budget property! This is the sort of hotel where guests have been returning for 20 years, and never complain. It is a bit like when one has lived in their home for a decade or two, you can almost guarantee that their home needs a refurb, yet most people would sooner move than endure the upheaval of such an exercise. Indeed, the point moreso is that people don't necessarily notice what is falling down around them as they are familiar with their surroundings, and that is exactly what has happened here. The average age of the guests is a lot higher than I would have expected, and that probably has had a considerable bearing on the management's inertia to exert change.

Whenever we stay at a truly great hotel, one that could be described as ""as good as it gets"" (at least in many aspects, as nowhere can ever be perfect), it is always interesting to speak to the top level management, and invariably they are always similar characters. Typically, they are individuals who never rest of their laurels, and are always questioning things, looking at how to improve them. They do not think that because something is working well it will always work well. They do not wait for cracks to appear before papering over them, they are replastering long before even the smallest of hairline fissures emerge. It is this sort of ethos that this property is severely lacking. As a guest here it feels like the management for the most part are very much the old school ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" brigade.

If you're a returning guest, you may well overlook all of the annoyances and encumbrances that are part and parcel of this hotel. If you are staying here for the first time, and have the benefit of having stayed at hotels that have adapted to the 21st century, outside of the UK and Ireland, then this property's shortcomings are only too apparent and myriad. Charm alone is not enough to make up for these.

If this property wants to be the best in Dublin, in the 21st century, then in short, it needs an overhaul in pretty much all areas, with all rooms and bathrooms requiring a full refurbishment - a lick of paint here and there is not going to cut it. Of course it is hard to make the decision to radically overhaul the property as doubtless it is very busy, and given the rates it charges, very financially successful too, so in that sense it ain't broke, so why fix it? Although if every hotel applied this logic, it would never change, so someone needs to take a bold decision at some point, take The Ritz Paris which is now infinitely better after a major refurbishment.

I suspect things won't change here for a very long time, as their clientele is the perfect combination of being undemanding and happy to part with their money for relatively little in return. If the hotel was say half the price, then one can begin to overlook its flaws, but like everything in life, if you're going to charge top dollar then the hurdle for success must be commensurately higher. Judging from the overwhelmingly positive Tripadvisor reviews, clearly guests who expect the best - in a contemporary rather than mid 90s sense - aren't their target audience.

For the sake of full disclosure, the guest relations director - who is new at this property and given his background and approach is an invaluable asset to them - did make a modest concession on my bill for the inconvenience that we experienced.",2,2022,10,08
200,Terrific Hotel in a great Dublin location,"The hotel is a top tier hotel with responsive service, great food, and a terrific central Dublin location. The courtyard garden is an oasis. The rooms have every amenity. The concierge helped me plan a complicated full day private tour, which local tour companies could not organize. The staff are great and very professional",5,2022,10,02
200,Exceeded our expectations,"First class hotel, and service.  The restaurant and bar were excellent.  The location is good as well.  The service is first class and everyone we came in contact with were totally committed to our needs.",5,2022,09,25
200,Fabulous!,"We spent only one night at the Merrion but it was a fantastic stay! The staff at the hotel could not have been nicer! The place is beautiful, immaculate, and comfortable. The room was quiet and perfect. 
Our room was not ready upon arrival so they held our bags and placed them in our room before we returned back to the hotel later that afternoon. In the interim, we asked about nearby coffee and they recommended Viola, right around the corner. Great choice. 
Breakfast was served starting at 7:00 am which made it easy to get our day going early. The Merrion is also walking distance from many interesting sights.",5,2022,09,24
200,Exceptional Service in a Lovely Hotel,"Exceptional hotel experience in every way! Lovely appointed room, outstanding staff experience, exceptional concierge staff.  Such a memorable trip to Dublin.  Highly recommend especially if your first visit as the entire staff was supportive and insightful.  Hope to return one day",5,2022,09,17
200,World Class Hotel,This is by far one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The staff is the finest collection of hotel employees I have ever come across. Derek at concierge booked us at the most incredible restaurants and his knowledge of the city is second to none. What an incredible stay.,5,2022,09,16
200,Weekend away in The Merrion.,"This is a Wonderful hotel , so luxurious, comfortable,spotless,staff superb,food superb,room so comfortable, everything is looked after by the wonderful staff,  a real treat away, cannot fault this wonderful hotel.Lovely open fires in the drawing room to relax and have lunch when you arrive.",5,2022,09,14
200,Best hotel in the world,"We stayed the first night at the FitzWilliam because our travel agent screwed up and the merrion was full. When we switched it was like entering the gates to heaven. The place is perfect- gorgeous large rooms; fabulous classy decor with cool art; quiet, even though it was full; brilliant restaurant for dinner ( we ate in the Garden as the Michelin restaurant is closed on sundays). The Merrion is heaven. Go there. Pay whatever - you’ll be happy.",5,2022,09,14
200,Exquisite Stay in Dublin,"We had three nights in Dublin and we wanted them to be perfect.  A friend recommended The Merrion Hotel and it did not disappoint.  The location is near the Trinity College Dublin campus (the reason for our visit was to return our daughter to school), the National Gallery, Stephen's Green, and loads of restaurants and shops.  But even though all of these important sites were nearby, I would have been happy spending my days at all of the gorgeous rooms, facilities (pool, spa, and gym) and restaurants that the Merrion Hotel has to offer.",5,2022,09,12
200,Lovely in every way,"Everything about The Merrion Hotel is top notch - the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are luxurious and the beds are beyond comfy. Love the Asprey amenities too. We stayed 4 nights, it’s so easy to walk everywhere from Merrion Square. Very special place!",5,2022,09,10
200,Luxury stay,Very special experience…. Wonderful staff and a culinary master class - looking forward to returning. The pool is super … the spa looks very appealing but I didn’t visit to qualify that. If you are visiting Dublin - this hotel should be first on u to our list !!,5,2022,09,07
200,Best in class,"From location to facilities, staff and class - this has everything. Had a room overlooking the internal courtyard so nice and quiet and superbly fitted out. Great service in all areas of the hotel and very friendly and professional staff. Breakfast was a delight. Have stayed at a number of Dublin hotels and this is the best so far.",5,2022,09,07
200,Superior 5 Star Hotel in Dublin,"This was our first trip to Dublin and we selected The Merrion Hotel. From when we arrived, the staff all greeted us with a smile and provided the highest quality in service. They went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was great. They provided helpful information about the hotel and area. This hotel is very close to many sites within walking distance from the hotel. Dublin is an amazing city and staying at The Merrion Hotel made the trip much more enjoyable. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel!",5,2022,09,06
200,Perfection at the Merrion,"The Merrion is simply one of the best hotels in the world, not just in Dublin.  Staff is extremely kind, courteous and helpful; the hotel is lovely, rooms perfectly designed, and the restaurant we ate in was excellent (it was breakfast but still the best French Toast I’ve ever had.). Well done!",5,2022,09,01
200,Classical 5 stars in the heart of Dublin,"We have stayed in all of Dublin's Five Stars hotel over the years and decided to stay the Merrion last December. We had a lovely stay and particularly appreciated the beauty of the front rooms, originally townhouses, the courtyard and the size of the room.

The room was comfortable and appointed as can be expected from a hotel of that category.  Its decor, even though pristine, looked a bit dated or possibly just a bit too traditional and feminine for our taste.

We had a very pleasant dinner in their dining room and cocktails in the drawing room and in the bar.

All in all, a very nice stay at The Merrion.",5,2022,08,31
200,Beautiful hotel with excellent customer service,"Very well located in the city centre next to a host of amenities.  Very strong on customer service in both the hotel and restaurant areas.  Great food options also - with a lovely outside terrace to the rear on the rare sunny days in Dublin.  Afternoon tea is also a lovely treat, though it is pricey.  Tea is served in silver pots which is a lovely idea but practically not great as burns when pouring or you have to wrap a coaster or piece of paper around the handle.  A simple thing but does impact on the actual enjoyment!  Overall this is a great hotel and highly recommended.",5,2022,08,29
200,"Service, Beauty, and Staff !","My husband and I stayed 4 nights at the Merrion during our 15 day trip to Ireland. The place is stunning. The rooms ( we stayed in the older, original building ) the view of the Prime Minister’s  Offices, the gardens and patios, the Spa and pool , and our favorite , the Drawing Room, were beautiful !
Beauty is as beauty does and the true jewels of the Merrion are its staff. Bernie at the front desk, took us under her wing knowing that it was our first trip to Ireland .She helped us find a pharmacy, stored our luggage safely , and tirelessly answered our questions with warm graciousness. Tommy, the doorman got us cabs whenever we needed one and recommended the Epic Museum. I was able to enter my great grandpa’s name and birth , a famine orphan who emigrated to the U.S.A. 
Fiona the manager of the restaurant attached to the patio and gardens made sure we had a good meal and made us feel at home .
The daily maids and waiters and waitresses were all polite and immaculate EVERY DAY consistently !
The dry cleaning and laundry service was daily and enabled us to pack lighter for such a long trip ! 
It is obvious that this is a well managed hotel that provides thoroughness and excellent follow up in its care of its guests. You cannot do better in Dublin !",5,2022,08,28
200,Superb hotel,"Luxury accommodations, gracious staff, gourmet food/drink and beautiful artwork who could ask for anything more? The location is perfect to access by short walk the best of DUblin’s shopping, restaurants and walk in Stephen’s green.",5,2022,08,28
200,Arts in Dublin,"We had a great experience in Dublin at the Merrion. The personnel was very attentive to our requests. The hotel is very nice, in a very good location on Merrion square next to the national gallery and has a great art collection. You can ask the considrge an audioguide to learn about it.",5,2022,08,28
200,Wonderful Five Star Hotel - Top Choice for Dublin,"We truly enjoyed every aspect of our weekend stay at the Merrion.   Front to back and top to bottom, all of the staff were friendly, accommodating and welcoming.   The facilities are excellent and I'd highly recommend a visit or two to the Cellar Bar.  It's an extraordinarily comfortable place for drink whether you're in a small or large group.  Also, a trip to Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is highly recommended - a true Michelin Star experience - sperate reservations needed.   This should be your top hotel choice for Dublin, and the pricing is fairly reasonable for a true 5 star hotel.",5,2022,08,25
200,Wonderful experience,"The hotel was very nice, clean, and well maintained.  The staff were excellent in making it a memorable stay.  The staff took over upon arrival and handled all our luggage, parked the car, and made check in so easy.  After an exhausting travel day, this was so helpful.  Food in the restaurant was fresh and well made.",5,2022,08,25
200,How to run a five star hotel,"As Mary Poppins said, this hotel is ""practically perfect in every way.""  The service was impeccable, the food was outstanding, and the location is great.  Recommendations for restaurants and things to see and do were great.  We loved sitting in the parlors and enjoying drinks and snack food.  

While I thought the breakfast was great as was the service, at 30 Euros a person, and being the type that is frugal and I prefer eating very little for breakfast, I would pass on eating at the hotel and try exploring outside the hotel.",5,2022,08,22
200,Gem in Dublin,"If i could give this hotel more stars I would.  The service started weeks before we even arrived.  The concierge helped me plan our 3 day stay in Dublin down to the smallest detail.  They arranged a wonderful walking tour of Dublin and gave us great dining recommendations.  The staff  was wonderful, the room was divine and the food was amazing.  Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely return next time we are in Dublin.",5,2022,08,17
200,Dublin experiance,"Best staff, location and amenities in Dublin .
From the doorman to the cleaning staff.
The best experience to have  of Irish hospitality. 
Staff could not be more attentive to all our needs. And helped me set up a family gathering with relatives.",5,2022,08,15
200,Perfection,"We got married here and everything from the staff to the food exceeded our expectations.   

I cannot thank the staff enough and the rooms are spectacular!!!!!!  

We will definitely be back!!!!   

Thanks to everyone involved.",5,2022,08,12
200,Would give this hotel 6 stars if I could,"Fabulous, quiet, charmingly old-school hotel. The staff and service was really outstanding. It has a non-descript exterior which makes it feel very private and quiet. There is a lovely courtyard in the middle of the hotel wings which you cannot see from the outside. Gym facility is good; pool lovely; great tucked away bar. This was our first stay and we were so pleased to have stayed there. It's probably the best service we've had at any five-star hotel. 
The location is about one block away from where it starts to feel busy so it has a quieter feel but you're right in the middle of everything - highly walkable area.",5,2022,08,12
200,A nice stay in the city centre ,"We stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon. The room was luxurious with fabulous towels/sheets and the staff were very pleasant. They even left a bottle of prosecco in the room. The breakfast was excellent and the lunch on the terrace was fine. 

It's something minor but no one said congratulations or addressed us by our names. Lastly when we woke up on morning of departure the bill was posted under the door which I wouldn't have expected from such a reputable hotel. 

All in all a nice stay. ",4,2022,08,10
200,Absolute perfection - 10/10,"The Merrion is an absolute dream of a hotel.  The service from the staff is amongst the finest in the hotel business.  From the moment you arrive to departure, there is no request too small to fill.  A history lover's dream, the Duke of Wellington was born in the property and the art collection is exquisite.  The public rooms were made for tea and the No. 23 bar is the perfect place to relax with a cocktail (the house special cocktails and ice tea were excellent).  They key to service is to make it look easy and the staff at the Merrion has that perfected.  

The rooms are lovely and relaxing - converters are provided, cords are wrapped with Merrion velcro to stay tangle free by housekeeping and the day before departure ziplock quart bags are provided for toiletries.  

We had to leave early for a flight and the team kindly put together to go boxes.  However, we were bummed to miss out on breakfast for day 2 and quite possible the best French toast ever.  

The Merrion is truly a world class hotel with an exquisitely trained staff - it is the perfect location for your Dublin base.",5,2022,08,06
200,Great Choice in Dublin,"We stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights in July, and we loved it.  It's reasonably priced, in a great location in Dublin with wonderful service.  The bed and room was very comfortable. Don't miss going to O'Donahue's pub which is a hundred yards away for great music and company.",5,2022,08,06
200,Perfect in Every Way!,"We stayed at the Merrion for three nights in July and were greeted very pleasantly by everyone upon our late morning arrival.  While waiting for our room, we had coffee outside in the courtyard.  Our superior, king accommodation was nicely appointed and overlooked the garden that was lovely.  The bathroom was very spacious with double sinks and separate bath and shower.

The buffet and menu breakfast, that was in the Garden Room restaurant, offered many choices.  We, also, had dinner there two nights and the selections were excellent.  The service and staff were what you would expect at a property of this level.

The location was in walking distance of many major attractions and I would not hesitate to recommend or stay at the Merrion on any future visit to Dublin.",5,2022,08,02
200,Lovely Hotel-Rooms Need Updating,"We stayed here for the first three nights we were in Dublin. I trust Tripadvisors' reviews and therefore booked the Merrion.
We endured quite a few problems upon an attempted check-in. I do understand that rooms may not be ready at 12:30. After talking to the woman at reservations, who kept giving us different times for possible room availability- 1 p.m., 1:30 p.m., 2. 2:30, we, as the last of the visitors awaiting checkin received our keys 3:30.
A guideline for training of staff-teach your employees not to assume check in times. Giving guests false hope and trying to please them is unprofessional.  When in doubt, ask  your manager for help.
I do not expect to receive service like this from one of the ""Leading Hotels of the World"".
When we saw our room, we were underwhelmed. Our view was of a brick wall.
The room itself is in desperate need of refurbishment and renovation.
You charge way too much to provide such a dated ambiance.
Yes, the area is great. Yes the garden is stunning. Yes the lounge for afternoon tea is beautiful.
Yes the bar is quaint. However, I had to send my Bloody Mary back twice, as the bartender didn't know how to make one.
To their credit, the manager on duty did provide us wit complimentary breakfasts because of the difficulties we experienced upon check in.
Dublin is a very expensive city. Hotels needs to pull up their socks and provide a much more current and professional experience to warrant such extreme pricing.",3,2022,07,29
200,Exactly what I was expecting,"We enjoyed our one night visit here. Yes, the prices are high, but for the price I expected a nice hotel with good service and this is exactly what I got. From the moment you arrive, your baggage is whisked away and checking in was easy. Our room wasn’t ready yet and we were told they would call when it was (they did call later). 

Once we came back later, we were walked to our room and someone showed us a few things about the room. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean. Our room was the most basic category, but was nice and had a bathtub. No view, but the location is quiet and fairly central without it being right in the middle of chaos. The bed was very comfortable.",5,2022,07,28
200,The beautiful Merrion Hotel,"I stayed in the Merrion Hotel with two friends. What can I say,  as it was so perfect. The staff, the beautiful rooms, the food and garden are simply perfect. I mistakenly thought I lost something in my room and all of the  staff were beyond kind and helpful particularly the manager Fiachra. We are planning our next trip already.",5,2022,07,28
200,Another faultless stay,"How many times can you review one hotel?! The key to excellence in hospitality is consistency without complacency and the Merrion has achieved this perfectly over the 20 years that we have been staying at our “home away from home”. As always, service is world class, personal yet not intrusive. We love everything about this hotel.",5,2022,07,24
200,10 stars !!!,"We live in Malta and travel extensively but I wanted to celebrate our daughter's upcoming wedding by staying in a fab hotel with my two daughters for a girlie weekend.

From the initial calls and emails, the service was out of this world. Literally could not fault it. Replies within a short space of time. They also arranged for a display of balloons to be in my daughter's room. 

We booked two rooms, one twin room (290) and a king (280). Both were exquisite, beautiful pale tones and the attention to detail was as you would expect.

Bathrooms were fabulous and the bed linen to die for. We booked afternoon tea on the first day and it was delicious......champagne was delightful and the whole two hours was so relaxing. We went and used the pool before our dinner in the Garden Room. Again the food was superb, when our daughter was not sure about the Rose wine, she was allowed to taste a little to be sure....this is 5 star service....

Breakfast was delicious too and the Spa treatments I arranged for my girls were both excellent.

We travel a huge amount, Singapore, London, Maldives, Malta, France and I have to say that this hotel nails it....service is friendly but very professional, unlike in other hotels, there are lots of staff to help you....they also remember your name which I love.

Thank you for a wonderful stay and we will be back again.",5,2022,07,24
200,Mr Spencer,We had a fantastic time at the Merrion. Very interesting art on the walls! Great pool and spa area. Extremely attentive and friendly staff. Immaculate rooms. Excellent food. The hotel is very well located also.,5,2022,07,21
200,"Centrally located, very nice expensive hotel","A very good room, decent shower, real air conditioning and superb service for a hotel that is within walking distance of Trinity College, across the street from Parliament and has a lovely wine cellar bar that shouldn’t be missed. Recommended",4,2022,07,17
200,Excellent city hotel with sophisticated vibe,"This property is not exactly in the center of the city but in a way that is good because the city center is more seedy and this is a nicer neighborhood. The entrance to the hotel is very discreet; you wouldn't know the hotel was there unless you looked really carefully. The street around the back of the hotel (Lower Baggott Street) has very good eateries for a more sophisticated palate and the Pearl Brasserie next door is an excellent place to eat dinner off property. That street is good for lunch (ie: Voila) and for takeaway for the plane ride. We had a junior suite for a night followed by a specialty suite. Both were very spacious; the junior suite was perfectly good. The bathrooms in both cases were very good; toilets here are not behind a separate door and the suite only had one bathroom. The air conditioning in the living room of the suite 392 was poor; it put out hot air even after we asked for repair. I asked for bedsheets instead of the huge duvet they put on the bed; I asked do the Irish actually sleep like this and they said No Way. So why should I?
Our junior suite faced the inner courtyard which is pretty and the suite faced the parliament building, which is impressive to see from your window several stories above ground. You know you are definitely in Dublin when you look outside.
The gym is small but adequate (it needs a full-size foam roller) and the pool is excellent; the hotel also has a spinning machine in the locker room to dry bathing suits. There is a spa; book massages in advance to avoid disappointment. The steam room was not working for all 3 days I was there, even after they said it had been repaired.
The hotel's Garden Restaurant is excellent both for dinner and breakfast. Simon the pastry chef makes great breads and breakfast pastries --- better than usual even for a top hotel. He's great with apricots! The hotel has an extensive private art collection and they will give you a catalogue of the art as well as a book telling the history of the hotel on demand. Irish Times and Financial Times newspapers in print are also available, which is a very nice amenity still to exist here.
Elevator service is very good; there is only 4 landings and 2 elevators per building so I never had to wait. 
Concierge service was very good and the staff at front desk and throughout the hotel was friendly. Service was prompt and cheerful but never stuffy although I had this feeling the extremely hard-working concierge tolerated us more than he liked us. (Maybe he needs a break.) Prices offered good value for money both on room and with food, especially if you book in advance.
This hotel is a good choice if you don't mind the 10 minute walk into town and if you would rather be in a quiet and sophisticated place. The menus at this hotel were better rounded than the Shelbourne, for example. Only thing I was not thrilled with was the air conditioning situation in the rooms and lack of certain amenities in the wellness area.",5,2022,07,14
200,An incredible hotel,"This hotel is fabulous. The staff is lovely, the food is great, the rooms are spacious and comfortable and well appointed. The linens are plush. It is situated perfectly in the city.  There is art work through out. It is elegant. I wish they had hotels in other cities. It is amongst the nicest hotels I have ever visited.",5,2022,07,13
200,Superb Hotel - ticks all the boxes,"Very well deserving member of Leading Hotels of the World. Spotlessly clean, attentive service, great room & bed, lovely swimming pool and some lovely gardens.

Terrific location too. Underground secured parking with EV chargers available.

As the title says, it ticks all the boxes",5,2022,07,10
200,"Perfect location, elegant boutique style hotel","We had an amazing stay at The Merrion Hotel.  This is a world class elegant boutique style establishment with superb accommodations, an excellent staff and wonderful ambiance.  The location is perfect - close to all the major attractions of this historic city.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in the world and The Merrion is up there at the top!",5,2022,07,09
200,Family Birthday Celebration,The purpose of our visit from London was to celebrate an 80th Birthday. Our ages ranged from 83 down to a to 1 year old. All ages were perfectly accommodated in every respect. The Service in all parts of The Merrion was exceptional and the Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A wonderful advertisement for Dublin and Ireland.,5,2022,07,08
200,The Merrion ruined me for all other hotel experiences,"My stay at the Merrion was impeccably good. I loved everything  - my room (annex room overlooking the garden), the food, the bars & restaurants, and the staff. It is expensive but worth it. The pool is gorgeous.",5,2022,07,07
200,Afternoon tea at The Merrion,"We had afternoon tea at The Merrion as one of their Art Teas. 

The staff were welcoming and efficient, with Viktoria (I think) looking after us. We opted for the vegan afternoon tea which was ok. The beetroot bun was a highlight and having coconut cream for the scones was a nice touch. 

Although it seems tricky, we’d requested a low sugar option and they tried by offering some vegan pastries but the chefs have said it’s impossible to do an afternoon tea without sugar, so we appreciated their efforts. 

All guests are given a guide to their artworks to take away and any spare cakes are boxed to take away. Overall it was a nice experience.",4,2022,07,07
200,Lovely hotel,"Me and my family have been coming here for years now as it is the best hotel in Dublin.Classic , good food ,nice staff ,clean and comfy.
Patrick the doorman makes the stay extra special , alway welcoming with a warm smile and hug.
The garden is also lovely to stroll around on sunny days.
However if I was to complain about anything is that whenever we are there management is never around and only ever appear when a celebrity or someone important is staying, which is disappointing as we have been coming here for over ten years.",4,2022,07,05
200,Merrion Hotel.,"We stayed at the Merrion recently, and had a first class stay. Staff excellent, food and service was brilliant. We will definitely be back. Highly recommended. The hotel is is in a excellent location for exploring Dublin.",5,2022,07,05
200,Calm in the city,Excellent hotel staff very friendly and attentive. Very relaxing and calm atmosphere. Excellent breakfast. Rooms a little tired especially bathroom which need upgrading otherwise excellent hotel will be back.,4,2022,07,05
200,Great Place to stay in Dublin,You could not ask for a better hotel in Dublin.  The staff is wonderful and you are right next to St. Stephen's Green.  Numerous wonderful restaurants are within walking distance and eating at the hotel is a wonderful experience.,5,2022,07,02
200,Beautiful hotel The Merrion Dublin,"What can I say about this hotel it is just beautiful & the attention to detail is just 100% . The staff are just so helpful & friendly & the food is just amazing. 
Thank you for the lovely memories I took away with me . 
A very happy guest",5,2022,07,02
200,"Beautiful hotel, great location","The Merrion is a beautiful hotel in a quiet but perfect location. Breakfast was excellent, with lots of choice, including gorgeous smoked salmon, and very helpful staff. The weather was kind enough to enable us to eat on the terrace.
Our bedroom was very comfortable, with a super king bed and lots of space.
Most of the staff were very helpful and pleasant, including Ciara the concierge, Bernie, the front desk manager and Nicolette on reception.
Sadly our luggage was lost on the flight to Dublin but Merrion staff were very kind in helping us, unfortunately to no avail.
Highly recommended top class hotel.",5,2022,06,25
200,Best of the best in Dublin Center,"Excellent service and one of the best housekeeping services I have come across with immaculately clean and well serviced room with exceptional linen and appointments. Breakfast is delightful with the large and bright environment and exceptional service with a smile alongside quality of both a la carte and buffet. Stay here about 6 to 8 times a year and just had not taken the time to write. One morning on a recent  stay I wanted a room service breakfast at an unearthly time to catch an early flight and all was delivered. It definitely feels like a home away from home and the quality of the room does allow me to work pleasantly from my room. The gym, sauna and wellness facilities are great but an extra elyptical could help as was difficult to exercise as the one available.was too popular. Would compliment the staff for quality service and the same with a smile. One small but important comment for improvement is around lunchtime snacks. For some reason am always directed to the bar or restaurant for lunch but the living room area seems to be for tea only and being a non- drinker would prefer to eat in the living room area rather than the bar. Love the little ties  for the electrical wires for my equipment and a nice touch as is the Merrion travel bag for liquids at each stay. It is this attention to detail and service that continues to bring me back.",5,2022,06,25
200,Short City Break,Another wonderful experience at the Merrion Hotel. This is what 5 star should be. Stayed for two nights in a room that had everything anyone could need. Service of staff from the front door to room staff and Garden room was beyond outstanding. Dinner in the restraunt was AMAZING and breakfasts were a delight.  We choose this hotel above all else as the best 5 star hotel on all of our travels. We finished off with amazing top to toe treatments in the Spa. Quite simply it doesnt get any better. Well done everyone. We cant wait for our next visit.,5,2022,06,13
200,We'll be back,"Truly a restful visit with an amazing bed and linens! I didn't want to get out and see the world or visit my friends. The service and staff is excellent.  

My one disappointment was not appreciating the scones at afternoon tea.  My Irish friends and I had a debate about whether crusty scones or doughy scones are better.  Unfortunately the Merrion's receipe was not in our winning column.",5,2022,06,12
200,My Favorite Hotel in the World,"Everything about the Merrion is spectacular: convenient location, high quality rooms with lush linens and roomy bathrooms, superior service from the staff from the bellhops, to the restaurant, bar, spa and hotel staff.  After a red eye flight from the States, we visited the spa for a lavender-infused steam bath and rejuvenating shower.   Those few treats erased jet fatigue and allowed us to enjoy a full day exploring Dublin. The pool is lovely. We enjoyed lunch in the garden space, dinner in the tavern (the Garden Room Restaurant was closed for a wedding) and breakfast.  Service, food offering and quality of food was excellent.   With its inner courtyard garden, magnificent art collection and beautifully designed public spaces, this hotel is a modern day version of the Isabella Steward Gardner museum in Boston.  A very special haven.",5,2022,06,12
200,The Merrion is a very special silent aven n Central Dublin,"Simply the best hotel anywhere & anyhow!.. Location,, history, staff and service are priceless. No 23, Celar Bat,   Garden Restaurant & pool are exquisite. To Jennifer & Sophie, thanks for putting up with me.. A very memorable stay that for sure won't be my last.....x",5,2022,06,11
200,Exccellent hotel on two visits,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel twice during our May 2022 visit to Ireland, first for several days after arrival, then again for a final night before returning to New York.   Both stays were excellent.  The staff was wonderful and helpful.  The breakfast, afternoon tea and evening bar facilities were lovely.  Our flight over our first night from JFK was canceled for mechanical problems, forcing us to fly the next night.  The hotel knew of the cancelation before our arrival and comped the charge for our missed first night without our even needing to ask.   We found our high opinion of the hotel to be shared by a prominent actress next to whom we were seated at breakfast one morning and who told us the Merrion is only hotel at which she stays when visiting Dublin.  A lovely hotel that we would also make the only hotel at which we stay when we return to Dublin on future trips.",5,2022,06,09
200,Work trip,"The hotel is an excellent and lovely spot, with easy access to central Dublin. The staff are fantastic and very welcoming. Once inside, you are in a little oasis with great areas to sit and have meetings or eat and drink.",5,2022,06,09
200,One of the finested hotels I have stayed at.,"Everyone one the staff was terrific. Everything from arrival, check-in, restaurant, luggage handling,  concierge to departure  was superior. Very apparent the staff enjoyed  their job proud of the facility.Good central location. Full Irish breakfast was outstanding. .
Will definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to friends an business associates.",5,2022,06,09
200,Great welcome and charming staff,"Ideally located, great art collection, helpful staff, quiet.  We stayed over a weekend  in the more modern garden rooms.  Would be interested in trying the rooms in the main house, which may be less quiet.",5,2022,06,08
200,Better than the Shelbourne,"I have stayed at the Shelbourne twice per year for nearly twenty years.  It was nice with the welcoming fire and residents drawing room.  Those are gone.  The bar is not as friendly as it once was and the price is through the roof.

I tried the Merrion.

I have found my new home in Dublin.  Warm, inviting staff that really appeared to mean it.  Wood/Peet fireplaces in the drawing room with welcoming staff that encouraged me to stay and use my computer.  Rooms were fine and a sense of quiet elegance seemed pervasive.  Being a Leaders Club member my breakfast was included (it used to be included at the Shelbourne before they changed the awards programs).  Needless to say, I enjoyed myself. 

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,06,08
200,Beautiful hotel stay in the heart of Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Merrion for three nights for a family wedding, and had such an enjoyable stay. The staff is exceptionally helpful, the atmosphere in the hotel is very relaxed and the room was incredibly comfortable. We stayed with our 5 month old son and the hotel was so helpful in accommodating him - we requested hot water one evening for a bottle and they even brought ice to the room so we could chill it! Their attention to detail is excellent. Food was fabulous and the breakfasts were delicious. The spa is beautiful also - whilst we didn’t have treatments, we did use the pool and it is a very calming space within the hotel. We had to leave for an early morning flight and they were so helpful with getting us from our room to the airport door. I would definitely recommend the Merrion to anyone looking for a beautiful central Dublin hotel (even with small children)  and hope to stay there again some day!",5,2022,06,08
200,"Beautiful hotel, but the staff are the stars of the show.",The hotel is centrally located and beautifully appointed. The staff are incredibly friendly and go above and beyond. They were able to accommodate some special requests at our friends wedding. The food was fantastic also. I cannot fault any element of our stay.,5,2022,06,06
200,Peerless location/artworks on display/high caliber staff,"We began our week in Ireland here.  Only spent 2 nights before moving on but we regret not staying longer to get to know the property better.  Our guide told us that displayed on the hotel corridors/rooms and public areas was the best private display of art in Ireland.

We had a bed & breakfast package and so thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast offerings onsite.  Our introduction to Irish soda bread still lingers in my memory! There were plenty of options for both cold or hot breakfast items.  Service, as I'd expect in a 5 star hotel, was exemplary.

The rooms were nicely sized with modern bathrooms that you didn't have to squeeze into. 

As for location, well, this is close to EVERYthing worth visiting in Dublin.

This hotel has been at the top of the heap in Dublin for ages:  it deserves to be, in my opinion!",5,2022,06,04
200,Tranquil Atmosphere in the Spa,Fantastic amenities in the spa. Excellent service and highly trained therapists. Thoroughly enjoyed all of my treatments. Would highly recommend a visit to the spa in the Merrion if you’re looking for a pamper day or you are staying in the hotel,5,2022,05,30
200,The Merrion,"A wonderful stay at The Merrion would recommend it to anyone. Right in the heart of Dublin. Quiet luxurious bedroom and great Irish breakfast Staff courteous and polite service impeccable . 
The whole hotel spotlessly clean and absolutely nothing to complain about",5,2022,05,21
200,Reunion with friends,Wonderful stay.  Dnner in The Garden Room was excellent on a glorius summer evening with the doors opened showcasing the gardens. Exceptional service from the time of our arrival to departure from friendly + professional staff. We look forward to our next visit!!,5,2022,05,21
200,perfect stay,"Just WOW, from the welcome by the porters to the reception staff everything was just perfect.
All the staff and there are a lot of them were very friendly and smiling all the time.

We arrived early and the room was not ready, not a major hassle and they stored our bags then we had a lovely club sandwich in the bar an hour later the room was ready – just perfect.
Room its self was well stocked and had a lovely big bed, shower and bath were great.
Would love to return, thanks for making our 2 night stay so good.",5,2022,05,20
200,Absolutely Wonderful,"I had a perfect stay at The Merrion Hotel. It's luxurious without being stuffy. Everything was clean and fresh and beautiful. The bed, bedding and pillows were incredibly comfortable. The service was impeccable and every staff member I encountered was a delight - friendly, accommodating and professional. If I return to Dublin, I will definitely stay at The Merrion (I might return to Dublin JUST to stay at The Merrion).",5,2022,05,18
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"arranged a family night away, only days prior .   All aspects of the booking and stay were superb.   Very professional and friendly staff.  Fab breakfast.  Of course a great location in the heart of the city.  Overall a great experience.",5,2022,05,18
200,Best hotel in the world,"I love this hotel! Beautiful, chic, comfortable and the staff are fabulous - discreet but there when you need them. The breakfast in the room is amazing - as fresh as if just cooked that minute. I cannot say enough good things about the Merrion. I have stayed in fabulous hotels across the globe but this one tops them all.",5,2022,05,17
200,Surprise birthday at The Merrion,"My family and I arranged to surprise my husband in Dublin for his 40th birthday. I worked with the concierge team at The Merrion for a month leading up to our arrival. They ensured everything went smoothly, working with me through multiple emails to arrange car services and changed reservations. My husband was completely surprised! The hotel itself is delightful! We stayed once in 2015 and loved it and had to return. It’s understated elegance with top notch service. I can’t recommend it enough!",5,2022,05,14
200,The lap of luxury,"After rescheduling our trip 3 times due to the pandemic, my husband and I finally made it to Ireland and started our 5 week road trip with 4 days at The Merrion.  We couldn’t have chosen a better place to begin our visit.  We had booked an extra night so that we could go straight to our room upon arrival in the early morning and it worked out perfectly.  We had an efficient airport pickup with a  friendly driver guide who gave us lots of tips on the way to the hotel.  The neighborhood is ideal.  We walked nearly everywhere. We were thrilled to be upgraded to a Junior Suite in the main section of the hotel.  The room was spacious, beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean with every amenity you could want, including a huge king size bed and comfy overstuffed sofa.  I especially appreciated the vase of fresh flowers.  We had a lovely view of the garden.  It was very peaceful and we slept well.  There was ample closet space and hangers, plus a bidet and bathroom scale in the bathroom.  The bathroom was large and included a soaking tub and separate shower, though the shower stall could have been bigger, and we would have preferred more space for personal toiletries.  There were large towels, plush robes and slippers and quality soaps and shampoo.  WiFi was fast and reliable.  Every detail is well thought out, so you enjoy modern comfort in a charming traditional setting. Service was exceptional and very warm and inviting.  Though I had done most planning in advance and didn’t need any special assistance, the Concierge team was very helpful when we needed anything.  If you like art, ask them for the audio tour of the hotel art collection, it’s well worth the time.  Breakfasts were excellent in a lovely room overlooking the beautiful garden, and we especially want to thank Fiona for taking such good care of us and providing the personal touch.  I’ll review Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud separately, but suffice to say that it fully deserves its reputation.  We’re still on the road for a few more weeks, but The Merrion is sure to remain a highlight of our trip.",5,2022,05,09
200,No really luxury,"This Hotel is rated as a luxury hotel. Our experience has not borne out this fact. From the time we arrived the experience was anything but luxury. We were told by the receptionist that we had an upgraded room and she also mentioned that it was an upgrade on the last visit two years ago. We arrived at the room and discovered that it actually was a downgrade. The room was so small that if you were working at the desk then it was impossible to get through to use the bathroom 
The Bed and the Desk were on top of one another. After complaining they told us that there were no other rooms available. After speaking to the receptionist again and explaining that the room we had previously was more than twice the size of what she gave us
Eventually she found another room that was still small 
but at least the layout was such that the desk was far enough that you could move to the bathroom 
When we checked in we were told that breakfast was included in our tariff. We went for breakfast and met a business partner. We discovered later that they charged us for both of our breakfasts even though it was included. As we were extremely angry about all of the issues we spoke to the Guest relations who agreed to pay for our transport to the airport",3,2022,05,08
200,First Class Hotel,We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. When you enter you feel like you are being transported into a bygone era. Wonderful antiques and artworks create a luxurious cozy atmosphere. The high tea service in one of the lounges is out of this world. The staff is extremely attentive and professional. All of this in addition to its central location makes this a perfect place for a stay in Dublin.,5,2022,05,05
200,Cant fault it!,"Have very high standards and have stayed in many of the top hotels all over the world and I cant fault a thing.
From the check in to the departure, the breakfast, restaurants, rooms, concierge, ambience and location it was all perfect.
My only criticism was that we wish we could have stayed longer - thank you, we will be back.",5,2022,05,05
200,Luxurious City Stay,"Superb service, great food and ambience. We stayed between Christmas and NY so staff were under pressure but a great time was had by us and our 4 year old. We stayed in a suite and our son loved the children’s amenities and special turn down provided for him. We enjoyed the pool before breakfast each morning. It’s expensive but you do get what you pay for. Very close to Government Buildings and right in Dublin City Centre.",5,2022,05,01
200,City break in Dublin,"The perfect hotel for a city break in Dublin with wonderfully friendly and helpful staff, fabulous location and the most beautiful courtyard gardens. The cosy bar serves excellent cocktails while tea in the sitting room in the afternoon is a relaxing treat. Highly recommended.",5,2022,04,25
200,First stay in Dublin & The Merrion,"This was a first time visit to Dublin and we choose The Merrion due to its very central location and quality of hotel. Certainly not the cheapest option but we believe you get what you pay for in most cases!  As tourist we spent very little time in the hotel, except to change, sleep and eat breakfast as most tourist do... The bed was key in our requirements for a good nights sleep and it didn't disappoint in size or quality! 

We only ate in the Garden Room for breakfast but it was exceptional. A very lovely setting looking out onto a lovely inner courtyard garden. Food and staff were excellent. 

We would definitely use this again for our next Dublin stay and hopefully try the cellar bar and other restaurants!",5,2022,04,22
200,Stellar Stay,Attention to detail and luxurious stay - you don’t want to stay anywhere else! Amazing staff and beautiful grounds! It’s a place you feel like the staff truly are authentic and care. We’re coming back!,5,2022,04,22
200,A Great hotel with great staff,"We found Merrion hotel absolutely wonderful with very professional staff and services beyond excellence! We felt very happy and very well taken care of! Spacious room , exceptionally clean and peaceful! A five star experience!",5,2022,04,22
200,"Great stay, as they have thought of everything!","Based on TP, we booked the Merrion, and it was absolutely perfect. From the friendly staff to all the comforts of a five star hotel.  The rooms are large and have every amenity including an umbrella. Location was good as most is within walking distance.  Highly recommended!!",5,2022,04,22
200,Highly Recommend the Merrion,I would highly recommend this hotel. Will be staying here anytime we visit Dublin in the future. The hotel is a bit difficult to find as they don't have a large sign out front. The sign is knee height on the gate right outside the hotel. Google Maps had us driving in circles about a 1 /2 mile away. Waze had us across the street. The hotel is directly across from The Department of Finance building. Beautiful hotel! The outside of it looks just like the rest of the block. Highly recommend.,5,2022,04,19
200,A restful visit,"All I needed was to rest and rest I did. The staff gave me a peace of mind and they were very helpful. The rooms are well built and clean, the spa, sauna and swimming pool area is great! And if you love art, that's the place to be. Lovely paintings!",4,2022,04,18
200,Best hotel in Ireland,"The Merrion Hotel is the best hotel in Ireland.  I have stayed there on multiple occasions.  Service is impeccable from reservations, front desk, concierge, bellman, dining, housekeeping.  Rooms were finely appointed.  Location is amazing.",5,2022,04,17
200,Highly Recommend ,"A luxurious hotel located just outside the city centre. Within walking distance of fantastic restaurants, bars, shopping & sightseeing. All the staff are very friendly & helpful. Rooms are beautifully decorated. We loved our stay & can't wait to return. ",5,2022,04,16
200,Luxury and friendliness abound at The Merrion!,"We booked two nights at The Merrion based on its location and it’s excellent reviews. 
The staff, to a person, went out of their way to greet us and offer to help. The first staff member we met found out we were waiting for our room to be ready and he found another room that was available earlier. The room was beautiful, immaculate and so well appointed, with comfy chairs in front of the window, with great internet. The bed itself and the bed linens were luxurious and made for a great sleep. I loved the size of the bathroom and it’s deep tub and separate shower.
I was very sad to have to leave after two nights, but I look forward to returning next time we visit Dublin!",5,2022,04,07
200,Fabulous!,"My Fiancé and I stayed for one night on 1st April after receiving a pre wedding gift of a Dine and Dream Voucher. We were somewhat disappointed at not being able to use the voucher for a Saturday stay, however this did not take away from our overall experience. We found the service from start to finish truly exceptional. Every member of staff that we came across treated us so well and were extremely attentive to our needs. 
Our room was upgraded from a Queen to a King. 
The spa facilities were amazing and the food was superb. 
We will definitely be returning!",5,2022,04,06
200,Fabulous hotel but overcharged,"My husband and I had a one night stay,  Tuesday 30th March at the Merrion Hotel.
We availed of the Five Star Steal Package at a cost of €695 for the overnight stay with breakfast and dinner included.

All of the facilities were excellent,  we had a lovely experience and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

However, I would just like to point out one point of concen.  I settled my bill on departure which was paid in full.  The following day I noticed that an additional separate charge of €42 was taken from my Debit Card without my consent.

I contacted the hotel and advised them of this error. I was put through to Accounts and then Reception who knew nothing about the charge..I was then put through to Finance and the girl explained it may have been a charge for the mini bar or something like that.  I explained that we had not used the mini bar and had stated this at reception when asked while settling our bill.  I was advised that the charge would be refunded and my Debit Card reimbursed, she apologised for the error. One week later and the money still has not been reimbursed.

I was a bit perplexed that this charge was made to my card without any communication from the hotel and especially as my bill had been fully paid on departure.

I just wish to make you aware of the incident.",5,2022,04,04
200,Exceptional!,"Amazing hotel, the service was incredible, great meal in the restaurant and enjoyed the breakfast buffet. If you needed anything there was always someone available. Both bars were great but the Cellar bar was our favorite. The staff did a great job remembering guests names and really making you feel welcome.",5,2022,04,01
200,Top Notch,"Had the distinct pleasure of being a guest at the Merrion with my wife. 

From the moment we arrived, to the moment we checked out, we were treated to five star service, accommodation, and hospitality from each and every staff member of the hotel.  

Cannot express how happy we were with our stay. 

There’s no doubt we will return.",5,2022,03,31
200,superb treat on our doorstep,"as we live in dublin we would probably never have spent a weekend here but thanks to a very generous voucher we received we had a wonderful weekend spent in true 5 star surroundings , the staff are incredible, the food and the entire experience in both Guilbauds and The garden room was superb .

the spa treatments were first class",5,2022,03,29
200,Wonderful stay at an incredible hotel.,We stayed here the during the St Patrick's Day activities. It was in a wonderful location and the staff went above and beyond to make us fell welcome and comfortable. The sweets left in our room in the evening were a welcome treat at the end of a long day.,5,2022,03,28
200,Great experience,"Stayed here for a birthday treat recently. Have been here many times and always been impressed with the experience. This stay was the best yet. Room ready early and upgraded to Junior suite on arrival. Nice surprise. The suite was just fantastic. A real treat. Had dinner in the garden room. Lovely restaurant, great food and atmosphere. Special mention to Anna who was just great. 
Overall I would rate the Merrion as the best hotel in Dublin. Highly recommend a visit.",5,2022,03,27
200,I hate leaving,Yet again we had an amazing stay at The Merrion Hotel.  The staff are wonderful.  Professional and helpful but still very friendly.  The accommodation is first class.  The food and wine are the best around.,5,2022,03,26
200,Merrion Dublin as a Birthday treat for mum,"This hotel is superb, the luxury comes from not only the gorgeous surroundings but more importantly from being treated like a queen. My car was valet parked (a 1st fire my little micra), or bags were carried for us onto the hotel. We were walked to our room after checking in and the hotel had left us two desserts to celebrate mum's birthday. The room has everything you could need, I particularly appreciated the coffee machine, the ice bucket (filled while we were out for the evening and so ready for our night cap), and the free and replenished bottles of water. There was also an umbrella if it was raining outside, a little shoe shine kit so you don't have to pack your own and all the standard hotel room amenities you would expect. The room had a pair of lovely comfy chairs which was great for a morning cuppa. Extremely comfortable bed, turned down at night for you. The doormen were always extremely friendly and attentive. All in all we had the most marvellous weekend thanks to the Merrion Hotel Dublin.",5,2022,03,26
200,Perfect,Wonderful stay in a central location easily walkable to everything.  Upgraded room with unexpected freebies. Impeccable service and friendly staff made this a most memorable visit.  We’ve already recommended it to friends - and now to all of you.,5,2022,03,25
200,Lovely Hotel with the Friendliest Staff,"This hotel is a delight.  The staff could not be more attentive and friendly and knew our names within minutes.  The room was like walking into a beautiful spring day...airy, bright, and so pleasant to the eye.  Lots of pleasant touches.  The location is excellent. Can't wait to return.",5,2022,03,23
200,Beautiful Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Staying in the Merrion ticks all the boxes, Its location to the tourist spots in Dublin City Centre  and the shops are  within walking distance......  The hotel itself hires the best staff, they make you feel your the only one in the hotel, nothing is too much trouble.  The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated.   I would highly recommend this hotel as it meets all your needs",5,2022,03,23
200,Understated Luxury at its finest,"Had the most amazing few days staying in the Merrion Hotel
Understated elegance and superb service and food. Real luxury. I’ve stayed in the other 5 star hotels in Dublin but the Merrion outshines them all !!!!!  If you’re thinking of a trip to Dublin the Merrion hotel is THE PLACE !!!",5,2022,03,23
200,Glorious Hotel,"Excellent attention to detail 
The staff and environment are a calm oasis in the city with quality around each corner 
the Spa is small but fantastic - I had a facial which was excellent
The restaurant is great and food super
Rooms are clean and well presented and nothing is too much effort",5,2022,03,22
200,Pure luxury,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. Pure luxury with excellent food and attentive friendly staff. The Cellar bar is a must see. The beds are difficult to get out of in the morning due to the fact they are so comfortable. Well done to all. Highly recommended,5,2022,03,13
200,Night away,"First class experience and excellent in all areas.
Check in was very easy and very helpful staff,
Best part of the stay was the breakfast. One never needed to ask for anything with staff being vert attentive.",5,2022,03,11
200,One of The Best,"Fabulous hotel within a stunning Georgian setting near to the City centre. Beautiful room overlooking the garden and many thoughtful extras. Staff are extremely pleasant and helpful and the Concierge will do their upmost to meet all requests. Very tranquil, excellent food and service in the Garden Room and a super selection of wines. If you need a treat - look no further!",5,2022,03,08
200,Fantastic Service. Beautiful Hotel.,"Service was fantastic from start to finish. The staff are incredibly attentive. We ate dinner in the Garden Restaurant one evening and had breakfast twice. The food was great. 

Beautiful building and rooms.

Only thing that could be improved upon would be a hot tub or jacuzzi in the Spa.

We'll definitely be returning whenever we're next in Dublin.",5,2022,03,07
200,Excellent Place to stay in Dublin,"Our stay was simply put, AMAZING! The staff at the Merion were so helpful and collegial and the cleanliness of the entire place is emaculate. My daughter's Service Dog loved it as well as he was pampered and taken care of as well. Every detail in this place is very well thought of. Will definitely rebook if we return to Dublin, hopefully in the near future.",5,2022,03,06
200,A real treat,"As we live in Dublin it felt very decadent to treat ourselves to a night in the Merrion but it was an amazing experience, it's somewhere I have always wanted to stay and it didn't disappoint! 
Everything about the hotel is fantastic, large, comfortable and very nicely decorated room. Food in the Garden Room was delicious. 
I think I'll have to treat myself again soon!",5,2022,03,03
200,Magic at the Merrion,"I often say to my husband, that if I win the lotto, I'm reserving a room at the Merrion...permanently! That's how much I love this place. Excellent service, high standards, understated luxury. Great location in the city.   The swimming pool is just the right temperature and it feels like you are swimming in a luxuriously smooth body oil. It's not heavy with chlorine! The garden area is gorgeous and great for sipping a cool glass of wine. I highly recommend this place.",5,2022,03,03
200,Top Notch in every way,"Our stay was truly wonderful, from the time of our arrival the staff could not do enough to ensure myself and my daughter had a  wonderful experience,   my only regret was that I could not stay longer.  Thank you Merrion hotel for a fabulous weekend.",5,2022,03,02
200,Nowhere Better.,"So lucky to have had a table here after my daughter's graduation.  We were  thrilled to be able to celebrate having had graduation postponed and the Merrion did not disappoint.  The ceremony ran late, but the table was held.  We had the warmest of welcomes and really enjoyed the Garden Room.  Not usually a fan of a large menu but our food was delicious and the service is faultless.  Will always remember this celebration. Thanks to the Merrion for bringing our daughter a chocolate 'congratulation plate'.  Not something we had requested but it brought her such joy and content.  Love the Merrion.",5,2022,03,01
200,A very good stay but maybe not a great one,"I stayed here with my husband for a Sunday night in February. Given the price and reputation we were very excited but also had high expectations. We arrived early with the intention of having lunch somewhere else in the city and were greeted by numerous members of staff who parked our car and brought in our luggage. They were very welcoming and it was no issue that we arrived 2 hours before check in time of 3pm. Off to a great start. We were told that our room would be ready at 3 so we returned at 3. The room however was not ready and the staff member who told us this was neither apologetic nor helpful, she bluntly told us that it wasn't ready. We attempted to sit and have a coffee (which we didn't really want but had to pass the time) but the bar and seating areas were all full so we wandered around looking at the hotel's art collection which is amazing and arguably the best aspect of this hotel. After a few minutes a table became available so we had 2 coffees which cost €15. I felt that this should have been covered by the hotel as compensation for the room not being ready but that would just be me. The room was lovely, not massive but fitted to a very high spec. The bed was particularly comfortable. After we settled we went to use the spa facilities which were very relaxing - a very big pool with a steam room and sauna. A jacuzzi pool would be a welcome addition in my opinion. We had dinner booked for 8pm in the Garden room restaurant. Aesthetically I found the room a little bland and plain in comparison with the rest of the hotel which is magnificent. We were happy with our starters of halloumi and prawns although I felt that my prawn starter could have been hotter. My husband was happy with his venison main but I was unhappy with my rack of lamb which was cold. I was very impressed with how this was dealt with however so wouldn't hold it against them. I got a new main along with complimentary sorbet, drink and dessert. Breakfast was not included in our package. I think 3.5 stars is a more accurate mark but 3 was perhaps harsh so I decided on a 4. There were many tourists in this hotel and I can see how they are attracted to its historical and artistic charm as well as its handy location. However, while we had a good time I just don't feel that we would justify a return trip all things considered. ",4,2022,02,24
200,Understated and quietly excellent,"Passing by over the years, I never really understood the Merrion’s charm… that changed when we stayed there recently as part of a birthday celebration. The Merrion is understated and quietly excellent. Despite its prestige, it doesn’t feel flash or showy like some other city centre hotels. It felt chic, sophisticated and private. 

We were on a very reasonable deal which included accommodation, champagne and dinner. This package helped me as the organiser and it meant everything was included and I didn’t have to worry about who was paying for what.  Despite being on a package, our rooms were spacious, comfortable and extremely well serviced. 

Service in the restaurant and at breakfast was slow, but I think this could have been related to covid staffing absences as it wasn’t in keeping with the rest of the service levels. It seemed like there could have been at least two more servers on the floor.

Looking forward to staying there again very soon.",5,2022,02,21
200,"Wonderful hotel, great staff",We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion complete with spa treatment; dinner in The Garden Room and a return for brekkie the next day. Magnificent room in the Old House/main building - we received a lovely upgrade. Really cool high ceiling  with intricate details on ceiling of bedroom. The biggest curtains I've ever seen in a room. The staff were superb - particularly Anna in the Garden Room; the very friendly Adil; Gloria; Magda - I could go on. A very pleasant stay indeed.,5,2022,02,20
200,Lovely few days,We had a lovely couple of days in the Merrion. We were delighted with our evening dinner in the Garden room and had two lovely treatments with Emma in the spa. Breakfasts was a lovely leisurely experience with great range on the buffet overall a great stay,5,2022,02,20
200,Superb hotel,This is an absolutely superb hotel. The service is immaculate and the staff can’t do enough for you. Unfortunately I was staying as I was attending a funeral the following day but the staff still made this a fabulous stay. They organised a dinner reservation for me in The Garden Room at very short notice where the food was stunning. Contactless check out was also very much appreciated. I will definitely return and hopefully under much happier circumstances next time.,5,2022,02,20
200,Birthday celebration ,"Booked The Merrion for my husband's birthday. Stayed for 2 nights and we had an evening meal included.
We were met by a very helpful concierge, (Russell) I think who parked our car. Parking is 35 euros per night.
We were given an upgrade to a garden view room, which was lovely. The bed was the cosiest and nicest bed I have slept in ever.
We were truly taken back by the turndown service on our first night. The housekeeper had really gone the extra mile, tidied all my make up on a white napkin in the bathroom, hung up clothes we had over the chairs and even tidied my charger and straighteners with lovely merrion tie straps. Definitely felt like 5 star service.
We dined in The Garden Terrace restaurant and the food was very nice.
Cocktails in Number 23 were really excellent.
We treated ourselves to Afternoon Tea at 55 euros per person. It was truly a lovely experience and we enjoyed every minute. We were served by Fabrice, Gemma and Victoria who all were excellent.
Gemma had also served us in Number 23 on a few occasions and is a fantastic hospitality person, friendly yet professional.
Great selection for breakfast. We were lucky to be seated one morning near the window with a view of the garden.
We had a lovely stay in The Merrion. It was lovely to meet Donna from HR and also to see Vanessa again.
Thank you to all the Merrion team for a lovely stay. ",5,2022,02,19
200,5 star from start to finish,My friend and I had afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. We also booked a one night stay. From start to finish our experience waw excellent. The afternoon tea was beautiful and the service exceptional. The rooms were fabulous with lovely soft fluffy robes. The staff from when we arrived outside could not do enough for us. I would highly recommend,5,2022,02,18
200,"Dublins 2nts,3 days business visit","Outstanding hotel. Attention to detail at every twist and turn. Wonderfully professional and friendly.
Good location, oozed quality in the rooms and public areas. 
Served up really nice breakfast
One of the nicest hotels and experience that I’ve stayed in across the world.",5,2022,02,10
200,Could not have been more perfect,"The staff make the Merrion.  From the fabulous door men to the kind housekeeping crew, our first trip with a baby was made seemless by everyone.  The room was lovely and nothing was too much trouble - even the best room service we have ever had.  Dublin is expensive for hotels but the Merrion is worth that bit extra.",5,2022,02,10
200,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here on a Tuesday evening jn February. We availed of the valet parking which was very handy. Our bags were brought in by the concierge. Check in was quick and simple with very friendly and welcoming staff looking after us. We were given a small tour of the ground floor to get our bearings.
Our room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. The beds are huge with lovely linen and comfortable Pillows. A bottle of champagne was waiting for us on ice. The bathroom was also lovely and spacious with plenty of toiletries. The towels were lovely and big. I loved the bathrobes and comfortable slippers which were also provided. 
We had dinner in the Garden Room at 7pm. Again staff were very efficient and friendly. The menu had lots of choice. The food was good however I wouldn't describe it as excellent. The wine list was good however there wasn't a huge choice by the glass.
Breakfast the next morning was only ok. The mushroom and pudding were dry and the bacon was hard to chew.
Our experience of this hotel was fantastic but if I stayed again, I would choose to dine elsewhere.",5,2022,02,10
200,Best hotel in Dublin! 5 stars - can’t fault anything!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our first stay at the Merrion. Living and being from Dublin, we went back and forth with the idea of spending a night in a Dublin hotel for our anniversary rather than one outside the county but we are so glad we booked here!! 

From the moment we got out of the taxi at arrival the experience was flawless. Every single staff member we encountered; the receptionist, concierge, bar staff, cleaners, waiters and waitresses, everyone was so friendly, pleasant and accommodating (in particular Joffin John our concierge who was brilliant and provided us with a really kind gesture for our anniversary-thank you!)

Our room was beautiful & immaculately clean. it was a lovely surprise to come back from dinner to see that the room had been tidied with a turn down service. We went to the pool twice and again, we couldn’t fault it. Changing rooms are fab and it’s a great touch that you are provided with a locker and fresh towel, robe and slippers each time. Both dinner and breakfast were gorgeous. 

Overall it was such a lovely treat and we definitely plan on returning for future special occasions!!",5,2022,02,05
200,What a treat!,Have stayed many times and always a thrill to arrive back.  From the moment we arrived at the steps of the hotel our wonderful experience began.  Surrounded by wonderful works of arts it is a delight to be staying at this hotel.  Service is superb throughout.  Dining in the Garden Room is a real pleasure with a great choice of food - all perfectly served.    We look forward to our next stay.,5,2022,02,03
200,Still amazing,The Merrion Hotel has set the standard for 5 star service in Dublin for a long time now. Having had a brief visit to the Merrion it’s pleasing to see this standards remain in place. Everything is a form of perfection and the service and friendly approach is second to none. Gardens still beautiful!,5,2022,01,31
200,Superb service and comfort,"We spent a quiet NYE 2021 in the Merrion, and it was my first time staying here. What took me so long?!
I'm usually a fan of more modern hotels, but the Merrion's classic style and impeccable service at every turn won me over. We stayed in a deluxe room in the main building which was huge and beautiful, a perfect place just to relax and enjoy some room service. We also enjoyed lunch in the Garden restaurant which was delicious, and a couple of quiet cocktails in the bar.

We paid a short visit to the spa for a 25-min massage each as this was all that was available - in the expert hands of the therapists this felt like much longer! we then enjoyed the pool and steam/sauna which although now feeling a bit dated, were in perfect condition and we had them to ourselves during the time we visited, so felt completely COVID-safe.
A superb breakfast served in our room on New Year's Day rounded off a lovely experience.
My only constructive feedback would be to perhaps add a few more contemporary + healthy options to the restaurant and room service menus, the food offering is very traditional overall.",5,2022,01,29
200,It was a real treat to stay in The Merrion!,"Gorgeous, spacious room / great food and service in the dining room / lovely, friendly staff. The Merrion's location is a big plus - it's right in the heart of Dublin so you can walk to Stephens Green for a stroll or go for a pint in Doheny & Nesbitts or do some shopping on Grafton Street or browse in the National Gallery (2 minutes walk!) - there's so much on offer right outside its doors. That said, the hotel is so gorgeous that you could feasibly spend a lot of your stay inside - having a glass of wine and a chat in the Drawing Room or the lovely enclosed garden area!!",5,2022,01,28
200,Fabulous Holiday Stay at the Merrion,"After having to reschedule our trip to Dublin 4 times due to the pandemic, my family and I were thrilled to finally be able to travel to Dublin.  We were so fortunate to be able to stay at the wonderful Merrion Hotel over Christmas and New Year’s.  The entire staff at the hotel was excellent and so kind.  They immediately made us feel at home.  The rooms were so beautiful and absolutely immaculate. Having stayed in many 5 star hotels, this hotel was by far the cleanest hotel that I have stayed in.  This was particularly reassuring given the pandemic.  We just loved sitting by the fire in the Drawing Room and having snacks and tea.  Christmas and New Year’s dinners in the Garden Room were excellent.  They really made the holidays special, with live music and beautiful decorations.  The concierge team is excellent and helped plan our entire itinerary prior to arrival.  We had the most incredible stay at the Merrion and hope to return in the not too distant future.",5,2022,01,25

200,Family get together,This is one of Ireland’s best hotels The staff are courteous friendly and helpful The rooms are well appointed beds very comfortable The dining room is a great experience for breakfast and dinner There is an excellent swimming pool Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is a special experience but needs to be booked in advance The Merioneth is expensive but you get what you pay for Try it for a special experience,5,2022,01,22
200,Wow! What a special place.,"From the moment we arrived our trip was super, Staff and Hotel all excellent. Well worth the cost. Rooms where perfect, clean modern with a classical feel. Food  breakfast, lunch and dinner was amazing. Bar service was also great staff so professional on every level.

200,A Real 5 Star Experience,"This  is a fabulous hotel stayed here at the weekend with some friends and the level of service is excellent the staff are excellent food and drink excellent excellent breakfast what can I say what a super hotel and can’t wait to get back. I highly recommend booking a room in the old part of the hotel it’s a little bit more expensive but what a fantastic room with full of character.
The location of this hotel is just off Stephens Green and five minute walk to Grafton Street.

The hotel is also located near O Donohue’s pub a Pablos restaurant or soul several small restaurants like by am I highly recommend staying in this hotel and yeah as I said earlier look forward.",5,2022,01,15
200,Age discrimination,Don’t go here if you’re under 21 they treat you with less respect than if you were far older. We got staff looking us up and down at breakfast and not even serving us water or our correct order because they didn’t seem to have the time for us. The reception staff on the other hand were nice and didn’t seem to discriminate regarding age.,3,2022,01,15
200,Properly spoiled at the Merrion!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion for New Years eve, luxury georgian feel, superb client service and fantastic comfort! We felt properly spoiled by the experience and will be thrilled to go back!",5,2022,01,14
200,Always an occasion,"Staying at the Merrion Hotel always feels special. The attention to detail is second to none. Service from staff is beyond reproach. The rooms are quiet, clean and relaxing. It is amazing how quiet rooms are in the middle of the city. The hotel is stones throw to the city centre and there are museums and parks nearby.",5,2022,01,14
200,Early January birthday break in Dublin,"We received a gift voucher as a present from friends. We decided to book The Merrion as a post Christmas treat to celebrate my birthday.We had an absolutely fabulous experience. The room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful.
Only negative was that breakfast times were assigned prior to arrival with no choice. We were are told on arrival that there were no breakfast slots available for breakfast on our second morning, however when we complained this was resolved and we were able to have breakfast in the garden room on both mornings at times that suited us. The breakfast experience in the Garden Room was probably one of the best ever absolutely amazing.
Dinner in the Garden Room was also really good.",5,2022,01,14
200,Best place I've stayed in Dublin,"The service was exceptional, as were all of the accommodations. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. The staff was knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. I'd recommend to anyone staying in Dublin and look forward to going back.",5,2022,01,11
200,A haven of a hotel after stormy year,"The Merrion Hotel is a complete treat start to finish. A beef sandwich and copious pots of good tea in the Drawing Room was a lovely start.  The art collection and the accompanying catalogue is a value-add treat.  The food was excellent at dinner as was room service breakfast. Any small problems (dodgy remote control/billing error) were sorted without any problem. All staff very pleasant and helpful and a shout out to Regina in The Drawing Room. She was dealing with a particularly tricky  customer at the next table and she was excellent. Thanks for the Christmas tea bag. 
If you want to treat someone, buy them a Merrion Hotel Voucher.",5,2022,01,11
200,Dublin visit,Worth every penny we had a memorable elegant two night stay lovely kind and friendly staff with 24 hour in room dining and a great fireplace lobby bar the hotel is also walking distance to everything .,5,2022,01,11
200,Exceptional service and personal touches,"The service in this hotel is the best, other hotels say they are 5 star and they are just ordinary but this is proper 5 star from the minute they take your bags from you at the door. They excel at special touches. It was our first night away since having a baby and they left a bottle of champagne in our room and upgraded us.",5,2022,01,11
200,"Top class, simply the best in Ireland. Luxury with the pretentious snobbery of other hotels","It wasn't our first time in hotel, but first time we brought our 7 and 5 year old. I don't know where to start, hands down this is the best hotel in Ireland. We had a room in the house, simple touches like kids robes for our visit to the pool, kids menus with a twist, it's not normal you expect a 5 star hotel yo treat kids as 5 star guests. Everything about the hotel is luxury without snobbery. You are known by name as soon as you check in. The room itself is huge and amazing, the turn down service is out of this world, everything arranged, even kids teddies put to bed for us. We had a lovely evening in the drawing room having a relaxing drink whilst playing board games with kids.  How it gets better year on year is beyond me. We took an open top bus tour and went by another 5 star hotel just around the corner, the tour guide said it was the best 5 star hotel in the country, we have stayed in both, not a chance, the Merrion hands down is simply the best. We cannot wait to go back. Top class on every level.",5,2022,01,09
200,Back in Ireland after 16 months,"First time at the Merrion & it really is a different class of hotel. Check in was the best I ever had, just left bag at counter & brought to another desk to check in. Lady showed me to elevator & bag arrived within 5 minutes. 
Had a drink with friends at lounge which was very elegant, staff were very attentive. Got room service later which was quick as well.
Breakfast was a big letdown though. I booked through American Express which gets you breakfast included. Have used it so many times in Ireland but this was the first time I could only order fruit or cereal. Was looking so forward to my last fry up for a while & only got a cold plate of fruit instead. Also didn’t help that my flight was delayed until 1pm, so got breakfast at Kealys by the airport, which was great",5,2021,12,23
200,Overnight @the Merrion,This is a superior hotel my first visit and would recommend it highly.  The Georgian architecture proportions are stunning. The inner courtyard was such a wonderful surprise an oasis in the center of the city. The beds are the most comfortable I ever experienced away from home.,5,2021,12,22
200,Hotel treat pre-Christmas,"Lovely experience from the moment we met the doorman to our departure. Lovely room, fuss-free friendly staff, excellent food.  A real luxurious feeling throughout the hotel. Plenty of space to sit and chill and enjoy the atmosphere.",5,2021,12,22
200,Overnight stay,This was our second time to stay overnight in the Merrion and both times were such a lovely experience. From the time we arrived to the time we left we were made feel so welcome by everyone we met along the way. The food was great the friendly staff and the leisure centre made such a difference to our time spent in the hotel. Look forward to my next overnight stay.,5,2021,12,22
200,Wonderful mini-break!,"A truly wonderful hotel for a mini-break!

Lovely comfortable guest rooms; Excellent restaurants, bar and lounge rooms with great food and beverage - particularly afternoon tea with Xmas carols; excellent pool and spa facilities and attentive, friendly staff - a gem!",5,2021,12,17
200,The Merrion in Dublin is a gem!,"Stayed two nights and loved this lovely hotel. Elegant refined, with exceptional service! It’s centrally located but quieter with many options for dining and shopping.
Will be revisiting and recommending for sure!",5,2021,12,15
200,Old world charm with first class service,"A beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin.  The most classy hotel in Dublin and I have tried them all!  The main hotel comprises four Georgian town houses restored with no expense spared.  This hotel is over 20 years old but it looks even better now than when it first opened.  The basement pool and spa area is delightful.  
The staff are very professional and friendly.  Overall, a very charming hotel. I always recommend it to visiting friends and business colleagues.",5,2021,12,13
200,A very Special Place,What a beautiful way to spend time with friends. A very special hotel that just never fails to impress. As always the service in particular deserves top mention and the late breakfast was just fantastic…. Looking forward to next year already,5,2021,12,10
200,Mags,"Fantastic central location, hotel has a lovely atmosphere.  Lovely helpful  staff, great food,  accommodation lovely and spotless clean. Would  highly recommend a visit at Christmas will definitely be back👍",5,2021,12,10
200,Just Pure Magic,"We have stayed in quite a few different hotels, but The Merrion trumps anywhere else. Its expensive, but it is worth every penny. Our second time here and I cannot wait to go stay there again. The building and rooms are stunning and immaculate, they literally think of everything. But it's the staff that make the place. Absolutely love this hotel and cannot recommend enough.",5,2021,12,10
200,Definitely the best hotel in Dublin,"Returned to the Merrion last week for a 2 nights stay and it is definitely the best one in Dublin.  Now with business travel resuming, stayed at The Marker, The Westbury and The Merion in the last 2 months and definiely the Merrion it's one step above all of them.  The key difference is attention to detail, fine luxury and a hotel where you feel that they really know what the guests want and need.  Used to be a regular client of the hotel before the pandemic and it is clear that it is still my favourite one.",5,2021,11,28
200,Simply First Class!,"Arrived at hotel and greeted by the footmen, very welcoming. Excellent efficient check-in with high standards of Covid awareness. Room was excellent, food in the garden room was top quality and the wine list was great. If you want the highest quality hotel stay then the Merrion is your spot in Dublin.",5,2021,11,24
200,a wonderful hotel,"Friendly staff, beautiful room, right in the centre of the city. Great  food and service and a beautiful hotel just opposite government buildings. 
We really enjoyed our short stay and the staff could not have been more helpful .",5,2021,11,23
200,Pure Magic.,"My friend and I stayed on one of the busiest weekends in Dublin since Covid which really added to the magic. From the minute we pulled up to the front of the hotel you feel like royalty. Tommy, the commissioner was ready and waiting as if just for us. He was so attentive and took our bags and made sure we had everything we need. 
From checkin to getting to the room and finding a beautiful amenity on arrival there were no faults. We had the most beautiful cocktails in Bar 23 and Daniel went above and beyond to make drinks that we wanted off menu and chatted with us the whole night. We felt like VVVIP’s. Charlotte, the server in 23 was also amazing very attentive and friendly and really made it feel special and relaxing.
 I could name every member of staff we came across as they were all amazing and you can really get the impression they love what they do. 
The Covid measures were all handled amazingly. You really wouldn’t know Covid was around in the best possible way. The branded masks and the Perspex glass in all public areas along with the sanitizer everywhere you need and the complimentary sanitizer and wipes in the room. 
Over all the whole experience was amazing and all staff, food & beverage ( Afternoon tea was phenomenal) and facilities were amazing. 
Glad to have been able to stay in the Merrion again after far too long because of the pandemic. Pure MAGIC from start to finish.",5,2021,11,19
200,5 Star Location & Standards,Everything lived up to expectation. From check-in to check-out the Hotel staff gave a very personal touch and made one feel very welcome. The Hotel is immaculate and location was perfect to all destinations within the City Centre. Lovely atmosphere and would not hesitate in staying again.,5,2021,11,18
200,Exceptional Hotel,Our favourite hotel in Dublin if not the world.  Staff in every department go totally over and beyond to make our stay perfect. We love absolutely everything about this hotel especially the cellar bar that has reopened.  Can’t wait for our return stay in December,5,2021,11,17
200,Birthday,"Fabulous stay at the Merrion. Nothing was to much trouble forthe staff. Concierge was most welcoming.
Our Spa treatments were very good and we had plenty of relaxation time in spa area.
Particularly liked the drawing rooms atmosphere was warm and inviting.",5,2021,11,11
200,"Great location.  Superb, understated service","We had 3 nights in a suite for a special occasion.  Having the car valet parked,
luggage taken from our car to our suite, breakfast delivered to the suite, and so on, it was all just excellent.    Recommend completely.",5,2021,11,11
200,Perfection,"We had reason to visit Dublin on a few occasions within a short period recently and stayed in various 5 star hotels, all were very good, but The Merrion  was head and shoulders above the others. All I can describe it as is seamless, from check- in, right through our stay up to check out. The staff, facilities, food, accommodation and general ambience were perfect. When visiting Dublin again I will not stay anywhere else except The Merrion.",5,2021,11,11
200,A home away from home,"We recently stayed in The Merrion to celebrate a milestone birthday.  From the second we arrived until we left, we were in heaven.  The Merrion has a special knack of taking care of your every need with effortless elegance.  The breakfast in the Garden Room is a truly wonderful experience.  The spa is so peaceful and luxurious and should really be experienced, so be sure to factor time in for that during your stay.  The Merrion is essentially three old Georgian houses together and it really does feel like a home away from home.  Part of the magic of The Merrion is no matter where you are spending time, whether it's in The Garden Room, the Drawing Room or elsewhere, you don't even notice the other guests or visitors around you.  I have experienced The Merrion both as a guest enjoying a wonderful stay and as a client organising events for work.  No matter what your reason for being there is, it's hard to beat The Merrion and it's wonderful staff who will stop at nothing to make sure your every need is met.  They are the epitomy of grace, elegance and charm.  Their 'can-do' attitude and endless energy knows no bounds.",5,2021,11,05
200,Amazing centrally located hotel,Just home from an absolutely amazing stay in the Merrion hotel and can’t wait to return..we try stay here any time we are in Dublin and are never disappointed with the level of service we receive here…from the moment you step out of your car you received the 5 star treatment…the 5 star option is well worth it bed/breakfast and evening meal plus a btl of chilled champagne each day in your room…the staff are so well trained everything is seamless…the breakfast is fabulous everything you could wish for and more all made to order…dinner is equally as good in a beautiful surrounding….we can’t wait to return.,5,2021,10,30
200,Best hotel experience ever,"Possibly the best hotel experience I have ever had.
I had taken my father on a tour of Ireland for 10 days. This was a trip of a lifetime for him and every place we stayed was lovely. The Merrion was our last stop. We stayed for two nights. The level of service at this hotel was beyond outstanding. From check-in to dining, to our departure, the staff went above and beyond to allow us to fully enjoy our last 2 nights in Ireland, without worrying about getting our car in time, getting Covid tested, even allowing room service to bring an early breakfast so we could get to the airport on time for our flight home. 
I wish I could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back.",5,2021,10,27
200,5 Star throughout ,"Just returned from a fabulous stay with the Merrion Hotel which was 5 Star service from start to finish. Our room was spacious and elegant and though not as big and view not as great as the last time we stayed it was extremely comfortable.  Dinner, lunch and breakfast were all first class with excellent well presented food.  Our spa treatments were some of the best we've had and the spa is such a restful oasis... make sure and factor in some time there.  What makes this hotel in my opinion is the warm friendly staff, everywhere you go in the hotel you are greeted with a warm smile and a friendly efficient service.  The communal areas are well laid out and very comfortable to spend time in.  I hope I get a chance for another visit soon. ",5,2021,10,27
200,Wonderful break in Dublin,"We could not fault the Merrion Hotel, the comfort, service and attention to detail were outstanding. The staff could not have been more friendly, helpful and obliging. The concierge team is absolutely brilliant and a fountain of information, recommendations and nothing is too much trouble.",5,2021,10,27
200,5 star merited - exemplary service,"We had the pleasure of staying for one night at the Merrion last week. It is a destination hotel and merits its 5 star status from our experience. Credit must go to the staff and their approach taken in dealing with guests at every interaction. The anticipation of guests needs before they even arise is remarkable. 

Francesca and Angela both deserve mention as their management of our check-out alone was exemplary. They rectified an issue with a complementary gift that hadn't arrived to the room and within the next breath advised it would be stored with out luggage without us even having to raise the request. It may seem innocuous but as we were leaving on check-out for the afternoon (but our luggage was to remain at the hotel until later), it really was impressive that the sequence of every scenario is considered by staff.

The room, especially the bedding and furnishings are luxurious. On opening the shower cap box, there was a hair bobbin included - again anticipating that those of us with longer hair may have forgotten one. Further to the already 5 Starr experience, these small touches show the dedicated 5 star experience. I will definitely be arranging to stay here again - we were gifted the stay but it's worth saving for.",5,2021,10,21
200,Overnight R&R,"From the minute we stepped out of the car we were made to feel so welcome by all of the staff. Our check in process was efficient and we had a lovely room overlooking the courtyard. We had booked dinner in The Drawing Room, and were a bit hesitant as not very fond of hotel restaurant dining - were we surprised! Every aspect of the experience was special & we loved it. It's a more sedate experience that some of the other local 5 star hotels, but it really suited what we wanted especially post Covid, and we took great comfort in the measures the hotel and staff had in place for this.........Definitely will be back.",5,2021,10,21
200,Magnificent hotel to celebrate anniversary,We stayed for our 28th wedding anniversary as we had a voucher. We have stayed in many great hotels and the Merrion in one of the best. The facilities are great as you would expect and people are simply fantastic - and in our view that's what really makes it memorable. we will be back for our anniversary next year - even without a voucher !!!,5,2021,10,21
200,The best hotel I've stayed in.,"I got married here and stayed multiple times, the service is 5 star from the time you pull up outside until the time you leave.
The only problem with this hotel is that everybody else feels the same way and it's difficult to get a booking.",5,2021,10,19
200,"Eco friendly, efficient staff and a lovely gift gesture on our 38th wedding anniversary.","Room was warm and clean and the bed very comfortable.
Staff very helpful and professional.
Food was excellent both breakfast and evening meal.
Eco friendly athmosphere all around the hotel.
Valet car parking exceptionally efficient and the price was reasonable.",5,2021,10,19
200,Excellent stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion hotel. I highly recommend it. I travel a lot and it was one of the nicest places I have stayed. Everything is 5 star quality, from the helpfulness of the staff to the quality of the rooms. It was a lavish oasis. We felt pampered the entire time. Also, breakfast was delicious with an excellent selection!",5,2021,10,14
200,Excellent Stay,"Had a lovely stay at the Merrion Hotel as a belated 60th Birthday present. The hotel, staff and service were superb.  Off particular note was our waitress, Laura on Sunday evening. She was friendly, helpful and very professional, nothing was to much trouble. The doorman outside on Monday was also very pleasant and chatted for a few minutes about our stay. Would stay again highly recommended.",5,2021,10,05
200,Merino Stands Out in Europe not just Ireland,One of the most beautiful hotels in all of Europe nevermind in Ireland.  Incredible oasis in the center of Dublin.  I try to stay there every time I am in Dublin.  While Covid restrictions reduced some of the available food and beverage outlets what was offered was comprehensive and up to historical standards.  If you haven’t been in a few years the new garden restaurants is a great addition for breakfast.,5,2021,10,02
200,THE BEST STAY IN DUBLIN,"I really can’t recommend The Merrion Hotel in Dublin, enough. As our first hotel stay since Covid we were apprehensive, but there was absolutely no need to be… all Covid precautions were in place. But from start to finish the experience was second to none.. there’s a friendly warm but professional manner that’s very evident through the staff. ‘Nothing is a problem attitude !’ As a family with 3 teenagers we were excellently accommodated for with twin joining rooms.. 
We ALL cant wait to go back …",5,2021,09,29
200,Another lovely stay but ….,We love the Merrion but on a recent stay were disturbed by a virtual business meeting being conducted in the large salon. It is a relaxing space and we were just about to embark on a chilled lunch when a gentleman launched into a very loud sales pitch to someone.   We eventually moved to the bar to escape his boring delivery about international logistics but it spoiled a very pleasant interlude. Many hotels have a no laptop policy in such public spaces or at least a quiet policy but there was no visible management on the floor to ensure that this sort of thing doesn’t become routine.   Hopefully it will be addressed going forward.,4,2021,09,26
200,Amazing hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Superb upscale accommodations close to shopping stores, attractions, great pubs, and Trinity College. Very friendly staff...always willing to go above and beyond to fulfill your necessities. Breakfast was the best ever (try the cinnamon french toasts!) Pool, gardens, facilities are great. It is not your regular 5 stars hotel, it is your city mansion combined with your favorite 5 stars hotel. I highly recommend The Merrion!",5,2021,09,24
200,Best Hotel Experience,"We spent our 20th Anniversary at the Merrion. They made our stay memorable and our Anniversary one to remember. 
The Spa was amazing. The staff throughout the whole Hotel made myself and my wife feel special and looked after all our needs",5,2021,09,22
200,"Great location, service and accommodation",The hotel has a great central location allowing us to walk to most anything we wanted to do in Dublin.  The rooms are large and clean.  Service was friendly and professional from everyone we interacted.  There is a great outdoor courtyard to sit and have drinks as well as eat.  The Garden dining room was great and we had a breakfast and dinner during our stay.  Great hotel and will definitely be back!,5,2021,09,19
200,Best in Dublin,"We stayed in the Merrion Hotel for the Weekend of Sept 11,we brought a couple of friends from London as I wanted to show them Dublin,we had two garden rooms which were up to the expected standard with views over the beautifully laid out gardens,as there were some lockdown rules in place there were plenty of sanitising stations,masks available etc,We had dinner in the two star Patrick Gilbaud restaurant and it exceeded expectations,food was divine and service was. First class, in all a terrific weekend,should have said superb breakfasts",5,2021,09,19
200,A Dublin City Gem,"Myself and a friend stayed in the hotel for one night at the end of August, and I must say it was the best hotel stay I have ever had.
We were welcomed at the door by a smiling doorman who immediately offered to carry our bags to reception.
Upon check in, the very kind receptionist showed us through the hotel to our room, which was absolutely beautiful, facing the gardens and impeccably clean.
We had a swim booked in the spa, and were running a little late, but as we arrived in the spa, the lovely Eimear assured us there was no need to rush as we had the full hour to enjoy the pool! She walked us through the spa and offered us lockers with fresh bath robes and towels, and after we were done with the swim gave us merrion bags to carry our clothes back up to the room.
We enjoyed a pre-dinner drink in the Bar 23, where the bartender Brian made the best old fashioned I have ever had, and headed to the beautiful Garden Room restaurant where we were welcomed by the lovely Adil. He was so warm and friendly and made us feel so welcome! The restaurant itself was nothing short of stunning, especially the gardens.
Our waiter mayvine was an absolute delight and so professional. Service was so smooth and he was so friendly, we wanted to stay there all night! He did not rush us at all, and made sure to keep the drinks refreshed all night!. 
It was the highlight of our trip and we cannot wait to return!",5,2021,09,14
200,"Beautiful hotel, professional service.","Had the pleasure of having a bite to eat and a tea in the Merrion hotel. What immediately strikes you is how immaculate the place is, absolutely spotless and takes you back to the era of the building. The service is immaculate and the staff are clearly trained to be consistent in what they do. The quality of the food was excellent and whilst not the cheapest place you’ll get a club sandwich in Dublin, you’re paying for an experience. The pianist (who I’m told  plays on Sundays) was a lovely relaxing touch too.",5,2021,09,13
200,12/10 Would Recommend,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. The service? Amazing? The decor? Amazing. The drinks? Amazing. I could go on but you get the point.

Upon arriving at the hotel two porters assisted us with out bags with a cheery disposition. We went to the front desk to check in and since our room wasn't quite ready yet, they escorted us to the bar area to hang out. I ordered the Darjeeling Margaret's Hope tea and when it arrived the presentation was perfect and the tea itself is delicious. 

When our room was ready, someone from the front desk brought us our keys and told us that our bags were already in the room waiting for us. The room was beautiful and was more than what I had expected. I had a beautiful view of the garden area where you can eat which made my room even better than expected.

I was so sad I didn't get more time in the hotel as I was about town with friends but I can't wait to come back and do things I didn't get to do like afternoon tea.",5,2021,09,10
200,Best hotel in Dublin! Attentive luxury and a friendly welcome!,"My review title says it all … I’ve stayed in many Dublin hotels over the years. And The Merrion is simply the best. Hands down. Every aspect of my stay in the hotel exceeded my expectations and delivered completely on the 5 star hotel experience. The rooms are a beautiful classic French design, with soft cream hues and elegant furnishings - think the Ritz London albeit more subtle and understated. The hotel is boutique, but it has a beautiful garden square, which is lovely to have a drink or lunch in on a fine day. If it’s cold, attentive staff provide you with blankets.

Yes, the service is that good.

The cocktail bar is exceptional. I take my cocktails very seriously and The Merrion doesn’t mess around. It largely sticks to the classics and executes them perfectly. Some of the best French 75 and Old Fashioned cocktails I’ve had. The bar is quiet, so not for people that want to party. More a refined drink for couples. 

I didn’t eat dinner in the hotel, but the breakfast and lunch menus were varied, inventive, and delicious.

Possibly the biggest draw, however, is the unparalleled service. Due to it being a smaller 5 star, the staff know your name and are always there to assist you and are lightning fast. I have rarely experienced warm, friendly, and effective staff as good as this in hotels. 

First rate overall!",5,2021,09,06
200,Girls City Break - Treat yourself.,"We stayed at the Merrion in Aug for a girls city break. Coming back to the Merrion is my favourite thing to do. We had the warmest welcome from David on the steps of the hotel. This set the tone for our stay. This was my first time back since Covid; it was exceptional. The concierge team took care of us so well. Steven and Colm. Check-In was seamless.  We had lunch in the Garden Room restaurant, Lauren took care of us so well. We felt at home immediately.  We enjoyed an afternoon drink on the terrace. It was glorious. Our room was spotless and spacious. We had a nightcap(espresso martini's)  in the drawing rooms it was delicious. My favourite part was having breakfast in the Garden. It was a wonderful experience.  Covid restrictions were in place and it adds a lot of work to the staff to continue to provide a seamless and effortless experience (Esp Ellen).

The staff at the Merrion have always been fantastic and continue to make staying at the Merrion so special. I can't wait to stay again soon.",5,2021,09,01
200,Wedding event,"Stayed 2 nights while attending a wedding at the hotel and can only say it was a truly lovely experience. Staff could not be more welcoming and helpful in a charming understated way. Did have to ask for directions all the time as it is quite a maze but there was always someone to act as a tour guide although I suspect sometimes we went the scenic route! Food was excellent, atmosphere relaxed and Covid regulations so seamless were hardly noticed. I’m already looking forward to a return visit at some point in the future. Thanks to all involved.",5,2021,08,25
200,Dublin Heaven,"We stayed with our children at the Merrion hotel after too long an absence due to Covid. 

It has always been one of our favourite hotels in the world and it was as wonderful as we remembered.  From the doormen to the reception staff to the cleaners to the waiting staff they are all unbelievably friendly, helpful and willing to go the extra mile to make your stay a memorable one. 

We are already planning a return trip and wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",5,2021,08,17
200,"Short beaks at the Merrion Hotel, Dublin with four children","We had a truly wonderful one night stay at the Merrion this summer with our four children. The reservation staff and concierge couldn’t have been more helpful in providing us with suitable information to help us make the most of our trip and the staff, facilities, accommodation and food were more than worthy of the Merrion’s five star status. We had a wonderful rest and enjoyed every aspect. Thank you to everyone involved.",5,2021,08,11
200,Overnight package,"Myself and my husband returned recently to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. Facilities, food and staff are second to none. Although the hotel was busy, social distancing measures and use of face masks were observed and we felt safe. It was a lovely treat and we hope to make it a bi-annual event.
Sarah and Aidan",5,2021,08,11
200,Excellent,The Merrion thinks of everything - we just felt cocooned and minded for our entire stay. We had a wonderful time and were particularly impressed by the exceptional staff. We will be back and already can’t wait. One small issue was an error on our bill before we left but thankfully we spotted it so I would say to double check everything. Otherwise a perfect stay.,5,2021,08,10
200,Splendid,"This is our second time staying in the merrion hotel and nothing has changed still as good as ever,the room was fabulous  overlooking  the garden,we ate in the garden restaurant and it was delicious,  it was great to be out and about again,and the merrion was definitely  the best place to start.",5,2021,08,07
200,Superb city break location to lose yourself,"Superb 5* experience, staff so on their game, and friendly. Room amazing. Drinks fantastic. Food, while a bit tourist-orientated, was decent, but only slight gripe in our opinion. A little thought in that area would elevate this to the top. 
Location ideal. Recommended",5,2021,08,07
200,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Due to COVID, this year has all been about holidaying at home. Being from Dublin usually means you never stay in Dublin. But this year we decided to try a few of the hotels in Dublin and our first one was the Merrion. It’s in an excellent location with shops, pubs and parks nearby. So all we did was stroll around town, did some shopping, went on the Book of Kells tour in Trinityand just saw our city as Tourist. The hotel itself is excellent, the staff are very attentive and there is a nice central courtyard where you can sit out in the afternoon for a drink or a tea. We ate in the Garden room and had one of the nicest meals we ever had. This really topped our experience and why we gave the hotel 5 stars",5,2021,08,07
200,Special place in our hearts,"I just love the Merrion. Every time we stay we have a very special stay in Dublin. It  feels like an Oasis in the city, from the warm welcome from the doormen when you arrive at this historic buiding, to the interior gardens that you can relax into and forget about the hustle and bustle outside. The staff really make the Merrion - every interaction we had from the front desk to the waiters were incredible and you feel like they would do anything for you.",5,2021,08,05
200,Afternoon Tea,We had delicious Afternoon Tea and the service was excellent. Thank you to Gemma and staff for a personable experience. Would highly recommend. Really enjoyed learning about the paintings on display in the hotel.,5,2021,08,05
200,Magical,"I am a bit late with the review as I had my head in the clouds :) We got married in Merrion hotel at the end of June, it was only 5 of us, so it was just a small celebration! I am not sure was it all heightened by the lockdown and we were just out of it but it was magical! Hotel went above and beyond to make our small celebration unforgettable ...so our humble thank you from the bottom of our hearts goes to every single member of staff who made it possible :) The atmosphere was just dazzling, food was delicious , room was just lavishing ( thanks to the hotel for the treat ) and staff - staff what makes the place so wonderful. they made us feel at ease and welcoming. It was my first time stepping into this magical building and hopefully it won't be the last :) I often pass by Merrion hotel and I am delighted that anytime I will pass it will bring me the most wonderful memories.

Thank you... and I look forward coming back there sometime in the near future",5,2021,08,04
200,Five star experience throughout,"We spent three nights in The Merrion and loved it. All of the five star touches are there. Staff are friendly and accommodating. Pool is wonderful and special mention to Leanne in the spa who is the perfect mix of professional and warm. I am seven months pregnant and this was the perfect relaxing break, with all of the city amenities on the hotel doorstep if we wished to avail. Art in the hotel is incredible, gardens are great. Our room was very well appointed, bed super comfortable. Room service for dinner on the first night was of a high standard with great service. Breakfast each morning was delicious and service fabulous. Most especially, the hotel was extremely understanding when we couldn’t make our first night due to an unforeseen medical issue. They did not charge us for that night and held the room until the following morning when I was due to revive GP advice on whether I could travel. We had a really excellent experience overall.",5,2021,07,30
200,Best hotel in Dublin.,"Without doubt the finest hotel in Dublin. We’re lucky enough to live in Dublin yet we visit the Merrion regularly, even more so during the hot nights, we all need a bit of air con when it’s nearly 30 degrees. The team here are world class. We particularly want to mention Hugo serving in the garden, what a wonderful young man. My wife and I had a slightly off experience here not long ago, Martin and Kelly not just resolved it but made us love the hotel even more than we did before. We stayed here during our honeymoon through lockdown and they couldn’t have done more for us. We will be back time and time again. Thank you team Merrion. Thank you so much.",5,2021,07,29
200,Outstanding,"Probably the best hotel in Dublin.  I honestly can't fault a thing.  The attention to detail , the warm welcoming staff and fantastic concierge team make your stay so wonderful. You'd never know you were in a City but everything is on your doorstep too.",5,2021,07,27
200,Loved every minute,We absolutely loved every minute of our stay. The staff were amazing and so friendly. We got upgraded to a king suite which was really great room over looking the courtyard. We ate in the terrace restaurant and the food especially the pork belly was amazing. From the moment we arrived we felt like we were in a luxurious 5 star hotel hidden away in the heart of Dublin. Well worth a stay and a visit. The art work in the hotel is spectacular too.,5,2021,07,27
200,Beautiful stay and start to our Irish vacation,We started our Irish vacation at the Merrion. The location was great and a bit quiet but accessible. Not a typical hotel feel as this is a series of townhouses. The weather being hot created some issues with the air conditioning and we required cooling fans in one of our 2 rooms but they were very accommodating. The staff were great and helpful particularly in helping us arrange a rental car directly to the hotel and picking us up at the airport. The food was great although we had to wait a bit for lunch on the terrace as they did not have a lot of seating and no time limit for guests so we had about 45 minutes to wait in the drawing room.  Dinner was really nice. Would stay there again.,4,2021,07,26
200,Absolute luxury in the heart of Dublin,"We had a very memorable stay at The Merrion in July 2021. We availed of valet parking - the concierge team were very efficient and friendly. The check in was super fast, hygienic. We got assigned our suite in the main building on the third floor. Utter luxury! Amazing views over the stunning terrace/ gardens of this magnificent building.  Dinner and breakfast in the garden room were both flawless and the waiting staff were super friendly and warm. Couldnt recommend the hotel more! Enjoy",5,2021,07,26
200,Five star staff,Stayed one night in garden wing superior room. Room was spacious and very comfortable. Lovely view of garden. Staff make the hotel. Everyone from the minute we arrived to departure. Room service for dinner was five star . Breakfast ok some improvement required. Overall can’t wait to return.,5,2021,07,23
200,The Merrion sells perfection,"This week I was celebrating a very special occasion in Dublin. Choosing the Merrion hotel as our place to stay, dine and celebrate with family was the best decision I could have made. 

The hotel is simply stunning, it’s not like the others, the Shelbourne, Westbury and Westin are nice, lovely in fact, but not comparable to this hotel. The layout of the Merrion is different, it envelopes you into an exclusive, opulent and beautiful place far removed from the city it sits in the centre of. This is what really differentiates it from the others, how it make you feel, on every level. The Merrion makes it all about you and how you feel, the team unlock the essence of true 5 star hospitality as you walk through the doors. 

The rooms are magnificent, on a previous visit we stayed in the main house, on this occasion we stayed in the garden wing and in all honesty I would happily spent the rest of my days in either room and I’m only 33!! 

The service is exceptional, and I really mean exceptional. The food is glorious in both restaurants. On Wednesday evening we dined in the Garden Room basking in the celestial rays of the evening sun. All six of us could not fault the service, the menu or food. Everything was perfect! 

The Merrion doesn’t sell rooms, it sells perfection and there’s simply nowhere else in the city with that offering. 

Thank you team Merrion!  We will meet again!!",5,2021,07,23
200,Overnight stay,"From arriving at the hotel to departing the hotel everything was amazing the staff, food, beverages, room, concierge, pool facilities.  Nothing was a problem for any of the staff that we dealt with.  I would recommend a stay at this hotel to everyone.  It is quite expensive but it is a true saying 'You get what you pay for'

Well done to all the staff at the Merrion, you were a joy to deal with.",5,2021,07,14
200,Luxury weekend,Service from staff was exemplary. They were attentive to your every need. The hotel was presented to a very high standard. The rooms were spacious and clean. We stayed in the old house and had adjoining rooms. Food was good. The pool underground was big enough to do some laps and you can relax in the steam room or sauna after.,5,2021,07,10
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"We live in Dublin so we usually do a few one night stays per annum at the Merrion. Unfortunately with Covid this was not possible over the past 16 months until the recent lifting of lockdown restrictions. We did a Thursday night staycation with Dinner in the Garden Room and the whole experience was excellent. Great room with a view of the garden, really enjoyable dinner and outstanding service from the staff. Looking forward to staying again.",5,2021,07,09
200,The SUPERB Merrion Hotel,I have traveled through many countries and stayed in many hotels over my 50 yrs of travel. The Merrion has got to be in the top three.  The warmth and friendliness of the staff was amazing. The attention to detail within both our room and the overall hotel superb.  I really can’t wait until our next visit.,5,2021,07,06
200,Very nice stay,"Stayed here for just one night for our anniversary.  We booked the queen size bed room, it was a very small room but very comfortable and attention to detail was spot on, big bathroom too with plenty of toiletries and towels.  We didn’t get to use the pool as the only availability was our breakfast time which was given to us on arrival.  The ate in the garden restaurant and was just ok.  The breakfast the next morning was outstanding",4,2021,07,05
200,Refreshed,"Wouldn't be an everyday occurrence to get to stay in a hotel like this, it was a real treat to ourselves after a year and a half of this covid nightmare. It felt like luxury from start to finish. Lovely lunch in the drawing room followed by dinner in the garden restaurant that evening. Food on both occasions was fabulous. Breakfast the next morning was as good as you'd expect, delicious and plentiful. Room was beautiful, bed was amazing and staff without exception were friendly and helpful. I feel refreshed and ten feet tall after it. ",5,2021,07,04
200,Exceptional hotel,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in, I honestly couldn't fault a single aspect of our recent visit. The staff, service, food, room and extra touches were exceptional. Great location and easy access to everything in Dublin city centre.",5,2021,06,28
200,An amazing hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for one night as a group of six girls. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. The staff are so friendly , the rooms are exquisite and our dining experience was top class. I cannot wait to book another stay in this hotel in the future. A true five star experience.",5,2021,06,28
200,Restaurant,"Just back from a 2 night stay in the Merrion and we dined both nights in the Garden room and from the minute we entered it we were treated like royalty Adil the restaurant manager was amazing very professional but completely friendly and funny when seated at our table he  introduced our server Alexandre and she was fantastic explained everything on the menu guided us with our wine selection top class and on the second night we had Jessica so gorgeous and excellent at her job the 3 of them Adil Alexandre and Jessica are at the very top of there game and we hope to see them soon Alan and Ruth McGorrian

200,An absolutely outstanding visit to a superb hotel,"We have been regular visitors over the years and really looked forward to our first visit after the lockdown.    We were most pleasantly surprised at most things we encountered.   The whole place looks splendid, the staff are friendly, helpful and obviously happy to see guests return.      We did not think that The Merrion Hotel could improve but indeed it has, well done.    Surely it can't get better than this, anywhere.",5,2021,06,22
200,Fantastic 5 star experience ,"Stayed here with newborn. Absolutely brilliant staff and facilities. All in all we have no negative comments. Gorgeous food, superb location. Definitely will return.

Highly recommended to anyone visiting Dublin. Thanks to all at the team. ",5,2021,06,17
200,The MOST child friendly 5star!!!,"We had a fantastic 2 night stay. Our 3 year old was spoilt for the duration of the stay. The staff went above & beyond to make her feel welcome, from balloons, to a teddy bear, coloring books & lollipops! With an added touch of a mini robe & slippers in our room. It was really sweet to see a hotel make such an effort for the little ones. 
We really could not fault our stay, the level of professionalism is hard to beat. It is very evident that the staff are well trained. I found the interaction to be very genuine with everyone that we met.
Really happy to feel comfortable in the hotel in regards to Covid safely measurements in place.
Always a big hello from the doormen who were keen to help us with any requests that we had! Really cannot wait for our next visit!",5,2021,06,16
200,Good but Room to improve,"Stayed on 3rd June in a garden superior king room . 
Reception / Concierge:
Couldn’t fault them - very good . 
Room : 
room was fine -  the sound of the garden water feature and view of the garden was lovely . 
Terrace :
I had a club sandwich ( very good ) and a cocktail  while waiting on my husband .  We then had some wine each . Excellent service . 
Dinner :
Good food, waiter was excellent 
Bar:
Refused a drink at 11.04pm citing last orders 11pm despite wait staff in restaurant advising we could avail of bar until 11.30pm - we could easily have been on time had we known . Bar staff inexperienced. We were very disappointed  and to be quite frank it ruined the evening for us . ( We were fully aware that all residents needed to be back in their room by 11.30 as per Covid protocol and were totally fine with this ) .
Breakfast:
Lovely staff but disjointed service - cereal arrived with no milk , bread with no butter and toast didn’t arrive at all ( we did ask for these a few times ) . 
Lunch : 
We checked out before 12 and came back for lunch . The waitress facilitated us earlier then our booking and also allowed my husband order a club sandwich from the terrace menu - this we very much appreciated . A different waiter brought us the wrong bill but this was rectified quickly . 

Summary : excellent location.  Lovely garden terrace and a very relaxing ambience in the hotel  - although not quite a 5 star experience . 
I emailed the hotel about it and they did offer us a drink in the bar and a room upgrade when we return which was a nice gesture  and both appropriate and appreciated . 
Total bill €595 for 1 night breakfast  dinner , parking and drinks - terrace lunch , ( excluding lunch the following day c. €60) . You could find better value for your money",4,2021,06,15
200,Excellent hotel,"Just stayed in the Merrion for four nights and it was excellent. We were a family of four with two kids and the staff couldn’t do enough for us.

We stayed in the Merrion Suite which was beautiful and had a separate living area which was great with the kids.

We have stayed in the Westbury several times and this was our first time we stayed in the Merrion with the kids and we were really impressed. Pool, outside garden area all brilliant.

Was interesting to note how much better the speed of service and quality of food was in the restaurant on our second two nights versus our first two nights. Not sure if staff changed etc but would give food in restaurant 10/10 for last two nights but only 6 or 7/10 for first two nights. Hopefully this feedback is of some help. I know first two nights were Sunday and Monday of bank holiday weekend so was obviously busier which may have effected quality of food and service.

Thanks again for looking after us so well and we look forward to returning again.
",5,2021,06,10
200,Amazing experience,"Currently sitting out in the garden after checking out. Everything from start to finish of our night away was fantastic. Tracy from reservations looked after my booking and couldn’t have been more helpful. I mentioned it was my friends birthday and we were assigned a stunning room with a “happy birthday” plate in the room on arrival. We had a few delicious cocktails before dinner served by Hugo who was very professional , charming and friendly. After this we had a delicious three course dinner in the garden room. It was delicious food and the presentation was fantastic. As a vegan , a lot of places don’t have a very interesting choice but the flavours and creativity were phenomenal. All the staff we dealt with in the garden room made the evening. A big thanks to Shane , Thomas , Isabel and Jessica who made us feel totally welcome and made sure we had a wonderful experience. Again, another “happy birthday “ plate was delivered to our table with a candle to mark my friends birthday. We had a seamless experience and every single aspect was perfect. I can’t wait to return.",5,2021,06,10
200,Never disappoints,"Home after a most wonderful 2 night stay in this the best hotel in Dublin.
Once you arrive at the front door you know you are not going to be disappointed.
Check in is warm,welcoming and efficient.
The rooms are always serviced to the highest standards and feel well aired and fresh.
The garden room dining experience is always top class and the wine list is interesting ,balanced and has a superb French entry level Chardonnay and Bordeaux red for 40 euros approximately that were superb.
The athmosphere isn’t stuffy and great to see guest and staff interacting happily.
We look forward to returning again.
Well done to Management and staff for your great attention and courtesy",5,2021,06,09
200,Wonderful staycation,"10/10 stay. We had such a gorgeous time here, enjoying the pool, gym and the Garden Room restaurant. The service is second to none and the atmosphere is so warm and relaxing. We enjoyed our brunch in the sunshine on the patio outside, the whole thing was just glorious. Counting down until our next stay.",5,2021,06,05
200,EXcellent service and attentio to detail,The whole experience from the moment we arrived to our departure was amazing.  The staff were so friendly and welcoming. My son's wedding took place in the hotel and the attention to detail was incredible.  Even though the numbers were small due to Covid restrictions we had a fantastic time.,5,2021,01,06
200,Wow: by far the best Dublin Hotel I've ever stayed in! Over and above all the others!,"Amazing stay, and private dining room for small group allowed me as a vulnerable person feel safe! This place really is worth a stay! Treat yourself. The room I had is by far the nicest room I've ever stayed in, and it was clean and felt perfectly safe for travel during Covid-Time!
Dorothy and Peter McCann, and Sean the waiter were the shining stars of my stay: thank you all!",5,2021,01,05

200,A Joy as always,"On approaching the hotel , you know that you will be well looked after.  The staff are friendly and so professional.  All the measures were discreetly in place.

The Merrion always looks fabulous but even more so at this time of year.  Elegantly decorated.  
On leaving we always look forward to return visit.",5,2020,12,26
200,Super hotel ,"Stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights in December and loved it. Top marks for safety & service - the team is excellent. 

Food menu for breakfast was super  ( I would recommend the porridge with sweet berries as well as the Burren smoked salmon and poached eggs for breakfast. Accompanied by lots of Barry’s tea). Apparently the pancakes are worth sampling too.

Dinner menu was broader than last time I stayed and I’d totally recommend everything I’d sampled!

-Pate starter ( mix of foie gras, black pudding and ham hock - delicious )
-Steamed sea bass main was incredible 
-Scampi main with a saffron aioli ( and I ordered a portion of their yummy chips !)
-Sorbet selection as a light dessert option
-Meat eaters raves about the short rib and the turkey / ham ( it’s December after all).

The team is good with allergies. Thx!

The hotel is open to residents only & it felt safe to stay at during this COVID-19 pandemic. Super service.

Tip : 

There was a daily rate special offer when I booked —350euro for two including breakfast, dinner & a bottle of champagne - all daily !",5,2020,12,23
200,Everything about this hotel is *****,From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a warm smile and a friendly word. Check in was smooth and efficient. The room was superb. absolutely spotless. The staff are all wonderful. Going out of their way to help your stay be as memorable as possible. Wonderful dinner in the Garden Restaurant. Great cocktails in the cellar bar. Highly recommended for an indulgent break away.,5,2020,12,19
200,Flawless everytime,"I've been here a few times for family occasions and with friends and can not fault it. We've done lunches, dinners and afternoon tea and each time I find the staff attentive, service impeccable and the food is top notch. We went recently for an impromptu lunch and while the restaurant was busy it was accommodating and tables were well spaced.

Food choices are comprehensive as is the wine list. In normal times I love to while a few hours away here people watching but definitely didn't feel like we were being rushed along or anything  with new restrictions",5,2020,12,16
200,As always simply excellent,"We have stayed here before and hope to do so again. It's always been excellent. The staff really standout. Great location, near but not stuck in the middle of the downtown hubbub. The rooms in the old part of the hotel have the best character.",5,2020,12,12
200,Home from Home,"A stay in The Merrion is always an experience.  From the welcome at the door you just feel relaxed and looked after.  Our latest stay in the hotel was a little different due to Covid, but only a little different. The safety measures they have in place are excellent, while being unobtrusive, and had minimal impact on our stay.  The staff were, as always, excellent, friendly and helpful. One small gripe was the noise coming from a group of guests in the courtyard on one night but that's a small thing. I look forward to our next stay.",5,2020,11,30
200,Dublin’s finest ,"We’ve stayed in the Merrion many times and have a really great experience every time. The hotel and its staff are fantastic in every way. Lots of options for food and drinks; the Garden room is lovely for both breakfast and dinner and for something that bit extra special Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is unbelievably good. The bar is superb for a nice cocktail or glass of wine etc. The spa is lovely (though the addition of a spa bath would be amazing!). The rooms are fabulous, worth paying a little extra for the deluxe room and the photos attached are from the most beautiful room ever; junior suite - not sure the photos quite do it justice - just incredible. The lady who has checked us in a few times (last on October 11th) is so lovely & professional - we do love to see her on our arrival - incredible at her job and very memorable for that reason, apologies I cannot remember her name. The five star and seven star steal offers are absolutely amazing value. The Merrion Hotel is in a league of its own in Dublin - particularly during covid times - no short cuts, no cutting back on services, safe, clean and efficient and most of all luxurious. We’ll definitely be back. ",5,2020,11,08
200,Afternoon tea,"Unfortunately I lost my husband Allan in February 2018, three weeks after we had married. Every year since my fantastic friends help me celebrate our wedding anniversary. Allan had treated me to a birthday trip to the Merrion. We stayed in one of the suites in the Georgian house. It was magnificent. Peter McCann, who is an excellent manager, was very kind to us and we promised to come back. We never had the time, we thought we would have all the time in the world. So I could not have chosen a more special or suitable venue for my second wedding anniversary.

The afternoon tea was delicious, the staff so attentive but not intrusive. The atmosphere was relaxed but luxurious. The champagne, wonderful. I would highly recommend that people enjoy the delights of the Merrion when this terrible crisis is over. We need to be kind to ourselves and support such outstanding indigenous businesses. I will be back and so will Allan, in spirit. Thank you to all in the Merrion.",5,2020,11,06
200,Amazing Stay!,"Couldn't fault the Merrion at all, from extra safety precautions, to the spa, to the food - everything was wonderful. Was so lovely to spend a few days relaxing. As we're from Dublin and couldn't leave the county, we were worried that we wouldn't get into that 'holiday mode' but the Merrion had us relaxed the second we walked in the door. Staff so friendly and helpful, room was gorgeous and exceptionally clean. Amazing!",5,2020,11,02
200,Birthday treat,"Wow - it exceeded every expectation! Seriously, everything was perfect 👌Every aspect of our stay was as you would wish - from the time we abandoned our car at the door to the time it was returned to us on departure - with chilled bottled water for the journey.

It was the last night before lockdown and we were sad for everyone. We have reserved another stay after lockdown and that will give us something to look forward to. Keep doing what you are doing because it works. Thank you everyone 🙏",5,2020,10,30
200,The Merrion did it again !!,"Well we decided to have another staycation in Dublin and decided it had to be the Merrion Hotel again.
As before, it was simply stunning.
The service was 100%.  The friendly staff were excellent.
Who, by the way, all remember your name !!  Now thats professionalism at it's best.
The bedroom was luxurious beyond words.  From the bed linen to the Marble bathrooms,  the soft furnishings and the lighting, all beautiful.
The Swedish massage was outstanding which only made me want to relax in the lobby with a glass of wine and watch the world go by.
Thank you again.  Can't wait for our next stay.  John & Sarah x",5,2020,10,21
200,Just what the doctor ordered!!,"We’ve missed various celebrations this year so booked a night in The Merrion as a treat. We arrived at 1pm (for lunch) and our car was taken off us outside and we were checked in immediately. Room was just fab, cosy and spacious with all the luxuries you’d expect in a 5 star hotel. 

The hotel has a very intimate, boutique feel and every single staff member was an asset. Well done to whoever does the recruiting!

The Garden Room had lovely lightning and a lovely atmosphere and dinner was delicious.  The view over the little garden oasis was wonderful. We had a drink in the drawing room after dinner, with lovely background music by a harpist. What a treat! 

After breakfast, yet another delicious meal, I was so sad to leave and go back to the new normal. We are so lucky to live in Dublin and get to experience this amazing, wonderful hotel. Hope to return soon, this was just what we needed, thank you. 

",5,2020,10,18
200,Fantastic hotel! ,"Our trip was cancelled due to Covid restrictions and we weren’t allowed to leave County Dublin, so we treated ourselves to a night in the Merrion and it was absolutely lovely! The staff are so friendly and helpful, the room was gorgeous, the swimming pool was lovely and dinner was incredible. I have stayed in a lot of hotels - some for luxury breaks and some simply for convenience. This is probably the nicest hotel I have stayed in and I would happily return. Not a single complaint! ",5,2020,10,18
200,Wonderful experience,"Francesca on check in was absolutely wonderful. She was personable and professional, a great person to meet at the beginning of our stay. All other staff were excellent too. 

We booked the five star steal deal which included a bottle of champagne in our room which was there to enjoy when we checked in. Our room was stunning and very well appointed. The breakfast was gorgeous and were allowed a later check out which meant we could enjoy the hotel for longer. 

Would definitely stay and highly recommend.

Thank you to all the staff at The Merrion!",5,2020,10,15
200,Simply the best in Dublin,"We’re Dubliners who visit the Merrion for special occasions, currently we visit so we can have food and a drink in public. It’s the wife’s birthday this weekend and we made a last minute decision to come over for a lovely day. What incredible value. Dinner, breakfast and a bottle of champagne for less than the price of a room normally. If that wasn’t enough, the wonderful lady front of house gave us an upgrade to a suite in the main house. I wish we could afford to stay in this suite every visit, other rooms are incredible, the suites are mind blowing, and we’ve stayed at the savoy, claridges, adare, four seasons NY etc etc so we know good rooms and great hotels. It’s sad that Patrick Guilbaud is closed and we miss Stephane, Charles and the team but the garden room food was brilliant (top secret, some of PG chefs are working in the kitchen at the Merrion currently, 2 Michelin star chefs cooking here menu is hotel prices). This is a World class hotel. We will keep coming back until the bank manager stops us. Thank you Peter and I’m sorry but I can’t remember the front of house managers name but she’s fantastic, we asked for our normal room, she smiled and said “I think you’ll like the room you have today a bit more” was she ever right! She rang when we’d settled in and asked if we were happy, the answer was emphatically “yes, yes, yes and thank you” 

The one thing I will suggest and ask for is a way to tip without using cash as in the current environment cash isn’t acceptable and most of us don’t carry it. It would be great if we could tip the staff electronically in some way. Frankly it’s embarrassing for us to be unable to show our gratitude by passing a few euro over, I hate to seem rude and ungrateful. ",5,2020,10,11
200,Wonderful stay,"We were cracking up under Level 3 restrictions in Dublin and for self care we booked directly with the hotel.  We had a fabulous stay in room 183.  We dined in the Drawing room, and the Garden Restaurant.    The chefs are outstanding - loved the great dinner and fantastic breakfast.   Enjoyed our cocktails in Bar 23. Loved walking around the paradise garden.  Cleaners are super efficient. All the Staff we came in contact with were extremely helpful and friendly.  The swimming pool is 1.5 metres. We have been recommending the hotel and the Garden Restaurants to all our friends and family.  We are looking forward to a return trip.",5,2020,10,10
200,Amazing hotel!!,"Stayed 1 night in the Merrion, king deluxe room and it was fantastic. The staff were wonderful, so much thought and detail put in to the service and the rooms themselves. Staff in the Garden restaurant were so wonderful, it made the dinner and breakfast experience! Really loved our stay, can't wait to go back!!",5,2020,10,08
200,Faultless,"Wow - what an exceptional experience we had during our recent stay at the Merrion. A total five star experience from check in to check out, as my heading states it was completely faultless. The room was magnificent - so clean and welcoming with fluffy towels and bathrobes. We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast there and every meal was delicious and served to us by attentive, friendly and well trained staff. A particular mention to the Breakfast service, I'm still dreaming about those fluffy pancakes! 

Adherence to Covid regulations is strict but subtle, leaving us feeling safe but not feeling like it had taken away from our experience. 

Although short (too short!!), our one night stay was totally relaxing and when we got home the next day we both commented on how it felt like we had been gone for much longer than one night.

It looks like our planned trip away outside of Dublin later this year won't be happening with the new restrictions so we're immediately looking to the Merrion again for our last little getaway before our family of two becomes three in December!  

Thank you to everyone who made our trip such a special and memorable one, we will be back!",5,2020,10,06
200,Fabulous,"Stayed for one night - birthday celebration. From check-in to check-out, every moment was fantastic. Staff so friendly, welcoming, highly professional. Very safe: COVID guidelines being followed to the max. Delicious lunch in the lounge, bedroom beautiful, overlooking the garden. Dinner in main restaurant: perfect. Again COVID rules and distancing fully in place in the dining area. Breakfast one of the best. It was like a small bit of heaven, away from stress, for 24 hours. We will definitely be back. Thank you to the amazing team members there, who make the hotel one of the best I have ever stayed in .",5,2020,10,05
200,Very satisfied customers ,Spent a lovely night here. Felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. All our interactions with staff were excellent. It is very apparent that they are customer focused.Covid regulations are discretely reinforced making us feel safe and secure. Looking forward to our next visit.,5,2020,10,03
200,24 hours that beat any other break in 2020,"We cannot express how relaxing our short but sweet stay was. In this year, when a break was rare and hard earned, this was simply restorative. There is nothing we could fault. Nothing. 
The Merrion staff are simply the best. Our room was sublime and the food was excellent. 
Planning our next stay.... and definitely making it longer.",5,2020,09,25
200,Elegant,"From the top hat greeting at the  front door, through the warm and friendly front desk, to the pampered feel of the room, this place was great.  Attention to detail includes housekeeping wrapping your loose eclectic charging cords with a Velcro strap.  Incredible.  Morning breakfast also superior.",5,2020,09,21
200,The closest thing to heaven in Dublin,Everything about this hotel is excellent. We stayed during a very hot spell of weather and the gorgeous terrace is a beautiful oasis with its abundant foliage and trickling fountain well away from any sound of traffic. We enjoyed taking the hotel bicycles out to a favourite swimming spot at Seapoint for a dip and a sea breeze. The staff at the hotel were all so charming and accommodating. I look forward to returning! ,5,2020,09,19
200,"Outstanding Hotel, Staff and Weekend - Best Hotel in dublin",This is an outstanding hotel and we had a wonderful time - we stayed for the weekend (anniversary) and had dinner in the Garden Room. Everything was outstanding. We recommend the kayaking in the Liffey. Hotel is perfectly located for shopping; restaurants; museums and walking around Dublin. Staff and service is always there without being stuffy. True five star !,5,2020,09,16
200,“Top Hotel in Dublin “,"From arrival where our car was valet parked, to relaxed check in , deluxe room was perfect. Spot of lunch, perfect and drinks, perfect. I loved the bar and the relaxation areas , staff warm and friendly and professional. Beautiful breakfast room, didn’t try the pool or spa but I imagine they were in keeping with the rest of the hotel. 
Try and get a room in the main house , and even if you live near this wonderful establishment it’s worth treating yourself to a stay here . We had a wonderful time, our third time here and we will be back. ",5,2020,09,13
200,Another splendid staycation!,"You just can't beat The Merrion!
Faultless friendly service, gorgeous property and fabulous food.- and managing Covid safely discreetly but brilliantly 
We were very kindly upgraded to a speciality suite which was quite stunning - i nearly needed a ladder to reach the huge bed!! thank you so much!.
Thanks also to Allesandro in the Garden Restaurant  who was so lovely - the hotel  clearly values its wonderful staff. 
Can't wait for our next little tripette!",5,2020,09,12
200,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing!","We stayed in The Merrion on 11.09.20 and had an amazing experience from literally making the reservation, getting out of the car to driving away! 
Reservation: 
Very friendly, efficient and covered every aspect of out stay.
Arrival: 
2 friendly guy's (sorry hopeless with names) greeted me as I got out of the car, took my keys and carried my bags.
Check-In:
Effortless, we were on the BT package so they had our famous bag with voucher inside waiting for us.
Room:
Bright, comfortable & nice views of the garden. It was my 50th so I have to mention the Happy Birthday plate with mini fruit tarts, they were yummy!
Dinner:
We dined out. 
Breakfast:
We were down for 8.30 so the  Garden Room was nice and quiet. Service & food was excellent. Again nothing was a problem and had a lovely table over-looking the garden.
Check-out:
Again smooth-less. 
Drive away:
Nice gesture of bottled water for our journey home.
We don't get to stay away that often, and most times its 4 Star but this was a special occasion but it was worth every € for the experience and we will be back next year for our next special occasion!
So in summary, thanks to everyone in The Merrion, well done for doing an amazing job looking after your guests!",5,2020,09,12
200,Merrion staff practise the new Arts  of Irish hospitality,"There is no better place in Ireland to enjoy a staycation with total confidence in the provision of highest standards of anti-Covid  care. That's why we chose Dublin's No1 hotel, The Merrion', for our first holiday break away from Home Confinement; the fact that it has been offering a VERY attractive Dinner B&B deal also influenced our decision. What a wonderful hotel! What superb food in the Garden Room Restaurant! What brilliant staff throughout! As art lovers, we were able to spend a couple of hours with audioguides and catalogue maps exploring the hotel's famous collection of a hundred Irish paintings which have inspired the hotel's Art Afternoon Tea featuring unique treats created by patissiers rather than painters -- but equally delightful!",5,2020,09,10
200,Sent by Heaven ,"Like so many people,  I'm doing the staycation this year. Stayed in Wexford on Monday night and woke up on Tuesday morning,  thinking about where to stay on Tuesday night, I booked the Merrion on a whim!

From start to finish,  the entire experience was exceptional.  A very friendly young gentleman checked me in and kindly showed me to the bedroom.  Dined in the fabulous Glovers Alley that evening and when I returned to the hotel, enjoyed a nightcap in the drawing room. What a treat to return to the bedroom which had a welcoming turndown service!! 

 Had a great nights sleep and enjoyed a hearty breakfast in the morning  - had a great laugh with the waitress!  I live about 5 miles from the Merrion,  have visited it lots over the years,  but this was my first time to stay. I never take these type of experiences for granted, staying in the Merrion is one of life's special treats. Thanks to all the team for making my stay so special and thank you heaven for sending us the Merrion Hotel!",5,2020,09,09
200,Great food in a relaxed and safe environment,We had a lovely dinner in the Garden Room to celebrate a graduation. The service was exceptional and there was great attention to detail shown. While there  was a relaxed atmosphere in the room all covid protocols were strictly adhered to without impinging on the mood and the sense of occasion. The food was up to its usual high standard and the presentation was very elegant. We really appreciated the chef making up some garlic aioli for one of the party.We thoroughly enjoyed the evening.,5,2020,09,02
200,One of the best in the world.,"Outstanding hotel. Exceptional staff. Warm, welcoming atmosphere. Attention to detail makes the experience so memorable. The staff are some of the best in the business I’ve encountered having travelled the world over. 10/10. Will stay here again for sure.",5,2020,09,01
200,Luxurious  Hotel,"This is a special hotel,  everything is top-class, from the welcome on arrival, elegant king rooms, amazing gardens to relax with a drink in the sunshine, lovely spa area for swim and sauna and delicious food in the Garden restaurant.  All Covid procedures followed which were unobtrusive to comfort of guests.  Genuinely friendly staff on every corner.  We look forward to a return visit.
Treat yourself!",5,2020,08,31
200,Super experience ,"Stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights in August and loved it. Top marks for service
- the team is excellent. Food menu for breakfast and dinner is delicious. Incredible art on the walls ( make sure you do the tour)- some artists can also be seen in the national gallery ( just down the road).

The hotel is being run ok 50 percent occupancy to keep everyone safe so please support this wonderful hotel during this strange time. There’s a daily rate special offer on at present —350euro for two incl breakfast and dinner plus a bottle of champagne ! Excellent value.",5,2020,08,30
200,Relaxation at it’s best,Beautiful gem in the city. Exceptional service from arrival to departure. Lucky to have spent 2 nights bed and breakfast and evening meal at this fabulous hotel. The room was luxurious and the staff so attentive . The gardens and amenities are fabulous. Truly an experience to remember. Can’t wait to return.,5,2020,08,23
200,Exquisite Luxury Dublin Hotel,"Fortunate to stay one night for dinner and b&b. Gorgeous luxury hotel with impeccable levels of service and quality. Dinner in the garden room restaurant was fantastic. Only slight disappointment, given the quality of the food, was the cheese board. First world problems but it seemed quite meagre and cream crackers have no place on a luxury cheeseboard for the price charged. 

Room luxurious with comfortable bed and the queen room was large when compared to other queen rooms in 5 star Dublin City centre hotels.

One small criticism was breakfast - quality was great bar the full Irish breakfast which, given the quality of dinner the night before, was 4 star rather than 5 star.  

Overall fabulous hotel with more than a touch of luxury than other 5 star hotels and look forward to returning.

",5,2020,08,22
200,Anniversary Lock Down Treat,"Magnificent Merrion. Exceeding expectations from arrival. Upgrade on check in. Room perfect. Pool & Spa excellent. Dinner in The Garden Restaurant on a par with its Michelin Two Star Neighbour. Staycation at it's best. Ireland still excells at hospitality.  The Merrion provide a beautifull experience. A bargin compared to times past. 8 hours in and 36 to go. This is better than any other European Capital. Can't wait for breakfast, afternoon tea and the rest this gem has to offer. I'm ready for another 6 months of lock down as long as this Queen can revive me afterwords. Bon Fitz.xx",5,2020,08,21
200,Top Class,"We had a fantastic stay at this hotel from the moment we arrived until we departed we felt so cared for by every member of staff who genuinely go the extra mile to make sure you have an experience to remember.  Our room and early check in assigned to us by the lovely Petra was beautiful.  It overlooked the garden and had everything one could need for a relaxing stay. We enjoyed drinks in the garden in the afternoon. I had a swim and sauna (prebooked) in the very relaxing pool and spa area while my husband enjoyed reading the newspaper. Dinner that evening was a magical experience, the food was fabulous nothing was too much trouble. The Merrion Hotel have done an excellent job ensuring that COVID-19 safety measures are followed to a tee. We felt incredibly safe.....well done to all the team on that because it cannot be easy. The Merrion Hotel is truly a 5* gem in the city centre with wonderful character and art. We have already booked and are looking forward to our next stay.",5,2020,08,18
200,Exceptional hotel,"We stayed for one night and we absolutely loved it. Everyone was helpful and welcoming. The rooms were immaculate and the attention to detail was unreal. Breakfast was delicious and very relaxing. Had such a great stay, we have booked to return in December!!",5,2020,08,16
200,Some Disappointing Aspects,"This was our final stop on our mini-moon after our wedding in November 2019, which I booked as a wedding present for my husband as he has always wanted to stay in The Merrion but living in Dublin, it's a hard one to justify!

Firstly, the positives. We utterly adore The Cellar Bar, it's one of our favourite spots in Dublin and of course we popped in after dinner during our two night stay and were extremely well looked after, as always. 

Upon check-in, our room wasn't ready (although it was after 3pm) but we were told that if we could wait, we would be upgraded to a Junior Suite, which we happily accepted and took ourselves to the Lounge for a bite to eat and some drinks in the meantime, which was delicious as always. 

Then we come to the negatives. Whilst it was lovely to receive the upgrade and a complimentary bottle of champagne, we were surprised at the room and certainly would not have been happy if we paid the going rate for it. Our impression of the hotel was that the common areas and the areas open to the public are immaculate and inviting. Once inside the hotel in areas open to guests only, however, it is a different matter. The room and bathroom were dated. The hallways are dated and generally, everywhere feels tired and in need of a facelift.

Massages we booked the following day were without a doubt the worst massages of our lives. I came out of the massage more stressed than I went in, it was so bad. The lady who performed them was very nice but didn't seem to have a clue. No feedback was sought and she barely exerted any pressure. My husband also had a massage with her and said the same thing. The room was almost clinical looking, with bright lights. A bizarre and irritating experience, and it felt like we had wasted well over €200.  

The spa area is dingy looking and the carpet is truly awful and something out of the 80s. Why there is carpet at all in a spa is beyond me, and I was quite shocked by how dated the pool and spa areas were. 

Room service for dinner was good, but the lady who replenished our mini bar and also dropped breakfast to the room both mornings was very surly indeed. 

Overall, The Merrion was (surprisingly!) the dud amongst the hotels we stayed in for our mini-moon (Ashford Castle, Adare Manor, Ballyfin Demesne). We still love The Cellar Bar and have been back since, but we left strongly feeling that the guest-only areas of The Merrion need an urgent facelift.",3,2020,08,16
200,COVID WEDDING,Firstly I would like to thank Laura McGinn and Sean(John on his name tag) for being wonderful. The merrion needs more staff like you guys. You made the day so personable and relaxed. Anything we asked for they accommodated. Can’t thank them enough. ,5,2020,08,12
200,Simply Faultless,"Stayed here on the last night of our staycation, this is an amazing property with amazing staff.  The Merrion has achieved the enviable formula of being high class but not feeling “stuffy”.  Food and drinks are top drawer, staff are very attentive and friendly. Breakfast in bed was a great experience and I would highly recommend!!!",5,2020,08,10
200,A Home from Home,"Staying last week. Still Dublin's best hotel. Staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble.  very enjoyable stay.

Especially like the new way breakfast is served, a big improvement. Hope it can stay in the new format.",5,2020,08,08
200,Think tank break,Spent 2 nights in The Merrion. Fabulous facility with all the comforts and standards you’d expect. Above all the staff were the best I have experienced while staying at any hotel. Would highly recommend.,5,2020,08,06
200,Excellent ,"My family and I just had an excellent stay in the Merrion hotel. The staff are fabulous, in particular the breakfast team especially Alessandro who really looked after my son Alexander. The concierge outside with the top hats, nicest gentleman I have ever met. They suggested a trip to Malahide and we had the most enjoyable day. Staff couldn’t do enough for us. Thank you so much! ",5,2020,08,03
200,Outstanding,"Our stay at the Merrion was outstanding... from the moment of arrival to checking out I could not fault one thing. The staff were amazing, so friendly and nothing was a problem to them. The room was beautiful and contained hand sanitizer and wipes for us which was a lovely touch. Despite everything that is going on in the world we were able to have a beautiful escape where we knew we were safe and every precaution was being taken but it was so subtle it still felt normal with a lovely atmosphere. I am already looking into another stay!",5,2020,08,02
200,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights and what a fantastic friendly hotel. Everything about the hotel is great. Lovely staff and extremely friendly and helpful. Food was lovely in the garden restaurant and breakfast is a lovely selection of fruit. Pancakes etc and yes proper coffee.  Rooms and bathroom are very comfortable ,5,2020,07,26
200,Such an amazing luxurious hotel,"The Merrion is sheer luxury from the moment you step out of your car at the entrance until the moment you leave!!
Everyone without exception says “Welcome to The Merrion”. 
We were booked into an Executive Garden Room but were upgraded to a deluxe room in the main house. Our room was fabulous with lots of character looking out over Parliament Buildings. 
This hotel is full of character and style. We had a Bottle of Champagne  included in our package which we chose to have in the sunny garden terrace! This was truly lovely. Later in the evening we had dinner in the garden restaurant which was superb in every way. The hotel had good social distancing measures in place which were unobtrusive.
 Later in the evening we had a drink in the bar which was the perfect end to a perfect day!
Would certainly recommend this hotel for a special treat and some pampering!
Sheer luxury. 
Hope to return again.",5,2020,07,20
200,Absolutely amazing ,"I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the management and staff of this truly amazing hotel, for a most memorable overnight stay at your hotel. 
From once we checked in we were made so welcome ,and made feel so relaxed and everything the staff did in implementing the social distancing measures was impeccable ,without making the customer feel uncomfortable. 
Our bedroom was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated and meticulously clean.
The level of comfort was really Exceptional. 
We had dinner in the garden room restaurant, and again the level of service and hospitality was superb. The restaurant was beautiful and extremely relaxing and most importantly the food was amazing. I particularly liked the way the menu contained a large amount of locally sourced food and prepared to a five star service. 
Breakfast next morning again outstanding. The staff were extremely efficient and extremely helpful. Overall we thorough enjoyed our stay thanks for such a wonderful experience and most of all for all you did in making our stay with you so special. 
We certainly will be returning and
Continued success to you .

200,Recent stay at Merrion,"Absolutely love this hotel.
Even during a Pandemic, with all the appropriate measures in place to ensure everyone’s safety it still manages to provide an air of normality and old fashioned luxury in the 21st century.
Can’t wait for my next visit.",5,2020,07,16
200,Great to get afternoon tea here again,"The last 4 months have been really tough for everyone, as an end of lockdown treat we got afternoon tea at The Merrion. Unlike most venues there was no social distancing at the Merrion, its socially distanced all the time.

The amenity of the perfect 1800's interior completely unchanged and the comfort of the sofas the same as always. The sandwiches and scones were the usual perfection and the quality of service as warm as ever. The cakes here are always different depending on which of their artworks they are paying homage to. This time they were the best yet. We look forward to returning again in September and December for the coming birthdays",5,2020,07,08
200,Great experience,"We stayed one night and had our evening meal in the Garden Restaurant. It was the first night of operation for the hotel after the 'lock down' and they handled all the 'covid precautions' very well. We very much enjoyed our stay. The bedroom was super. All staff very friendly, efficient and helpful. Our evening meal and breakfast were both very good - as the title says above it was a great experience.

The location of the hotel is perfect for access to Grafton St and a range of centre city attractions.

One minor niggle - I had a business Zoom call and got 'your internet is unstable' message several times.

Their garden areas are delightful.",5,2020,07,08
200,A pleasure to take away,"We have enjoyed the Art afternoon tea over the years and were delighted that we could pick up afternoon tea from the Merrion for a family celebration. It was as thoughtfully presented as if we were in the hotel, lovely boxes all labelled to follow the menu and a choice of teas. The highlight for me was a beautiful pastry that looked like a Rose with a few dew drops on it. We missed wandering around to visit the artwork but hopefully we will get to do that again soon.",5,2020,06,23
200,Elton John Concert,Hotel was great and staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We enjoyed lunch in the cellar bar and happy hour in the bar on the main floor. They staff handled my golf clubs and helped sent them back to the states since we were not heading home but to Italy.,5,2020,04,13
200,Relaxed perfection,"My wife and I stayed at the Merrion hotel this weekend, and whilst the world outside had gone crazy with Covid-19, the team at the Merrion made sure that we had everything we needed for a relaxed few days, stolen away without the kids!! Huge thanks to the team, specifically David the doorman, who was welcoming and full of the Irish charm. We’ll be back without hesitation!!",5,2020,03,15
200,Luxurious,"It is difficult to write reviews for hotels like The Merrion. Its so faultless that all I can say is Perfect.
The staff make you feel so welcome. Everything from checking in, to the room and lunch in the Garden room was faultless.
A thoroughly memorable and enjoyable stay. Cannot praise it enough",5,2020,03,15
200,Brilliant!,"We stayed here the night we got engaged and the staff were nothing less than incredible. From knowing our names, to remembering we were ring shopping and to looking after us no matter what the request. 

All of the staff were incredibly nice, friendly and helpful. 

The amenities within the room are just fantastic, they have thought of everything! The beds are like a cloud and the pillows were so soft! 

The only thing I would change was the hotwater wasn't as hot as it could have been but that is so minor. 

The pool could do with an update considering how lovely the rest of the hotel is.",5,2020,03,11
200,The BEST Dublin option,"Can't believe that I haven't stayed here before. Head and shoulders better than the Shelbourne in almost every regard. The service is old school in the best sense of the word: staff are well trained, friendly and helpful. I was a little dubious about being in the annex, but our room was lovely, spacious and finished to a high standard. Our room looked into one of the 2 courtyards that are enclosed by the hotel- beautiful spaces that are so sheltered you can sit outside much of the year (well, if it isn't raining!).  It is a gracious experience that feels personal and welcoming. All of the food is excellent, whether in the Garden, the Cellar, or the Drawing rooms, and of course the Michelin 2 star restaurant, Guilbaud's, is just downstairs. It takes a lot of work to run a hotel this well, but they make it seem effortless. It's not inexpensive, but even the frugal one of us felt that it is good value.",5,2020,03,08
200,Attention to Details,"I stayed at the Merrion Hotel in February 2020 and was most impressed. This boutique hotel paid attention to every details for the suite we stayed. Service was excellent. The ambience was cozy and quaint. I particularly enjoyed their sumptuous breakfast, English garden and the audio tour of the art collection in the hotel. The location was also very convenient, within walking distance to most of the interesting sites.",5,2020,03,05
200,We’ll be back!,"Just loved this hotel, the rooms were perfect for our needs, wish I had stayed longer than 3 nights. I will book again in May when I return. Thanks for the wonderful service! I split my trip between the Merrion and the Shelbourne to experience both, felt the rooms here were a better value, had a better layout and the sitting areas were far more comfortable. Top notch!! Love your beautiful county and the countless nice people of Dublin! ",5,2020,02,29
200,Stunning hotel,"We have just spent 3 nights here for my wife’s birthday, from the moment we arrived to be welcomed by the door man until the time we left the staff were first class. The hotel is spotless and the food is delicious. The staff are the most friendly and helpful I have ever come across. Thank you for making my wife’s 40th special.

Malcolm & Rachel Jones",5,2020,02,29
200,Amazing hotel!,"As usual, an amazing experience. We usually stay with you once a year, for either of our children's birthdays, but this year surpassed all others. Our 7yr old was greeted with a birthday dessert to our room after check-in, a further dessert after our evening meal, jelly & ice-cream in the bar that same evening (accompanied by a song), and again, a birthday muffin at breakfast. Any of these in isolation would have been plenty, but to get all of them was overwhelming for a grateful child (and his parents).

To add to this, our 3yr old was a last-minute addition to the stay and the staff made a point of dropping up a robe & slippers to him, all gratefully received. 
To myself & my wife, the staff were amazing as ever - from the concierge charging my wife's mobile, to the night concierge going to our car to get our son's birthday presents for me at 11pm. 

All in all, an amazing visit, and we hope to be back again soon.",5,2020,02,25
200,From arrival to departure this hotel is flawless.,"The Merrion have restored my faith in the Irish Tourism industry. I actually felt the Cead Mile Failte, an aspect of our tourism trade that I feel had become extinct during the Celtic Tiger days, it's what we Irish do best and what gives us the edge when  it comes to countries to visit.. Keep it up, it was refreshing and heartwarming.",5,2020,02,25
200,What a great hotel,"Visited with friends for a couple of night the perfect base for a night in town or some of the restaurants locally .
Lovely surroundings with lovely staff
Lovely street art sales on Sundays just down the road 
The cellar bar not cheap but the service is great 
The garden room was great although a little expensive with food that was well presented and a good selection of wines 

Well done I will be back very soon ",5,2020,02,24
200,Weekend break,"What a gorgeous gem of a hotel. Absolutely deserves its status. From the initial greeting by the fabulous door staff through check in to the wonderful room, all perfect. This  is now on my list of ‘must return’ hotels. Perfect late valentines weekend break. Cellar bar fab. Thank you! 😍",5,2020,02,23
200,Not To Be Missed!,"Just returned from a trip to Dublin and a wonderful stay at The Merrion Hotel. We have traveled extensively and this hotel is at the top of our list. If you enjoy a morning workout followed by a great breakfast, an art tour, afternoon tea and world class dining this is the place for you.",5,2020,02,21
200,What a beautiful hotel with fantastic staff! ,We recently stayed in the Merrion and what a beautiful hotel. Behind the simple Georgian facade is a hotel with a mix of old and new. We loved the drawing room and the adjoining bar where we had the best tomato soup. The gardens in the centre of the hotel are so gorgeous and peaceful. Our room was very well appointed and we had a fab dinner in the garden room. However I think what makes this hotel is the staff-they are incredibly helpful and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and received a complementary bottle of champagne from the management which was very thoughtful. We would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2020,02,21
200,The Nicest Hotel in Dublin.,"From the moment you drive up to the door The Merrion is a wonderful experience, the valet parking is excellent and the concierge are so welcoming. Your luggage magically appears in your room!
Check in is swift as the staff are efficient. The decor is calming. The food is excellent. The hotel is understated yet elegant, without doubt it is the best place to stay in Dublin.",5,2020,02,21
200,Excellent ,"We were in Dublin with family for the day and called into The Merrion for a drink in No 23.
We had Guinness. Lucas served us. He made our day. He explained all about the history of the Merrion and made us so welcome.
Beautiful surroundings. We loved it. You may think its more expensive to have a drink here but it's actually cheaper than a pub in Temple Bar. I prefer The Merrion.
Thank you Lucas for excellent service. ",5,2020,02,20
200,Amazing as always,"Rather last minute plans for a trip to Dublin and our sixth stay at the Merrion. Interconnecting double/twin rooms for us and the kids. Concierge could not have been more helpful in charging the car. Kids bath robes were in room already which is nice that you don’t have to request them. But they were taken away during evening turn down which was a bit odd! Took us a while to find the rooms but when we did, they were beautifully presented and spacious. Pool area is spotlessly clean. Such comfortable beds. Breakfast was a bit chaotic- huge delay for cappuccino/ latte type drinks. Can the the garden room please have its own machine? However breakfast staff were exceptional and more than happy to source Nutella for my son. Very easy walk to Grafton Street. The best hotels create the unique touches- all our charger cables were tied up with Merrion branded cable ties at turn down and bottles of chilled water were in the car when we were leaving. Stability and reliability from the top. By the way, the chocolates were out of this world incredible. ",5,2020,02,19
200,Fantastic place,"what a great place to stay, you don t have to do anything, all is done for you, great service and staff even my car was parked, room fabulous food great very relaxing facilities at the centre of Dublin ",5,2020,02,16
200,Fabulous!,"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in, the service was of the highest standard, the food was beautifully prepared, and the staff genuinely friendly and helpful. My bed room was comfortable, and my sleep was above average for a hotel. I can highly recommend the Merrion Hotel.",5,2020,02,16
200,Perfection,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business in the garden wing king room, overlooking courtyard. Staff across the board, from reservations to checkin to restaurant staff were helpful, friendly, welcoming and professional. Tiernan (sp?) at the concierge desk expertly told me where to buy a gaelic football jersey for my son, and for which team. Room was beautifully appointed, with crisp linens, very comfortable mattress and luxurious white marble bathroom. Housekeeping was on point, even detangling all my cords in a Merrion-provided cord holder. Bar and restaurant staff made me feel comfortable as a solo, female traveler and the food was high quality.
Hotel is elegant, not trendy, and the location on Merrion Square is convenient to all of Dublin. 
Overall,very highly recommended for a truly luxurious, enjoyable stay.",5,2020,02,15
200,Excellent stay,"Stayed here for business, 2 nights. Extremely service oriented staff and spot on from the moment I arrived. Bag was dealt with immediately and brought to my room after checking in. Friendly welcome at check in, and I was personally escorted to my room. Room was very nice and very big. The bed slept wonderful and bathroom was very spacious. Used the gym twice, it is perhaps a bit small for the size of the hotel, was the equipment was good.
Summarized : if you are in Dublin and have the budget, this is a very good choice. ",5,2020,02,15
200,Overnight in Dublin,"I had an unplanned overnight stay at the Merrion recently and they could not have been more accommodating. Breakfast was very good and as you might expect in one of Dublin's top hotels. I was not there long enough to try out the spa and other amenities, maybe next time.",5,2020,02,12
200,Delivers Every Time!,"We have stayed at the hotel on numerous occasions and the hotel and its staff never disappoint. 
All the staff are friendly and helpful, and go out of their way to speak or offer assistance - nothing is ever too much bother.
Yes the hotel is expensive, but it delivers and more on every level every time... making each stay memorable and you looking forward to the next one.
It would be so very easy to stay and not go beyond relaxing in the hotel.",5,2020,02,10
200,Beautiful and well managed,The people who work at this hotel are so friendly and kind.  The bell staff and concierge are the best.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  Breakfast is fantastic. .  The housekeeping staff are very nice and also do a great job.  They even sewed a button for me.   I will always stay at the Merrion when Dublin. Just a great hotel.,5,2020,02,08
200,Best Hotel Dublin,"Dublin is one of the most expensive cities and this is one of themes expensive hotels, however this is one of the few places value outweighs price. We went for a long weekend break for the wife's birthday and the hotel far exceeded expectation.For those who may remember ""Are you being served?"" which was a TV series about a high class shop where staff bowed and scraped to every customers requirements this is an up to the minute hotel where the staff do their utmost to help at every turn you make in the hotel. From being greeted by full uniformed janitor and concierge staff we were invited in and arrived at reception. Though long before checkin (ours was an early Are Lingus flight from Birmingham) bags were stored and were were shown to a trendy bar where we had some Guinness (one of the national drinks, the other is whiskey - a bit too strong this time of day!). Shortly after lunch were were told the room was ready and there was a lovely surprise - our room had been updated to the main house and was much larger. Attention to detail was exceptional. There was a Spa and decided to book 2 75  minute full massages. Very quiet, private, and top drawer treatment. Lifts to room and short walk under cover to bar or Garden room restaurant (used for breakfast too). They are used to people getting lost in the hotel during initial orientation and soon get people moving again. A high standard of dress code and behaviour comes as standard though the bar can and does get a bit noisy in the evening. This works a top class gastro hotel, booking meals is essential as people come far and wide to eat here (open to non residents). We got to know a number of the staff very well very quickly. All have excellent manners and one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Very close to central Dublin though taxi best means of transport (you wouldn't stay here and use a bicycle for example!). Most of the staff melt in to the background though can cope with a large number coming/going without fuss",5,2020,02,04
200,Visitor non welcomed as in the Vatican,"Went to this hotel to greet a great friend of mine who is top American broker and was sleeping in the merrion ... Even though I was dressed no casual I was questioned 1 million times  before they gave me the go ahead to enter.  Despite that, the employeesbact  like the swiss guard in Vatican... everybody was following me and a bold porter with glasses asked with his bad English Italian accent  if I was sure that my friend was there I Answered in Italian ( as I come from Venice) but When he realized he made a mistake he started to use his phone while he was in service to pretend he disappeared .
In the end im currently working in hospitality as receptionist and I can say The hotels were create to welcome guests not be like a prison .more then merrion I would call it the Vatican hotel! Learn  to be warm from Shelbourne, the best 5 star hotel in Dublin",2,2020,02,03
200,Perfection at every turn,"From the minute you arrive the level of attention by the staff is truly exceptional. At every turn there is an amazing attention to detail wrapped in genuine friendliness. The staff manage to look after your every need without ever seeming over the top. The hotel and its ambiance is one of elegance and understated luxury. At every turn there are gorgeous works of art.

We had dinner in The Patrick Guilbaud restaurant which was an experience in itself. Flawless and Divine!

Wonderful well appointed comfortable rooms and a super relaxing breakfast in The Garden Room.

We have been before and hope to return to this fabulous oasis in the very heart of Dublin City Centre. Not cheap but worth every penny.",5,2020,02,02
200,Great Hotel... Great location,Very smart but friendly hotel set right in the heart of Dublin with great access to everything and loads of really good places to eat in teh locality. We treated ourselves to a meal in the attached two Michelin star Patrick Guilbaud restaurant which was simply stunning.... bars are good...  Good service... a good attention to detail... all in all ... a fine hotel... would happily stay again,5,2020,01,31
200,Patricia O’Neill ,"JUST PERFECT!!!!! My husband and myself stayed for the weekend and it was simply perfection.  The service , the food , the ambiance,   We have stayed in the other five star hotels in Dublin but the Merrion is without doubt in another league 
If you’re thinking of staying here do yourself a favour and book it !!!!! You will not be disappointed ",5,2020,01,29
200,Wonderful vegan afternoon tea,"I had vegan afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel recently.  It was a wonderful experience. 
There were two courses !  The first course comprised elegant savoury food, scones and cakes.  Carrot cake, lemon drizzle cake, walnut cake.........   all delicious and all vegan.
The second course consisted of three small delicious treats - fruit in pastry, creamy cheesecake and a vegan mousse. These were works of art.
The ambiance was great, the seating was very comfortable and the staff was professional, attentive and friendly.
A great experience👍😀",5,2020,01,27
200,Just perfect,My Sister and I dined in the Garden room on Friday night. when we entered the front door the welcome we got was outstanding and so warm. Each member of staff we passed had a smile and went out of their way to help. The atmosphere in the Garden room is amazing. Our table was by the window so we had a perfect view of the beautiful garden. The menu is amazing it caters to everyone needs. We ordered the sirloin steak and the chicken for main course. It was beautifully plated and my steak was like butter everything was seasoned to perfection. For dessert we order the Caramel Tart and the Mango parfait and it was so full of flavor and so well presented. Our waitress Julia was so friendly and nothing was to much effort. I would diffidently recommend an evening in the Garden Room. we look forward to returning.,5,2020,01,27
200,Friend's Pre 50th birthday treat,This hotel was truly fab. Attentive friendly staff from start to finish. Impeccable decor and quality in every aspect.  Personal attention and made to feel so special..got a fantastic suite complimentary and free Champagne...cant wait to return....VERY SOON I hope.,5,2020,01,26
200,Afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea in The Merrion Hotel yesterday. It was truly an fabulous experience and the sandwiches and pastries were just works of art. It really is Art Tea. You will not be disappointed.
The hotel and facilities are five star throughout and the staff are incredible.",5,2020,01,20
200,Afternoon Tea,"The Merrion puts on a great tea, I've now been on two different occasions.  The art of tea is really fun and more recently I had their holiday tea, very fun desserts.   This is a must do event when in Dublin.",5,2020,01,09
200,Terrible hammers and drills,"I reported workmen at 8am drilling and nailing to Laura Neilon duty manager and she did nothing. 

It’s 10.10 now and they’re still nailing at walls and floors. Laura advises that this is standard policy. 

Not standards I expect at all. ",1,2020,01,08
200,Exceptional Stay,"We loved everything about the hotel.  Our room was spacious, classically decorated and had a beautiful view of the gardens.  Breakfast was delicious and the service was excellent.  We loved the location for walking in the park, nearby restaurants and getting around the city.  We wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",5,2020,01,07
200,Really nice,Perfect situation in the heart of Dublin and such a 5 star level of service. The Tetra spa has had an incredible upgrade and is now state of the art. Accommodation proper class. The whole Hotel is Beautiful!,4,2020,01,06
200,True 5-star stay!,"My husband and I spent two nights at The Merrion in October. The hotel is well-located, next to Merrion Square, walking distance to St Stephen Green, Grafton St. and Trinity College. St Patrick's and Guiness storehouse are not so close, but it can be done walking.
Don't expect a grand entrance, it almost goes unnoticed. But as soon as you go past the lobby, you feel the elegance The Merrion irradiates all-around. We had booked our stay through American Express and it proved just great. Our room was very comfortable, ample, with some details I had never seen before in a 5-star hotel (housekeeping even rolled up the cable of our phone chargers and tied them up with a delicate velcro ""belt""). Everything was impeccably clean and neat.
Breakfast was complete, with many options, served in a room overlooking the lovely garden. 
We didn't have dinner at the hotel, but I'm sure the restaurants are amazing too (one of them enjoys Michelin stars).
Front Desk and concierge were also excellent, very helpful and attentive to our needs.
If ever in Dublin again, we'll definitely return to The Merrion!",5,2020,01,04
200,Lovely Hotel,"A lovely hotel with fantastic staff - The only reason it's getting 4 stars is it's quite a pricey place to stay and breakfast wasn't included, which then meant it was 64 euros for an omelette and a coffee for us both! The pool area is a little dated and the sauna is very small, only big enough for 3 people.

Other than those minor issues, its a lovely hotel with very nice rooms in a great location in the City of Dublin!

Again, cannot fault all the staff, they were all excellent!",4,2020,01,02
200,Christmas Eve/anniversary,"The most wonderful start to our Christmas came after staying at The Merrion on the 23rd.. 
Everything about this hotel is the dream.. from the beautiful reception area, the fantastic restaurants, quiet yet child friendly pool, super dreamy comfortable beds... and The most welcoming, friendly , professional and all round perfect team of staff members.,. 
Thank you all x",5,2019,12,31
200,Festive Afternoon Tea,"In my opinion, no afternoon tea is value for money food wise but in relation to the experience, we definitely received good value. We went for the Festive Afternoon Tea, as it has been recommended by a friend. The food was very nice and large portions. The range of teas and coffees was extensive. I tried one of the seasonal teas and it was excellent. The festive touches were a treat. Staff were friendly and very attentive. The Christmas carols were a nice touch. It was overall an enjoyable experience. I'll be returning to try the Art Afternoon Tea.",5,2019,12,31
200,Misleading.,Rooms are advertised on the website as “Merrion” rooms  but they are not in the Georgian house but they are rather in an annex. Beware! A very long walk and an anonymous room awaits you in the Garden Wing.,1,2019,12,30
200,Hard to fault,"We had a lovely stay at the Merrion in a Junior Suite in the old part of the hotel.   Beautiful furnishings, helpful staff, good quality food and relaxed ambiance made it impossible to fault.   A great swimming pool and pleasant spa area was a welcome extra.",5,2019,12,30
200,Old fashioned elegance ,Old world hotel with eager to please staff that’s sense of urgency undermines the serenity of a relaxing sit down by the fire place.  Where are they rushing to? Why vacuum the bar after each guest vacates a table? Sure I appreciate cleanliness but at what cost?   Otherwise lovely and well located ,4,2019,12,30
200,Old World Elegance,"Super comfortable room, very friendly staff eager to please.  Terrific Cellar Bar, congenial and knowledgeable barmen and extensive Irish whiskey selection.  The one very minor drawback is that in the lobby bar the staff vacuum after each guest leaves, which is noisy and detracts from the otherwise serene surroundings.",4,2019,12,30
200,Understated Elegance - exemplary service,"This was our third stay at the Merrion. We love the understated elegance and the superb service. Safe to say we are addicted! Be very hard to convince us to stay anywhere else. 

Particularly liked the new spa facilities- the relaxation suite is just beautiful and we loved the afternoon tea- not tried that before. 

A big thank you to Lucas for ensuring everything both before and after our arrival was taken care of. ",5,2019,12,29
200,Post Christmas break,"First impression say a lot and the minute the doorman says hello you know the place is good, beautiful appointed public rooms, I loved the bar and lounge. The bedrooms are large very comfortable with lovely finishing touches. I thought breakfast was a little expensive but boy was it good. A special mention to the breakfast maitre charming. It’s location is great everything on your doorstep. The service first class efficient yet very friendly. Looking forward to next Dublin trip so we can stay again.",5,2019,12,29
200,Weekend getaway,"My partner and I stayed here for a weekend just before Christmas. I have nothing but positive feedback for this beautiful hotel, the rooms are stunning and the cellar bar is great. The hotel was stunningly decorated in line with the festive season.",5,2019,12,27
200,A true 5 star hotel!,My husband and I stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights last week. This hotel boasts a top class team that gets everything right first time. The classic decor of the hotel is timeless - no faddishness here! I love the eclectic  art collection which is  dotted around the hotel. The service is impeccable and nothing is too much trouble. It goes without saying that the bedrooms are very comfortable with top quality beds and bedlinen. We stayed in a room overlooking the garden and it was totally quiet.  Breakfast in the Garden Room was excellent and the service here was very good . This is by far the best hotel in Dublin.,5,2019,12,25
200,Just lovely,Visited Cellar Bar recently. Staff were more than kind in sourcing a nice seating area on a busy evening. Person who seated us told us the history of the hotel. Very personal service and magically festive.,5,2019,12,19
200,Amazing!!,Stayed here with my boyfriend and our experience was amazing from start to finish. The Merrion Hotel is the definition of luxury and is perfect for celebrating any occasion. The service was excellent and all of the staff were professional and a delight! I will be back as soon as possible,5,2019,12,18
200,Another fabulous stay at this world class hotel,"Everything about the Merrion just works seamlessly.  This was my fourth stay and it only improves with each return visit.  Upon check in, the staff gave me a complementary upgrade to a King Room for 3 nights of my stay.  They didn't do a big song and dance about it either, just quietly informed at reception that they had done it.  The King room was comfortable and sparkling clean as Merrion rooms always are. I had room service delivered in the evening as a red eye flight meant I was too tired to go out.  The food (smoked salmon platter) was copious, beautifully presented and really an excellent bargain for food of the caliber.  Turn down service is always a lovely touch -- I was celebrating a special occasion and had a bottle of champagne that I had brought with me in my room.  Turn down service noted the bottle, and along with the ice that is delivered customarily delivered to your room in the evening, they also brought me an ice bucket for the champagne without my having to ask.  That epitomizes the Merrion -- they get the big details right  (rooms are quiet, clean, comfortable) but it's the attention to the small details that vaults the hotel into the top tier.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else when in Dublin.",5,2019,12,17
200,ABSOLUTELY APPALLING FROM START TO FINISH..!!,"What a total disaster of a hotel from arrival to departure!  

ARRIVAL: 
The check-in experience was nothing less than chaotic, so much so that I found it difficult to hear what the receptionist was saying other than that we were apparently way too early and must come back at 3.00pm for our room keys.  We could, however, she noted, avail of the hotel’s many facilities including the swimming pool and spa whilst we waited.  We found out later of course that we couldn’t have used the swimming pool as guests had to change in their rooms due to the changing facilities being closed for refurbishment.  There was no real meaningful welcome, guest respect or acknowledgment that we were anything other than one of the many patrons in the reception, most of whom were obviously only in the hotel for lunch/afternoon tea.

LUNCH:
We proceeded to the Drawing Room’s where we were advised that we could obtain sustenance only to find that both areas were packed to capacity.  We returned to reception and were directed to the Garden Terrace.  We entered the glazed link and were immediately met by a member of staff who asked if she could help.  We noted that we wanted to have some lunch and she directed us away from the Garden Terrace back to where we had just come from (obviously as the Garden Terrace was equally packed!).  We explained to her that there was no availability in the Drawing Room areas so she directed us downstairs to the Cellar Bar.

The access to the Cellar Bar was an experience for sure as it felt like we were back-of-house with staff rushing past us up and down the stairs as if an emergency evacuation of the area was under way.  We passed through an equally depressing drab toilet corridor to the Cellar Bar to find that it too was packed to capacity leaving us no option but to leave the hotel in dismay.

We found food in a nearby café and wandered around the area as we most certainly didn’t expect to be forced to leave the hotel, having just arrived. 

GARDEN WING/BEDROOM ACCOMMODATIONS:
Keys finally in hand and once past the glazed link the hotel décor matched the drab toilet corridor with unadorned walls and an almost hospital corridor like feel, which was a huge disappointment particularly given the décor advertised on their website, rich wallpapers, fabrics and period furniture being fully expected.  All we found was a miserable table by the lift with a few lonely apples for embellishment together with an out-of-place single armchair occupying a large corner corridor space which looked totally ridiculous, but, ironically, became very useful later on that evening (as outlined below!)

The room (No. 147) was equally disappointing with a cheap looking frameless mirror inside the door, the same drab painted walls, carpet lifting from the skirting boards and the bathroom door handle on the outside falling off (see attached photographs).  The interior of the bathroom was equally dated in décor with a small shower, single vanity basin and very little space for toiletry bags etc.  My wife wanted to warm-up after wandering around, given that we had been relieved of our suitcases earlier, not obviously knowing that we would be forced to leave the premises inappropriately dressed.  She noted that there were no bath salts/bubble bath to use, only some shower gel/shampoo which she had no alternative but to use. 

Meanwhile, in the bedroom area I couldn’t get the TV to work and finally discovered that the batteries had been put in so forcefully that the spring had been overworked such that the batteries couldn’t connect with each other to generate the required energy to power the unit.  The only thing available to me in the room to eventually free the battery was the refill cartridge from the writing pen on the desk.

PRE-DINNER DRINKS:
We made our way to the bar for pre-dinner drinks at 6.45pm only to find that we couldn’t get anywhere near the counter to place an order.  We literally ‘bumped’ into a member of staff and asked if there was anywhere else that we, as residents, could go and he directed us back upstairs to No. 23.  We waited there for a staff member who immediately asked if we were residents before showing us to the last available seat.  We ordered our drinks and were, for the first time since our arrival felt somewhat respected as hotel residents.  We noted immediately, however, that non-residents were being seated there too and some were simply just walking in and sitting down and telling the staff that they were ‘only here for dinner, but it’s too crowded in the bar so we’re sitting here instead’!!  This lack of control by the staff who obviously have no ability to protect this one and only amenity for the residents simply capped our experience of the hotel overall.  At this point we felt that we would have been better placed staying at a City centre ‘Budget Inn’ and then avail of the Merrion’s facilities as it was obvious that walk-in’s were given priority over the hotel’s actual residents.

7.40pm promptly arrived and cognisant of having been noted of the strict dining regulations of the Cellar Bar (i.e. table only available for 1 hour and 30 minutes and your reservation will be cancelled if your’e 15 minutes late…..) we hurried our drinks and set off for dinner.

DINNER:
Upon arrival we found that there was no designated area or person on hand to register our arrival and show us to our table.  We wandered around the area looking for a member of staff to tend to us, and eventually we hailed someone with a tablet in hand and announced our arrival.  He punched our name into his machine and said your reservation is for 8.00pm.  I immediately responded actually it’s 7.45pm at which point he smirked at me with a look suggestive of my being wrong.

In relation to my dinner reservation I received two email correspondences confirming 7.45pm (together with reiteration of the warnings noted above), followed by two telephone correspondences to me from the hotel confirming the booking together with a re-confirmation by the receptionist with the restaurant when we checked in, so in all 5 correspondences of various types were placed to secure the booking.

He noted that he had a table for us but that it was still occupied.  I pointed to an empty table set for two adjacent to where we were standing and said we’d have that instead but he ignored us and simply walked away from us leaving us standing there like fools.  He returned shortly thereafter and handed us two menu’s and said abruptly 'have a look at these while you wait'.  I was furious at this point as we had hurried our drinks in No. 23 bar upstairs to be left standing empty-handed waiting for our well pre-booked table and again protested that as residents we were being treated appalingly.  Sometime thereafter another member of staff approached us with 2 glasses of Prosecco as an apparent gesture to apologise for the delay.  These were impossible to drink as we were standing in the main circulation space with staff and patrons bumping into us from all sides.  20 minutes after our arrival (15 minutes past our booking time) we were finally seated.

At this point we were so annoyed that our appetites had diminished considerably.  We were re-presented with the menus again (rather they were dropped onto the table in front of us by our waiter who left as quickly as he arrived).  On his return some time later he took our main course order (entrees were declined for the above reason). 
 
The waiter asked if we wanted drinks which said we’d order when we finished our Prosecco’s.  The waiter did not return with our food rather it was delivered by another less formally dressed member of staff.  

An hour later the waiter and yet another member of staff returned to clear our table.  The waiter asked if we’d like anything else to which I answered yes, we’d have liked wine with our dinner, but you never came back to us.  He acknowledged that it was entirely his fault and offered to rectify his shortcomings directing us to the drinks menu, but by that stage it was just too late.

We were so disappointed that we did not want to be subjected to any further bad service so we left the restaurant without ordering anything else in a furious state as by this time our experiences in the hotel had been compounded to levels of total disbelief.

We simply gave up and decided to return to our room as we couldn’t tolerate it any further.  On the way I vented my frustration to the staff on duty on reception and informed them that I had left the restaurant in dismay mid-way through our meal.  They asked if I’d like to speak to Guest Relations which I declined as I was much too annoyed at that point to deal with another member of the hotel's staff.

On returning to our room at 9.00pm we found that it was being serviced by housekeeping.  We waited for a while (my wife on the lonely armchair adjacent to our room) with no sign of anyone finishing up and vacating the room.  I went back to the door and it finally opened and I again announced that we were waiting to return but he said that he wasn’t finished and had to replace the hand towels.  I returned to my wife who at this time couldn’t believe that we were still waiting to get into our room.  I went back to the door again to find that the housekeeper had in fact finished with our room and had commenced servicing the room opposite.

We failed to understand why he didn’t come up to us to let us know that he was finished as he plainly knew that we were waiting there, but that he did.  He simply carried on his merry way as if he had not encountered us at all leaving us like fools on the corridor.

You will see that us being treated like fools is a recurring theme of this review, but that is truthfully how we felt and were treated.

Some 10 minutes after finally getting into our room there was a knock on the door and it was the first of our two encounters with the Guest Relations Department, who stood there presenting a bottle of wine as a token of the hotels’ embarrassment for the way in which we had been treated.  I took this gesture as an absolute insult as it was the wine that we would have liked to have enjoyed with our meal earlier and outright refused it as ‘too little, too late’.  I spent at least 20 minutes standing at the bedroom door outlining the litany of disasters that we had been subjected to since our arrival which she noted and continually apologised for.  I was informed that our bill would be cancelled and also offered a complimentary breakfast for the following morning to try to make amends for the dreadful service encountered.

I seriously considered moving to alternative accommodation, but honestly by this time we were so stressed and exhausted that my wife needed to lie down.  

As advised we checked out around 9.00am and the Director of Guest Relations was there to meet us and to apologise again.  I noted that I could not possibly reiterate the litany of errors encountered and simply wanted to get out of the premises without further delay.  

He again offered us a complimentary breakfast before departing which I absolutely refused noting that I’d rather pay for it at another establishment rather than be subjected to any more of the hotels bad service and off we went.......NEVER TO RETURN.....!!!!

I received an email from the Director of Guest Relations some days later apologising for the appalling treatment we had been subjected to noting that we could return with their compliments , wherein they would give us a bottle of 'HOUSE WINE', with dinner.....how generous of them!!!!!

To cap off the entire experience when I checked my VISA bill a few days later we had been charged the FULL AMOUNT by the hotel.  I had to email the hotel to request the refund that I had been promised......WHAT A DISGRACE!!. 

I had written a very detailed letter of complaint to the General Manager and got a half-page response thanking me for my detailed letter and offering his sincere apologies for what we had to endure.  He also noted that.....'At this stage there is little else I can add to this and our previous apologies' and attached a VISA slip detailing the refund which they had processed and that was that.......

5 STAR LEADING HOTELS OF THE WORLD MEMBER.......I MOST DEFINITELY THINK NOT.  ANY BUDGET HOTEL WOULD TREAT THEIR GUESTS BETTER.",1,2019,12,12
200,Afternoon tea - Best in Dublin,"The festive afternoon tea is run every November where the usual sandwiches and scones are accompanied by themed Christmas cakes of a mince pie, Christmas tree and a macaron snowman. This is now our third year doing this and it is consistently excellent, nothing nicer than a roaring fire in the depths of winter with 5 star service and an afternoon tea that is the same standard as the M.O's Rosebery in Knightbridge.

We will certainly return again next year, confident the standard will be perfect.",5,2019,12,05
200,I don’t get it!?,"I have spent about an hour now going through the positive reviews for this hotel and I am just so confused... where were these people staying?? In my experience, this hotel room is tiny, old, dark and dated and the reception desk staff have not been at all accommodating. I checked in last night and am dreading my next 3 nights here. At luxury rates, I would expect a luxury hotel but this simply is not. The hotel room is comically small - so much so that room service didn’t even know where to place my dinner cart and ultimately had to put it in a location that blocked the entry and bathroom until it was removed. One of the closet doors is broken and closes back up as soon as you open it. The “city view” is eye level to a dumpster and that’s it. The heat vent rattled all night, waking me up. And worst of all, the staff were rude about it and claimed it was because I booked directly through their website and not through a third party travel agent. Only bookings through travel agents are eligible for upgrade... WHAT?! What type of business model is that? Isn’t it better for a hotel to get a direct booking through their staff? I’d never stay here again, especially not in the broom closet that is a “standard queen” room. Nothing redeeming about this hotel unless you’re paying a bottom dollar rate.",2,2019,12,05
200,The Marvellous Merrion,"Wonderful experience of a gorgeous hotel - I only stayed for one night just wished I had stayed for longer! 

I had a lovely drink in the bar on my own as travelling with business - and felt totally happy and relaxed even on a Friday night. 

I enjoyed fab room service in the room after a long bath and felt very pampered in my fluffy robe and slippers - look forward to returning! 
",5,2019,11,23
200,Wow Wow Wow !,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Merrion Hotel on November 16th 2019 for a very special occasion. It was the most perfect experience we have had yet. From the moment we arrived meeting the wonderful and pleasant door man who helped us with our bags to the moment we left. The whole experience was absolutely wonderful. The staff are amazing, professional and efficient. The food in the garden restaurant was stunning. The bedroom was beautiful with its fabulous bed, crisp bed linen comfy chairs and stunning bathroom. 
Loved every moment of our stay. 
We will be back for sure !  ",5,2019,11,19
200,Graduation overnight stay,"We booked interconnecting rooms for an overnight stay to celebrate our daughter’s graduation. Attentive doorman, pleasant efficient receptionist , perceptive concierge who advised taking an umbrella with us for a walk, very comfortable beds, fabulous breakfast, lovely lunch in cellar bar and all in all excellent service.",5,2019,11,18
200,Luxurious Irish Hospitality- not to be missed ☘️,We celebrated our daughters graduation 👩‍🎓 & Anniversary here & from check in with Pedro to Sean helping us to our suite. Everyone was so friendly & welcoming. Paul on the concierge desk suggested taking a panoramic photo of us outside - photo of the day! Cupcakes were a lovely touch too - thanks to all the team - we will be back 🙏🏻💚❤️,5,2019,11,13
200,Excellent City Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location - close to two parks and near museums.  The staff can’t be best- service is very good.  But with caveats. First , this is an adapted reuse of some very old townhouses.  Do you need to I stand that going in.  Our room extended accross the width of two of the original townhouses so there was an elevation change down to the bathroom.   We found it charming but others may not.   There is a more modern wing which may appeal to younger families for example. In addition , our room was very loud.  We heard folks in meeting rooms on one side and people watching TV in their room on the other side.   Interestingly I saw complaints online about street noise.  We had none of that. But the noise from our neighbors was annoying. Nonetheless I give it five stars.  It is a special place.  ",5,2019,11,11
200,A wonderful hotel with unequaled customer service,"Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by a top-hatted doorman (say Hi to Tommy for me!), and you won't have to worry about a single thing for the rest of your stay. I swear the maids (many of whom are actually men) must have cleaned our room four times a day. We never seemed to have a dirty towel. The high tea (Art Tea) was 2 hours of harp music, lovely tea, and fantastic sandwiches and pastries. And you leave with a catalog of the art collection housed in the hotel, three pieces of which inspired your dessert. (There's a self-guided art tour that's free to guests as well.) Be sure to check out the Cellar Bar while you're there (and order the mac and cheese)! The location is ideal as well, across the street from the National Art Gallery, a stone's throw from St. Stephen's Green, and 5-10 minute walk from Grafton Street.",5,2019,11,05
200,Where Elegance and Luxury Meet,"If you are looking for sheer luxury and elegance in the heart of Dublin look no further.  From the time the first concierge spots you heading for the steps of the hotel to the time you say your goodbyes you know that the staff are there to do your bidding.  Full marks to the reception staff too, they were courteous, efficient and friendly.
Our room (111) was a superior King Room and to say that it was well equipped would be an understatement, anything you could possibly want was provided.  The room was spacious and luxurious with comfortable seating, great wardrobe space and perfect bathroom facilities.  
When we booked we were asked was it for a special occasion - it was a birthday treat for my wife from our children - when we were brought to our room there was a lovely plate with a birthday greeting and two lovely pieces of confectionary.  Much appreciated.
The art collection in the hotel is well worth checking out.  There is a catalogue in every room which provides a great introduction to the collection and a self-guided tour of the collection is highly recommended.  All the greats of Irish art are represented and quite apart from the contemporary collection which is superb there is an interesting collection of older Irish and European pictures and some fine pieces of sculpture.
The breakfast, as one would expect, is excellent.  I opted for a very interesting Vegan breakfast and it was first class.
If you are looking for a really special treat book yourself a night or two in the Merrion Hotel where high quality service and and luxury will be the hallmarks of your stay.",5,2019,11,05
200,My Residence in Dublin,"Being a return guest, for me the Merrion Dublin can best be described as “an old friend” in the city. From the moment you ascend those granite front steps there is an air of familiarity about the place: the warmth of the welcome from the concierge through to the pleasant and efficient manner of those on the reception desk. 
We were accommodated in room 390 on this occasion which is in the main Georgian house. Located on the third floor and nestled between the Lord Antrim and Lord Monck suites, the room was bright and comfortable and offered a King bed along with a pretty sitting area and magnificent views over Government Buildings. Both the Housekeeping and Room Service staff were excellent, proving to be incredibly friendly without being intrusive. 
The public rooms of the hotel are an absolute joy, particularly to take tea in and once again the staff here proved exceptionally helpful, pleasant and friendly. On through to the hotel’s cocktail bar, No. 23, where Lorenzo the barman greeted us like old friends (indeed this theme repeated itself through that Saturday evening when we saw the GM greeting a number of other guests too). 
I think it is that genuine warmth and sincere welcome the team of The Merrion provide to their guests that really makes it stand out, where you are never made to feel like just another anonymous guest passing through. 
I look forward to returning once again, ascending those granite front steps to what has firmly become ‘my residence in Dublin’.",5,2019,11,04
200,Great Place to Stay in Dublin ,This is a fine well located hotel.  It is a converted former Georgian era home with lots of charm and character.  Breakfast was included with my stay and it was excellent.  The rooms were well appointed and quite lovely.  WiFi was free and worked well.  Walking distance to pubs and fine restaurants.  Museums and shopping were all within walking distance.  There is also a wonderful art collection throughout the hotel.  The staff was multi lingual and saw to our every need.  It all was positive.  You won’t be disappointed if you choose to stay here.,5,2019,11,03
200,High tea,"Outstanding service, beautiful food, more than enough for two with one order!! Really enjoyed the savoury selections, local ham and smoked salmon. Felt like we learned how the other half lives!! Lots ofTea and cocktail choices. Wish my mum was travelling with us.",5,2019,11,03
200,Perfect stay for my 40th Birthday!,"Stayed here for my 40th. We had a meal booked at another location so we only had soup and snacks in this hotel but they were beautiful. 

The staff are very friendly and the treatment we got from the second we left our car and throughout our stay was amazing. Everyone was so friendly. 

The room was perfect and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. 

The parking was €25 but that was no problem, especially for Dublin as parking prices are expensive. 

I will 100% be returning for another visit and I’m looking forward to it. 

Highly recommend this hotel!! ",5,2019,10,28
200,The Cellar bar ,"Fantastic evening, fabulous service, delicious food. Freshly made bread, Spanish Rioja 🍷Lovely cosy atmosphere with great attention to detail 👌👌👌👌👌👌
Recommend to all 🎈
A special thank you to Yahya, he made our evening spectacular. ",5,2019,10,26
200,A luxury escape within Dublin,"Everything about The Merrion was first class upon arrival. Front desk, concierge, restaurant, and everyone we encountered at The Merrion were very friendly and extremely helpful. Service was top notch.

The room was one of the finest rooms I've ever stayed in with all the amenities you would need. It was the most comfortable bed we had while staying in Ireland for a week. 

Dublin can be  very busy city but once you step foot into The Merrion you are transported to a private retreat. We were able to walk to every stop we planned on making in Dublin: Temple Bar area, Trinity College, Guinness, and St. Stephen's Green.",5,2019,10,26
200,Our favorite Dublin retreat,"This was our 4th stay at The Merrion and it never disappoints and always leaves us amazed at the experience and the world class level of service. It is so nice to be greeted by the familiar faces of Brian and the others at the door. The front desk staff are outstanding and always helpful. You are treated like family. The rooms are breathtaking, especially the suites in the historic section. The gifts in the rooms-gourmet Merrion chocolates, wine occasionally, water, etc are fantastic. The recent renovations in the back are beautiful. The breakfast buffet is remarkable and a daily highlight. The gardens are an oasis amid the bustle of the city. The audio art tour of the Merrion collection is a don’t miss. The sole on my shoe detached during a day of walking and Brian personally took them to a cobbler for repair. That is the level of 5 star service at the Merrion. I have recommended this hotel to many friends and colleagues and all have been just as impressed. You need to treat yourself to a stay at The Merrion if in Dublin. We will be back again soon.",5,2019,10,24
200,Perfect in Every Way,"We spent four nights at the Merrion Hotel before embarking on a cruise that began in Dublin. We had chosen it mostly on the basis of its location. We really knew nothing about it.  The Merrion simply does everything right.  The staff is wonderful, the housekeeping is immaculate, the food in its restaurant is terrific.  The only negative was the service in the cellar bar, but that's a nit. Dublin is a lovely, friendly city. The Merrion made our stay a genuine pleasure.",5,2019,10,21
200,A wonderful experience!!,"This really is the most wonderful hotel, stunning inside with a gallery of interesting paintings. Picturesque gardens are situated at the back of the hotel with a host of expertly kept plants.
The staff are friendly, hospitable and professional, the very best hotel staff I have ever experienced. 
We stayed in a beautiful suite with luxurious bedding and soft, comfy pillows.
Whilst staying at the hotel we ate in Patrick Guilbaud Restaurant, an experience not to be missed, drank cocktails in the cellar listening to a traditional Irish band. This was a truly memorable trip, this hotel is deserving of six stars( if it was possible ) Simply the best!!!!!",5,2019,10,21
200,Birthday Weekend,"Guys, got to tell you all bout this treasure. The staff are so welcoming from the second you arrive until you leave. The service is equal to anything I have experienced all over the world.
If you get a chance you must visit this place.
Enjoy Guys!",5,2019,10,20
200,Perfect until it’s intolerable,"My prior experiences at the Merrion were all 5 star - great location, historic building, quality service, memorable art - until they allowed a Wednesday night party under my suite to thump on until 1am. I could accept that in a chain hotel on a weekend. I can’t in a hotel that aspires to upscale business travelers. If you can’t sleep in a hotel because of the noise, it’s a 1 star at best, whatever the linen thread count.  I’ve enjoyed the Merrion in the past and planned to stay here for all my quarterly business trips to Dublin.  But no more. I hope their event sales tonight were worth it.",3,2019,10,16
200,"Top notch, best of the best!","I had the pleasure of staying at The Merrion from October 11-14. I have never had a more enjoyable experience at a hotel ever before. Right from when you arrive, you notice the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff. The attention to detail (small details), never goes unnoticed. The beauty, serenity are unmatched, and the cleanliness are of the highest level. This is truly a 5 star hotel of impeccable standards, unfortunately I was only here for a brief long weekend stay. This now is the new barometer for future hotels, but when I’m back in Dublin... I will only stay at The Merrion!",5,2019,10,16
200,Details,"The Merrion manages to balance the history and elegance of an established luxury hotel, with a sense of contemporary relevance.   A big part of this is their extraordinary art collection that greets you from every room and hallway.   The staff is very attentive, the rooms incredibly clean and well equipped, and the details of everything were taken care of in a way that normally doesn't happen in most hotels.   My stay was short but I'll be back to enjoy more of the Hotel Merrion.",5,2019,10,16
200,Sumptuous Irish Hospitality,"I am very late writing this review, I do realize! Ireland is one of the destinations where it was always on our list and it took an extra tug to get us there. That tug, turns out, was the Golden Tour of my favorite pop artist. After researching Dublin extensively and knowing my hotel taste, the only location in the city that would do was The Merrion. Let me tell you, from the moment we arrived for check in, to the moment we hit the taxi on the way out, this place ensured we were taken care and saw to every detail they could, each and every day.

Check in was wonderful. We arrived at 7:30AM fresh off a flight from the US. The brisk air hit us as we got out of the hotel’s hired Audi A8 and into the cozy, warm lobby. The hotel’s main areas are actually four joined Georgian townhomes, so there’s several rooms to walk through and enjoy. Obviously, our room was not ready at 7:30AM, so we were seated by the fireplace and treated to complementary coffee and biscuits. This is where we also bumped into a famous American actress who will remain anonymous. What a delight! After our coffee break, the hotel delivered our bags to the spa locker room so we could freshen up and change. I’ve been to many fantastic hotels around the world and this gesture, without even having to ask, was a very classy thing to do. I actually now use ESPA products at home because of the jet-lagged shower I had at the Merrion spa! I’ll never forget that morning.

The room was so comfortable and sumptuous, although a little traditional for my taste. It overlooked the lovely courtyard fountains. The autumn breeze while leaving the window open listening to the water made for some peaceful moments between sightseeing. The bed sheets were top quality, as were the mattresses. The bathroom was decked out in floor to ceiling marble and equipped with a separate shower and tub and Asprey amenities. In other words, all the trimmings expected in a world-class hotel.

The facilities are wonderful. The indoor pool and steam room we made plenty of use out of. The breakfast room was bright and airy. As it turns out, the person we came to see on tour was staying at The Merrion and we bumped into her tour manager and music director at breakfast! The sitting rooms at the front of the building are sumptuous and the hotel bar is lovely. They make a mean drink and hospitality in there is fantastic. We dined at Patrick Guilbaud one evening, the hotel’s fine dining establishment with two Michelin stars. What a stunning dining room and what a meal! It holds the place as best two-star experience we’ve had. As if the two desserts weren’t enough at the end, they wheeled over this huge chest of house-made chocolate truffles to round out the meal. It’s one of my favorite dining stories.

Overall, you cannot go wrong staying here. It is the most expensive place in town, but Dublin remains a relative bargain compared to other cities in Europe. Go ahead and do it!",5,2019,10,15
200,Anniversary ,"If I could give this hotel 10 stars I would do so.  It is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a lot of them!  
Everything about this hotel is top notch.  They are friendly and courteous to us through out our stay.  The service was A+.  It is so nice to go to a hotel where the people working there are about service.  A delightful visit.  I recommend this hotel without reservation.",5,2019,10,12
200,Absolutely superb,"This hotel is top-notch. From the very friendly and helpful staff and their services, to the excellent food, the wonderful rooms, the spa area, everything was perfect. I felt really taken care of, and I really have nothing bad to say!",5,2019,10,10
200,Superb,"Stayed at The Merrion during the summer and wow, what a beautiful hotel in the middle of Dublin. The staff are so welcoming and cant do enough for you. The rooms, food, service, bar, all are fabulous. Loved every minute . Lots of little touches that made the stay extra special.",5,2019,10,09
200,Heaven!,"Dublin is expensive, and The Merrion was *the* most expensive hotel in Dublin when we booked it. But the reviews on TripAdvisor were so extraordinary, we chose to splurge for a luxurious landing after a long, long trip from San Francisco. This hotel exceeded our highest expectations. Lovely. Intimate. Historic. The premier location in Dublin. With access to the Prime Minister's offices & National Gallery across the street, beautiful parks, lively restaurant scene. Everything. The staff are so attentive, the concierge infinitely helpful, fresh fruit basket so appreciated, the food in the large breakfast venue so wonderful -- have the buffet if you're in a hurry -- the harp at tea time in the living room, and the dinner in the Cellar Bar downstairs so perfect. Friends who have stayed in The Merrion say it's the most wonderful hotel they've ever experienced. It helped that we were able to get early check-in on arrival, but even without that -- it is indeed the most wonderful hotel we have ever experienced. Thank you to The Merrion for the care and hospitality.",5,2019,10,09
200,Sensational!,"Having hosted a birthday party at the Merrion eight years ago, this was my first return visit. While a little shocked at the price rises (!), I must say the Merrion is as good as ever - one of the world's great town house hotels. Mesmerised by the sensational art collection and my friend Rowan Gillespie's brilliant sculpture of James Joyce in the quad, I relaxed in the super comfortable drawing rooms and bar as before. An evening meal with friends was a little disappointing with some rather odd items on the menu, which didn't quite work! The gravadlax looked like four tiny hamburgers! But all is forgiven, as this is still one of my favourite hotels. Breakfast is ridiculously priced but very good. Again, forgiven! I didn't have time to make use of the sensational spa facilities on this visit. Next time!",5,2019,10,09
200,Lovely hotel for lunch,"I stopped off with friends for lunch when I was in Dublin recently. It is simply a charming place to visit with its fine rooms and great art adorning the walls. The service, food and atmosphere were excellent. I will come again.",5,2019,10,08
200,Hidden gem,"This is a beautiful, luxurious hotel - elegance at its best - very deceiving from the street facade - doesn’t look like much - in fact it looks all very understated and was not sure that I had been dropped off at the right place. But once inside - you experience all the beauty and elegance of a hotel that has so much on offer. From a very efficient doorman and super efficient reception staff to a lovely surprise at the luxury and size of room as well as all the amenities on offer. The staff are friendly - and go the extra mile - they have hospitality to a T - and make each guest feel special. Bed was super comfortable and bathroom was a pleasure. Had room service on my first night - food arrived promptly and quite delicious. Overall a fabulous stay. Also hotel is centrally located - a quick 10 minute walk and you are in the center of Dublin at Grafton Street.",5,2019,09,28
200,Luxury in a great Dublin location,"The Merrion was a very pleasant surprise. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but the entire experience was superior. I would recommend the Merrion to anyone traveling to Dublin for business or pleasure.",5,2019,09,24
200,An amazing stay,"We had a wonderful three night stay in The Merrion Hotel. The staff were so friendly and helpful. No request was too big or too small. Our room was in the main house and it was large and spacious with an open fireplace which gave a wonderful ambience. The housekeeping staff kept the room very clean and paid attention to every small detail. The food was excellent and the breakfast was amazing. My wife had a very restricted diet and they cooked everything fresh, specifically for her needs. I would highly reccomend this hotel and we look forward to returning to it in the near future.",5,2019,09,23
200,Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in,"I have a new favorite hotel in this world, and her name is The Merrion. Beautiful, understated, luxurious, elegant, and quietly confident, The Merrion is the kind of hotel that simultaneously makes you feel right at home and yet elevated & pampered. Service is amazing - fast, efficient, but always warm, friendly and polished.

Everything is so FLUFFY. The bath robe, towels, mattress, pillows, and duvet feel like marshmallows swallowing you in comfort and indulgence. It’s quite literally Cloud 9 every time you get back to your room after a day exploring Dublin. 

Location is excellent: relatively quiet street, but short walk to main shopping / F&B area. 

We had the Colley Suite, which is very large and over equipped (if there can be such a thing). Sound proofing is excellent too (even between rooms). 

Also: We met 2 separate concierge team members (including the Head Concierge, Lazlow) with the Golden Key, which tells you quite a lot about The Merrion. And yes, they can get you anything. 

For breakfast, order the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon - it’s the perfect portion size and absolutely divine. 

100% will be back in Dublin if only to stay here again! ",5,2019,09,22
200,The Best in Dublin,"The Merrion Hotel is by far the best choice for first class accommodations in Dublin. The hotel itself is classically beautiful and a visit there makes you feel like you are staying in a grand old townhouse rather than a big/busy, “this hotel could be anywhere”, property. The rooms are lovely, comfortable and well appointed. The food is delicious and the breakfast selections are vast. However, what really makes this hotel stand out is the staff and the service provided. Every member of the Merrion Team is amazing from the front desk, the concierge, the door staff, etc. Trust the concierge dining recommendations; they were amazing! I was traveling with my husband and my parents, who are older. The day we arrived my father needed some medical assistance and that staff took care of everything. They quickly arranged for a house doctor and assisted us in taking my dad to the hospital. Thankfully it was nothing serious but throughout the rest of the stay, the staff made sure to check in and make sure we had everything we needed. A big thanks goes out to all of the gentleman who man the front door-not only did they make sure to always ask my dad how he was doing everyday, they assisted him in ways that went above and beyond. If I could rate our stay more than 5 stars I would. A fantastic property run by superb staff! We will definitely return to The Merrion Hotel.",5,2019,09,20
200,Perfection,"Everything about this centrally located, high end Dublin hotel is just perfect.  A red-eye flight from NY caused our arrival at the hotel around 6:00 a.m.  We were served coffee and biscuits in the gracious salon followed by a eucalyptus-infused sauna and shower in the lovely spa followed by a delicious breakfast.  This was just enough to fortify us for a full day of touring the city.  The rooms in the garden wing are lovely (large, sumptuous linens, fabulous bath) overlooking the gardens.  The collection of art work is amazing and I believe there is an audio tour you can take.  Food in the Cellar Restaurant and Tavern was great (we agree that they have some of the best fish and chips in the city!) as was the daily breakfast buffet and hot service in the main dining room.  The hotel also has the only 2 star Michelin restaurant in the city, Patrick Guilard (we did not eat there, but the menu looked amazing). Every staff member was graciously warm and welcoming (front desk, footmen and restaurant wait staff, in particular).  If your travels bring you to Dublin and you want an exceptional lodging experience, the Merrion is the place for you.  We stayed in other luxury properties during our vacation (Dromomoland Castle, The Park  Hotel Kenmare and Ballynahinch Castle Hotel), but this was definitely my favorite.",5,2019,09,17
200,Art afternoon tea,"Fabulous experience, the food , the ambiance, the tea💞
When you feel you can’t eat or drink anymore have a stroll through courtyard garden and appreciate the artwork .
The staff serving were attentive , informative and charming.",5,2019,09,17
200,Concierge service,"This is a great hotel in Dublin with a great location.  Rooms are larger than most European hotel rooms, clean and well appointed.  The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5-star review was because the concierge service seemed to lack knowledge on the real local eateries but instead recommended touristy places with lackluster meals.  We got more information from local people we met along the way than the concierge service.We also found out after we left that private tours are available, something our concierge didn't mention at all during our stay.  The last night of our 4 night stay we discovered the hidden gem of a little bar between the tea room and Cellar Bar.  We didn't even know it was there till the last night. Now that I know this information I would stay there again, but just passing this on to future travelers for your benefit.",4,2019,09,15
200,Absolutely lovely!,"We had a fabulous experience at the Merrion. The room and common areas are elegant, the staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming, and there is great attention to detail. Our stay exceeded expectations. I can’t recommend highly enough! Just about perfect! A true 5 star hotel!",5,2019,09,13
200,I could spend the rest of my life here,"There are 5* hotels, and there are 5* hotels that are special; and The Merrion is definitely the latter. Being here felt comfortable and very special.
I could simply list everything that is right with this place, but that would be too boring. Let me just say that I felt taken care of from when I arrived until when I left.
I would love to return. Many thanks.",5,2019,09,12
200,A perfect birthday treat! ,"I had booked into the signature spa package which included treatments and lunch along with use of their facilities. On the way up unfortunately we got a call to inform us that the pool was closed due to a chlorine issue. I was of course not happy about this as we had come up early to use the pool. However, the staff were so fantastic on the day and supplied us with a lovely small breakfast as we were up there early, along with a gift for my mum’s birthday. Even though the pool was not in working order we still had such a wonderful time in the Spa. Alice and her team made our experience one to remember and we will definitely be back in the spa. Not only that, the service was also exceptional along with the food in the Garden Rooms. From the Spa to the restaurant the staff there acknowledged my mums birthday which made it a real special day for her. Thank you so much for a wonderful day out! ",5,2019,09,12
200,Understated Elegance,"Our third stay at the lovely hotel.  Super efficient and customer conscious staff. Fine food and dining served with an efficient staff.  
The room is well appointed and has everything you could want, including robes an slippers.
The staff goes out of their way to make the stay a pleasure.",5,2019,09,05
200,Central location,"Walking distance to many places in Dublin and a lovely hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was a superior king, and a good size, desk, bed, sitting area, 2 closets, minibar, safe, robes. Comfortable but firm bed, loved the pillows. Towels large and fluffy. Nice toiletries. The room would benefit from more storage: drawers or shelves, as we stayed 3 nights and would like to have unpacked our suitcases, but there was insufficient place to do so. While my eyes are pretty good, a stronger magnifying mirror in the bathroom with brighter lighting would have been appreciated. 

The Garden restaurant - this is where any meal of the day maybe taken (and open when their other restaurants are closed), including breakfast. We tried the breakfast once, which was quite enough. It was extraordinarily high priced for the offerings. The “buffet” included mostly breads/pastries, with some fruit, yogurt and cold cereals. The small plate of salami and cheese looked to have been there awhile. This for €26.50 and if you opt to add a hot item (on demand) it was €32.50. Definitely not good value nor worth that cost. 

The Cellar Bar and restaurant - very cosy, and some nice wines by the glass available. We had the seafood board, which wasn’t very good (see separate write up), but the service was very friendly. Closed Sunday night and the Monday night that we were there.

The gym was a decent size with mostly cardio and a few dumbbells, enough to get you through a few days. The pool had been open, but closed on our second day with no known reopening date. 

Overall, a nice hotel, pleasant staff, but we felt it was overpriced. ",4,2019,09,05
200,Absolutely first class hotel and exceptional service.,From the time you arrive until the time you leave it’s superb service and can not be faulted in any way. It’s a short walk to the town centre and in a great location for the whole of Dublin. We just can’t wait to visit again.,5,2019,09,04
200,The Garden Room Restaurant,"Lunch in The Garden Room is a delight.  Attentive service but never obseqeous.  There were 7 of us and we all found sonething gorgeous.  The halibut was cooked just perfectly, lovely sides. The highlight for me was the Passionfruit and Mango Souffle- a first but I will go back for it alone. 
Its 5 star food and worth every penny.",5,2019,09,04
200,Ireland trip,My wife and I made our first trip to Ireland. First stop in Dublin. This hotel was superb! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Very attentive to our needs while their and well located for activities in Dublin. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2019,08,28
200,Room was not ready at the agreed check in time of 3pm and room rates vary for same rooms.,"Arrived in the morning and droppped our luggage off, was told to come back for 3pm as the rooms would be ready at 3pm, when we arrived back at 3pm we were told there was a delay with the room being ready due to the hotel being fully occupied and the 3pm check in is not guarenteed. Also my brother and his family paid less for their rooms which were identical to the rooms i booked for my family.",4,2019,08,22
200,"Third stay, Beautiful but getting pricy.",The Merrion is a very nice hotel with a great location in Dublin.  This is my third stay and enjoyed it.  I did find this time that things are getting expensive.  Continental breakfast 38 Euros.  Regular 18 Euros.  I would stay again when in Dublin.,4,2019,08,20
200,Wedding Anniversary ,We had a wonderful experience in the Merrion. Everything was perfection from the minute we entered and we enjoyed all aspects of our stay. The service from the excellent staff was outstanding. Dinner in the Garden Restaurant was delicious and made our wedding anniversary the best ever. Breakfast the next morning was an absolute treat. Our tour of the amazing art work around the hotel was the icing on the cake. ,5,2019,08,18
200,A Wonderful Stay,"I was, recently, lucky enough to have stayed in the Merrion Hotel for a second visit. This is a wonderful hotel and deserves the fabulous reputation it has.  From the moment you get to the front of the hotel you are taken care of, the staff make this hotel exceptional and are so friendly, helpful and attentive.  It's a very relaxed place right in the heart of a busy Dublin city centre.  I couldn't recommend it enough and hope to be able to visit again soon.",5,2019,08,16
200,Best hotel In Dublin ,"It is a lovely hotel with excellent service.  My room is spacious and lovely.  The public spaces are gorgeous and the spa excellent.  It deserves five stars. It is a lovely old world hotel-
Elegant, understated and quiet.  It is worth the money.  I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.  

It is the only true 5 star hotel in town. 

It even has outside gardens where you can walk or have a meal. ",5,2019,08,14
200,Simply Perfect,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. I thought there was no way it would live up to it's #1 hotel in Dublin ranking, but it really did. The staff is great, very helpful and friendly. The concierge pretty much planned our Dublin stay for us—he recommended restaurants, made us dinner reservations each night, and recommended great places to go during the day, and it made our stay so wonderful! Our room was absolutely gorgeous: big and bright and so comfortable. And the hotel itself is beautiful, such a great place to order tea and relax. The location is great. We loved our stay here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone! I'll leave a separate review for Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, which is the 2 Michelin Star restaurant next door, but if you're thinking of going, go! It was one of the best meals I've ever had. We loved our time in Dublin, and The Merrion Hotel was a huge part of that! Thank you!!",5,2019,08,13
200,Wonderful!,"This charming, classy hotel is ideally located within a short walk of almost everything wonderful to do, see and eat in Dublin. You don't really need to leave the property, however, to enjoy the best of Dublin history, dining, art and culture. The Georgian architecture in the front of the hotel is complemented by a beautiful inner garden courtyard filled with fine paintings and sculptures.  The rooms are immaculate and fully updated with beautiful furniture and fittings.  The spa and pool in the basement are recently renovated and lovely, and the many dining venues are all first rate.  Best of all, every staff member we had the pleasure of meeting was polite, friendly and highly competent.",5,2019,08,13
200,They say it is the best hotel in town and it is,Location is wonderful. Right near everything but on a quiet street so you are not int he noisy hubbub like the other 5 star hotels are. The service is beyond!!!!!! The cellar bar is terrific and breakfast is wonderful! We didn't have time to eat in their 2 star Michelin restaurant but it looked wonderful. The hotel is renovated and charming and the rooms are lovely and very well appointed.,5,2019,08,12
200,One of the Best,This hotel is superb in every way. Courteous friendly service from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave.  They really understand attention to detail and provide those extra touches that other hotels talk about but never do. The suites are beautifully presented with lots of thoughtful touches like the straps to keep your computer cords tidy and a wide variety of amenities in the bathroom. There is always someone on-hand to provide advice or assistance with a smile when needed. Central location couldn't be better. My wife and I have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful hotel.,5,2019,08,11
200,Fabulous stay,"The staff was most accommodating, our rooms were wonderful, the Garden Room offered a delicious breakfast with friendly and attentive staff, the pool was perfect for lap swimming, the concierge staff was most helpful and thoughtful, and we had a fabulous and memorable dinner at Patrick Guilbaud's Michelin 2 star restaurant, one of the best meals I've had. The Merrion is a special place- the hotel itself is beautiful and well cared for but what sets this special hotel further apart is the staff who in their kind and caring way make you feel right at home.",5,2019,08,07
200,Afternoon Tea ,"Visited this hotel for a last minute afternoon tea after being turned away at a few other hotels, first off... WOW! This hotel is gorgeous, unique, and absolutely elegant. The service for tea was amazing, we felt we were having such a unique experience and it was absolutely delicious. The tea has a tie in with the incredible art collection which made it truly one-of-a-kind. Highly recommend taking some time for afternoon tea at the Merrion! ",5,2019,08,07
200,Old-world Charm and World-Class Service,"We bounced around Ireland on a holiday in July, and the Merrion was our last stop.  This is a high-end luxury hotel with lovely gardens, a 2-star Michelin restaurant, excellent and highly professional service, and a relaxed, luxury vibe.  Rooms were spacious, but expensive.  Room bathrooms are very lovely.  Staff were all 100% professional.  the property is situated in a great part of Dublin with close access to the city-sights, as well as a terrific higher-end shopping area and plenty of restaurants nearby.  The music scene on the weekends (in pubs, or on the street) is also thriving this time of year.

I rate this as 5-stars, but note that it is an expensive place to stay in Dublin, so others may rate lower than 5-stars if budget conscious.  We used this as our last stop before the long flight home, and felt pampered throughout our stay.",5,2019,08,06
200,Wow!! Absolutely Perfect.,"I’m not sure where to start with this review as it’s not often you visit somewhere where absolutely everything is perfect, but the Merrion just offers everything you could want and more! 
The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble, receptionists and concierge so welcoming,  the rooms are wonderful and room attendants make the rooms perfect.

The restaurant: food and wine cooked and delivered so well, the cellar bar and cocktail bar great! 

I have to admit this, unfortunately this was a massive treat for us as it is more than we would normal spend on a hotel but worth every penny!
Thankyou to all the staff who made our visit so fantastic and memorable I hope we can return one day!! ",5,2019,08,06
200,Only the Finest,"If you’re used to luxury, unparalleled service and first class everything, then you have found the perfect hotel for a Dublin visit. The location is central and the accommodations are wonderful. We took an apartment sized suite and it was appointed with the best of everything. The food was delicious and the staff friendly and helpful. This was expensive but well worth the money. It’s just perfect for a short or a long stay.",5,2019,08,04
200,A perfect 10,"We spent a lovely weekend at this stylish yet homey hotel at the heart of Dublin. Amazing location, large comfortable rooms and a beautiful garden in the middle to relax and have a drink in the afternoon or morning coffee. But above all, the staff was superb. The highest  quality of service you can get in  a hotel. It’s not cheap but is well worth every Euro!",5,2019,08,04
200,"We never do, and never will, stay anywhere else in Dublin","Having been fortunate to stay at some special hotels, we wondered: could the Merrion live up to our memories from prior trips years ago?  We needn’t have worried.  I guess the best way to convey our experience is to say that the hotel anticipates one’s every need.  The service is friendly, confident and polished.  The property is well-maintained, feeling both classic and contemporary.  One is made to feel so welcome.  We’ve never considered staying elsewhere in Dublin, and it’s hard to imagine we ever will.",5,2019,07,30
200,The service here is amazing the staff are fantastic,"This is the second time here and this time we had our Grandson with us. They gave us a beautiful room overlooking the central courtyard. It was large light and bright during the day and had block out curtains for the  
Night. The room had everything you would want from toiletries to Tea & Coffee facilities. The bed was new and flat so I woke up in the morning without any back pain 
The breakfast buffet was quite extensive too
The staff throughout the hotel were all attentive polite and helpful",5,2019,07,29
200,Everything was perfect ,"Amazing service, attention to detail. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Thank you for such a perfect weekend. Lunch on the terrace was beautiful and afternoon tea was delicious. Such a delightful stay. ",5,2019,07,27
200,Birthday Treat,"My husband booked an overnight stay as part of my Birthday.  We got a room upgrade. The room was absolutely beautiful.  I've only ever stayed in the garden rooms so to stay in the main house was a real treat. 
All staff were very friendly. Drinks and snacks in no.23 bar were excellent.  
Room service breakfast was perfect and arrived bang on time. 
Valet service was super. We appreciated the cool water left in our car for our journey home as it was a very warm day. 

Another fab stay in my favourite hotel. We will definitely return. ",5,2019,07,27
200,A Very Comfortable Stay,"This hotel is a very elegant hotel located in an old Georgian building. It looks very stark with no ornamentation from the outside but that is deceiving as it is very elegant on the inside. The staff is abundant and very helpful. We arrived around noon and unfortunately weren’t able to get an early check-in, which was unfortunate. The Bellman stored our luggage when we arrived, Our room, #307,  is ready at 3 o’clock, and our luggage was already in our room which was a nice touch. The room was very comfortable, the bed large with luxurious linens and a fine duvet cover. The only window in the room overlooked the central courtyard. The room was very quiet at night, and the black out curtains made it very dark. The bathroom is very well appointed, with unfortunately a small shower, but did have a nice bathtub. Surprising to only have one bathroom sink in a room costing this much. We received a nice welcome basket of fruit, and complementary water in nice large glass bottles. There was a coffee making service. All in all this was a good hotel stay. While we didn’t receive chocolates at turn down each evening, we did receive a very nice box of six chocolates on our last evening at the hotel. This hotel is very well located in the city with easy walking distance to many attractions.",4,2019,07,24
200,Lovely Stay,"The Merrion Hotel which dates back to the 1700s lives up to its 5-Star rating in every way. It’s well-located, across from the Irish Parliament, walking distance to the Liffey River, the National Art Gallery, St. Steven’s Green, top restaurants and convenient shopping.  The rooms were cozy and quiet, with a large bath and Asprey amenities. The staff stands out, from the doormen, to the concierge and reception staff. Housekeeping left several small, but notable surprises each time they serviced my room-like Velcro ties for my cell phone cable. I would encourage you to dine at the only 2 Michelin starred restaurant in Ireland, located in the hotel-lunch or dinner.  It was stunning and memorable.",5,2019,07,23
200,Beautiful,"We had a wonderful overnight stay in the merrion hotel,we loved every minute  of the stay there are two beautiful gardens which we sat in for much of the day it was so peaceful it was hard to believe we were in the city,the young man that served  us drinks was so pleasant and professional, we had lunch in the cellar bar it was delicious, our room was  ready a little later than expected and we were offered a free drink which we did'nt expect.our room was overlooking the gardens and was spotlessly clean and bright.we certainly  intend to go back.",5,2019,07,23
200,Afternoon tea at the 5star Merrion Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel. The afternoon tea was served to us while relaxing in a beautiful drawing room complete with an open fire. 
The service was fab the hostess was amazing. She brought us on a journey and describe everything in detail. We had pastries which were    designed  to compliment the 19th-20th century art which is on display. 
The delectables were served to us on fine bone china. 
We had champagne to start and then miniature pastries, a delicious array of tiny sandwiches and scones all served with a choice of blended teas or coffees.  
We had desserts to finish which depicted the art and our hostess described everything in detail. The pastry chef heard it was our birthday treat and he decorated our plates for us.
The whole afternoon tea was a delight a real treat and a most enjoyable experience. ",5,2019,07,22
200,Loved Staying Here,"We had the most comfortable room at the Merrion Hotel - one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, super helpful concierge staff, a great breakfast every morning and an awesome location.  We stayed here on our arrival into Dublin and stayed somewhere else when we were leaving Dublin.  Both my husband and I regretted staying somewhere else.  Would definitely go back there.",5,2019,07,21
200,Mid week stay,"We recently stayed in The Merrion Hotel using a voucher that we had been given by our family last Christmas.  We have had the pleasure of staying there a couple of times before and this time was as wonderful as our last visits.  I can honestly say it is the best 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in, it is a wonderful experience from the minute you arrive until you check out. The staff are fantastic, charming, friendly, efficient and discreet, the bedrooms are beautiful and are so luxurious, the bed linen is exquisite - the nicest bed linen I have ever slept in and the beds are blissfully comfortable, the rooms have water and ice bucket, a mini bar with some nice bits and bobs in them, a Nespresso coffee machine and also kettle, the bathrooms have lovely robes and towel and there were fresh flowers in the room/. The turn down service was something else with out slippers laid out by the bed, phone cables tidied up and wrapped in Merrion ties, and when we got our back from the valet service there were bottles of water in the car too.  I can honestly say that the service is impeccable and the staff really lovely.  This is definitely my favourite hotel.",5,2019,07,21
200,Excellent,"We had our wedding drinks reception in the cellar bar. 

We got some platters and there were amazing. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed them. They loved the ambiance of the cellar bar but the icing on the cake was the beautiful manicured gardens where we got some great photos. 

Special thanks to Laura and the events team for ensuring everything went smoothly. 

",5,2019,07,19
200,I love these people!,"This hotel was absolutely beautiful to begin with, but what made it more so were the friendly and helpful people.  Everyone from the concierge to the lovely ladies at the front desk to the room service staff was delightful, friendly, and kind.  We stayed for several days, went to Ashford, and then returned for one more night before departing Dublin.  We even received a complimentary upgrade for the second stay!  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  It met and exceeded all our our expectations!",5,2019,07,16
200,"Comfort, convenience and elegance at the Merrion","We had a wonderful two night stay at the Merrion. They were very accommodating in arranging two connecting rooms for us. The beds were very comfortable, allowing a great sleep after the long overnight flight. The rooms are well appointed with a Nespresso machine and they provided some delicious chocolates, fruit and waters. The location is perfect, convenient to most of Dublin's great sites, restaurants, parks and shopping. Hope to return to Dublin and the Merrion soon!",5,2019,07,15
200,One of the best hotels in the world,"I put this hotel up there with the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok and the New York Palace in its prime. This place is an absolute joy. The staff are amazing, the rooms are huge and clean, the location is perfect and its hard to find anything negative to say! We absolutely loved staying here and really did feel so at home.  Its not a cheap hotel by any means but you get what you pay for and what you get here is world class accomodation. Worth every penny. My only small complaint would be that the water pressure in the shower isnt great and if someone turns the tap on while you are in the shower it gets even worse but thats all I can think of to say in order to make the review feel more balanced. Its the ONLY place I would stay if I came back to Dublin. Thanks for making us feel so at home.",5,2019,07,15
200,Superb,"This is an excellent urban hotel with lovely rooms, superior service, a nice garden terrace and a recently upgraded spa.  The food and drink in the hotel itself was very good but as we were in Dublin when the adjacent Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud was closed we weren't able to dine there.  A great reason to return!",5,2019,07,14
200,Great location and luxurious stay!,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Merrion.  It's location was amazing - a short walk to museums, shopping, restaurants, and other tourist sites.  We decided to ""splurge"" on a hotel for our stay in Dublin and we weren't disappointed.  The room was truly luxurious and we enjoyed the nice extra touches like robes, turn down service, and bottles of water.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  You definitely pay a luxury price but it's worth it to pamper yourself during your stay in Dublin.",5,2019,07,13
200,Superior in so many ways ,We aren’t sure what other reviews say but this hotel has fantastic service and is truly lovely. Note that we are always in jeans and sneakers and the staff (unlike other fine hotels we’ve frequented) are so courteous and thoughtful. The garden resto is a delight - from cuisine to service to view. Room is lovely with fine amenities. Staff are friendly and positive and courteous - do stay here it is an great experience in every way. (We’re so impressed that we are writing this review while still staying at the property.) Thank you for the lovely visit! ,5,2019,07,13
200,Best of the best,"I certainly cannot exaggerate how good this hotel is.
Room, service, staff, & food are all first class.
Concierge service is fabulous, I contacted them a few days before our arrival to enquire as to tickets to a “ sold out” show, somehow they were able to oblige!
If we ever return to Dublin this is the only place we would consider to stay.",5,2019,07,13
200,#1 for a reason,"One of the better hotel experiences we have ever had and we travel a lot. First class staff who after a very short time knew our names, beautiful grounds, indoor pool and spa, extremely comfortable room and lots of little touches eg- We had books out we were reading so bookmarks appear. We had cords to our iphones out so they attached little phone cords to keep it tidy. I left my wallet in a cab that picked us up at the hotel and the staff went out of their way to track down the cab and assit me in trying to recover it. Great location, good business center, nice art and frankly a fair price given what you get. We arrived around 200 pm so our room wasnt quite ready so they told us to just wait in the bar and have a drink on them. They let our son and daughter in law who were not staying at ther hotel leave their luggage their until we arrived (they got in several hours earlier) and even let them refresh in the pool/spa. Water bottles left for us to drink. Did room service 1 Sunday night for the 4 of us cause nothing open late and the food was terrific. Its hard for me to believe there is a better place to stay in Dublin. And they have a Michelin star restaurant to boot.",5,2019,07,12
200,The Wellington Room in the Merrion Hotel no longer needs to rest on the laurels of its historical connections,"I recently enjoyed a lovely meal at a private corporate event that was held in the Merrion Hotel. I've eaten there on a number of occasions (all private dining events) and my most recent visit didn't disappoint. If you enjoy the spectacle of what I call synchronized serving, then this is the place to come as there's something very refined and civilized about the sight of seeing 10 or 12 waiters in full livery deliver dishes in front of expectant diners simultaneously!",4,2019,07,07
200,Fabulous ,"The service, staff, and stay surpassed my expectations. Jordan and Robert were exceptional. They greeted us every time we passed and remembered our names only for a two night stay. Great location within walking distance of all major attractions. ",5,2019,07,07
200,"Art, History and Service in Perfect Harmony ","My wife and I spent three nights at The Merrion in Dublin and were immensely impressed by the entire experience. 
The Lord Antrim Suite we stayed in is a beautifully appointed room which felt like home from home.
The location of The Merrion makes all of the best places to visit within easy walking distance which is the best way to take in everything that Dublin has to offer. 
The service was also top notch. 
If planning a visit to Dublin, there is only one place to stay....The Merrion 
",5,2019,07,06
200,An unforgettable experience that has earned its 5 stars,"Another very old hotel (with a new garden wing)..allegedly where the Duke of Wellington was born (""George Washington slept here !"") Right across the street from the Prime Minister's office and the Irish Parliament. Most sites of interest are very walkable..such as there are any (and Dublin is surprisingly void of these) The downstairs corridors are glass-walled with views of several lovely flowered gardens..and toward the front, several very English panelled rooms with fireplaces for drinks or tea. Very good concierge service. The room was quiet and nicely appointed...easy-to-use temperature controls and showers..a special hook outside the door to hang a ""Do-not-disturb card""..rather than the usual twisting and turning to hang it on a doorknob.

The garden restaurant suffers from multiple server syndrome. You don't have one server..you have three...or none..so that several people may take your order..and/or deliver it...or maybe not. And busboys regularly come by with trays of the wrong food. Why not have just one waiter ? The breakfast buffet, with minimum server involvement is lovely.",5,2019,07,05
200,An Extraordiary Sanctuary,The beauty of the hotel and the competence of the staff is exceptional and should be on everyone's list when they are seeking a hotel in Dublin. This former home of the Duke of Wellington has been converted into a sanctuary of nobility which surrounds a garden of beauty and tranquility. The staff is extraordinarily competent and makes your stay a true pleasure.,5,2019,07,01
200,Honeymooning In Ireland,"My new Bride and I arrived in Dublin 10 days ago and checked-in to Merrion Hotel for a couple days to rest and relax before embarking on a 10 days driving tour of the Emerald Island.  The Merrion Staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating, providing local restaurant and visitor attraction recommendations and always with an umbrella at the ready in case of a quick downpour of Irish Sunshine.  The rooms were clean, well appointed with AC and WiFi all functioning as designed.  The Merrion is perfectly located for walking to literally 100’s of Local restaurants and shopping venues.  So if you find yourself looking for a 5 Star Hotel in Dublin, then the Merrion should be high on your list and if you do stay there then tell-‘em Willie McTavish sent ya.  ",5,2019,07,01
200,Pure luxury,"Everything at The Merrion is pure luxury. The room is gorgeously appointed with the most comfortable bed. The spa and gym facilities are quite nice, and the service is above all. The only criticism I have is the laundry service uses so much waste and is not eco-friendly - everything was wrapped in paper, and then plastic, and then put in a cardboard box. They should have just left it folded on the bed, had I known about the excessive packaging, I would have asked for this. However, every little thing is attended to. My iPhone cord was so long and unwieldy; the housekeep staff wrapped it up nicely in a Merrion-branded Velcro strap. Glass bottles for water instead of the dreaded plastic, and the option to not swap sheets and towels everyday to preserve water. The breakfast buffet is stunning and accommodating to all allergies; as one who eats gluten and dairy free, I had no trouble whatsoever. Can’t wait to come back to this most amazing hotel! ",5,2019,06,30
200,Business meeting,"Meridian hotel Gurugram.Earlier(pulmann).Good ambience.plesant staff and coul place Very conveniently located.
It was my first visit but feel like going there and exploring more.
Bar and Resturants are located just at the right place for efficient handling.",4,2019,06,29
200,Almost perfect,"The Merrion is a gem. The staff, on the whole, have pose and grace and an ease of welcome that means you begin feeling relaxed the moment you put your foot on their front step.

Food is stunning, rooms are stunning, attention to detail is excellent.

Spa is superb!

Some tiny quibbles:

- AC in the room but but not in the bathroom.

- Tables in the garden room and drawing room may be reserved and may or may not have a reserved sign — this is embarrassing.

- Bar staff were inattentive on one evening we were there.

- Young woman in spa was less than pleasant when we tried to book a pedicure.

HOWEVER, these are small quibbles.

Merrion is EXCELLENCE time and again.
Surely Dublin’s best hotel!",4,2019,06,28
200,Wonderful!,"The Merrion is a combination of old world charm and contemporary style and service.  From a hearty and warm welcome by the doorman to the concierge to the front desk we already felt we were home away from home.  The reception area is in the old part of the hotel with a partial wood floor highlighting it's history.  The staff are well trained, warm and generous with information and advice.  

Our room was clean, elegant and the bed soooo comfortable we fell asleep feeling pampered.  We dined several times in their Garden Room restaurant, a comfortable and calming atmosphere with good service.  

The only flaw was one evening when a group of 12 arrived and essentially held all the other diners hostage to their raucous, inconsiderate, inappropriate noise.  For us it interrupted a business meeting, for others perhaps just a charming time.  The next morning we received an apology from a Guest Relations rep, and we observed her apologizing to other guests who had dined there as well.  I wish we had spoken up at the time, but we were so frustrated we simply left before we were finished.  I'm certain this incident has resulted in improved policy at the hotel, and I mention it to advise other travelers to speak up rather than suffer through.",5,2019,06,25
200,Outstanding service ,"This hotel prides itself on excellent service and my wife and I found it so from check in to checkout. Everyone was incredibly professional and helpful. We arrived in the morning before checkin and were shown to the locker rooms and spa so we could freshen up with our luggage brought to us. The room was lovely, well appointed and quiet. The property is outstanding and the concierges incredibly helpful. I’ve traveled all over the world and this hotel ranks with the very best. Pricey but worth it!",5,2019,06,24
200,Impressive art collection in five star hotel,"We ended our 2 week trip with a 2 night stay at the Merrion. The service lived up to the five star designation. The bed, linens, housekeeping, amenities were all what you would hope to find in a luxury hotel. The art collection in the hotel itself was impressive. The location was perfect for walking to all the main tourist locations in Dublin. We would stay here every time we were in Dublin for sure!!",5,2019,06,24
200,fantastic five-star hotel experience,"The Merrion is a fantastic old-school hotel. The Merrion has a high level of amenities with impeccable service. All of the staff is friendly and helpful. After a few days at the hotel, you will feel like everyone knows you. Also, the location in the center of Dublin is very convenient.",5,2019,06,24
200,Excellent dining in Garden Room,"This is a very fine location with generous space allocation and excellent service.
There is an excellent all day menu with a generous time allocation for reservation.
Wine list is extensive. We will return",4,2019,06,19
200,Possibly the best luxury hotel in Dublin ,"Impeccable customer service was very easy to experience everywhere from front desk to bar to breakfast restaurant to doorman and concierge. The rooms are beautiful and the location across from the Irish Prime Minister’s Office in the Merrion Square area is just sensational; quiet and not busy like around the Grafton Street or St. Stephen’s Green area yet within walking distance of those areas as well as Trinity College. When back in Dublin, we’d love to once again stay at The Merrion.",5,2019,06,17
200,Superb in every way ...,"We have had the privilege of staying at some of the finest hotels in London, Madrid, Barcelona, Edinburgh, the U.S. ... and I can say that The Merrion stacks up against any of them in every regard.

We were upgraded to a wonderful suite, probably because we were staying a week. The room and all its amenities were superb. On-site are multiple restaurants that range from a quiet corner for a cup-of-tea-and-a-snack, to a Michelin 2-star, and anything else you’d desire in between. All were excellent in their way. (And the Pearl Brasserie, right next door, is terrific, don’t miss it!)

Besides the room, the amenities, the perfect location, what distinguishes The Merrion is its staff: Every person you encounter will bend over backwards to meet your every need, with a smile. There is no 5-star “attitude,” not the least bit of snobbishness; you could wander through The Merrion in a tux and tails, or jeans and a T-shirt, and you’d be treated just the same — as a guest whom they are happy to have aboard.

Cannot recommend The Merrion highly enough. This is what a great hotel should be, in every way. 
",5,2019,06,17
200,Just what it should be,"Spent 4 nights in this splendid hotel a few years ago and forgot to review.  It’s a very nice hotel, clean, good service, and very inviting in all ways.  The afternoon tea was nice add!  It’s in a great location as we hopped on the “hop on hop off” bus right in front of the hotel.  Our room was very large and quiet!  I was struck with how clean the entire property was as well.  Just what you’d expect from a luxury hotel!  Don’t miss it!",5,2019,06,16
200,"Quiet, elegant hotel in Dublin","I stayed at the Merrion with my husband and college-age children on a family trip. The hotel is a short walk away from St. Stephens Green, shopping and other attractions in Dublin. The atmosphere is quiet and serene, and the hotel has a lovely interior courtyard where you can enjoy a drink. The staff was courteous and helpful, and many of the guests appeared to be traveling on business. Our rooms in the main building  were connected by a private hallway, and both rooms were large and elegant. We ate breakfast and dinner in the Garden Room (included with our package), and the food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2019,06,15
200,"Wonderful, simply sublime","Highly recommended. We stayed at the Merrion as part of a birthday celebration, and had a thoroughly wonderful time. The hotel itself is the epitome of style and elegance. The staff were friendly and helpful in every way. Our (upgraded) room was beyond words. Could not recommend more. Simply sublime.",5,2019,06,13
200,Irish Charm Global Standards,"My wife and I started our vacation in Ireland at the Merrion.  While I have stayed there before, it was my wife’s first visit to the Emerald Isle. The facility is excellent, the staff professional and up to the global standards one would expect in any global first class hotel.  Special mention that the concierge and doormen are terrific. 

The room was very nice. Ours had a living room and a bedroom, both of which were well appointed. The inly comment that I would add is that the shower is rather small   

Overall the Merrion is Irish charm at its best. ",5,2019,06,12
200,Top class for business travellers,"Stayed here on business on several occasions and without a doubt this is the nicest place in Dublin to stay - the bedrooms are so well-appointed, comfortable and the attention to detail is superb. The beautiful reception areas are spacious enough that you can have a business meeting or coffee in comfort and the staff cannot do enough for you, in particular the very pleasant concierges. Highly recommend, never disappoints",5,2019,06,08
200,Home Away From Home (No Cliche'),"This is a stylish, beautiful converted (and extended) house which exhudes class, right opposite the Irish Parliamentary building. When you walk in it is as though you are in a home, ably assisted by well trained, well groomed staff. Beautiful bedroom and lovely breakfast room, the list goes on and on. When in Dublin, strongly consider this one.",5,2019,06,08
200,What a treat!,"Can’t say enough about this hotel! 
Charming decor & garden.
Such a beautiful room with all the bells and whistles and more!
Arrived to chocolate & cake in the room.
Luxurious bedding and towels. Robes, slippers. Wonderful amenities in the bathroom,newspaper at your door very morning. Turn down service.
Very attentive staff including concierge and doormen!
Fantastic location in between Merrion Square Park and Steven’s Green .
",5,2019,06,08
200,Lovely stay,Friendly and welcoming staff that went above and beyond. Large comfortable rooms and comfy bedding which was much needed after air travel and day tours. The breakfast spread was plentiful and the blueberry pancakes off the menu were amazing. Would definitely return when back in Dublin  ,4,2019,06,08
200,Garden View or Garbage View,"This is a very pleasant hotel with many wonderful staff.  The staff at the hotel were extremely professional - regretably, our room locations left much to be desired.  We had two well appointed rooms (#230 & #218) which were in the Garden View wing, but, which faced a back-lane and rows of garbage bins.  For a combined cost of 880 Euros an evening, hardly a garden view.  The open window in the bathroom in #218 provided a wonderful fragrance of green garbage. Even worst, the garbage service provided for the bins to be emptied at 1am local time.  And, later (6am) in the morning the constant clacking of the bin wheels provided a wonderful wake-up call.  Surely a hotel which claims to be among the best in Dublin could organize its services area so there is no evidence, visual, olfactory or audible, to distract the client from a pleasant visit.  When I mentioned the experience at check-out, I was greeted with solemn looks of indifference and an offer to speak to someone in Guest Relations. I passed on their offer - better to let them read my views here.",3,2019,06,06
200,Understated elegance In Dublin,"The Merrion is not an opulent or architecturally grand hotel, but it is hard to imagine a better, more sheltered and comfortable spot in Dublin. The two are a good fit. Across from Parliament and adjacent to Merrion Square, its location is perfect for visitors and seemingly fine for business travelers too. The public rooms in original, stately-yet-simple Georgian row houses are beautifully decorated. The tea room with fireplace is a particular delight. The historic front of the hotel feels like a large, elegant house. Most of the hotel though, including rooms, are in more modern additions. Rooms are very comfortable and decorated in understated hues. The courtyard gardens are a great public space for an urban hotel. All three dining facilities are worth patronizing. The Garden Court [sic?], to be fair, could exist in any fine hotel, but the atmosphere, food, wine list and service are excellent. A fine staff and an interesting, original art collection. Think of The Merrion as a less grand version of a grand hotel, but their equal in service, cuisine and comfort.",5,2019,06,05
200,Perfection. ,"The Merrion Hotel is a beautiful hotel with a fabulous garden where you can sit and relax with food and/or drinks. It is luxurious and calm. 
The food is excellent and has a great choice for vegetarians. Staff are friendly and efficient. The rooms are beautiful. For anyone planning a visit to Dublin this hotel is the only one to consider in my opinion. ",5,2019,06,05
200,Great 5 Star Hotel & Experience,"We stayed in a Garden Wing Superior King Room at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin and it was perfect for the time we were there.  The room was beautiful, quiet, clean and was a nice size for two.  The bed was very comfortable as well. The public rooms through the hotel and the garden area where you can just relax or have coffee, tea, etc., are very nice spaces and the service is excellent.  We had breakfast in the Garden Room, cocktails in the Cellar Bar and dinner at Patrick Guilbaud. All of them were just great. We definitely had a 5 star experience and it would be our choice of lodging any time we are in Dublin.",5,2019,06,03
200,Great start to  Ireland ,"What a terrific hotel
The rooms are spacious and immaculate 
The staff are sincere, polite and knowledgeable
Excellent breakfasts
Workout and pool round out the experience
Great location to walk to most sites, the Hop on Hop off bus, restaurants, pubs and parks
In eyesight of the museums and Trinity College
5 stars all the way",5,2019,06,01
200,The epitome of a five-star hotel,"There is good reason this is the number one rated hotel in Dublin.  My wife and I have stayed in our share of five-star hotels over a lifetime of travel, and The Merrion is right in there with the best of the lot.  I would find it impossible to come up with any aspect of the place that was not absolutely top-notch.  The adjectives I wanted to use have been taken up in recent reviews -- flawless, impeccable -- no dissent here.  The staff is world class in its service and cordiality.  The rooms have every imaginable comfort for a restful stay.  The breakfast is first-rate in every respect.  We particularly loved the 23 Bar -- the ambiance elevates you to a better world, cozy and elegant.  Our unreserved enthusiasm for this truly outstanding hotel.  Thanks to all of you who make it happen, because it represents an extraordinary commitment to excellence.",5,2019,05,29
200,Flawless in Dublin,"We just returned from four restful nights at the Merrion.  Our room was bright and modern -- overlooking a beautiful garden and fountain -- with insanely comfortable beds.  A perfect environment to de-stress, read and catch up on sleep in between sightseeing and dining outings.

The housekeeping staff was among the most attentive we've ever experienced and attentive to details (like placing Merrion bookmarks in open books, replacing coffee pods without being asked, servicing the room late so we could sleep off the jet-lag) that make you want to return.  A fruit platter awaited us when we checked in and an assortment of chocolates arrived several days later.  The front desk, concierge and bell staff were friendly and helpful.  

Aside from smiling Fiona, the breakfast staff were less friendly than their colleagues.  The breakfast buffet was elegantly presented and reasonably priced but not outstanding in its variety.  My request for a scone (not on the buffet, but I assumed available a la carte) was surprisingly declined with a ""we don't eat those for breakfast."" -- a sign that I'd already enjoyed enough buttery vacation treats!

The 20m swimming pool is a highlight for fitness swimmers.  (There's also a 25m pool down the street at Trinity University.) It was immaculate, as were the newly updated changing and workout rooms.  

We'll definitely return to the Merrion when in Dublin.  Oh, and eat at Diwali if you're in the mood for delicious Indian food.  Manager Abu will take good care of you.
",5,2019,05,28
200,We love The Merrion!,"What a lovely hotel!!!  We have stayed in many wonderful hotels around the world and The Merrion is one of our absolute favorites.  The hotel itself is a beautiful, historic hotel that is light and airy with an exquisite art collection.  The rooms are supremely comfortable with the highest quality linens, robes, soaps, etc.  The service is impeccable - polished, warm and gracious - and the food is fabulous.  Not only that, the hotel is quiet but very well located.  Refined yet unpretentious.  We love it and will always stay here when in Dublin.  Also, the high tea or ""Art Tea"" is a wonderful offering at The Merrion, and I highly recommend it.",5,2019,05,26
200,Perfect,"Centrally located in Dublin. Service excellent. Accommodated all of our needs. They picked us up at the Dublin airport, gave us the room we requested when we made the reservation. Patrick Guillbaud restaurant in the hotel, although pricey, was one of the best meals we had in ireland. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,25
200,Perfectly enjoyable!,Our first introduction in Ireland was at the Merrion and they exceeded all of our expectations. They had our room ready upon our very early arrival after a long flight. The tub was so clean that I felt safe to take a hot bath which I never do in other hotels. Staff and food fabulous as well. Miss you Merrion!!,5,2019,05,21
200,5 star across the board,"Hotel includes everything you would expect from a 5 star botique property. Spacious rooms, impeccable house cleaning service, great restaurant, great service...great location...Nothing but the best! Although it was our first visit to Dublin and there are some other 5 star properties in the area that we checked out, we wouldn’t think twice about returning to this one next time we are back.",5,2019,05,21
200,Top notch all around,"This was a repeat visit for us, having had a great first time experience. We were not disappointed this time.

Very professional and welcoming greeting. Very easy check-in. Large rooms with lots of lighting. Large warm bathrooms. Great water pressure. Comfortable beds and pillows. We also really enjoyed the extras provided in the turn-down service.

The bar and Garden restaurant (for breakfast) were excellent.

If there was one complaint, it would be that it was difficult to cool down the room. We found it quite warm, even with the window opened versus the fan at the lowest setting. This really only affected us during sleeping.

We will likely return here, if there are available rooms, next time we're in Dublin.",5,2019,05,20
200,Elegant hotel with impeccable service,"The staff is to be commended for catering to every need. Someone walks you to your room to show you where everything in the hotel is located.
The restaurant is very expensive, but the selection on the breakfast buffet is amazing.
Location is good.  Lovely park a block away, 15-30 minute walk to major attractions.",5,2019,05,20
200,"Stylish, immaculate and by far the best in town!","I'm a recent but regular visitor to Dublin and The Merrion is not just a local standout, but an international standout in my view. 

I arrived jetlagged and exhausted at 1am, slightly concerned that I may have lost my room. However, was delighted to be greeted by the incredibly warm and friendly reception team. And even more delighted to be told I had been upgraded to a suite. 

This is a beautiful hotel with tasteful decor, nice art work, long bright halls and unlike many hotels, not a sign of wear and tear. There are beautiful internal garden courtyards which are a lovely view to start the day. 

My suite was fantastic with a separate living room, guest toilet and large living room. Sadly I had to get up for work and check out early in the morning but managed to enjoy a relaxing bath, and try out the ultra soft bathrobes. The bedding is super comfortable and the room offered heavy drapes to block light and noise. 

The hotel is a great location which is quieter and I found preferable to hotels on Grafton or the canal. 

The service really is impeccable and unique in that it is also warm and friendly, whilst maintaining a high level of professionalism. And it seems that the people working here really enjoy it. 

It's impossible to find fault with this fabulous hotel. I am now keen to get an opportunity for a longer stay!",5,2019,05,16
200,Beautiful Hotel in Convenient Location,"The Merrion is a beautiful hotel in a great location near Grafton Street.  The hotel and rooms are beautiful and the service is impeccable.  The food in The Garden Room was the best I had in Ireland and the Cellar Bar and the Drawing Room were both enjoyable places for coffee and dessert.  The gardens within the hotel are just lovely.   I really cannot find anything negative to say about this hotel, even though the ongoing construction while we were there made afternoon naps difficult.  But they are renovating the pool area and I certainly understand they have to do the work sometime.  When the workers were still working later than their stopping time (6pm?), the hotel stepped in quickly to make them stop.  I cannot say enough about the wonderful staff at this hotel!  They were among the best at any hotel at which I have ever stayed.",5,2019,05,14
200,Best place in town,"Nice rooms, friendly staff and great breakfast. I can only recommend this hotel was my third stay and they always have the same high level. Located near downtown with everything interesting in walking distance ",5,2019,05,07
200,Staying on Top,"The Merrion does what it says on tin and more. Lovely staff, great rooms, best beds in Ireland. Especially like that the guest staying at the hotel is the priority, no one else. Really makes a difference to the ambience and the main reason why I stay there.",5,2019,05,07
200,Fabulous as always,"Tranquil, elegant, gracious.  Beautiful property and friendly, helpful staff.  Tea in the parlor and breakfast in the Garden Room are both a must!  The spa and indoor pool are also lovely. Highly recommend.",5,2019,05,06
200,Superb Experience,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in, anywhere in the world. My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Merrion. Perfect , faultless. Gorgeous room, brilliant staff, excellent restaurants, great location. 
 
Our only regret was that we had to leave to continue our journey.

Thank you so much to the management and staff .

We thoroughly recommend The Merrion.",5,2019,05,03
200,Birthday treat.,"We stayed here for just 1 night in March. We had reservations for Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud so The Merrion was the obvious choice for our hotel. We booked a room which was very disabled friendly, (as I am disabled). I can’t say much about this hotel except that it was probably the best I’ve ever stayed in. It was extremely peaceful and relaxing. We were not left wanting for anything. Our room was beautifully presented and scrupulously clean. My compliments to the staff and management for a wonderful hotel experience overall.",5,2019,05,03
200,LOVE the Merrion Hotel!,"We were only in Dublin for two nights but can’t wait to return and when we do, we will definitely stay at the Merrion! They do everything possible to exceed expectations.  The bed and pillows are the best we’ve had in our travels! Lovely hotel! Love the staff! ",5,2019,05,02
200,Easter break,"Perfect long weekend,benchmark for hotels anywhere,staff so friendly and helpful.I would recommend/have done,to anyone staying in Dublin.The attention to detail is never failing from front door inwards! Treat yourself!",5,2019,05,02
200,There is no better place to stay in Dublin,The service at this hotel is on another level. It really is amazing. Everyone goes the extra mile. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are of a very high standard. The turn down service is a really nice touch. Don’t stay anywhere else. ,5,2019,04,30
200,Great workforce central location but not impressed,"All the workers were great and the site is central but so are many other hotels.  This is a high priced place and didn't live up to the cost.  The room was well appointed but not large.  Breakfast not included.  The swimming pool was closed.  People were working on an up-grade to the room next door and started early.  It's not for me.  I'd rather pay a lot less, have breakfast and a room equal in size. Preferably without workmen next door.",3,2019,04,29
200,Nice hotel ,"The merrion is located on a great street filled with restaurants and pubs. The hotel itself had a great staff and a great bathroom. Downstairs they had a lovely bar and restaurant as well. The service was great, not far from the biggest shopping center in town. ",5,2019,04,28
200,April visit,"Contacted the hotel via email before our stay a number of times, over a number of weeks to try and make arrangements but did not receive a response. Although this was mentioned at check-in and check-out it was never followed up. The room itself was lovely and well presented but the service was below what is expected of a hotel of this calibre.",3,2019,04,24
200,Lovely,"I stayed here over the Easter bank holiday weekend with my girlfriend. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend the hotel to friends and family. The location is great, not in an area that is overly loud and wild but still a short 5-10 minute walk from Grafton Street. The staff are all extremely friendly and can not to enough for you. The hotel itself is stunning, especially the garden area. The spa and pool facilities were being renovated during our stay so they arranged for us to travel to the nearby Intercontinental Hotel to use their facilities free of charge. Cleanliness was second to none and the lady on reception arranged our travel to the airport for our departure. ",5,2019,04,24
200,Quaint and classy hotel,"We stayed in this chic hotel for 4 days and enjoyed every minute. Very classy exquisite place. Beautiful bedroom, comfy bed, high quality bed linens and towels. High quality toiletries. Very helpful friendly staff. Very helpful concierge who booked our tour to the Causeway and our dinners offering us good recommendations. We enjoyed our dinner at their Patrick Gilbeaux Michelin Star restaurant, lovely classy ambience, sophisticated crowd, beautifully presented food and great service. I’ve also tried the hotel’s breakfast, high quality, beautifully presented, offering a wide variety of choices. Waiters were very friendly, eager to assist and please. I tried the lunch as well. I had the fresh fish catch of the day which was exactly what I wished for. The location of the hotel is very convenient, very close to all high end areas, museums and luxury stores, we would definitely stay there again if we were to come again to Dublin",5,2019,04,23
200,Be Spoiled!,"I had an amazing three nights at this fantastic hotel. The room was quiet, the bed amazingly comfortable and the staff and service could not have been better. The location is great for walking around the city, although I was there on business. Once you stay here you will be spoiled for life!",5,2019,04,23
200,Garden Restaurant,"Only there for lunch and we all had great food and service.  Attentive service and lovely setting with well set out garden area.  Lovely dining room environment, great atmosphere and great menu and wine list.  Prosecco was excellent too.",5,2019,04,23
200,First class accommodations and service!,"The hotels service and attention to detail is unprecedented. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and very clean.  They make sure everything you need during your stay is available in the room. Close to all you want to see in Dublin!",5,2019,04,23
200,"Second visit, as good as the first","We had been to the Merrion a few years ago and had occasion to stay there again. The hotel has changed slightly (new Garden Room for breakfast, the cellar has been turned into a pub-like atmosphere) but the commitment to quality is the same. While we liked the old cellar restaurant the garden room is actually nicer if I let go of my nostalgia, and the new cellar bar is appealing. Breakfasts are actually better than last time -- more choices -- and the unique aspects of the hotel -- those gorgeous sitting rooms beyond the front desk -- are still there. Service is as personal and as courteous as ever. Our only regret was that the spa and pool were closed for renovation while we were there -- we keenly remember the gorgeous pool. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's the same, great experience we remember from our first time. Not cheap, but worth every penny.",5,2019,04,22
200,Very good location in close relation to Trinity college grounds,A nice clean hotel conveniently located near Trinity college and Grafton street for shopping. The high tea should not be missed! The breakfast was good. They put a news paper at the door each day. The doorman was very responsive and good.,4,2019,04,19
200,The Number One Address In Dublin With Historic Lasting Impact,"I was fortunate to stay at The Merrion Hotel. The Merrion Hotel is the number one address to stay while in Dublin. My experience, from the beginning, being picked up at the airport, was exceptional with a high quality of servant leadership throughout my entire visit. My room was beautifully accented with a gorgeous view. 

The Courtyard of The Merrion Hotel is stunning to the eye and wonderful to eat at the restaurant while viewing it. The food was prepared at the highest quality and the server wanted to make double-sure that every bite was prepared to your taste. 

The Merrion Hotel is home to the finest restaurant in Ireland: Patrick Guilbaud*, the only restaurant in Ireland to hold 2 Michelin stars. 

Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who later defeated Napoleon was born at The Merrion Hotel. Thus, the finest hotel in Dublin with historic lasting impact! You will love it!",5,2019,04,19
200,"Grand vacation with my two boys, ages 12 and 14","Truly, you will not do better than The Merrion, it's lovely facilities, genuinely interested and caring staff, location, and amenities. I traveled there for 3-4 days in Dublin with my two boys, ages 12 and 14, and the experience could not have been better. They arranged literally everything and were flexible when we needed to make changes. Look not further; you have found a traveler's paradise!!!",5,2019,04,18
200,Great weekend in Dublin,We had a lovely stay at the Merrion.  The staff is very attentive and the room was very comfortable for sleeping or sitting for a bit to relax. The Garden Room was a very nice restaurant for dinner or breakfast. The location was accessible to many sites by foot.  If you like/need an elegant city hotel this would be a good choice.,5,2019,04,18
200,Wonderful Experience for Solo Gluten Free Traveler,"The Merrion is class, style and customer service - all executed to perfection.  Every staff person I interacted with was professional and courteous.  My room was beautiful with every detail considered, from Nespresso machine with espresso pods brewed into China demitasse cups and saucers, to the complimentary slippers in the closet.  It was a wonderful last day to my 2 1/2 week trip.  I am ready to be home but already miss the Merrion!",5,2019,04,17
200,Exceptional,The staff was amazingly helpful when I encountered a situation that required my early departure. I am very appreciative. My wife and I plan on returning this fall. I look forward to seeing you all again soon.,5,2019,04,16
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"I had the opportunity to stay at the Merrion during our trip to the Irish country side. A lot of research went trying to decide between the Merrion or the Shelbourne. Not being able to decided on which hotel, I decided to stay in one on my way to the country side and the other from. There is no question in my mind that the Merrion is definitely the best hotel .  Their service, food, accommodations, staff, and overall service is excellent. ",5,2019,04,16
200,Perfection as always!,"The Merrion is BY FAR my favorite hotel on the planet! The location, the incredible staff, the stunning drawing rooms (with roaring fires), the perfect little bar/lounge and the beautiful guest rooms add up to a perfect stay every time. Can’t recommend more highly!",5,2019,04,14
200,Elegant!,"This place is subdued and classy. It is near the embassies, so many foreign dignitaries stay there. Beautiful rooms, excellent service, traditional tea time and it's location is perfect as it's near the center of Dublin and the park, but is 2 streets away from all the congestion. It has a neighborhood feel, which is nice",5,2019,04,14
200,Wonderful stay!,"We spent 4 nights at the Merrion and are so glad we chose this hotel. Everything was excellent- beautiful property, gorgeous room, great breakfast and professional and friendly staff. The heated towel rack in the bathroom was an unexpected touch as were the welcome chocolates.  Location is close to many good restaurants and we also ate at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, which was fabulous but be advised it is very upscale so dress appropriately (we didn’t do our research so felt too casually dressed which took away a little from our enjoyment. However the food was amazing!). Concierge was very helpful in coordinating airport transport and private tours, which we thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend.  All in all a great stay and this will be our go-to spot should we return to Dublin.",5,2019,04,14
200,Dublin Visit 2019,"This hotel was One of the highlights of our Ireland trip.
It is centrally located. The staff are professional and accommodating,  thoughtful and friendly. The rooms are beautiful with an old world elegance.

200,Exceptional hotel with superb service,"It is always a great treat to stay at the Merrion Hotel. The staff and standard of service are exceptional. 
The rooms are all lovely and very well equipped with everything from tea and coffee making facilities to an iron and ironing board in each wardrobe.
On this occasion I was upgraded to a beautiful suite looking out towards the Dail. Although it was a spacious and luxurious room I actually prefer the rooms in the garden wing which look out over the courtyard garden as they are utterly quiet with no noise from traffic.
The garden restaurant is lovely.",5,2019,04,13
200,Charming hotel with good old-fashioned service,"The Merrion Hotel is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World and it shows; what a gorgeous hotel full of olde world charm and wonderful customer service.

We had a beautiful Georgian spacious room in the old part of the hotel. The room was spotless and room service was friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The new garden room for breakfast was a delightful bright comfortable restaurant with a lovely aspect over the garden.  It was a most relaxing and enjoyable stay in the most elegant surroundings. Thank you very much to all the staff for making our stay so very enjoyable. ,5,2019,04,09
200,"Good, not amazing stay","This hotel was good, but not amazing - our room was comfortable and lovely, but it felt like it could use a little updating.  The front desk seemed a bit scattered, as they had lost our reservation when we checked in.  The breakfast wasn't great; the bread was hard and there wasn't much selection.  We stayed 2 nights, and it was fine, probably one of the top hotels in Dublin, but not a top hotel in Ireland or other major cities.",4,2019,04,07
200,Great hotel,"This is an extremely good hotel with expansive public areas, very friendly and efficient service and good food. The rooms are pleasant and well equipped. The gardens are beautiful to look at in the winter and to sit in in the summer. There is art work displayed throughout the hotel",5,2019,04,07

200,Fantastic hotel in great location,"5 star hotel, perfect service, fantastic food. This hotel is a true gem. The only criticism is that the mattress was a spring mattress and a bit on the hard side. Otherwise, everything was superb. The location, service and dining can’t be beat. ",5,2019,04,02
200,Dublin's Best 5 Star,I stayed in the Merrion last weekend and really enjoyed the experience. This would be my first choice hotel when visiting Dublin. Staff were very professional and welcoming. My room was lovely - very comfortable beds. Garden Restaurant is such a beautiful addition to this hotel. Couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.,5,2019,04,01
200,A Comfortable Stay in Dublin,"The Merrion is a fine hotel, with very good restaurants and comfortable rooms.  The rooms for each my brother and I were large, appeared newly refurbished and the beds were outstanding.  We each had large bathrooms with separate showers and tubs.  The hotel has several restaurants.  Our reservation included breakfast, and the buffet was extensive with wonderful fresh fruit and pastries as well as the usual juices, cereals, etc.  The hot choices made to order were also excellent.  The staff was helpful and the restaurant service very good.  A great location for central Dublin, close to pubs, starred restaurants and the active Dublin vibe.",4,2019,04,01
200,Pleasant Stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Merrion. I would have to say that the location is the best part. it is close to many high quality restaurants such as Etto, Hugos and two Michelin star restaurants right next to the hotel. 

I would recommend staying in the main house as the rooms are much nicer. 

The gym was under construction when I stayed - so a make do gym was made in an old bedroom, this was very underwhelming as I pick hotels based on the gym and would have expected something a little better than what was provided in the interim. 

staff were very nice",4,2019,04,01
200,Afternoon tea,We hae an afternoon tea  with my fiancé at the Merrion hotel. The atmosphere was very friendly and luxurious. There was even a harpist playing at the lounge. The sandwiches were delicious and so were the pastries. They have a great selection of teas and you are welcome to taste as many as you like. ,5,2019,04,01
200,"Very organized, great tea by the fire",Looks like a flat from the road. Don’t let that deceive. I wouldn’t give it five stars but a solid 4. It’s nice. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Has a nice solarium area if the sun is shining that day. Had a newly renovated pub in the cellar that had superb fish and chips.,4,2019,03,31

A place I would be very happy to go back to.",5,2019,03,31
200,Five star hotel but with a few nits,Remarkably beautiful property composed of several Georgian townhouses. The public areas are amazing and my room was large and well appointed with beautiful linens and towels. The hotel offer a number of restaurants and a helpful staff. Now the few nits. The hotel has a beautiful courtyard and the afternoon I was there having drinks with a client we wanted to get a snack. Hotel was adamant that they wouldn't serve any food there. Also the shower stall was too small and had a low quality shower head compared to what might be expected at similar quality hotels. Neither of those things were major issues (I would still happily stay at the hotel again) but they could easily enough be fixed.,5,2019,03,31
200,Grand stay.,"This is a wonderful property with a great staff.  It's in a great location, you can walk to many sites from here.  Very friendly and accommodating staff. Very comfortable rooms.  Attention to details is seen everywhere.  Flowers impeccable.",5,2019,03,30
200,EVERYTHING ,"This Hotel is hands down my favourite place in the world. For service, comfort, location, staff and just good old fashioned 5 star luxury. Truly 5 star. I am lucky enough to return as often as I can for both business and pleasure. It’s a must stay in the friendliest city you could hope to visit. Once you stay at The Merrion everywhere else just pales into insignificance and you will feel irked by every singe touch that isn’t courtesy of The Merrion. ",5,2019,03,29
200,Outstanding Accommodations!!!,"OK, I live in NY and am accustomed to hotels like this but I was blown away as I didn't know what to expect. We were at the end of our 10 day driving trip around Ireland. Spending our last 2 nights at the Merrion. When we first drove up I saw the top hats and tails and told my husband to pull over before pulling up. As this was our last stop before going home I needed to clean out trunk and organize all of our stuff that had accumulated in the trunk so I could pack our bags in the hotel before returning car. Well, the Doormen came over to us and started helping unload everything, I was like no, I need to organize. It was all quite funny. 
The Merrion is second to none, absolutely beautiful right upon entry. They have several little courtyards where you can sit outside and relax and not feel like you're in the middle of the city. The room was also stunning, very comfortable bed, Full Marble bathroom, filled with wonderful luxury towels, robes and products. The restaurant and breakfast buffet was wonderful, location is perfect. We did try to get spa appointments and they couldn't accommodate but offered to try their sister property down the road. If you want to use the spa make your appointment before traveling.",5,2019,03,29
200,Top Level Staff,This Hotel is 5 star because of the staff. Without a doubt the most helpful and happy staff from a hotel I have stayed in. Room service was top class.

200,Special Hotel!,Our trip to Dublin was made even more special due to our stay at the Merrion. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable.  The staff went over and above to see that all of our needs were met. It was a busy week end (St. Patrick's Day) and the hotel appeared to be booked but we did not feel at all as if the service was less than perfect.,5,2019,03,27
200,Excellent ,"My family and I just had an excellent stay in the Merrion hotel. The staff are fabulous, in particular the breakfast team and the concierge outside with the top hats, nicest gentleman I have ever met. Organised a shuttle service to an alternative pool (their own currently being renovated) for our son to enjoy, guest relations manager was excellent. Staff couldn’t do enough for us. Thank you so much! ",5,2019,03,27
200,really lovely stay in Dublin,"We decided to stay on St Patrick's weekend. It was a really nice stay. Perfect location. Exceptional staff. Breakfast was delicious.

200,5* and more,"Had a fabulous 1 night stay in the beautiful Merrion at the weekend. From check in to checkout I could not fault one thing. Stayed in a suite on the 3rd floor overlooking the beautiful gardens, having been upgraded on arrival. Had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant with excellent service and lovely atmosphere. Have nothing negative to report whatsoever..",5,2019,03,26

Have you ever come back to your room after turn down service and found hotel branded velcro ties neatly organizing your phone charger cords!?  The rooms are impeccable with luxury bedding and bath accessories.  The hotel is very quiet and peaceful offering a very relaxing stay.  Beautiful gardens in the center of the hotel area.  Location is central in Dublin.,5,2019,03,24
200,Amazing stay at the Merrion!,"Our stay at the Merrion for our honeymoon was absolutely fantastic in every way! The location was great, close to St Stephen’s Green, and walking distance to many sites in Dublin. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our honeymoon was special and the accommodations were amazing!",5,2019,03,24
200,Top Choice in Dublin,Stayed here several times; always a good experience.  Like the location as it is away from the crowds on Grafton and in Temple Bar.  Excellent pubs and restaurants nearby.  Best restaurant in Dublin on premises.  Only negative on this trip was that the spa and fitness center are under renovation.  Hotel has temporary fitness facilities which are enough to make due. ,5,2019,03,23
200,Luxury hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Great hotel in my favourite part of historic Dublin. Beautiful gardens either side of the hotel and the Parliament opposite - but even more important (to me) are the fabulous old pubs around the corner. Added to this are the luxurious rooms, fabulous service and great staff. I love it. ",5,2019,03,22
200,Old Fashioned Elegance.,The Merrion is a spectacular hotel. The staff is more than attentive. The Merrion is old world charm. We really enjoyed the afternoon tea (and drinks) and the overall comfort and elegance. Dining at the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud inside the Merrion is a treat. The Merrion is also within walking distance of many great places in Dublin. And they have a fantastic indoor pool! The Merrion is definitely the place to stay in Dublin.,5,2019,03,20
200,Sheer Luxury at the Merrion Hotel - wonderful!,"We recently stayed at the Merrion Hotel and as always were not disappointed.  Service and style in abundance. Wonderful friendly hotel in a fantastic location within walking distance of the centre of Dublin and all its cultural and social activities. We had lunch on arrival in the Garden Restaurant which was superb. Such a beautiful restaurant during the day overlooking the wonderful gardens and was even better in the evening.  Superb food in a wonderful setting, what more could you ask for. Highly recommend this hotel, it does not get better than this!",5,2019,03,18
200,Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in!!,Lost count of the times we have stayed at the Merrion now and every time it is just perfect - honestly the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Everything about it is just fantastic. Apart from last time there was no tea bread at breakfast 😱 hoping it was just a one off! As it’s actually unreal the most amazing teabread i have ever tasted with delicious butter! ,5,2019,03,17
200,Great stay in a great place,"The Merrion is now our hotel of choice when visiting Dublin.  It is near all the places we like to visit--art galleries, shopping.  the staff are always friendly and helpful, and the surroundings--art on the walls, garden to enjoy, rooms that are quiet and lovely, good food, etc--make it the best value in the city.",5,2019,03,15
200,Class and Civility is what The Merrion is,"Over the years, I've stayed a few times at The Shelbourne and The Westbury in Dublin; both fine hotels. But The Merrion is the only hotel I stayed at for years now my many recent trips to Dublin. The minute I arrive and I get a warm Irish welcome from the fantastic doormen I feel like I have escaped  the crazy world and entered into a different time, a time when civility reigns. The staff can't do enough for you but it isn't overbearing. It is from a place of being of service, a how can I help, a how are you doing, The Merrion is a respite of peace, calm, kindness and this is due to the staff. Genuine, no airs, just people who are happy to welcome you and eager to make you feel special. The hotel is beautiful, the room immaculate, the beds and linens so comfortable. Perfect location away from the busyness of Grafton Street, Dame St. and O'Connell St. they're close by for shopping, dining, etc. The staff are the best - everyone from the sweetest doormen, hard working housekeeping staff, spa staff, restaurants and front desk. A stay at The Merrion will leave you feeling restored, peaceful and longing to return to a hotel who's speciality is creating an atmosphere that makes you realize what we want in a hotel and on vacation is civility. As soon as I leave long for a return The Merrion for civility, fine service with warmth and genuine care. The pool and sauna were closed for renovations and just know they'll be really good updates.",5,2019,03,10
200,Magical stay,I got a complimentary upgrade to a spectacular suite.  The hotel is absolutely fabulous and the staff are the best in the world.  The food is delicious and very good value for money.  We love coming back to this hotel and always look forward to our next visit. Thank you for a great stay.,5,2019,03,09
200,"Staff leading the way, and an example for other hotels","What an amazing Hotel. We have stayed in Dublin countless times and travelled all over the world but the staff here are without doubt the best I have encountered. No stuffiness like in other 5 star hotels. Everyone has time to chat. Patrick is the most lovely person! The room was spotless and well stocked, amazing bed and pillows. The shower fabulous and the little touches like the box of chocolates was a very nice touch. Housekeeping excellent and turndown service a joy. We had room service and ate in the Garden room, both beautiful and breakfast was very relaxing with plenty of choice.Dinner was in the Cellar Bar, stunning food, great menu and great atmosphere. The staff accommodated us even when we had not booked and were very busy. I have found my new favourite hotel and cannot wait to return.",5,2019,03,07
200,Merrion Hotel,"Absolutley fabalous hotel in every respect the staff were also excellent friendly and could not have been more helpful.

200,A huge treat,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in    It's in the most beautiful place    And, even though it's a special hotel, the staff are relaxed and friendly and don't make you feel weird    The paintings on the walls are exceptional   There was one I kept passing when I got lost  (the hotel is set over 3 houses & quite confusing)   It was a boy on a swing outside a large house  He's looking back apprehensively  It reminded me of my childhood and became an old friend during my stay",5,2019,03,07
200,Fab birthday treat,My husband treated me to a weekend here for my 30th birthday and we’ve gone back each year since in December because I just love it. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are lovely. The first time we stayed for my 30th we got upgraded to a junior suite and it was amazing!! The lounge is so nice and relaxing to sit back and enjoy a bottle of Bollinger by the fire. The food in the cellar bar is nice and we only ate once in the restaurant for dinner. The last time we stayed we didn’t book breakfast so paid extra for it and it was very expensive for what we ate. Will book in advance next time. Can’t wait to go back for my birthday in December 2019!,5,2019,03,06
200,A Wonderful meal in the Garden Room,"Last sunday during inclement weather we decided to eat at the Merrion Hotel Garden Room. The experience was fantastic and that sorry it was over feeling.The food and service was exceptional as was the ambience. Opulence being the operative word.
I have no hesitation in suggesting this wonderful find. We enjoyed a crisp glass of Henriot champagne followed by a well structured house Pinot Noir , a second bottle was required !.Dublin uncomplicated dining at its best Bravo.",5,2019,03,06
200,Attention to detail,"My recent stay at the Merrion was very enjoyable. It’s location is excellent but it’s the details that make all the difference. There was a box of chocolates in the room on arrival, plenty of water, and a bottle in the car for the journey home, a fluffy bathrobe and a really comfortable bed. The staff were fantastic, always attentive without being obtrusive. I have stayed here before and the staff are the secret weapon, so friendly. I will definitely return. ",5,2019,03,05
200,Fabulous!,"Felt very very special from start to finish. From being met at the door, the check-in and being shown to our fabulous room. Everything about the hotel is beautiful
Only slight disappointment was the Merrion/Irish breakfast - a bit bland ",5,2019,03,05
200,Excellent hotel but overpriced,"Very exclusive hotel with beautifully appointed rooms, simple yet elegant, nice lobby and dining area. We were given very close attention at the 2 Michelin star restaurant, excellent meal, impeccable service. The concierge took the time to give us VIP tickets to a special area for the St. Patrick's Day parade so it wasn't crowded. The concierge also made a stop at the National Gallery to pick up a catalog book for me on my request as we ran out of time. They made our stay very comfortable; the most accommodating hotel!",5,2019,03,04
200,Beautiful hotel with outstanding service,Stayed here for four nights in total and wished it could have been more. Tastefully decorated interiors with a feeling of understated luxury. The staff are all so friendly helpful and welcoming. The attention to detail is remarkable even down to providing a ziplock bag on your last night in case you need it for liquids when flying. My room was spacious and the bed so comfortable with the most decadent fluffy towels and bathrobe. Can’t wait to stay here again. ,5,2019,03,04
200,Wonderful 5 night stay,We would like to thank the merrion for looking after us on our trip to celebrate my fiancée’s 50th birthday. The only disappointment was the spa being closed due to renovation. Hopefully we will be able to visit again when the work is completed,5,2019,03,03
200,The Merger tour of Ireland,"Amazing hotel...classy, warm & welcoming. Would come back here for sure! Staff are friendly, knowledgeable & can’t do enough for you. Rooms are elegantly finished & spacious. Food is delicious & plenty of variety. ",5,2019,03,03
200,Wonderful hotel that hasn't sold out to a big chain,"This hotel is very conveniently located, and very quiet. It has impressive facilities, and two different bar/restaurants to suit your needs. The staff is incredibly friendly. It's on par with it's big competitor- but if you want a more authentic Dublin experience, I would stay at this hotel. They haven't sold out to a chain, and you can feel the difference in a charming way. Also the beds are the most comfortable I've ever stayed in.",5,2019,03,02
200,Consistently the Best,Understated elegance and professional service with a smile. Beautiful and well cared for accommodations. That sums it up for the Merrion. The Best Hotel in Dublin. I have stayed there for twenty years and look forward to another twenty. ,5,2019,03,02
200,Rested and Relaxed,"The Merrion is the best of both worlds. It is an 'escape from it all oasis' in a city centre location with lots to do and see. Our children bought this break as a Christmas present and it was fantastic. Everything is on your doorstep ( my husband avoided shopping and went to the history and art museum, whilst I happily shopped). We had a lovely meal in the hotel's Garden restaurant. Go pamper yourself in beautiful surroundings, and see customer service at its very best. Life just slowed down and we left feeling refreshed and hoping to return again.

",5,2019,03,01
200,Exceptional Service,"The hotel's website says: The Merrion occupies some of the finest, most beautifully restored, and best-located Georgian buildings in Dublin city centre. Our gracious public rooms with crackling peat fires epitomise the relaxed elegance for which The Merrion is known.

All this is true. Having returned from my work dinner, I sat at the bar chatting to the Polish barman, who was great, while having a very nice glass of wine (think sophisticated gentleman's club from a bygone era).  The service was very warm and welcoming, I liked my room and the breakfast was delicious.

So why not five stars?  Well, my only issue with the hotel was that my bathroom was decked out top to bottom and head to toe in white mottled marble, which somehow took away all of its character. You might say it's just a bathroom, but it was totally out of keeping with the bedroom and made me feel like I was in an operating theatre.

That said, it wouldn’t stop me returning.",4,2019,03,01
200,best hotel in Dublin,"always a fantastic hotel to stay in and the staff are magnificent, you can guarantee that you will be very well looked after, also the main bar does fantastic cocktails, and there is Bernie on the main desk that helps you out magnificently!",5,2019,03,01
200,Weekend in dublin,Booked the Merrion Hotel because of its central location. We found staff extremely friendly and they made our stay memorable.All aspects of the hotel are admirable. The only Downside would be the cost for an overnight stay without breakfast is a little steep but that being said the experience was worth it !!,3,2019,02,26
200,Bliss,"The Merrion is luxury and comfort at its finest. We had a wonderful stay and were so impressed by staff and surroundings, especially how well our two infants were catered for. We were unsure such a high-end hotel would tolerate two little monsters but the Merrion goes above and beyond for its mini guests! So happy with our experience- memories are made of this. Thank you. ",5,2019,02,26
200,Truly perfection for a hotel,"Amazing place. Great restaurant abound, as well as attractions, all within a short walk. I can't think of anything to say bad about this place. One thing that was amazing which is usually just average in every hotel was the housekeeping service.",5,2019,02,23
200,As perfect as perfect gets,"I recently stayed at The Merrion for a weekend to get some work done - and relax at the same time. From the moment I picked up the phone to the time I checked out, staff listened attentively to what I needed.

200,The best hotel in Dublin,Our second visit to The Merrion & another fantastic stay. Lovely hotel with excellent staff and service. Rooms spacious & spotlessly clean.  Great location close to lots of good bars & restaurants. We hope to return soon! ,5,2019,02,20
200,Warm and Welcoming Place,"Our trip to the Merrion was a wonderful experience. I was traveling with my 10 month old son during our stay. The Merrion was prepared and had given me their word that they would have a cot in my room. Not only did they have a cot, but they also placed a baby robe, slippers, and baby toiletries in my bathroom. Finally- they also had a bottle warmer. These gestures were noticed and made our stay feel more like home. I am grateful to the Merrion staff for the time spent in preparation of our arrival at the Merrion.",5,2019,02,19
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed two nights to celebrate a significant birthday. We LOVE the Merrion, best location, best service, all very relaxed and enjoyable. If budget permits then stay in the original building for added charm! ",5,2019,02,19

200,"Wonderful Staff, great experience",The staff was on top of everything and made you feel very welcome.

200,Charming Gem of a Hotel,"We just returned from a stay at the Merrion. What a lovely gem of a hotel! The service was top notch. Everyone from the porters, concierge, to the staff at front desk was warm and gracious. They made us feel so welcome - always a smile. Our room was lovely and included a sitting area with decorative fireplace and there were amazing linens on the bed. Really the beds linens are so incredible they are worth mentioning. This is a special hotel. The Garden restaurant served a lovely breakfast everyday and we had a very nice lunch and dinner there.  

The location of this hotel is terrific if you want to pop out the front door and stroll through Dublin.  Not all the 5 star hotels we researched have this fantastic location.  Unfortunately the spa and pool were being renovated so we didn’t get to check those out.  

We will definitely return to the Merrion next time we are in Dublin.  ",5,2019,02,09
200,Simply the best,"The Merrion is hands-down on of the best hotels in the world.  Impeccable service, wonderful accommodations, incredible staff.  Close to many restaurants and pubs and offices in the heart of Dublin. Within walking distance of St Stephens Green, Grafton St. etc. ",5,2019,02,05

From the minute we arrived at the front of the hotel until our departure we were treated as though we were frequent guests even though this was our first stay . The stay are excellent , using your name each time they meet you . Everything about our stay in  this hotel made it a memorable birthday treat . Our meal in Patrick Guilbaud's restaurant was a dining experience which I will cherish. Breakfast and dinner in the Garden Restaurant were excellent as was lunch in bar 23 . The cellar bar is a great place to get the feel of being in a Dublin pub but with 5 star service . There is traditional Irish music on Thursdays . I look forward to returning to the Merrion, I do hope I don't have to wait until I reach another milestone birthday.",5,2019,02,05
200,Great Overnight Stay,"Lovely hotel in a great location.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  The room was spacious and extremely comfortable.  We had dinner in The Cellar Bar, which was excellent.  Overall a really enjoyable stay.",5,2019,02,03
200,Weekend stay,We stayed from Friday to Sunday in this fabulous hotel. The rooms were luxurious.  Staff were friendly and professional. The location is not as good as some other hotels but still close to grafton Street so handy for shopping and st Stephens Green. We did not dine in the hotel so cannot comment on their lunch or dinner menus.,5,2019,01,30
200,Perfection!,"Our four night stay at The Merrion was perfect in every way. The building itself, which was originally four townhouses, is beautiful, including its furnishings and amazing art collection. Its location in center city south is very convenient to many of the must-see Dublin attractions.  The accommodations were terrific. Our suite was spacious and and perfectly appointed. The Merrion’s attention to detail is amazing. They have thought of everything. I cannot say enough good things about the service. Every single person we encountered was polite, friendly and helpful. This is the best hotel staff I’ve ever experienced. In summary, we have stayed at some very nice hotels around the world. The Merrion is at the top of the list. Well done. ",5,2019,01,30
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"Merrion is a real five star, from the moment you enter the lobby and until you leave again you can feel the vibe. The hotel is of a high standard, beautiful and well maintained, the facilities are good and the location perfect, but some of the rooms in the main building can be a bit low ceilinged. This is what you expect from a professional international five star hotel with plenty of charm, we will be back",5,2019,01,27
200,January break,My wife and I had the pleasure of staying for a short get away. The location is perfect and suits everyone wishing to visit Dublin whether it be for pleasure or business. The staff were excellent and warranted the price tag. We found the deluxe main house room amazing and when we had difficulty with the heating system we were moved to a suite. We visited the restaurant and also both bars. The food was amazing well worth a try. The staff again in the restaurant and bars were outstanding and they more than the facilities are why we are happy to give it 5 stars ,5,2019,01,26
200,"Little Touches, High Impact","I go to Dublin for work quite a bit and honestly, just stay in whatever hotel Egencia suggests, so I didn’t choose The Merrion, but boy, did I love it. 

Location is central, but seems a little more secluded than some other central high-end hotels - the staff are informal but attentive, the vibe is traditional country-house-in-the-city and there’s a lot of very comfortable public space across the townhouses - a must have from my point of view.

The Merrion is much bigger than you’d expect - extending back into the city block on which it sits; reception staff show you to your room, which always seems a little OTT to me, but you’d probably got lost otherwise..!

I had a good size, comfortable, room with lots of power points, good WiFi and an incredibly comfy bed.    Free bottles of water (which bizarrely you don’t always get - I had to pay $5 a bottle in a Nashville TN hotel last week) and M&Ms among the in room refreshments.

Breakfast was in a lovely room with a great buffet and *really* good tea - a calm start to the day, reading the paper and checking emails.
I can’t talk about the gym, as the spa/gym only opens at 06.30, which for a business day is just too late - bit disappointing. 

And then you come on to my main reason for writing this review, which goes to show that it can be small thing that really make a difference - and that the housekeeping team can really have an impact on guest experience.
The Turndown!  All my toiletries arranged neatly, my belt spooled and place on an armchair, shoes placed neatly together - and get this! - Merrion bookmarks placed in the two books that were by my bedside.

Business travel can be dull and it’s not always nice being away from family and home - small things like this can really have an emotional impact and a positive effect on guest experience.

Nice work, Merrion team.",5,2019,01,25
200,Absolutely stunning,"The stay at The Merrion was too brief, but it was an amazing stay. From the moment we pulled up until the time we left, it was nothing but luxury. It made a birthday celebration even more special. I will return!",5,2019,01,23
200,loved our stay,"Really enjoyed our stay, the staff are lovely and the location is great. The artwork is gorgeous and being able to see it up close is a real treat. The central courtyard is a lovely oasis in a busy city and the food in the cellar bar was amazing!",5,2019,01,23
200,They have no sound proofing.,"I waited a while before writing this review so here we go.
The wife and I had a night away from the kids so we picked the Merrion, mainly because we had a voucher that they took.
Went to check in but because I was using a voucher I had to pay the full value of the room up front. A bit odd, made worse because my credit card was held up in the air and I was told it was a debit card as if this was unusual. It also took ages,
Got to the room and despite telling them in the booking and again over the phone that it was my wife’s birthday, the room was empty of any greeting. Unfortunately this was made worse by her knowing that they should send something to the room. I took the hit for this as she was already on edge after the oddly embarrassing check-in experience.
Sound proofing, my god the rooms lack any form of sound proofing. 6.30 the knocking starts on the doors and it lasted an hour and it is loud. 
10.30, I kid you not, drilling and hammering started in the floor above. After a loud shout to stop they did but unless it was emergency drilling we were left wondering why?
Checkout, how could it be worse than the check-in? If the staff had no idea why I was charged for the full price of the room if I was using a voucher and so had to try to find the receipt. Ten minutes later, my card was refunded and we were out of there, swearing never to return.
Two stars because even though it’s what you pay for, the Hotel is beautiful.",2,2019,01,23
200,Birthday Stay,"Fabulous hotel with 5 star service, right in the heart of Dublin! Beautifully laid out chocolates and Prosecco in the room for my birthday! Valet parking and friendly and helpful staff! Amazing stay!!!",5,2019,01,22
200,A wonderful wedding experience,We recently celebrated our wedding with some friends and family staying at The Merrion Hotel with dinner in Patrick Guilbauds Restaurant. We had a wonderful time. For our three days and nights at the hotel we were made feel very special. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food and service in Patrick Guilbaud's restaurant was the highlight. I can't thank everyone there enough or highly recommend this hotel enough.,5,2019,01,22
200,Incredible Hotel and Wonderful Experience,"It was a truly wonderful experience staying here for 3 nights over New Year. A true 5 star hotel, with the emphasis on understated and discreet luxury, with all staff reflecting an incredible sense of 5 star hospitality. Beautifully appointed garden room, superb food throughout the hotel and a sense of staying home away from home, albeit in a beautiful historical building / hotel. We will definitely be coming back, it was a highlight of 2018-2019.",5,2019,01,19
200,"Wonderful 4 night stay, can't wait to return","From the staff making the booking over the phone to every member we encountered in the hotel, it is all about customer service at the Merrion.  Bravo to the management, they do an outstanding job selecting and training all of their staff. Throughout our stay we were made feel like VIPs.  We had 2 wonderful interconnecting rooms, our kids had balloons and cookies on arrival, kids bathrooms and slippers all laid out, no calling housekeeping to deliver them, the Merrion had already thought of it. We had an amazing Christmas tree in our suite.  It is all about the details at the Merrion, staff are anticipating your needs.  In the event something doesn't work, room key or something of that nature, the reception staff are coming to the door with your new keys.  Well done to the staff at the Merrion, literally every single one we encountered, service excellence at its best.",5,2019,01,18

200,"My Most Memorable Hotel: The Merrion, Dublin","The Merrion is an oasis of luxury, calm, and service in a busy city. Possibly my favorite hotel at any time, anywhere. Impeccable in every way--including the real fires (not gas) burning everywhere you look. Sixty-six years of luxury travel behind me--not talking through my hat. : )",5,2019,01,13
200,Excellent stay at a fantastic hotel,"The Merrion truly is a 5-star hotel. It has everything that you would expect from a hotel of this calibre - an extremely comfortable bed; an immaculately clean room; a perfect bathroom; excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable staff; a great pool; lovely food. Then there are the small touches that are thoughtful and unexpected. For example, one day I left my computer cord out - I came back to find that the cord had been tidied and kept together with a Merrion-branded cable holder. Another day I left my book, and since I had forgotten to bring a bookmark, I'd folded the page over. I came back to the page marked by a Merrion bookmark instead. Staff followed up with me to ask if I'd enjoyed activities that they helped me arrange. These kinds of things add an extra layer of polish to a stay, and take the Merrion above and beyond. I am very glad I chose to stay here, and look forward to doing so in the future. I also recommend the Tethra Spa, both for swimming and for spa treatments. The hotel is also in a great location that makes it easy to walk to a range of activities and points of interest.",5,2019,01,12
200,An outrageous check-out,"The hotel is nice and well located, but when I checked out I found an extra charge on the bill for a minibar consumption I never had.Ok, it happens sometimes and they removed it from the bill.Few hours later, when I landed back home, I received an email from the hotel in which they informed that they had charged my credit card for another minibar consumption that I never had. They sent me the receipt of the consumption, which had been filled AFTER my check out...in other words, it really seemed that they tried to cheat me and steal 50 euros...what's for?It really set a dark shadow on the managing system of this hotel...that's I pity, because I liked that...So, please, be really accurate in checking your bill at the Merrion Dublin...",2,2019,01,12
200,Always fantastic,"Stay at The Merrion is always a special experience. The staff are extremely helpful and cannot do enough to make the stay memorable. The rooms are luxurious, particularly in the old house. Food is very good and the breakfast is a particular favourite. All the food are local fare and very fresh. It is very close to the city centre but the rooms are so quiet. There is a very good museum and 2 parks nearby.",5,2019,01,08
200,Great Hotel Great location,If you want a five star experience in Dublin look no farther than The MERRION  great location. Attentive  staff  quieter than the Shelbourne in terms of the bar area which is fine if like me that’s what you want excellent accommodation ironing board tea coffee making facilities Good selection of bathroom necessities great shower good selection in mini bar safe and fridge All in all a five star experience ,5,2019,01,08
200,Catch up with friends.,"Just spent 2 days at The Merrion Hotel with friends from Scotland, as expected we were extremely well looked after. We ate in the dining room on the Friday evening, excellent meal with good service. Breakfasts are relaxing and most enjoyable.",5,2019,01,06

200,Pool ,The pool was nice and it was very big. It was very relaxing and the steam room was very nice. It’s appropriate for kids and there is armbands there too. Kids can go whenever they want but they need to be accompanied by an adult. There is also a gym that is very nice near the pool ,5,2019,01,03
200,Extremely comfortable and friendly hotel in splendid Dublin location,We stayed here for New Year  and loved every minute of our 2 full days in Dublin.  The Merrion is such a perfect place to stay - quiet but near all the places you want to visit in Dublin.  We loved the bar for drinks and snacks and watched the afternoon tea ceremony which is extremely popular.  The staff are charming and you are looked after from the moment you arrive until you leave.  We stayed in the garden wing and our room overlooked the lovely interior garden all lit up with tiny Christmas lights - so beautiful.  The breakfast room/restaurant is very smart but welcoming and comfortable and a sumptuous array of choice for breakfast.  A good cappuccino too!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and can’t wait for another visit!,5,2019,01,03
200,Superb hotel,We stayed for 3 nights for my sons wedding. Staff were excellent so very accommodating and courteous. Rooms were excellent and food was brilliant. Will definitely use this hotel again. I cannot praise it enough. ,5,2019,01,03
200,Wow wow wow what an experience!,We recently attended a wedding reception at the Merrion Hotel Dublin - a wonderful experience from start to finish. We checked into the hotel around 6pm the receptionist could not be any more helpful - she walked us to our room and the bellboy followed with our bags - such service! Our room was amazing the attention to detail was second to none. We were then escorted to a Champagne Reception and from there the wedding party were shown to  the room where we would have dinner and what a meal this was. From the smoked trout starter to the mushroom soup and onto the beef mains and sticky toffee pudding I cannot fault anything. The wine flowed all evening the service was excellent there was always a waiter at your elbow filling water glasses wine glasses and checking if everything was ok. After a lovely night in our amazing room breakfast was lovely freshly cooked perfect! AS we were not leaving until 4 that afternoon our bags were tagged and put away until we needed them. I cannot praise this hotel enough having stayed in many hotels around the country including three other 5 starred establishments this has got to be the best we're encountered so far! Will certainly visit again!,5,2019,01,02
200,Excellent hotel,"Our second one-night stay within the last 18-months. Everything is top quality, particularly since their recent extension (new garden restaurant). Very professional yet friendly and welcoming.Only small quibble was dated radio in room (iPod connection (!!) but no bluetooth facility), and pairing to TV was too complicated to operate.",5,2019,01,02
200,"Simply, The Best in Dublin","I love staying in nice hotels when I travel because to me that is one of the best parts of traveling. You get pampered, you eat extravagant breakfasts and you have your bed made by somebody other than yourself; just perfect right?

The Merrion, a 5 Stars hotel in Dublin, was all that and more!  It was exceptional!  I already talked about Irish hospitality but the staff at The Merrion go above and beyond to make you happy all the time.

Created from four Georgian townhouses, it is located in the city center opposite government buildings. There are 142 bedrooms and suites overlooking the most beautiful gardens.

The location is perfect. I was able to walk to most places that will recommend to you in this post. Everything was close by and my walks were never longer than 20  minutes. You have a BUNCH of amazing restaurants within a 5 min walk. Of course, you can also eat at the hotel.

Amenities

The Merrion has a 2-star Michelin restaurant called Patrick Guilbaud and there is also another restaurant on the premises called The Cellar Restaurant and Bar. They are both very good and The Cellar they have a very nice full bar/lounge.

I also recommend you get breakfast included when you book your room. Breakfast there was sooo good. The food choices were very similar to what you get in a 5 Star American Hotel but you can also pretty much ask for whatever you want and they will make it happen.

For example,  I wanted a green juice (I was missing California) and they didn’t have it on the menu or on the buffet and I asked Daphine, who was our amazing waitress everyday, and she was like “absolutely, what do you want in it? what else would like? we can make whatever you want to eat”. I was very impressed by the service! And it was like that with the rest of staff all the time.

There is also a spa, the Tethra Spa, which has a huge 18m pool, steam room, fully equipped gymnasium, and two private treatment rooms. I worked out almost every day during my vacation (I am sure you saw my IG updates), thanks to amazing hotels like this, that understand our needs.

So bring your swimwear for the pool but in case you forget to bring it they can sell you one right there at the spa. They are in the business of finding out what you will need before you even need it, my kind of service!

The rooms are luxurious and well decorated with a very classic and elegant style. Our room was very spacious and even had a sofa, work desk, huge bathroom and a very comfortable mattress covered with very good quality linen.

Hotel Staff

Honestly, they were the best.  There is nothing negative that I can say. They anticipate all your needs and make you feel very welcome. Everyone smiles and greets you. Irish hospitality is topnotch.

Internet/WiFi at The Merrion 

So I thought this was worth mentioning because with my job as a blogger I really need the internet to work really well all the time. And I can’t even tell you how many times I have stayed at hotels where the internet sucked or I had to pay a super expensive daily fee for crappy internet service.

Their internet service was better than mine at home, super fast!",5,2019,01,01
200,Amazing,We were there on our honeymoon and it was amazing. The staff are above any expectations and really make the entire week wonderful   The concierge desk was able to arrange all our transfers plus book us tickets at events around the city.

200,Great stay!,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Merrion. The staff were excellent and the room was very spacious and comfortable. We also had a very nice treatment in the Spa, which I would recommend. Unfortunately the pool was closed for maintenance when we were there but we were offered to return to use this facility at another time as we could not avail of it during our stay, which is great. ",5,2018,12,31
200,Wonderful 5 star experience,We had fabulous dinner and breakfast in the Green Room during our stay. Marco looked after us at breakfast and he was exceptional. It is nice to see that a wonderful hotel like the merrion continue to hire wonderful staff.,5,2018,12,30

200,Great staff,The staff at the merrion were excellent. Professional and warm.Eating great food  at Christmas is part of the magic ..

200,The perfect start to our family Christmas,"The staff are the most amazing bunch of people. the manager of the garden restaurant is an absolute pleasure he always makes us and our 4year old little girl feel so welcome and the food is always consistently great. Our room was just beautiful and the little bed that they make up for our little one along with her gown and slippers is just adorable.Connor Shaw is as always an absolute gent.The young guy that actually walked us to show us where the pool was , waited and showed us then how to get to our room was just so lovely. And you wouldn’t get that in any other hotel!And the conceirge, managing to fit our cases into a very packed (Santa) car , still with a smile on his face!The absolute perfect start to our Christmas.Thank you all!!",5,2018,12,28

200,The magnificent Merrion Hotel,"From the moment i placed my foot on the steps of the Merrion i experienced world class customer service.  It is evident the Hotel has invested in employee training; something that is frequently lacking throughout the hospitality industry in my experience.  The rooms were beautiful and spotlessly clean.  The food was excellent and the Spa therapists experienced and professional.  You dont always get what you pay for,  but you certainly do at the Merrion.",5,2018,12,25
200,Simply the best,"We had lunch in the Garden restaurant yesterday. It’s my fourth time eating there and it’s been so enjoyable each time. Firstly,  even though it’s busy everywhere now pre christmas,  it’s the only restaurant I have been in recently not trying to turn over tables every two hours. There was no rush and we could stay at our table as long as we needed.  Secondly where everyone else seems to be offering a set 3 course Christmas menu there were no restrictions here. Fabulous menu. We had prawns and mango salsa  to  start and cote de boeuf to share for two. The food was delicious. Prawns so tasty and the beef cooked to perfection. Best meal I have had in a long time. An extra positive was the soft live music playing throughout. Just enough to create a wonderful atmosphere. The staff were all very pleasant. I can’t tecommend this enough.",5,2018,12,23

200,Best afternoon tea ,"Took my mother for afternoon tea as a surprise. Normally I wouldn’t think of doing this but I thought I will treat her before Christmas. We arrived for a 16.30 spot and we had a lovely table by the fire. I didn’t know what to expect on the day but realized that I booked the Carroll’s Afternoon Tea so a choir appeared and started to sing. My mother thought I brought her to a concert, great start. The food was lovely especially the pastries. The girl that was looking after us poured my tea at least 10 times, very impressive. The whole thing was very special. I wouldn’t do this everyday but I think I will start a family tradition each year. The choir was absolutely beautiful and few people had tears at the end. Just great.",5,2018,12,17

200,Gracious doormen,"We didn't actually stay at this hotel, although it looked stunning. Wexhappened to pass by running late for a flight. We asked if they knew where we could get a taxi from. A lovley gentlemen hailed one down for us, held the door open and was generally lovley. Thanks to you both. Great advertisement for your hotel. ",5,2018,12,10
200,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is basically perfect in every way! Staff are amazing,attentive but not all over you. The venue itself has amazing art and gardens. Good and wine never disappoint and it is in the best location in town!",5,2018,12,09

Whatever your needs, they will work to satisfy them. And they anticipate need as well, supporting travelers to reach their goals",5,2018,12,08
200,Luxurious retreat in the heart of Dublin,Beautiful hotel with friendly attentive staff with the added bonus of a gallery of art treasures and a Michelin starred restaurant before you even step outside. Walking distance to all Dublin’s main attractions. We stayed before Christmas in the historic main house part of the hotel and we even had decorations in our room which was a lovely surprise. Breakfast was excellent and I’d recommend to anyone that is looking for a special place to stay in Dublin.,5,2018,12,07
200,Weekend break,"As part of Christmas tradition our annual stay in the Merrion Hotel which is situate in the heart of Dublin 2 was as wonderful as ever.A stunning setting & location.The hotel had a wonderful buzz about it & the staff , food & wine were simply divine! Can not wait to go back! ",5,2018,12,06
200,Perfect,"Absolute perfection from the moment we walked in. World class customer service, utterly beautiful bedroom and so comfortable, wonderful breakfast. We enjoyed it so much I even feel it was value for money. ",5,2018,12,05
200,Possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in,From the moment that you drive up to this mansion in the middle of the City you enter a world of comfort and charm. The reception couldn’t be more helpful and our upgraded suite was the height of luxury. There is a smiling member of the staff to help you at every turn. Lunch in the newly opened Garden Room was excellent with brilliant service. The Spa was conveniently placed with an enormous pool. I do hope that we will return in the near future and stay longer,5,2018,12,01
200,Dublin at Its Best,I have stayed at the Merrion for twenty years. I always look forward to the next trip and the warm hospitality extended. The hotel has been maintained in five star fashion and quality. The Management and Staff are very professional and friendly always willing to go the extra mile to assure that your stay is memorable. My thanks for twenty years of warm memories. I will return soon. ,5,2018,11,30
200,Faultless,"had a lovely weekend again there last weekend, without doubt our favorite hotel in Dublin. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave everything is seamless and you're made to feel more than welcome, the staff are superbly trained, a cut above most other hotels I've stayed in, the hotel is beautiful, location is perfect",5,2018,11,29
200,Superb hotel in Georgian House in central Dublin,"We have stayed twice in the Merrion hotel this month. I can honestly say that it has got to be one of the best hotels in Europe. From the moment one arrives the friendly staff make one welcome and the standard of service is exceptional. If you arrive by car the hall porters will take it and park it in the hotel’s own garage.
The lovely reception areas are tastefully furnished and everywhere there are good original paintings by Irish artists hung in all the ground floor areas. The hotel owns a Good art collection and there is a catalogue of the paintings in each room.
The bedrooms are spacious and quiet, a lot of them overlook the courtyard garden, so no noise of traffic. They Are equipped with ironing board, kettle and tea/coffee making ingredients, plenty storage and cupboard space. A nice touch is the tidy ties which are put round the flex of your phone charger. The bathrooms are also spacious and well equipped.
There is a lovely indoor pool and steam room.
The lovely garden restaurant serves wonderful breakfast ( I particularly like the large honey comb) I have only had lunch there but my cousins who were also staying , had a really good dinner there.
There is a Pleasant  bar on the ground floor and an atmospheric cellar bar downstairs.
All this luxury doesn’t come cheap, but when the surroundings and service are of such excellence I feel it is worth the expense.
It is an absolute treat to spend time in this lovely hotel and we will be back.",5,2018,11,28
200,Consistently Good,"I have stayed in the Merrion a number of times over the past 15 years. If there is one standout quality, it is the continuous consistency of service and quality from the moment you arrive at the hotel. The people, the doorman, the concierge, the arrivals lobby all ensure that the moment you enter, life is easier. The room is maintained perfectly throughout the day and that first cocktail from the excellent bar staff is  priceless. I stay in a lot of hotels throughout the year, there are two I look forward to, and this is one of them",5,2018,11,27
200,Afternoon tea,"Recently had a very enjoyable afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel. Very relaxing few hours enjoying really nice food served up by attentive, but not overbearing, staff in a lovely laid back environment. They also put a personal message on our signature plates served at the end of the meal which was a really nice touch. They offer a great range of specialty teas as part of the package and the rest of the afternoon was just so relaxing and quiet that you'd never realise you're only a 5 min walk from the bustle of St. Stephens Green and shopping area.",5,2018,11,26
200,A most memorable experience,A little piece of luxury in Dublin City centre. A fantastic place and although expensive worth every penny (or cent). We stayed one night only and from arrival to leaving we were treated like royalty. Something special.,5,2018,11,20
200,Fabulous Hotel,"I loved this hotel. The moment I walked in I felt appreciated and looked after. The conceirge brought my back up, I was walked to my room by a lovely assistant and given a little history of the place along the way which added to my experience.The room was lovely in size, nice size bathroom with bath and shower.Elegent environment and lots of history. Staff were very well turned out, smart and polite. A sophisticated place that I will definately be staying at again.",5,2018,11,20
200,Special hotel that makes you feel special..,"Stayed here for our second time on Fri 16th. Our first visit was very special made so by the staff,food and  ambience. Our second visit was equally special. From the moment we arrived we felt like VIP's. Nothing is too much trouble for them and every single member of staff deserves to be recognised for their friendliness. Breakfast was wonderful, so relaxing and anything you could wish for was provided. We stayed in room 114. It was large,
opulent and literally catered for every need. I am so looking forward to my next stay..",5,2018,11,19
200,A charming and elegant experience,"During our recent trip to Ireland, we had the good fortune to have booked the Merrion in Dublin. It is a wonderful property with a charming and competent staff. Attention to every detail says it all. 
This will be our only hotel in Dublin going forward; it is that good.",5,2018,11,18
200,Fantastic food and superb staff,"We had a large party for dinner in the cellar bar on a very busy night and the food was excellent and the service was superb, the staff could not do enough for us all night. Adil the manager is a credit to the establishment and I would highly recommend anyone going to this place for lunch or dinner.",5,2018,11,18
200,Excellent hotel in fantastic location with superbe service,"The Merrion is one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. Room and bathroom were spacious and tastefully decorated with all the amenities one could wish for. The service was exemplary, e.g. when I left a book on my  table I found a bookmark on it when I returned to my room. The hotel really thinks hard how to improve their guests experience. There is a really nice feel to this hotel and I can highly recommend it!
I definitely will be back staying at the Merrion.",5,2018,11,15
200,Exceeded all expectations,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Merrion in Dublin.  Arriving early after a transatlantic flight, our room was not ready (we were offered shower facilities in the spa), so we hit the town.  A couple of hours later, we received a text from the hotel indicating that our room was ready (very helpful).  
We received an unexpected room upgrade to a very nice suite (Merrion suite).  The furnishings and fittings in the room were very pleasant, and the room was quite comfortable.  There was a large living room overlooking the beautiful garden (this is probably one of the few places where I found a garden view better than a city/street view) with a couch, coffee table, armchair and desk.  There was a separate bedroom, and the bathroom had both a large bathtub and a separate shower stall.  Everything was very clean and well-maintained.
We ate twice in the Garden Room restaurant.  The food and service were both very good.  We had a lovely afternoon ""art"" tea in the Drawing Room by a lovely fireplace.  The pastry chef makes the sweet pastries based on some of the artwork in the hotel!
The indoor pool is a nice place to relax after touring.
ALL of the (international) staff are very friendly and helpful.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,11,14
200,great lunch in cellar bar,"Found this delightful cellar bar when looking to escape the cold. Fab bar, friendly  staff and food was delicious . The burgers looked amazing and apparently tasted as good as they looked as the 2 males with me did them justice , large portion. Will be on the list to re visit on the next trip to Dublin.",4,2018,11,12
200,Remarkable Hotel,We had a wonderful stay at this remarkable Hotel. The staff are so friendly and go above and beyond what I had expected. It was my wifes 50th Birthday and we received an upgrade to a mini suite which was exceptionally thoughtful. A complimentary glass of wine was a lovely touch as we waited to be checked in. The rooms as one would imagine are so perfectly turned out. The meal in the Garden restaurant was super. We'll definately return!,5,2018,11,12
200,...absolutely amazing...,"The location, venue, staff hospitality and general ambience and quality of this venue is really something special and a credit to all involved as this level of output does not happen by accident.  Well done!",5,2018,11,12
200,The best of the best,"I stayed in Rm. 380 in the middle of September. I probably wouldn't be posting this review were it not for the commentary of the reviewer who had such a different experience than mine. First of all, for the leading hotel in a capital city in the EU, the Merrion is doggone inexpensive. Perhaps that is as should be, and in general, for an American, accustomed to prices in other EU capital cities, all of Dublin is quite inexpensive. But the room I had was enormous, exceptionally well equipped and was well priced for what it was. The so-called tea towels are those found in every deluxe hotel when the room is made up for the evening. 
The doctor and I have dramatically different tastes. The entrance to the Merrion is elegant in the most tasteful way. And there are plenty of reception rooms of considerable elegance to be found adjacent to the entrance. I certainly had no trouble whatsoever with my breakfast orders-nor did anyone else. 
As to finding one's way to the pool, I truly hope the doctor does a better job with patients. Honestly, the first time I went to the pool I called for some one to show me where it was. In about 60 seconds or less, someone came to escort me to the pool. After I was escorted once, it wasn't that much of a chore to find the pool the other days I used it. And what a beautiful pool with water at just the right temperature. An expected luxury in a big city hotel. 
But the main reason I am writing is to thank everyone who was kind enough to make my stay memorable. I have stayed in deluxe big city hotels for much of my life. There are some that offer this level of style and comfort. But none who offer this level of attention to detail and service. I must especially commend the staff who set up my laptop and made sure I was able to work comfortably and the concierge who arranged my dining program. But everyone was so eager to please. Please accept my compliments on providing the best of the best for a big city hotel.",5,2018,11,11
200,Dublin Stay,Superior experience. Excellent location near shopping and tourist destinations. Still feels quite and secluded even though located near the busiest areas of Dublin. There is a stop near the front of the hotel for the hop-on-hop-off bus which is very convenient. The staff made each one of our group feel special with the individual attention they provide. ,5,2018,11,11
200,This is a beautiful hotel,"I have not been to Dublin for over 10 years and this was my first stay at The Merrion. Very understated from the outside, but beautifully opulent inside.  Excellent front of house, complimentary chocolates and water in the room and a fantastic pool in the spa. Wished I had stayed for a second night.",5,2018,11,09
200,The Merrion delivers again!,"Thanks again to the staff at the Merrion for another wonderful visit to Dublin.  As usual, everyone made us feel special and pampered from Afternoon Tea in the Drawing Rooms to late night cocktails at No. 23.  We came to see U2 for my wife's upcoming 50th birthday, but she chose this trip more so for getting to stay at the Merrion.  See you again soon!  Richard L., Houston, TX",5,2018,11,09
200,Fabulous Hotel,"Had a wonderful overnight stay at the Merrion on Saturday 27th October.  Myself and two friends were in Dublin for a concert and we are so happy we booked the Merrion for our stay.  The room was absolutely fabulous. Fantastic breakfast, wonderful staff.",4,2018,11,09
200,Oasis in Dublin,"We unexpectedly booked a weekend a the Merrion during the Dublin Marathon. Despite being in the heart of the start/finish area, you wouldn't have know it once you were inside the hotel. The location is incredibly convenient and we walked to most of the place we wished to visit. The Cellar Bar went above and beyond making us delicious Gluten Free Fish and Chips! And Room 23 welcomed us late night for dessert and cocktails after a night on the town. Staff is lovely and rooms offer the right amount of luxury. We would definitely stay again! ",5,2018,11,08
200,the last bastion of old world quality,"I have stayed before and was impressed with the overall quality of this hotel, but this trip two things were different - I became ill just as I arrived, and I was with my in laws. It speaks to the versatile quality of the hotel that I was not uncomfortable despite the formal setting. I enjoyed a cozy sit by the fire and experienced room service when I truly did not feel well and needed tea service in bed. Furthermore, I was extremely thankful for the attentiveness and ease of checking out and getting our car in such a situation. A sad use for such a lovely bath, but it certainly was calming and helped me to feel better.",5,2018,11,07
200,"Relaxing stay, wonderful staff.","This was our second stay in The Merrion and we were not disappointed. Very comfortable room, fantastic breakfast, wonderful staff. Location is perfect for seeing main city attractions. We will definitely return.",5,2018,11,07
200,Faultless as always,"My husband and I treat ourselves each year when possible to a 2 night stay at The Merrion.  It is by far our favourite hotel in Ireland.  The hotel itself is so warm and welcoming and the staff so professional. It was our first experience of the main restaurant in its new location and we loved it.  The couryard areas is a huge bonus - a peaceful and  blissful area in the heart of the city.
I always leaveThe Merrion looking forward to our next visit.",5,2018,11,05
200,"Stayed at the Merrion every time with been to Dublin, and we've been a lot.","This is the place to stay in Dublin, staff is outstanding, facilities are gorgeous.  Convenient to cultural and tourist areas, Dinner at Patrick Guibaud is a must experience to savor!!!  This is the place you want to call home while in Dublin.",5,2018,11,02
200,Works class stay,"We stayed her just before Halloween and had an amazing time. All the staff we encountered were friendly and extremely helpful. We used the pool which was great. We mainly ate at the Garden Room, the food and staff were great. The cleanliness of the room and the hotel in general again were faultless",5,2018,11,01
200,"Fabulous hotel, food and staff!","My daughter and I had a short stop over at The Merrion before a large family gathering in Dublin.  Our room, didn't have a view but the room was so beautifully appointed that it really didn't matter.  We ate in the Garden Room, and the food was extremely good.  The Cellar Bar is a great facility for the hotel, it's very stylish and serves great cocktails! The staff are highly professional, and make all the guests feel special.  Not cheap to stay here, but definitely worth it.  We will be back!",5,2018,10,31
200,Truly First Class,"An exceptional first class experience in the center of Dublin.  Best service of any hotel I have ever used in the world.  Ths attention to detail is incredible.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  The location is perfect and close to amazing parks, pubs, museums and shopping.",5,2018,10,30
200,Lovely hotel with a few problems,"We had a very nice time at this hotel but there were a few flaws. The flaws wouldn't be notable except that it is such a nice (and not inexpensive) hotel. We arrived on a Saturday after a very long flight and walked in about an hour before check-in time. Our room wasn't ready, which was disappointing but understandable. The front desk told us to have a drink in the bar and come back at 3 to check in. We had massages booked at the spa at 4 so I really wanted to check in and settle in a little before that. Unfortunately at 3 our room still wasn't ready and they said it would be another hour (shouldn't they prioritize getting rooms ready for guests who are waiting in the lobby, jet-lagged and with nowhere to go?). The lovely woman at the front desk said she'd comp our next drink. They should have comped the drinks we'd just finished because I didn't want any more alcohol after just having finished a glass of wine during our first waiting period (they did comp the sparkling water I ordered when we were told we'd be waiting again). The room was just lovely when we got there and very clean and comfortable. My only other complaint is something I still find very odd. We sent a few postcards home and bought postcard stamps. We asked the hotel if they could put them in the mail for us and they charged 1.30 euros for each one! I looked at the postcards my parents received to see if the hotel had applied extra postage but nope - the 1.30 charge was just for depositing our mail in the post. It's such a small thing (and such a tiny percentage of the overall bill) but an unfortunate way to end our stay.",4,2018,10,29
200,Our stay at The Merrion.,"The Merrion Hotel is lovely and the staff are professional, friendly and helpful.  If we visit Dublin in the future, we would definitely consider staying at The Merrion Hotel.  The Vault Bar had wonderful entertainment.",4,2018,10,29
200,Excellence,"My wife and i stayed here for 2 nights on recent visit to Dublin.  5 Star Plus hotel from the moment you arrive.  Staff, rooms, service, decor, food excellent.  For sure this is the top place to say in Dublin.  Planning a return visit.",5,2018,10,28
200,A class act,"We stayed at The Merrion for a family gathering, also at the hotel, and from start to finish it was a fantastic experience.

The rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet, and the staff are very attentive and friendly. It feels like a happy place.

There are lots of public spaces including the relaxed Cellar Bar and, my favourite, Number 23 cocktail bar where the bar staff have a great rapport with the customers.

Yes, it’s an expensive hotel but worth every penny for the experience.",5,2018,10,23
200,"The Merrion excellent in all aspects..,","I have been using the Merrion Hotel for many years for many of our VIP’s and the hotel never fails to disappoint, the new breakfast area is excellent lots of light and located in the garden area. The location of the hotel could not be better placed for central Dublin, the General Manager has all the stafff on board looking after the guests with a smile on their face . And as an extra the Art collection in the Hotel is of the Radar, enjoy.",5,2018,10,23
200,Mixed experience,"Unimpressive administration: Arrived at 3.30 and had to wait an hour for room to be ready   - though unlike other reviewers we did get a free cup of tea. Was phoned by a panicking waiter who thought we had done a runner after the Art Tea to request payment, even though I had booked it through reception and it was added to my bill. On check out an extra 48 Euros had been added to the bill for breakfast (which was already included in the room cost). The plug and charging cable I accidentally left in the room could not be found. 
Odd arrangements: Tea towels placed on the floor beside the bed and on the surfaces in the bathroom served no purpose other than to increase the amount of laundry, but on the other hand only one large bath towel was provided. The entrance lobby area is austere and unwelcoming and the potted trees either side of the narrow front door get in the way of people going up and down the steps. The reception desk was not very well organised and signage to pool and gym not very clear. The cooked breakfast  arrived way too soon as we had only just started the cereals so it got cold in the meantime. This seemed to be happening to other tables too.
On the plus side the rooms are well equipped, quiet and really dark so it was one of the best nights sleep I've ever had in a hotel. The garden area is lovely and the Art tea was great. But considering the Merrion is so expensive and so highly rated, overall I was pretty  disappointed.",3,2018,10,22
200,Our trip to Ireland.,First of all the cost is 30 euros from the airport to the hotel. The lobby is very small and the furniture is old and uncomfortable. We arrived early and our room was not ready. We ordered a coffee assuming it was complimentary but oh no it cost 7 euros. The hotel is way overpriced but the location is great and the pub around the corner was a lot of fun. Our room was nice but at the price we expected better then nice. Breakfast was included and it was adequate. ,4,2018,10,22
200,"Merrion Hotel, Dublin","Stayed 4 nights at the hotel while on my recent trip to Ireland.The stay was excellent as usual while the location in central Dublin is very convenient for meetings, restaurants and pubs.I will be back at the Merrion on my next trip home in 2019.",5,2018,10,22
200,Wow! Dublin and Merrion a must see,"When we went to Dublin we didn’t know what to expect having never been here. The hotel was beyond what we expected.  The rooms the staff and the food were amazing.  From breakfast to afternoon tea was simply heavenly. If you can stay at Merrion do it. It won’t disappoint 
",5,2018,10,20
200,Great for all ages,"I’m a teenager (just about to be fourteen) and came here with my parents. Normally, you’d probably expect me to complain about that, but the staff at this hotel made me feel like someone who was supposed to be there instead of some little inconvenience. I had a deluxe king bedroom for myself (room 281) tucked away on the second floor. Thankfully, it was through two doors and by the stairwell, so it was extra quiet. Even though my view was looking at the back of some houses, the room was great. The bed was comfy, chairs were bouncy, and the maids somehow managed to turn my teenaged mess into a room fit for when your mother says you have guests coming over. And speaking of the workers, I recieved (not sure why, still thankful) a complimentary fruit basket upon check-in and two of their whole made chocolate bars a couple of days later as a gift from a Peter Mac Cann (thanks dude). 

I didn’t eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel, but I did get room service one night (a 8oz Irish sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus) and found it to be quite delicious. It arrived in about fifteen minutes and was cooked exactly as I would like it, so cheers for that. 
 
In conclusion, stay here. If some bratty little kid can enjoy staying in this hotel while taking a visit to her ancestral homeland, you can too.",5,2018,10,19
200,Best city hotel I've ever stayed in - it's almost PERFECT,"The Merrion Hotel is the loveliest, exquisite hotel with the most unassuming exterior.  In fact, my guess is that many tourists would walk right past it, not even realising it's a hotel.  It's located on the other side of the Government Buildigns where the Taoiseach works, at the Stephen's Square end of the road.  In other words, a fantastic location in the centre of Dublin. 

The rooms are beautifully furnished, in a classic yet contemporary feel. Needless to say the place is spotless and kitted out with top quality products.  The staff are attentive, helpful and efficient. 

There is an afternoon high tea on offer which I'd highly recommend - the drawing room (as well as all other rooms) have such a wonderful atmosphere.  
My only complaint it that the breakfast is not included in the stay - with an establishment such as this it feels a bit petty and cynical to add breakfast to the bill, as if they are a Holiday Inn.",5,2018,10,18
200,Ireland at last,My husband and I recently visited Dublin and stayed at the Merrion. We Loved the Merrion. The Staff was superior. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We Loved it and would stay again.  The bellmen were especially helpful and friendly. ,5,2018,10,17
200,Five stars is not enough!,"My partner and I are textile nerds and designers. This trip was an ambitious driving tour into Northern Ireland and the Republic to see four mills in three days. Nothing could prepare us for the harrowing driving under tight timelines. When we finally arrived at the Merrion, we had terrible flus (thanks Giants Causeway), and gratefully handed the car keys to the Merrion Valet.

On arrival I was happy to learn that our room had been upgraded. Room 303 is fantastic- super king size bed with two large double windows looking onto the courtyard garden. As we went from ill health to worse, this room became our sanctuary. Never saw a stitch of Dublin. So believe me when I say the restaurants in this hotel are terrific. Service is excellent. Great room service menu, fast delivery. Supreme bed and bath linens. Our bathroom had a shower and separate marble bathtub. Cellar bar is intimate with a good menu. This is a hotel for adults who need a quiet rest in sophisticated surroundings.",5,2018,10,16
200,Dublin vacation,"We only stay at the Merrion! So attentive to every detail. We have stayed here 4 times before and each time it keeps getting better. Love the Cellar Bar, Library for tea and the spa. great location and short walk to everywhere. ",5,2018,10,16
200,Classic Designer Luxury Hotel - Similar to a Soho House.,I visited for afternoon tea and LOVED it. The Merrion is one of the most beautiful hotels in Dublin City Centre with a really classic designer luxury feel. It felt like one of The Soho House members properties – that luxurious but without the stuffyness. The staff were all super friendly and welcoming. It was wet and we were made to feel so warm and welcome. The tea’s and cakes were all home baked and totally delicious. I cant wait to come back.,5,2018,10,16
200,Great hotel with very comfortable mattresses and quiet rooms,"Great hotel with very comfortable mattresses and quiet rooms, ideal for sleeping well. Fantastic breakfast.  Centrally located.  Excellent service and great welcoming by Paula and Ramona at the reception!",5,2018,10,15
200,Elegant and Charming,"Yes The Merrion is my favourite hotel in Dublin.
Elegant and refined but not stuffy, amenities excellent and staff right on the money!
Love it - hopefully will be back before long!
Thank you everyone for making our stay so memorable.",5,2018,10,15
200,Business mid week stay," Such a luxurious hotel with exceptionally helpful staff and excellent service. We were upgraded to a suite which was lovely, had fresh flowers, chocolates and water left as a welcome gift.  Slippers padded and very comfortable, bed blissfully comfortable, bed linen of highest quality and room spotless with tea & coffee available plus very well stocked minibar. Gorgeous dressing gowns too.",5,2018,10,14
200,Fantastic Hotel,"The Merrion is a fantastic hotel, with elegance and style. The service pays close attention to every single little detail. Think about small things, such as, a lovely welcome letter or your newspaper, The location of the hotel is very central, the rooms are beautiful, and spending time in the bar, or for tea is a fantastic experience. Whatever you do, the service is top-notch, and every question gets immediately answered. Enjoy the beautiful garden to relax and recharge.",5,2018,10,14
200,An experience fit for royality!,We stayed at the Merrion for our 47th anniversary. Everything about the stay was outstanding. The artwork was exceptional and not something that you usually find in a hotel.The drawing room with the evening harp music was very relaxing. Afternoon tea is a must. The rooms were very nicely decorated an were spotlessly clean. Can't wait to go back.  ,5,2018,10,13
200,Simply marvellous,"We spent two nights at start of our Ireland vacation and this set the bar high for all hotels to follow. We were glad to have been given two inter-connecting rooms. Each room is spacious, nicely furnished and comfortable.

This hotel is conveniently situated in city centre (and all that's offered at St. Stephen's Green), within short walking distance but away from the noise and traffic.

After a day of activity it was wonderful to return to The Merrion's room with premium bedding for a sound and restful sleep. Plenty of drinking water supplied and not in plastic bottles but classy glass bottles.

Other nice touches: daily turndown service; Nespresso; kettle; lovely swimming pool/gym area, with fruit bowl and tea; apple bowls in hallway; heated towel racks; huge bathrooms; great vanity accessories (good quality). Appreciate their eco-conscious, green effort. An example of their level housekeeping one does not often see even in same-class hotels: the h/keeping staff who serviced our rooms noticed our electronic device cords on the desks and wrapped all loose cables with the hotel's branded velcro ties, then placed neatly on desk for us.

We recommend this hotel to travellers who will enjoy this hotel as thousands of others did.",5,2018,10,13
200,Good but not Great,"I have to say that our stays at the Merrion in August left us more conflicted than this sort of hotel should. There is no doubt the Merrion is a gorgeous hotel. The rooms (we had two, about a week apart) were beautiful, well appointed and spacious. The people were very friendly. The food was good, but not great. I may be biased there because I broke a tooth on a biscotti in one of their restaurants. In all fairness the accompanying ice cream was great. Our other food was good but it wasn’t exceptional. Food cost was in keeping with the caliber of hotel. We didn’t go to their flagship restaurant, so we can’t comment on that. The location, a block or so from St. Stephen’s square, was great. We walked to most of what we wanted to see and do on Dublin.

Broken tooth aside, there were other missed opportunities. We had problems with the safe in the first room and were given a safe deposit box to use. When we checked out, the staff there tried to charge us for it and then didn’t seem to know how to get our stuff out of it. Fortunately there was a manager standing nearby who saw the confusion and stepped in. Our quick early bite (a feature for people who can’t wait for the breakfast room to open) in the drawing room was anything but quick and way too expensive for what we had (toast). Our second room, a Garden room, was nice and fully functional this time. Unfortunately it overlooked an alley, not a garden. You had to walk through a garden to get there though so I guess that is how it qualifies. Service in the restaurants was good, but not overly attentive.

In conclusion, I probably wouldn’t go back to stay. After leaving the Merrion the second time we went to London and stayed at top rated hotel there. Merrion didn’t compare, except in cost.

200,Dublin Delight,"Location, Location,Location!  Several townhomes were converted into a very lovely old world hotel.The staff is very friendly & welcoming & has a doorman. We had superior rooms which were very nice.  Loved the small intimate bar & the breakfast room is very bright & airy",5,2018,10,11
200,4 th visit,Had a 5 day trip with my kids to Dublin and stayed here again. The hotel manages to stay relaxed despite offering fantastic service and amenities. It’s definitely our “ go to” in Dublin. Can’t wait to go back.,5,2018,10,10
200,Everyone in Ireland said the hotel is the best;  they were right!,"From the welcoming doorman who recieved our luggage, through the welcoming and readily available staff to check us in, the Merrion was on point right from the start. The oversized room with a huge bathroom had all amenities possible and were in good shape and quiet.  Our only regret is we only booked one night.  We'll be back if we travel to Dublin again. ",5,2018,10,08
200,A Class Act,"The Merrion is a cut above in every possible way. The staff were professional and ready to help with any request. The accommodations were lovely, and we were within walking distance of sights we wanted to tour and also of fine places to dine. The breakfasts were delicious, and it's difficult to imagine a nicer hotel experience than we had at The Merrion. We strongly recommend it to fellow travelers.",5,2018,10,08
200,sensational: the best in Ireland and many other places,"the merrion sits around a quadrangle with a wonderful garden in the middle. The rooms are large, the dec0or is restrained and the art collection is serious. But its the service that stes this hotel apart.It's seamless not matter why time of day or night or how weird the request. It costs but so does perfection of any sort",5,2018,10,08
200,Absolutely Incredible Stay,"The Merrion is hands down the best hotel we’ve ever visited. We’ve stayed at other 5-star properties and nothing compares to the Merrion. The entire staff is wonderful - they are not only accommodating and nice but they all go above and beyond for their guests. It goes beyond even attention to detail, every potential need is anticipated and it is a truly wonderful experience. The rooms and property are immaculately maintained and absolutely beautiful. Our stay was wonderful and it is the only place we will stay now when in Dublin.",5,2018,10,07
200,Classic Elegance,"The Merrion was the perfect hotel for a quick two-night stay for our first visit to Dublin. The “townhouse” configuration gives the feel that you are visiting a private, elegant home that hits the right note of elegance but not stuffiness.  When our room was not quite ready at check-in time, the manager picked up our lunch check. The service was warm, friendly and professional.  After we slept a little too late the second day, they rushed our room service breakfast with a smile so we could meet our tour in time. The bed/linens/pillows were heavenly... The location was central but quiet. Highly recommend!",5,2018,10,06
200,A stay at the Merrion is a treat everyone deserves,"I stayed at the Merrion with 2 friends and baby. It was incredible from start to finish. The staff at the Merrion are exceptional; warm, inviting and professional. There was no ask too big or too small. Our room had lovely touches including a mini robe for the baby.
We enjoyed drinks in the drawing room & room service. Breakfast in the garden room was the perfect start to the day. 
The Merrion was perfect for us, an amazing setting for spending time with friends and close to the shops. We can’t wait to go back.",5,2018,10,06
200,Super 5* Hotel,"we stayed here for 3 nights and had 2 rooms.
the location is great and very close to all the interesting places.
the service was super.
the breakfast was very nice and we are waiting for the next time.",5,2018,10,06
200,Lovely - after a rough start,"We are return guests to this establishment, which is fairly centrally located, near Merrion Park, and a few minutes from Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street. Upon a recent late arrival we were shown to a room that was both cramped and lacked anything close to a view. We immediately registered a complaint with the caliber of comfort being offered and were told that something would be sorted out in the morning. By the next morning the manager on duty was clearly aware of our particular situation, sat and talked with us, and agreed to make the necessary changed in order to accommodate our expectations and previous experiences. Though jarring to start - our stay was made comfortable, memorable in a pleasent way, and lived up to the hopes of a return visit in the near future.",4,2018,10,06
200,Top notch!!,"Love the Merrion!  Location, staff, services, quality of room top notch.  Gardens are pristine and lovely.  Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all the hotel has to offer. And nothing compares to their scones!!  and highly recommend the tea service.",5,2018,10,05
200,Highly recommend,"I can't say enough about our stay at the Merrion.  It is a beautiful, old-world hotel, with great service, friendly, helpful staff.  We loved the cellar wine bar and the spa.  The locations was also perfect.",5,2018,10,05
200,Top notch Service!,My stay at the Merrion was perfect from start to finish. They checked us in early on arrival which set a wonderful tone for our trip. The room and hotel were lovely. The service at breakfast was outstanding. You truly feel pampered by the staff. ,5,2018,10,04
200,Lovely experience,Just had a business meeting in the hotel and the atmosphere was fantastic.  Asked for a cup of mint tea and I got lovely treats as well. 5* indeed.  Waiters were very polite and helpful as well. Well deserved!,5,2018,10,03
200,No Graden View in Garden Wing,The Merrion is know for hosting dignitaries and celeb's but our experience lacked the 5 star service you would expect when paying 4 figures for a suite. We specifically booked a suite in the Garden Wing. Unfortunately when we got to the room we opened the curtains and saw an alley with graffiti on old building walls. The room itself was very nice but still...we were on a tight tour schedule so we dashed out. We came back to shower before dinner and when I asked about moving was told the hotel was completely sold out. We rolled with it until the knock knock knock woke my husband up (he snores and was sleeping on another bed in the living room). He could time the knock every 12 seconds. The same noise woke me at about 6am. Pretty sure it was the plumbing because the sink let out a load whistle when turning the hot water on. We were only staying one more night but had an early flight back to the states the next morning. I called the front desk - the noise was unacceptable - hey told me they could move us later in the day. I was ok with that. When we come back form our day tour our things were moved to our new suite with garden view and high floor. When I inquired about any compensation for the sleepless previous night they looked at me like I was nuts. My travel agent is still arguing with them. I'm a pretty seasoned traveler and in a hotel of this caliber I am stunned at the lack of concern with a guest that had such an unpleasant experience. We stayed at 2 other properties in Ireland - both were amazing. Too bad I can't recommend the Merrion to anyone - at any price. ,2,2018,10,03
200,Wonderful visit ,"Although our two day stay was shortened to a single day, visiting the merrion eased the disappointment.  Everyone at the merrion makes you feel welcome.  Attention to every detail and rooms second to none.  
The hotel exceeds all expectations",5,2018,10,03
200,Another Great Stay,"Had another great stay at the Merrion.  The staff, the hotel itself and the Cellar Bar were great. The Concierge team did a great job in helping with logistics and had great sightseeing and restaurant tips.",5,2018,10,03
200,"Great Hotel in Dublin, excellent location","Wonderful hotel in excellent location in Dublin.  It is within walking distance of all the major tourist sites- Trinity College, art and archeological museum. St. Patricks cathedral, O'Connell Street.  From the time you walk in the door until you check out you are treated with kid gloves.  Just an example, when we returned from touring, our ice bucket was filled and they put Velcro ties around the cords for our electronics.  Not to mention delicious chocolates and free water.  We ate in the regular restaurant, food was delicious. Would return in a second.  Recommend highly.",5,2018,10,03
200,Merrion shines,Wonderful hotel in every category. Location is perfect it sightseeing. The staff are all so helpful and seem to truly enjoyed their jobs. The physical plant is lovely and very well maintained. Even the housekeepers are pleasant and helpful.,5,2018,10,03
200,Classy Hotel with a twist!,"A townhouse style city hotel with hallways filled with original artwork! We took the catalog from the room to conduct our own tour. Breakfast was lovely, delicious and the service was excellent. Good location for a walking tour of Dublin and close to shopping on Grafton street. Would definitely consider a return visit when in Dublin.",4,2018,10,02
200,Lovely stay in Central Dublie,"This hotel was absolutely lovely.  The original old hotel is stately as you would expect.   The guest rooms had beautiful linens and toiletries.  The rooms itself was pretty typical - nothing spectacular.  The bar made some delicious cocktails.  Friendly discrete service.
",4,2018,10,02
200,Super magical hotel,"Beautiful artwork, incredible staff, sheer comfort in our room and great selection of restaurants. Ideal location for a weekend in Dublin. Great doormen who go to the limits to look after you. Overall superb",5,2018,10,02
200,One of the best hotels in the world.,"From beginning to end this was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had in the world. The check in was effortless, friendly, and informative. The hotel itself is such a wonderfully beautiful building in a perfect location of Dublin. I enjoyed an incredible massage in the spa. Fun evening entertainment of Irish music in the Cellar Bar over drinks, then incredible food for a night in of room service after a long day. I had a King room facing the garden--with an exceptional view of the grounds. I would not hesitate to pick this spot over any other in Dublin. ",5,2018,10,02
200,A 5-rating does nor give this hotel juistice.,"The attention to guest desires and requests FAR EXCEEDED any possible idea of the guest. As the fsather, I had the wife and four grown daughters (yes, definitely outnumbered), yet not one person had a complaint of less-than Perfect opinion of the Staff. We have no idea how the hotel recruited or trained such wonderful Staff. (After more then 4-1/2 million business air miles, this is one hotel that stood out after 30+ years of travel !) God smiled when he gave this hotel the Staff and their attention to the guest !",5,2018,09,30
200,This is 5 star hotel!,"We have stayed in many luxury hotels in the US Canada and Europe and this is by far the best.  From the helpful front door staff, to the wonderful cellar bar we will certainly return here when we come back to Dublin.  The amenities in the room, the wonderful way they keep your room made and ready (it must be elves in the closer because the turnaround is lightening quick and you never see them!) make this a true luxury hotel.  And breakfast is well worth the trip alone!",5,2018,09,30
200,Dublin Visit,"We spent 3 days in Dublin and stayed at the Merrion Hotel. It was an absolute delight and a superb facility, well done all. Will be back to visit again in the future at some point im sure. We especially liked the cellar restaurant which was outstanding quality food and drinks. ",5,2018,09,30
200,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,Great location ... very good staff and service. The garden cafe is really nice and the food is great. A bit pricey but worth it for the easy walking access to everything in Dublin. The staff is extremely helpful and the room was really nice (we had a superior executive room).,5,2018,09,27
200,Gorgeous Hotel in awesome location,This hotel has a wonderful location near great pubs and shopping.  They have a fantastic pub in the basement which we spent time eating and drinking.  The restaurant in the lobby had a delicious pasta with crab that I would love the recipe for.  Every employee went out of their way to make sure we were having a great time.  We will definitely go back.,5,2018,09,26
200,Superb,"We stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights based on TripAdvisor reviews and are very glad we did. It's probably one of the finest hotels we've stayed at, from the helpfulness and friendly demeanor of the staff to the facilities. The building and grounds are beautifully maintained, as are the very comfortable rooms. Highly recommend.",5,2018,09,26
200,Service is on par with the best,Always an excellent experience when we stay here . The service levels are so high. Really recommend the breakfast especially the freshly prepared smoothies. The staff were so helpful from the minute we arrived to the minute we left,5,2018,09,25
200,Always excellent,"One of the two best hotels in Ireland 
Standards high in every aspect from concierge to reception to rooms to the cellar bar. Great location and leaving gives you a longing to return. Very comfortable, spacious rooms with quality linen. 
Compact leisure Centre and pool very comfortable too. 👍",5,2018,09,23
200,Fantastic!!,"More than accomodating!! Simply beautiful, service beyond your wildest dreams! Extremely polite staff, excellent food., right downtown,close to everything. Personnally couldn't ask or expect anything better.",5,2018,09,23
200,Arty afternoon tea,Afternoon tea was set in beautiful surroundings with the fire lighting and very comfortable seating. Obviously the food was beautiful and catered for all allergies etc and the service was wonderful. I'd highly recommend it for a celebration.,5,2018,09,23
200,Excellence in Dublin,We loved everything about the Merrion from the outstanding staff to the lovely and incredibly comfortable rooms. The bedding is fabulous and we slept very well. We appreciated the great welcome and the way staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. ,5,2018,09,22
200,Afternoon tea is fab!,"I went here today with 5 family members for afternoon tea. The staff were friendly and attentive and made us feel very welcome and looked after. We had vegetarians, coeliacs a d pregnant ladies in our group and they were catered for without a problem. All of the food was so fresh and delicious. Definitely worth a visit.",5,2018,09,22
200,"Super expensive, all hype, and dirty","I came to check in at night, and the room I was in had no sound proofing to the outdoors. I could hear the shouting happening outside the hotel where there were people rummaging through the trash. It also did not help that the backside of the bed had bugs that I had to clean up. The gym also was a mess when I got there at night and it closed quite early at 9:30pm. I also could not go to sleep because there was noise outside and no sound proofing and the bedside had some dust and bugs. ",1,2018,09,21
200,You get all my Stars,"From the Bell Service at check-in to the Bell Service at departure we could not have been happier. Clean, very clean, maid staff really doing their job. Dining met all expectations, Patrick Guilbaud fully qualifies as the best in fine dining.",5,2018,09,21
200,Attention to Detail,"If you care about details then the Merrion is the place to stay. Staff and Location are the best.   The beauty of the Merrion is the size , location and staff. The attention to details will surprise you and make your stay very special.",5,2018,09,21
200,Fabulous stay and perfect location,"Fabulous hotel with excellent service. We were traveling with 3 other couples. Service was wonderful, beds were very comfortable, and the location was perfect. I would definitely stay here again if I were to revisit Dublin.",5,2018,09,21
200,Superb,"We stayed here coming into and leaving Dublin and I couldn’t recommend it more. The rooms and amenities are wonderful and the staff as warm and friendly as is possible. The breakfasts are delicious. Best eggs and salmon ever. However, don’t eat there for dinner curiously it was terrible. Go to Etto around the corner.",5,2018,09,19
200,Grace and Elegance in the Heart of Dublin,"We arrived at the Merrion at the end of our 17 day trip around Ireland.  It was fabulous.  I have traveled the world staying in lovely places, and this is one of my all-time favorite hotels.  

The period Georgian exterior is a study in understatement, which is how I like it.  Once inside, though, you are clearly in a 5-star hotel.  We were greeted with warmth by the bellman and front desk staff, who checked us in speedily.  The service is impeccable -- every single staff member was efficient, friendly and extraordinarily helpful.  The large traditionally decorated room was sumptuous, the linens crisp, the towels fluffy, the robes top-notch, the slippers thick and comforting.  The bathroom was elegant and supremely functional.  The maid even tidies up your electronic charging cords with little ""Merrion"" velcro ties. Everything was spotless.

The breakfasts were  superbly cooked and delivered, and the dinner we had in the bar could not have been more delicious.  The drinks were the best.  And the location in the heart of Dublin makes sightseeing easy.  Walk out your door and a couple of blocks away is St Stephen's Green.  Parliament is across the street.  The National Gallery and National Museum are around the corner.  And the staff at the Merrion will give you all the information you need to find them.

Honestly, it's difficult to imagine a better hotel, anywhere.  I look forward to our return trip.",5,2018,09,18
200,Top-Notch,"We spent two nights at the Merrion, before heading home from an epic Ireland adventure.  Everything about it is great.... the location, bed and linen quality, reception.   I would definitely stay at the Merrion again in the future!",5,2018,09,18
200,My favourite Hotel!,"The Merrion Hotel is a jewel, tucked away by Merrion Square, and a stone's throw from St Stephen's Green. The staff are amazing, remembering everyone by name and always so helpful. The rooms are beautiful, so cosy and well presented. Afternoon tea is just the best, would highly recommend (especially at Christmas time). Would recommend this hotel to everyone for a magical stay in Dublin.",5,2018,09,18
200,"Perfect, just perfect","What a lovely, lovely hotel in the middle of this fabulous city.  The staff, service, location, gorgeous room, and everything else exceeded our expectations.  Clearly a 5 star experience in all respects.  Many hotels strive to meet this level and many fall a bit short.  The Merrion sets a very high benchmark - what a great job they all do.",5,2018,09,17
200,Definitely what I expected,"We modified our Dublin reservations based on recommendations from a friend, and weren't disappointed.  Definitely a class act all around, be it the staff, the location (on a quiet street, but easily accessible, and within walking distance of lots of things.  Whether breakfast, drinks, or dinner (at Patrick Guilbaud) it was a relaxing way to end a three-week trip.",5,2018,09,17
200,Merrion Hotel Dublin,The Merrion Hotel is one of the most luxurious hotels I have stayed at.  It was deserving of its 5 star status.  The rooms were clean and well appointed and the bathrooms were fabulous. The room was very clean and chocolates on arrival were a nice touch. ,5,2018,09,17
200,Lovely hotel ,Good hotel lovely staff and accommodation would definitely go back again it was lovely recommend anyone to stay here beer and craic couldn’t ask for much more.. very welcoming hotel staff are amazing.. breakfast was my favorite ,4,2018,09,15
200,Luxury within a stroll from the city,Excellent luxury venue. Everything as expected from a hotel of this standard. Friendly staff in a pristine setting. A real treat. Afternoon tea is an experience highlighting the art in the hotel. Lovely inner courtyard to relax in and delicious food.,5,2018,09,13
200,"Exceptional hotel, restaurants & staff! ","The Merrion Hotel is ranked in the top 100 hotels for a reason. The hotel staff is exceptionally friendly, just like all of the Irish. The pool and spa area is lovely. They also have a range of bar options from the cellar bar in the basement, bar 23 that is lovely for a late night drink and open 24 hours a day for hotel guests. The courtyard is a wonderful place to have afternoon tea or a cocktail before dinner and has a lovely atmosphere and drink selection. Fresh flower arrangements are scattered around the hotel to add to the beautiful decor of the hotel. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant had a variety of hot selections made to order and a buffet of homemade croissants, and anything else you could want. They have gluten free options as well which is a plus. The hotel has a great view of Parliament and is a short walk to great restaurants and Grafton street so you can walk around and explore the streets of Dublin versus taking a taxi. My 9 month old niece stayed and they provided a crib, robe, slippers, and baby shampoo and wash making her stay just as delightful as the rest of the family! ",5,2018,09,13
200,The Hotel You will measure others against,"The Merrion Hotel has the finest staff in Ireland. It is an extraordinary experience to stay here.
The Cellar Bar is cozy, inviting with a delicious menu, and the Garden restaurant is exquisite. 23 is open around the clock and so relaxing.
The extensive art collection on display is rivaled by no place.
From the dignity and gallantry of the doorman to the care that is taken at turn down, no opportunity is wasted to make you feel pampered and comfortable. As one would expect in a 5 Star environment the cleanliness is above reproach and not a visible scratch to paint or woodwork is seen. The staff truly appear to enjoy their work, how else could they be so superb at it? They stand above all.
They take great care to address ever detail. Every other hotel is a disappointment after staying at The Merrion.",5,2018,09,12
200,Just Magnificent,"Hello Fellow Travelers
This is an amazing place to stay in Dublin the city, of course it will cost you a few Euros but we all know that , We stayed in a suite while we visited my Father who was an olympic runner for Ireland in the late 40's before emigrating to the USA for college i'll tie all this 
info up with another review of two more great places to stay.
 For my brother and i it was our first visit to Ireland so we decided to go first class and if that's what you're looking for this is the place.
The service is outstanding our suite was just fantastic
the staff couldn't do enough for you and the food my goodness 
you don't want to eat anywhere else but you must , you just walk out the door and you are with in walking distance of the heart of dublin",5,2018,09,11
200,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed for a couple of nights this weekend. As it was very pricey we booked a garden room which was a little more affordable. I was delighted by the room: it’s size, comfort and cleanliness. The attentiveness from the housekeeping staff was great - not that I met them - but they seemed to know whenever we’d gone out and they’d be in cleaning it or doing a turn down service - maybe standard in hotels but there was just that little bit more they did to ensure it was tidy and spotless.  
We didn’t eat in the hotel but we spoke to a manager in the Garden Room and he was extremely courteous and helpful. The cellar bar was also very nice - fabulous brickwork. If I criticised anything, I’d say some of the bar staff were slightly inattentive but they were busy.
The doormen and concierge staff were also top notch.

A very good stay, at a great hotel that seem to really get it right.",5,2018,09,10
200,Fabulous Hotel in heart of Dublin,"Stayed in a number of 5 star hotels, this hotel was superb.  The staff were terrific and the food at dinner in the Garden Room was fantastic. Recommend this hotel but it is pricey but worth the extra.  The front door staff were warm and extremely helpful",5,2018,09,09
200,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here for a single night, which was not long enough!  I need to return!  The service was outstanding.  I was traveling with two young children, and the hotel goes all out to welcome children and make their stay more comfortable (and easier on tired parents). 

The food in the restaurant in the basement was great - just what we all needed after a long day of travel.  The room was lovely.  I cannot wait to come back; I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2018,09,08
200,Great base for a Dublin stay,"Stayed there four nights with my wife.
Overall it is a great place. The location is about perfect - easy walking reach from most of the main city sights. The rooms are spacious and well designed. The front of the hotel (reception, bars etc.) looks more like a Georgian house than a hotel. The art collection is a nice touch. Restaurant (Garden Room) very good and the ""23"" bar a good place for a drink (either in the bar or, on a warm day, in the courtyard garden).
The only grouses are (1) the price of the breakfast - whilst you accept that a 5 star hotel will charge a bit more, the 29 Euro price is nearly three times what other places nearby were offering and (2) the front desk service is not great. When we checked in our room was not ready at 3pm and it took quite a while for them to find us a room (to be fair they gave us a free drink in the bar while we waited) and once they found us a room it took for ever for our luggage to be delivered. Similarly we dropped bags on the last morning and it took them a long time to retrieve them.  These are minor annoyances and I would stay there again on a holiday. But on a business trip where every minute mattered, I would hesitate about this place.",4,2018,09,07
200,Merrion Hotel is superb,Loved our 2 night stay at the Merrion.  We had a beautiful room overllooking the courtyard.  Bed was one of best ever.  Spacious bedroom with sitting area and bathroom.  Staff is superb.  High tea is a must there!  Outstanding service and amenities,5,2018,09,06
200,Heavenly,"A Boutique Hotel . Room service the best ever. Truly, a Michelin chef for in room dining. Ever Staff Member Professional, warm and earnest in what they do. The owner of this fine establishment needs a congratulation. 2nd time their in less than a year. Not inexpensive but worth every dollar. If your looking luxury but on a smaller scale with one on one guest relations, this is for you.",5,2018,09,06
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed at The Merrion Hotel several times over the years and consider it the best hotel in Dublin.  The new garden-facing dining room is a great addition.  As always, the staff, services, food and room were outstanding.",5,2018,09,05
200,One of the World's best!,Fabulous staff and wonderful facility! In the heart of Dublin's St. Stephen's Green area with great restaurants and incredible music and pubs.The Cellar Bar at the Merrion is a treasure and you feel very welcome.,5,2018,09,05
200,A Grand Hotel,Outstanding hotel with a warm welcome and the highest standards of service - down to meticulous small details that make your stay perfect!Everything went well for our three days in a junior suite. Look forward to returning soon,5,2018,09,05
200,Alison UK,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Staff and the surroundings were first class. Will definitely return. The room and the facilities were excellent ask the food in the cave bar in the basement,5,2018,09,03
200,Wonderful stay! Great service!,"We stayed here over November last year, and experienced the most wonderful and courteous service by all staff members.  The host at the restaurant was ever so gracious and actually went and got my baby daughter a teddy bear to play with during our meal.  Our room was beautifully decorated and contained all the amenities we expected from a luxury hotel.  

The location was in a classy part of Dublin, away from the craziness of Temple Bar area, yet it was all within walkable distance to explore. 

Highly recommend, and we can't wait to go back and stay here again during our next visit.",5,2018,09,03
200,"Lovely hotel, very posh and central",You can’t fault this hotel. My only observation is that other guests are slightly older than in the competitor hotels. Maybe not buzzy enough for millennials. Everything was top notch. The garden restaurant is worth a visit.,5,2018,09,02
200,Disappointing experience,"Arrived at ten to four pm, room not ready. Waited half an hour to be shown a ground floor room (read semi basement), small, opposite the lift, with a small window with net curtains, looking onto a flower bed, with people in the courtyard garden outside. Said we didn’ t Like the room, but of course the hotel was full so we had to wait another 15 minutes and were shown an even worse room of a lower grade looking onto a corrugated iron roof, a for sale sign, a bar, a car park and a couple of rooftops. We opted for the original room, despite it being on the dark side. For Euros 495 a night (breakfast not included) this was a rip off, despite the attractive decor. Very disappointing and not recommended, will try a different hotel next time.",1,2018,09,01
200,Beautifully classic hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion is perfection! The location is terrific, the hotel itself is immaculate and gorgeous, but the fabulous staff puts it all over the top. I cannot recommend this property highly enough! Our stay at the Merrion was the icing on the cake to our trip to Ireland! ",5,2018,09,01
200,A great European hotel,"Without a shaddow of doubt, the Merrion is by far my favourite Dublin hotel. It is situated in an elegant Georgean Street, conveniently close to most of the places in Central Dublin that you would wish to visit. The service is impeccable - the staff friendly and helpful. We had a junior suite on the first floor, which was luxurious and very comfortable. All the public areas are pleasant. The outside seating area where drinks and snacks are served is particularly to be recommended. Breakfast, which was excellent, is taken in the downstairs dining room. (My wife always rates a hotel by the quality of its breakfasts!) We also ate there one evening, followed by an Irish whiskey - ""Method and Madness"" - in the bar. I think it was called the 28 bar. This hotel, although definitely not cheap, is highly recommended.",5,2018,08,31
200,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"From start to finish, our stay at The Merrion was a delight. Great service from the moment we pulled up at the front door. Our room wasn't ready, but the receptionist made sure we were seated for lunch and came back with our room key shortly afterwards. The room was lovely too, overlooking the courtyard. Very comfortable bed and plenty of space to spread out on the sofas.",5,2018,08,29
200,Lovely break,"Stayed at the Merrion Hotel on the 12/07/18 until the 17/07/18 what an amazing place this is.the reception lady was the most welcoming we could have ever wished for as at the time my hubby was not very well.we had the family room on the third floor as it was very kwiet sorry about spelling, the food was first class and the staff were very helpful and friendly we have booked to stay there again soon and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a first class hotel to stay in Llandudno thank you to all the staff June Aspinall.",5,2018,08,29
200,Dublin Visit,The Merrion was fantastic as the accomodation is stunning and have plenty of areas to relax with the lounge and garden area. For this trip our ease in booking into the 2 Michelin star restaurant adjoining provided a great memory of our holiday. The concierge team was fantastic as we had to book taxis every morning to connect with tours. There is coffee and tea available before breakfast is available which was a godsend for those early morning tours and the offer to pack us some pastries for breakfast was amazing.,5,2018,08,29
200,The Lord Monk Suite!,"Perfect in every way. We had a glorious stay at the Merrion. Exquisite service, impeccable room, the finest linens, and delicious food made staying at the Merrion a world class experience. Go ahead and splurge on a suite!",5,2018,08,28
200,Incredible hotel!,"The hotel was amazing! The architectural details in this hotel are exquisite! Service was first class and I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel whenever you are in Dublin. 

The hotel is walking distance to many fine restaurants and shopping. This is clearly the crowned jewel of Dublin. The rooms are very nicely decorated, the beds are very comfortable and the food is outstanding!",5,2018,08,27
200,"  Beautiful","We just spent two nights there and it is wonderful. The outside of the hotel is quite plain - brick - but when you get inside it is very elegant. We had a room on the second floor overlooking
the courtyard so it is serene and pretty. The rooms are beautiful although the shower is a bit small, but there is also a large bathtub. The breakfast area is gorgeous as is the china. Don't miss the room 23 bar and the Cellar bar. 

It's location is great just a few minutes from Trinity College and the Temple Bar area.",5,2018,08,25
200,The Garden Room,"Myself and my friend enjoyed a very pleasant coffee and light breakfast in the Garden Room. Our host Kate was warm and welcoming on our arrival and departure. Our server Miranda was attentive and friendly. Overall, it was a lovely experience and one we will be very happy to repeat.",5,2018,08,23
200,The Merrion,This is an excellent hotel for very special occasions. I we look forward to our next stay with them as soon as we can afford it.Expect to be well dressed as if you are not you will standout.Love it!,5,2018,08,21
200,Incredible visit to the Merrion!,"This is our second visit to the Merrion.  Having worked at a Four Seasons Hotel for many years, I can honestly say the service at the Merrion is unbeatable.  From the moment of check in until departure they don’t skip a beat.  Understated elegance at its best!",5,2018,08,17
200,Spa and brunch,"As a travel and lifestyle vlogger and reviewer from Dubai I can really recgonice a good standard ☺ And Tethra Spa was just fantastic aspecially facial with therapiest Antonella 😍 amazing range of products and beautiful pool and facilities. Also enjoyed Bar 23 bruch, best ever salmon and selection of sweets and coffee .... beyond 5*  highly reccomend to all visiting Dublin",5,2018,08,16
200,Amazing staff,"We just finished our stay at the Merrion.  The rooms were perfect and the food was great. The staff was exceptional.  In particular, we left our passports in the safe and the concierge (Ciara) went over and beyond the call of duty to help us, and coordinated with DHL to get the passports to us at our next hotel - even hand delivered our passports to the DHL office in a different part of town.  What could have been a disaster went very smoothly and we can't thank them enough.",5,2018,08,16
200,Best hotel I have been in.,"5 star experience, over the moon with this hotel! The staff was incredible, the maid/turn down service was perfect.  The restaurants were fantastic and the history and art in the hotel were second to none! ",5,2018,08,14
200,Wonderful summer weekend at the Merrion in Dublin,"We spent a fantastic summer weekend at the Merrion in Dublin.  Room was beautiful (shower a little small), food was excellent, staff was outstanding and completely focused on satisfying the hotel guests.  Restaurant was spectacular.",5,2018,08,13
200,Superior,"Everything about this stay was excellent. The property is attractive and well located, the food and drinks were excellent.  What really sets it into the excellent range are the staff, who were wonderful - efficient, helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Every contact with staff was great.  Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,08,13
200,Our wedding at The Merrion,"We love the Merrion so it seemed like the natural venue for our wedding. We booked a family meal and two nights at the hotel. The staff are so professional and friendly, we checked into a superior room with a view of the garden. I got my hair and makeup done and we went to get married, upon our return we took photos throughout the hotel and then enjoyed a delicious meal in the Garden Room restaurant. We had a lovely party in the Cellar Bar followed by a great nights sleep.  We really enjoyed our wedding day and stay here and when we went back to the Garden Room for my husband's birthday they presented us with a delicious cake made by the kitchen.",5,2018,08,12
200,First time stay at this great Hotel,"We have stopped at several Hotels in the past in Dublin. I wish we had stayed before. This is truly a great Hotel, we loved the afternoon tea and the location. Rooms were great and the staff very helpful. We will return this year.",5,2018,08,11
200,Simply amazing!!,"This is quite possibly the nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed in!!! I travel for work and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, this one beats them all! The attention to detail by their staff is superior as if the customer service. ",5,2018,08,10
200,Delightful friendly and magnificent hotel,The Merrion continues to be one of the best hotels in the world.  With the new Garden room and terrace area - this summer it has been delightful to stay so many times and enjoy the hotel and the wonderful service and facilities.,5,2018,08,09
200,Just the best,"Lovely hotel with perfect, classic accommodation. I asked for a crib in our room for my baby, and hotel also provided a robe, kid slippers, and baby products for the bath. Cannot beat the service here.",5,2018,08,08
200,Great City Hotel,"The Merrion scores on every front.  The service, from the time you pull up to the curb, through the concierge and front desks, house keeping, etc. is all first rate.  The rooms were spacious and technologically current.  Housekeeping tidied everything from loose iPhone charging wires to clothes left on beds.  The food service (numerous options throughout the hotel), gym and pool, and beautiful outdoor garden and atrium, were all fantastic.  The location is also superb.  I never expected to find one of my favorite hotels in Dublin.  But the Merrion is that good.  
",5,2018,08,07
200,Truly the Best of Dublin,"I am in Ireland several times a year for business meetings.   The Merrion Staff is truly the most professional and friendliest I encounter, traveling 100,000 miles a year.   Can not say enough about this hotel.   ",5,2018,08,03
200,Sisters day out and Lunch,"We had our lunch/ dinner in The Garden Room in The Merrion Hotel Dublin. Service, decor and food were of a very high standard. We arrived at 1.15 and left at 3.45 and at no time were we made to feel we were taking up a table space. The bill came to €116.50 for 2 crab 🦀 sliders, 1 Avocado 🥑 Cigars. Appetizers rather than starters but delicious.1 turbot 1 salmon and 1 fish and chips with peas and pancetta and champ mash as sides. Absolutely nothing was left on our plates. Yummy to say the least. One large bottle of still water and a Diet Coke. We were too full for dessert so had two pots of tea for the three of us. Dainty little morsels of Rice Krispie squares arrived for my sisters and I was given three little jelly squares ( Coeliac) these were a lovely touch and a surprise. Well done to The Merrion",5,2018,07,30
200,Paradise in the City,"After flying to Ireland from Canada, we wanted to spend the night in Dublin before picking up our rental car and heading to our first destination.  We discovered The Merrion last year when we also visited Ireland and ate at the Patrick Guilbaud Restaurant next door (that was so good we had to go back when visiting Ireland again this year).  This is a bit of paradise in the middle of the city.  The hotel is comprised of buildings that essentially encircle a beautiful garden patio.  We had a room in the Garden Wing but unfortunately, we faced the city, not the beautiful garden (now that we know, next time we will definitely request a garden view room).  We had lunch in the hotel's restaurant, and breakfast, too, and both were excellent.  A bit jet lagged we had a very comfortable nights sleep, after (of course) a night cap in the drawing room.  This was a lovely place to stay.  Last year we stayed at another 5 star hotel that is just a few blocks away.  That was nice but this was nicer so from now on this is where we will stay when in Dublin.  Next time we will stay a bit longer to enjoy the excellent resort like accommodations and service.",5,2018,07,29
200,fabulous room,"This is an historic property that has been refurbished as a 5 star hotel and deserves every star.
Our room 380 was huge with a lovely separate en suite. Tea and coffee making facilities, and best of all, a dedicated iron and ironing board in the room which is very unusual but most appreciated...such a small think to make us rave!
The decor was up to the minute, comfortable bed and sitting area. Tons of=wardrobe space. The restaurant was great and highly recommended, breakfast was very good.
Probably one of the finer hotels in the world, lovely gardens and the art was sensational.",4,2018,07,28
200,Yes please!!!,An amazing hotel for Dublin! I mean perfect! Location. The decor. The service. The bars and sitting areas.  Cleanest room and bathroom I’ve experienced. I want to stay here again and again.  The garden view rooms looked amazing if you can get! ,5,2018,07,28
200,Good location/bad cancellation,"This hotel is centrally located, near pubs, restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. We walked to most places. Breakfast was ample and good, the staff was friendly. Air conditioning was nonexistent on a hot July stay, and it could not be coaxed into working by the repair staff. We had an issue with a short- notice cancellation. The airlines cancelled and delayed outr flights and we did not arrive until two days late. We were made to pay for those rooms, even though we called to cancel as soon as we knew. There was no compassion shown for a situation clearly out of our control. It’s a lovely hotel, but be prepared to pay for your rooms, even if you cannot use them.",3,2018,07,27
200,Fab Stay,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. Will recommend to friends and family! The garden is particularly spectacular and the concierge team really go out of their way to help visitors out. Rooms are fab with all the usual touches you would expect from a 5* hotel. ,5,2018,07,25
200,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here just for one night on a short break. Superb hotel with great staff, facilities, food and drink. The spa and gym are also excellent and to be recommended.

This is not the cheapest place to stay, but, if you want to treat yourself, I’d recommend it.",5,2018,07,24
200,The Merrion is the only hotel in Dublin we would ever want to stay in.,"My wife and I visited Dublin for our 20th wedding anniversary, and wanted to allow ourselves a little bit of luxury so booked the Merrion. There was a 'Happy Anniversary' presentation of Sparking Rose and strawberries waiting for us in the room. The room was spacious, freshly decorated (unlike another Dublin hotel we stayed at recently) and very very clean. The breakfast delivered to room was amazing. We took a swim at the pool in the Tethra Spa, so relaxing. As fans of Irish 20th century, it was lovely to be invited to take a self-tour of the hotel art collection. The Merrion is the only hotel in Dublin we would ever want to stay in.",5,2018,07,24
200,Lovely garden picnic in the Merrion Garden Room,"Had a lovely garen picninc at the Merrion Hotel. It was gifted to celebrate our  engagement and the staff went the extra mile with top class service, complimentary champagne on arrival and they specially made apple crumble as one of the puddings!!

The room itself is beautiful, bright and colourful and opening up onto the lovely gardens and fountain. The picnic, was a mix of delights, sweet and savoury. Especially enjoyed the pudding combination of eton mess, chocolate cake and apple crumble! 

The staff were very friendly and attentive and I would definitely be happy to go back very week!",5,2018,07,23
200,Very Lovely hotel,"Very Clean. Very friendly staff. 
They had the best bed I have ever slept on. 
If you get a chance, do try their afternoon tea in their garden. 
The only downside of this hotel is their location I would say. It is slightly far from the centre in my opinion.  This hotel seemed to be the most well-known hotel in Dublin. ",4,2018,07,22
200,Garden Picnic,"My friend and I booked the Garden Picnic as a treat for ourselves and were very much looking forward to it. We have recently gone for afternoon tea in Dromoland Castle and Adare Manor and the Merrion was next on our list. The Garden Picnic visually looked lovely but there really wasn't much to eat (6 small things each for 30e each) and we were hungry leaving. We were given a very small lemonade as part of the board which is quite clever on the hotels part as you do not have enough to drink and need to buy another drink. It would have been a small gesture to ask if we would like a refill. The service left alot to be desired as we were seated inside and the picnic brought 20 minutes or so later. In the meantime nobody asked if we would like water for the table. The service really let the experience down. In both Dromoland and Adare we were asked if we would like extra of anything and service was impeccable. I won't be returning or recommending the picnic to anyone. In fact I thought it was only ok. The food that we did get was only average. Overall, a disappointing experience. ",3,2018,07,22
200,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"The Merrion is a luxury boutique hotel set in a series of four Georgian townhouses just around the corner from St Stephens Green in the centre of Dublin. I had a brief two night stay here in July 2018 in room 187. This was a very large bedroom with separate area for wardrobes and a large bathroom with top to bottom Carrara marble and a proper walk-in shower. The room had a good sized desk as well as a separate table with chocolate comfortable chairs. There were sufficient electrical sockets for recharging your devices. 

The free wifi was lightning fast. I measured it at 87 Mbps download and 95 Mbps upload speed, so plenty fast enough for any plausible use. The only place I have ever encountered faster wifi than this on my travels was in a posh hotel in Japan. The hotel has a nice courtyard garden bar area where you can have a drink, and is home to the best restaurant in Ireland, Patrick Guilbaud (the only two star Michelin restaurant in the country). The breakfast was also unusually good, featuring eggs made to order, excellent sausages and bacon from a good butcher, as well as the usual buffet options. Even the scrambled eggs were terrific, light and fluffy as you could wish, with charming service from a waitress who was working here while studying at university. This is a terrific hotel and I would happily return.",5,2018,07,20
200,My trip,"Very nice, centrally located,accessible to bus and tour bus. Business Center is very small and dress code was a little dampening to the mood of a vacation. Bathroom seemed a little outdated compared to the modernness of the room",4,2018,07,19
200,Awesome time in Dublin at the Merrion ...,Great staff and stellar accommodations.   Our 2nd stay here and plan to come back soon.   Gardens are beautiful and great food in the restaurant.    The location is great with easy access to lots of tasty restaurants to try.  Highly recommendations. ,5,2018,07,19
200,Outstanding hotel,"We enjoyed a much needed relaxing stay at The Merrion Hotel.  Every aspect of their service is exceptional.  The rooms are comfortable and tastefully appointed, the garden and restaurant spaces are beautiful and tranquil, and the food is excellent!  The location is great as well - easy walk for sightseeing and shopping.  A bit of a splurge, but worth every penny.  We will be back on our next visit to Dublin!",5,2018,07,19
200,A perfect stay....our 12 th stay!,"We have stayed here many times and so many aspects of the hotel make it exceptional, The  staff is very well trained and greet you by name every time they see you.  Breakfast is wonderful as are the meals in  the pub and restaurants  exceptionally clean and well attended rooms.   Gorgeous gardens.   Location is sensational.   Can you tell we loved or return stay?

",5,2018,07,19
200,Absolutely a first class experience!,"My husband and I went to Dublin to see Paul Simon in concert.  I wanted it to be a special long weekend, so I booked four nights at the Merrion Hotel.  From start to finish, it was a true luxury experience.  From the minute the bellman met our taxi to the minute another bellman helped us into a cab to the airport, it was absolutely first class.

It's true that the Merrion Hotel is not inexpensive, but there was no upselling when we checked in and everything we wanted or needed was provided.  We tried several of the bars and restaurants, even had afternoon ""art"" tea, though we missed the two star Michelin dining experience, which only gives us reason to come back to Dublin.  Not only is it a wonderfully friendly city, but this hotel is located in a great area for seeing it.  It's right next to lots of pubs, grocery stores, and tourist sites.

The last time we came to Dublin, we stayed at the Marker Hotel, which is also an excellent hotel.  However, if I have to choose one hotel over another, I'd definitely give the Merrion the nod.  It really is a classy place to spend a long weekend and well worth the money spent.  Thanks so much to the excellent staff who made our stay so wonderful!  Hope to see you all again!",5,2018,07,18
200,Delightful restful and devine in Dublin,"The Merrion is truely one of the most comfortable and calm hotels I have ever visited. The staff-- mostly from the formerly eastern bloc-- welcomed every guest as they would like themselves to be welcomed. Every one anticipated our needs before we could even ask. Our room was waiting despite two early arrivals (we stayed twice). The staff-- from front desk to door to maids-- were beyond perfect in every way. The service was as you would expect in high end Asian hotels without the bowing and scraping. The Cellar bar was open to accomodate the world cup. Most hotels are far too rigid to adjust. The rooms are not the biggest, the bathrooms are good but not fabulous. The views of the garden nice but not necessary. The staff and the ambiance make this hotel what it is. OH, and do enjoy a drink or dinner in the Cellar or even in the living room. The location too cannot be beat. Really, This is the best rest  Dublin has to offer.",5,2018,07,18
200,Recent stay,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels. Although this hotel is an adequate place to sleep in a reasonably good location in Dublin, if you have experience staying at 5 Star hotels you will be disappointed. Not even close to a 5 star hotel in service, food or accommodations.",2,2018,07,18
200,The BEST Day/Night EVER!,We stayed in this most fantastic/understated/elegant and above all soo relaxing hotel recently.  WOW and WOW and WOW again - and THE STAFF - where do you get them and the training comes right through. It is very unusual to find everybody singing....off the same hymn sheet but The Merrion have got it in ONE. Everybody should experience this most beautiful place at least once- it is just good for the MIND and the SOUL. Met a gorgous young man when we ate in the Cellar - CHARLIE name tag but.....What a personality -wonderful eye contact and WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU today- just love it.....Food excellent there and breakfast was a pure delight. WE are coming back for sure.  Thank YOU.,5,2018,07,18
200,One of the best and highly recommended!,The Merrion ranks as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. All aspects during our stay were excellent. Friendly and attentive staff with high quality service throughout. Meals were excellent with only the freshest produce used.  Thank you.,5,2018,07,18
200,Luxury experience!,Everything about The Merrion is so special. From the minute you arrive you are made to feel that what is important to staff is that you enjoy your stay and they go out of their way to make sure that is the case.  We will definitely be back when we want to treat ourselves again.,5,2018,07,17
200,Understated Elegance,"We had to most lovely experience at the Merrion Hotel. It had a feel of luxury and quality and was so relaxed, you would never imagine you are in the midst of a major city. The staff were all amazing.  ",5,2018,07,17
200,Fabulous,This was our second time to stay in this lovely hotel. V attentive staff and delightful surroundings. So convenient to the city. The beds are magnificent. The best sleep ever! Will be returning to the Merrion. Thank you.,4,2018,07,17
200,Is the Marrion Hotel the best in the world?,The property is beautiful with an excellent collection of significant art on display. The public spaces are formal yet inviting and extremely comfortable. The guest accommodations are rarely equaled. The hospitality is beyond compare. This is a hotel one will remember fondly and desire to return to often.  Well worth the cost. ,5,2018,07,16
200,"Great location, beautiful hotel","This is a beautiful hotel, made up of several old townhouses. The room we had was large and bright. There was plenty of storage space, a nicely appointed bath, and sitting area. The hotel is just of St. Stephens Green and Marrion Square. There are plenty of pubs nearby. It is also within walking distance to Trinity College, the museums and shopping area.",5,2018,07,15
200,Great location,"My wife and I stayed here in June 2018.  Our room was nice but our view was a concrete wall outside our window with a small dirt path in between.  The is the luck of the draw sometimes. Maybe the hotel was full?  There was a wonderful courtyard and the grounds were very well maintained.  What lowered my review score was the staff.  They always seemed to be on a computer or their cell phone anytime we walked by.  Unless you made eye contact first they did not even acknowledge you.  The door men were courteous and helpful with directions, suggestions for food etc. For such a highly rated hotel we expected much more from the staff working there.  Simply a smile and to be asked how our day was or if we needed anything goes a long way sometimes.  This hotel was recommended by our Virtuoso travel planner and I'm not sure I would be quick to revisit these premises.",4,2018,07,14
200,Wonderful!,"We flew into Dublin and this was our first stop on a long trip family around Ireland. This hotel stood out as the best of our entire trip. Our room was gorgeous and comfortable right down to the little bed they promptly brought up for my 8 year old. They spoiled her with balloons, coloring supplies and little treats. We usually stay in 5 star hotels so we are accustomed to a high level of service and the Merrion did not disappoint. It was the perfect way to begin our trip. ",5,2018,07,14
200,Outstanding rooms,"Used this as a base for a 2d trip.  Service is excellent. If you arrive after an overnight trip, you likely won’t have your room till mid-afternoon.  So, prepare accordingly with something to do.  Suggest you arrange a tour, or buy a HopOn Hop Off pass to ride around and get a Dublin orientation.  Beds are very comfortable.",5,2018,07,13
200,Among the finest hotels,"I was told by an Irish friend this is the best hotel in Dublin, and it lived up to my high expectations.  

Stayed for four nights in June and I was impressed by every careful detail of this exceptionally tasteful hotel.  Nothing ostentatious about it; all classically refined, beautifully appointed, yet also warm, welcoming and accommodating.  I gave them a slightly annoying request they handled with grace and efficiency.  The grounds are splendid and the location convenient.",5,2018,07,10
200,Overnight,"A one-day bed/breakfast in a suite; room 386.  Arriving with vehicle, it is parked by front-door staff in underground parking area.  If you arrive before 3.00pm you will be required to wait until that time before getting a room.  Breakfast is held in amply-sized garden dining room; is buffet, and, menu for cooked breakfast.  Suite was of an adequate size and very well equipped.  Due to high ambient temperature didn’t want duvet and asked for sheet + blanket; the requested change didn’t materialise.  The hotel gives the impression that it is over-staffed.",4,2018,07,10
200,Garden Picnic,"Went to this beautiful hotel to try there new Garden Picnic. Having tried their art afternoon tea before obviously expectations were very high and of course they kept their promise, whole set up exceptional. I cannot recommend it highly enough, it's light, refreshing and so we'll put together. Paul Kelly's desserts were to die for, lemonade is the best ever I tasted and mini sandwiches were top class. Request a table beside the little pond if weather is good. ",5,2018,07,09
200,The best,"They say you get what you pay for, and regarding this hotel, this is an understatement. I have never had such amazing service anywhere and I’ve been to some very high-end restaurants and hotels. Elegance, class, and an at-home feeling is a difficult combination to achieve, but that is exactly what you get at this wonderful place. ",5,2018,07,09
200,A 5 Star Hotel In Every Way.,The Merrion was a delight to stay in. The staff are brilliant and very well trained to be friendly and very obliging and helpful. The room was very well presented with everything you could wish for. The level of detail was exceptional. The restaurants were very good and the bar was comfortable with a great selection of spirits and wines. I would stay at this hotel on my next visit to Dublin without any hesitation. In the end you get what you pay for and that for us is value for money.,5,2018,07,09
200,Elegant yet casual,"We spent 3 wonderful days at the Merrion.  The staff could not have been more kind and helpful.  The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated.  There was ALWAYS someone who could point you in the right direction.  We ate breakfast in their dining room every morning.  It was excellent.  And, we ate two really great, light dinners in the Cellar Bar which was lively and just an all round happy place!  Wonderful all the way around.",5,2018,07,08
200,Wow truly a 5 star,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but a few are as luxurious as this hotel. Location is fabulous, grounds are beautiful and the service is Wow!!  There is also a 2 Michelin  star restaurant that you should absolutely try. It is also a walking distance to some of the best pubs in Ireland. Highly recommend it. ",5,2018,07,07
200,A true 5 star hotel you will never forget,"On our June vacation to both Ireland and Scotland, the Merrion was the highlight of our trip.  We were blessed to have stayed at 3  five star hotels during our stay and the Merrion was the best of all.  People were grand and the accomodations were flawless.  It's by no means inexpensive but if you can afford it, I think you will find value for the money spent.  I only wish the breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room.",5,2018,07,05
200,Experience a Great Hotel at Reasonable Cost,"We had stayed at Merrion before with a group and when we began to search for a Dublin hotel for our family we compared a couple  of other highly rated hotels but found them to be outrageously priced. The Merrion more than filled our requirements and when we needed their assistance with airline caused problems, they really came through. ",5,2018,07,04
200,Outstanding,"We were lucky enough to stay in this wonderful hotel on a recent trip to Ireland.  The facade is understated, but as soon as you enter this elegant hotel you are incredibly well looked after by the highly trained staff.  There is a wonderful afternoon tea served in the lounge complete with a harpist.  There is a beautiful garden enclosure for drinks on a lovely day.  A two Michelin star is connected to the hotel, a casual restaurant for all meals and a cellar restaurant for something more casual.  The breakfast buffet was amazing and it was possible to order a cooked breakfast if desired.  The rooms are elegant and are tidied up every time you leave the room and new towels supplied if necessary.
The Merrion is the type of place you would like to stay longer.",5,2018,07,04
200,Unrivalled service,We chose this hotel because it was highly recommended by every Irish person we know and we found out why! It is centrally located yet in a quiet neighbourhood within walking distance to all the hot spots south of the river. Despite being in a standard double room all the facilities are complete and the room/bathromm are furnished to the highest standard. The concierge and housekeeping services were totally outstanding by any standard. The only inperfections we experienced were the lack of ISB charging ports and the noisy door closers.,5,2018,07,04
200,Great location!,"Extremely well located in a nice part of town. Enjoyed Patrick Gilbaud, the 2 Michelin starred restaurant set adjacent to the hotel for lunch. Very pricey for dinner but watch out for the set lunch menu which is perfectly reasonable. Continuing on the food theme: - try the art high tea in the hotel set in a beautiful room with a harpist playing and at the end you receive a book detailing the hotel's history and artwork. Rooms are very cosy and clean and a nice touch was the 3 blocks of chocolate tied up with a ribbon when we arrived!!",5,2018,07,03
200,Fabulous!,"My family stayed at The Merrion on our first trip to Ireland and we were given a warm welcome.  The hotel has such a fantastic location - you can walk to so many interesting sights, excellent restaurants and good shopping.  The rooms are very comfortable, complete with great mattresses and perfect pillows (and I’m very picky about pillows!).  The restaurants and bars are top notch and the service is wonderful.  Would absolutely stay here again!  ",5,2018,07,01
200,Excellent Stay,"My stay was nothing short of fantastic. Beautiful place , clean , spacious room and great food and drinks . Staff are professional and very friendly. We are at 2 of the restaurants and loved the bar and food at the cellar best 😊",5,2018,06,30
200,Perfect for weary business travellers,"Luxurious room and bathroom, extremely comfortable, very good attention to detail. Classic and well executed room service menu and lovely restaurant for breakfast. Thoroughly attentive staff and ideally located; I try and stay here on every business trip to Dublin.",5,2018,06,30
200,Elegant Top Hotel,"I stayed here ten years ago and couldn’t wait to return. It was better than ever. Our deluxe room in the main house was beautiful, quiet and spacious. Housekeeping was impeccable. The concierges were helpful as were the doormen. Breakfast was ample and they prepared a wonderful room service meal at 5am the morning we left for the airport. If I had one critique it would be check-in, where the rep pointed out that early check in is not guaranteed. We arrived at 1pm so fair enough. But then she tried to push a late check in on me. I had to call a manager, who sorted it out beautifully. All in all, a wonderful stay.",5,2018,06,30
200,Mixed feelings,"I found the entrance & lobby to this hotel very, very simple, unwelcoming & nothing special considering how expensive it is. Mixed feelings about staff at hotel. Every time we walked back into lobby no one greeted us from reception area even if they saw & looked at us, just blank stare. I even smiled & nothing! Only 2 staff members we encountered were so nice & friendly and didn't act like we were bothering them and that was a woman from Brazil who walked us to our room & concierge lady from Australia.  Can't say the same for Concierge guy the day before who was a little rude. 

Having said that our room was lovely!  It was comfortable & very clean and had a large nice bathroom. The room included complimentary fancy Oscar Wilde brand water( best water), Fiji water & 3 bars of Merrion chocolate wrapped up in a nice bow. Very nice! 

Unlike so many hotels in Ireland The Merrion did not include breakfast with our rate of over $400 a night.",4,2018,06,29
200,Excellent Location and friendly and knowledgeable staff,"We stayed for two nights at the beginning of our trip. Even tho we arrived early at the hotel we were looked after beautifully and a room was made ready for us early. this was very much appreciated as we had an elderly relative travelling with us. We were a bit disappointed that we could not dine in the main restaurant that first night as there was a function on, but dined in the restaurant downstairs which was fine. The only clunky part of the stay was that it appeared our breakfast order was misplaced as we had to wait over 45 minutes for it. We accepted the apology and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast both that day and the following day. I would agree with other contributors who felt that breakfast should be included in the rate as an extra 29 euro per person, whilst advised to us and agreed to in advance is a bit unusual when compared to other hotels, both large and small.
I would certainly stay here again, even with the extra cost for breakfast as the location and the service were wonderful.",5,2018,06,28
200,The Dublin Star Hotel,The Merrion is a beautiful hotel. The staff was fantastic from check-in to check-out. Our room was beautiful and very clean. The breakfast was delicious with many options to choose from on the menu. The hotel is conveniently located to many Dublin attractions and shopping.,5,2018,06,27
200,"Stylish, sophisticated hotel in the heart of Dublin","It was definitely worth spending a night in Dublin before venturing off to the countryside. The location across from Trinity University, five minutes from Grafton Street (the pedestrian shopping street) and ten minutes from Temple Bar was perfect to feel the buzz of Dublin on a summer’s Friday evening. Our suite was very a good size with a comfortable living area and desk, and there was ample room to put an extra bed for our son. The master bedroom had personality with traditional cheery decor. All the staff were all most accommodating and the hotel is kept in tip top shape. The garden square to which our room looked out, clearly had been created by a skilled garden designer. The restaurant had a good menu, but we ended at the restaurant called the Bank on Dame Street for a delicious dinner in an historic building with a lively atmosphere complete with a terrific pianist playing lots of pop favourites.",5,2018,06,27
200,Treat yourself,"My friend and I recently visited Dublin to attend the Taylor Swift concert. We decided to stay an extra night and booked into the merrion for a spa treatment and overnight stay. The hotel is just amazing. From it’s opulent georgian wing to its beautiful lavinder garden to its well equipped and tastefully decorated rooms, this hotel desrves its 5 star ratting. The entire team were fantastic and couldn’t do enough to assist you. The spa and pool was wonderful. It was my first time at a spa and I was made feel very relaxed and welcome. I had the alge enveloment which was very relaxing. We had food in the cellar bar which was an intimate and lovely experience. Food was excellent and again very friendly staff. The room was large and well equipped with a very large bathroom. I would defiantly stay again ",5,2018,06,26
200,Relaxing Break,"Hotel is faultless. From making the reservation with Caroline to checkout we thoroughly enjoyed or stay. Door staff, check in/out staff and the staff at breakfast were all professional friendly people that clearly take pride in their work.  My only regret is our stay was so short and we didn't get to enjoy all this Hotel has to offer.",5,2018,06,25
200,As good as it gets...and then some more!,"We have just had a three day stay at The Merrion Hotel. 
I’ve been lucky enough to stay in many first class hotels all around the world over the years...but none better than The Merrion. 
Every aspect of our stay was perfect..the rooms spacious and refined, food excellent, gardens and public rooms lovely. But the staff just MADE it! They are happy, willing, smiling, relaxed and professional. 
I wish there were more hotels like it in the world! 
Thanks Merrion for a memorable stay.",5,2018,06,24
200,Incredible hotel.  Easily Best in Ireland.,The room was a beautiful suite overlooking the garden.  We arrived at 5am and got into the room immediately (THANK YOU!).  Custom orders like cut flowers and champagne were all done quite well.  The room service was impeccable from an award winning kitchen.  They arranged our fantastic driver for a country outing for hiking and made picnics for us.  The bathroom was exquisite and the nicest on the hotels I have stayed in. The night desk manager found me in the business office at 10pm confused on printing trail maps and spent hours working it out for me to have printed at 6am as we headed out the door.  Right outside the front door are 4 pubs with live music open late.,5,2018,06,21
200,What might have been...,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location.  One cannot help but admire the attention to detail; the fine silver and linens, extensive art collection throughout, worthy of a five star hotel.  I could not give five stars, however, because in my opinion the heart of a fine hotel is in the connection to the clientele.  I felt a real disconnect with the front desk.  Everywhere else within the hotel was exceptional.  I had emailed the hotel five months prior to our stay that we were celebrating two special occasions and they told me they would have some special amenities sent to the room when we arrived (primarily my husband’s birthday being the day of our arrival).  Nothing was sent.  When I ran down to inquire about the misstep the front desk told me that they had nothing in the computer, which is when I showed them the email.  At that point they should just have taken care of it no questions asked but I had to suffer through a long drawn out conversation about whose interpretation of the situation was correct.  I was a bit crestfallen.  If not for this situation (which occurred while I was asleep on my feet after an overnight flight) it could have been perfection.  We were pleased with our room, which was lovely.  Anything to make up for the missing details would have been appreciated, even just some chocolates on our pillows, but we walked away feeling like they didn't care.  Very unfortunate that our experience was not better, because I chose this hotel after reading the many positive reviews here.",4,2018,06,20
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion Hotel is the best hotel in Dublin with the nicest staff, fantastic facilities and a great location. You won't find better value worldwide for a truly 5 star hotel. Cannot recommend highly enough  ",5,2018,06,20
200,Pure Bliss,"Stayed with my hubby as a special treat. 
We were treated like what I perceive royalty to be like....... and not over the top snobbery. 
We had a gorgeous room and breakfast was amazing.
It was lovely to mozzy around town being so central, I look forward to our next special treat",5,2018,06,18
200,A classic 5 star hotel,"We only stayed here for 2 nights after our cruise docked in Dublin. I wish I could have stayed longer. The service is impeccable, the rooms are large and the beds very comfortable. There were so many nice touches, fresh fruit, chocolate and bottled water were provided. The entire staff;  the concierge the bell staff and the front desk were all pleasant, kind and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location and is walking distance from most sights. 
I can’t wair to return one day!",5,2018,06,18
200,A Great Experience!!,"Had a fantastic time and experience in Dublin. Helped by the extremely attentive staff.
The hotel is well located with everything within walking distance.
The rooms are contemporary with very comfortable bed and a good size bathroom.
Incredibly had gorgeous weather without rain.",5,2018,06,18
200,Underwhelmed,"The Garden Restaurant is a most attractive location as part of the room opens onto a garden/pool area.

Unfortunately, the cuisine was patchy.  The tomato soup was delicious and did not need the bread pieces that proved difficult to cut with the edge of a spoon.  The terrine was considered rather tasteless albeit made up of a variety of constituent parts.

The main dishes included hake, tiny carrots and little less.  A big appetite would seek something more substantial. The Chateaubriand was very generously sized and was accompanied by a fondant potato which was tasteless.  A baked potato was served separately in a tiny pot.  It had a big dark spade mark in its jacket and it too lacked taste.

A nice bottle of wine somewhat relieved the shortcomings.   However, these should not be encountered in a top class restaurant.   Such does not entice diners to make return visits.

Pity.",5,2018,06,12
200,Beautiful haven in Dublin,"We had a beautiful bright spacious room in the main building with a view of the courtyard.  Nice big marble bathroom!  The staff were wonderful right down to the cleaning staff and all the little 5 star touches.  
I agree with some that at the room rates they charge, it does seem reasonable to include breakfast.
Although we were staying here for 3 nights I didn’t get to see all the public spaces as I spent 2 of those days sick in my room or out and about when feeling better.
I did have a drink in the bar in the basement which I felt was not up to par with the rest of the hotel.  And although polite, the bar staff weren’t particularly warm or friendly
It did feel like you were in the cellar",4,2018,06,11
200,Perfection!,"The title says it all.  Everything about this hotel was spot on perfect.  The staff were friendly and gracious, the public spaces were gorgeous, and our room and its amenities were so comfortable we didn't want to leave.  And let's not forget how conveniently located it is.  Can't wait to visit again!",5,2018,06,11
200,Great location. Great staff,"Massive room and bathroom. Great bed. Clean and comfortable. The staff are helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good though the toast was cold.

Great location within walking distance of Temple Bar and the shopping district and lots of pubs and parks.",4,2018,06,09
200,Best stay in Dublin,"Incredible hotel, wonderful staff, made us feel at home following an 18 hour travel day.  The room was absolutely stately, and it was so nice to have a luxury hotel so perfectly situated in Dublin.  Will be back!  ",5,2018,06,09
200,Pre-cruise stay,"Great stay. Very comfortable accommodations, excellent location for exploring Dublin. Staff was courteous and helpful.  We were concerned that some online descriptions of bed size referred to to full size bed. We spoke with hotel beforehand and they confirmed it was actually a queen. It was a very comfortable queen. ",5,2018,06,08
200,David,"Excellent Location. Rooms always cleaned and tidy. Only disappointment was the springs in the bed seem to be worn well down.
Staff always a pleasure. Price of is also increased during the summer months",5,2018,06,08
200,Such Luxury!,"The Merrion is everything it says it is - and more! We loved staying here. The staff are warm and friendly. Guest rooms are sophisticated and comfortable, with beautiful marble bathrooms. The private art collection is extensive and fascinating. Be sure to explore this property thoroughly for both the art and the architecture - the plaster work in the older buildings is exquisite. Meet the lovely Fiona in the Garden Room - a real Irish charmer! Breakfast was superb - excellent quality - the blueberry pancakes memorable! The Cellar Bar is gorgeous with its vaulted brick walls and ceilings - and ""the best"" avocado and grapefruit salad. Drinks in the Garden Terrace on a spring afternoon, or tea in the Drawing Rooms - you won't want to leave. Great location just across from the National Museums, with Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green just steps away. When we next go to Dublin, we will indulge again at this outstanding hotel!",5,2018,06,07
200,Great stay!,"We had a great stay at The Merrion. The room, setting, service, and location were all superb. The continental breakfast that came with the room rate could be improved (fairly limited and no hot food items), but all in all this would not stop us from returning again. In fact, we can't wait to come back! We are especially grateful that the hotel allowed us to check into our room at 10am after a long flight. ",5,2018,06,07
200,Truly amazing hotel,This is an excellent hotel with a great location. The friendly staff are very professional and helpful. The delicious breakfast is served in great picturesque settings. There is a fantastic pool and fitness facilities. ,5,2018,06,07
200,Par Excellence,The Merrion Hotel represents a level of excellence that all other hotels in this class should aspire to. Time and time again it excels all expectations. Always a delighful experience for us at The Merrion Hotel.,5,2018,06,06

200,Unparelled excellence.,"Everything about The Merrion is excellent. We were not overlly impressed with Dublin, after having visited the delightful Irish countryside, but this hotel more than  made up for it. I would highly recommend it!",5,2018,06,04
200,Nice stay,"Comfortable and pretty room.  Nice bathroom.  There is a lot of noise in the mornings  (door banging) which made it hard to sleep.  It could have been because we were there over St Patricks Day weekend. Buffet breakfast in the restaurant was nice, dinner was average.  The oddest thing about our stay was that there was a welcome gift in our room when we arrived that included chocolates. My daughter was so excited. A few minutes later someone came in and took the gift and replaced it with fruit.",4,2018,06,02
200,Beautiful hotel,The Merrion Hotel is a quaint hotel with a lot of history in it.  The staff is top notch & they are willing to help you in any way possible.  You will have a great stay at this hotel.  I highly recommend it.,5,2018,06,02
200,Quiet Oasis In Busy Dublin,"Spent 2 nights at The Merrion this month. A nice respite from the mad streets of Dublin. The beds are legendary and with good reason. We had a street side room- which means it faced into the back.  If you are not paying for a Garden room- then make sure you are on the 2nd floor at least. Or it will be a brick wall outside your window. Staff was very nice. At these prices, it should indeed be a perfect stay. Why not an excellent?  The first room we were taken to was on the first floor and they were having some sort of drainage issue. Outside the window -right outside - a huge industrial waste truck was parked and groaning away with a yellow light spinning on it's cab hood. I asked to be moved and I was- but I should not have had to ask. Bathroom lighting- a bit of a gulag as you have to turn them all on at once. The tub is glorious and deserves better lighting. Would most definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again myself.",4,2018,06,01
200,A Fabulous stay in Ireland thank you Merrion,"We had the pleasure of staying five night here while touring Ireland. Luxury hotel with all the finest upgrades. The staff goes out of it's way to accommodate you.
Beds are very comfortable and the you hear no door noise at night. Loved the turn down service every evening.
They don't hound you with small charges. We felt everything we needed and more was included.
We arrived on a very early flight and we were allowed to change and use the spa. Our bags were transferred while we went exploring and lunch. Our room was all set when we returned.
Their breakfast - which was included for us was devine! More than your average Irish breakfast. 
Again, the staff and the lovely décor make this the place to stay in Ireland. If I ever return it will be my first choice.
PS - lovely neighborhood",5,2018,05,31

200,Perfect end to our vacation!,"My daughter and I stayed in a ""Garden View"" Room at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin for the final two days of our vacation.  It was the perfect end to our adventures in Iceland, Scotland and Ireland.  It's a truly lovely hotel in a great location and our room was very nicely appointed and quiet.  The bed was absolutely sumptuous.  We both slept like babies!  (I meant to ask where I might purchase the type of pillow they had as I need one like it here at home!) Beautiful sitting areas inside and outside in the private garden.  Concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations and making a hair appointment at the last minute.  Can't say enough about how pampered we felt.  Hotels in Dublin are expensive, but this one is well worth it.  - Kate & Molly (two weary travelers!)",5,2018,05,23
200,lunch in garden room restaurant,"superb, 5 star meal just like the MERRION HOTEL itself. The terrace garden is an amazing tranquil oasis in the city centre . I was celebrating a birthday with elderly friend and she, so , so enjoyed herself. the staff are so professional, friendly and acknowledged her special day so we were sad to shorten our day at 5. It was a fabulous experience and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin, ",5,2018,05,23
200,Superb,"I have to say the team here are superb. Really friendly and very helpful, even when thinking outside of the box. You should be proud of this team as they cannot be faulted.

Thank you",5,2018,05,23
200,Peace and Civilisation,We we warmly welcomed and upgraded to a junior suite.Our room was lovely and quiet.

200,Top class and comfy bed,"Was only in for one night, a rather short < 24 hours stay, however, my experience there will prompt my return next time I’m in Dublin.

Very welcoming bellboys, valet and reception. Impressive size to the rooms. Very comfortable bed and pillows. 

The only flaw would be that the shower pressure isn’t the best in the world but still does a decent job.

Highly recommended.",5,2018,05,20
200,Short stay in Dublin,"Excellent service from the moment I arrived. I got to the hotel around 8am off an early morning flight and after checking in was invited to have some breakfast while waiting for my room to be ready. When I returned to check in at 9.30am, my room was ready and my luggage already taken up. Everything was made so easy. ",5,2018,05,17
200,Pretty Nice! ,"Stayed three nights and wanted to take the bed with me when I checked out! What an amazing night sleep! 
The hotel was beautiful, the service top notch! Location is perfect. I only had breakfast at the property and as with everything else, the food and service was excellent. Thanks for a wonderful stay! ",5,2018,05,16
200,A very nice hotel with mostly gracious staff,"We arrived late after a fairly long flight
Most of the reception staff were friendly 
Apparently our room was booked as a room with King bed but there was some 
misunderstanding as to what was required 
One of the staff tried to tell us the room booked was not a King bed room & it would be an additional 44 Euros per night. We asked to see the room before we made a decision as the room was expensive anyway. The room that was booked was ok
Fairly small after the basic  rooms at the 4 Seasons in Russia . We have been told that the Merrion is the best Hotel in Dublin 
We had a breakfast meeting in the Restaurant & one of our guests ordered Toast . It took a very long time after I had mine so I asked if they could bring the toast. It arrived and half of the slices were 
Very Burnt . I was amazed that such a place could send burnt toast to a guest
The shower was tiny & when I washed my hair my elbows hit the wall. As well as a small shower there was mold in the grouting.The plug in the hand basin didn’t 
work so I had to call for maintenance. The maintenance man came & fixed it fairly quickly ",4,2018,05,13
200,Wonderful hotel!,"The Merrion has exceptional customer service, lovely rooms and great food and drink!! The Cellar Pub is wonderful as is No. 23, a little hidden bar with great ambiance. Our room service was perfect as were our restaurant experience. There are several options on site as well as high tea. Fireplaces are frequently encountered along with comfortable furniture. I highly recommend. The person I was with had stayed here previously and raved about it.",5,2018,05,13
200,Only Game in Town,"I stayed here recently for three nights as part of a business conference.  It was explained to me there were no other 5 star hotels in Dublin with conference facilities, so that is why we chose the Merrion.  It IS a first class hotel with excellent service and a very good location in the Centre of Dublin.  You can walk to most of the main tourist destinations.  My room was nice but forgettable.  They have made good strides in updating the rooms but the main hotel itself is very old and it shows in funny ways like the absolute maze-like hallways and having to snake through various rooms and corridors to get where you want to.  It’s easy to get lost and one is always having to ask directions.  The other odd thing is that the place resembles an old age home in terms of their guests.  I barely saw anyone under 70 roaming the common areas.  So, definitely not a hip, boutique hotel vibe if that’s what you’re looking for.  
However, the staff is extremely good and top level service throughout plus excellent food in the Garden restaurant and a very cool basement cellar bar.",4,2018,05,13
200,Very good choice in Dublin,"The Merrion in Dublin has character, elegance, nice food, and helpful staff.  Housekeeping was especially good and left thoughtful touches like wraps for our charging cords to tidy appearances.  The hotel also recognized and honored our LHW membership.  Breakfast was good, but not especially memorable - the food was fine, but the staff was busy and somewhat unwelcoming.  The common rooms are very nice, and the staff at the front of the hotel made us feel very welcome.  Although Dublin was disappointing, The Merrion was not, and we appreciated the work done by the team to make our stay so comfortable.",5,2018,05,12
200,"The Merrion Hotel, Dublin City Center","Beautiful hotel; exceptionally clean, comfortable, spacious and well appointed rooms, excellent variety of services and excellent service. Standards as expected from a LHW (Leading Hotel of the World)",5,2018,05,10
200,Great stay,"Perfect all around.  Large, spacious suites (with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on), lovely staff, and a great bar area and drinks.  Also located in a great little part of Dublin, walking distance to many restaurants and attractions.",5,2018,05,10
200,Best in Dublin......,"As a Dubliner i know the Merrion hotel very well from dining there to having a drink or meeting a client.I had the opportunity to spend a couple of nights there during the winter storms and I was blown away by the levels of service, the professionalism of the staff and the total courtesy and pleasantness of everyone I encountered. 
Usually 5 star hotels can be a little stuffy and reserved but I found the Merrion to strike the perfect balance of Irish hospitality. 
The rooms are very well appointed and mine looked out onto Merrion street with views of Government buildings. Bathrooms are very impressive and well stocked with supplies.The turndown service is lovely.
Breakfast in the new Garden Room was amazing and the choice of food and beverages plentiful.
In my opinion it's the best Hotel in Dublin by a country mile.",5,2018,05,10
200,An unbelievably positive experience in a great location.,"We arrived at the Merrion after spending fourteen days on a cruise.  It was an unbelievably wonderful stay.  The staff was so positive and helpful and concerned that we have the best experience possible.  All of the doormen were engaging and helpful always going the extra mile to assure our every whim was satisfied.  
The rooms were equally outstanding and extremely comfortable and practical My wife loved the robes provided.  The bed and bedding were probably the most luxurious and comfortable we had ever experienced.  The dining room was delightful and provided us with wonderful breakfasts each morning of our stay.  We would gladly return to the Merrion at the first opportunity.",5,2018,05,09
200,"Nice Hotel, Excellent Staff","The staff was wonderful, quite personable.
All employees were attentive to our needs.  Our stay also included a lovely breakfast each morning.  Our room was small, not spacious, but very well appointed and maintained.  The Spa and guest pool are first class! We enjoyed our stay.",5,2018,05,09
200,Deserves its reputation,"The Merrill is just what you would expect for a hotel of its rating and reputation.  The staff is cordial and most helpful.  The rooms are immaculate. The location is central with many Dublin attractions within close walking distance.  Breakfast was very good.  The cellar was fun.  All in all this is a beautiful hotel with an excellent staff.   Enjoy it.  And by the way, the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington is right next door to admire!",5,2018,05,07
200,The Merry Merrion Hotel,"When deciding which property to stay in on my short trip through Dublin, I asked a few friends in the hotel business.  Hands down they all recommended The Merrion.  When a property is recommended by its peers (or even competition), I usually have confidence it will be a winner.  I wasn't disappointed!

A little challenging to see from the road, especially when driving on the opposite side of the street (it was my first time), as I slowly idled past I am sure the bellman are used to this.  I rolled down my window and called out ~ they quickly stopped traffic and guided me around to enter the circular drive.  That was the last I saw of my car for 2 days!  

Check in was a breeze. I had enough time to settle into my beautiful room before tea.  This hotel must have had a woman (thankfully) on its design team.  The room was light, bright, elegant, lots of mirrors, great closet, tea pot and nespresso machine, coffee table and windows with great views! And the bed! So comfortable!

Tea time was a real treat with Fabrice lading the way and explaining the ART TEA ceremony.  There is a fabulous art collection displayed throughout the hotel (statues, too).  Each week the pastry chef selects 3 of the property pieces and creates desserts to compliment the art.  I've attached some snapshots for you to see.

Champagne, tea, scones and sumptuous desserts.  Heaven!

The front desk team is young, happy to serve and friendly as can be.  Concierge gave me a map with area highlights and I had a great evening stroll.

Shahid Malik, Guest Services, took time to show me the grounds, the event spaces and even some of the private residence areas of the hotel. 

Breakfast was amazing with Jonathan ready to serve and smile.

This experience made my Dublin trip better than expected!",5,2018,05,07
200,Incredible experience!,"Incredible food, location, bar staff and hotel room! We dined in the new restaurant, had drinks in the cellar bar and also in the garden - all were of the highest standard! 

Could not recommend enough!",5,2018,05,07
200,Very very nice hotel in good location in London.,This hotel does everything right!! The entire staff goes over the top to ensure your stay is perfect. Pampering of every guest is the norm here.  We were disappointed at the view our room had but EVERYTHING else about the hotel made up for it. Very pricey but all the pluses they offer made it a lot easier to accept the rates. Worth splurging for that special occasion.,5,2018,05,04
200,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion for 1 night in a deluxe garden view room. The room was spacious and the bed was amazing. The bed linens were beautiful. The bathroom was huge with a great shower and the Asprey toiletries were an absolute treat. There was also plenty of complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel and the gardens are immaculate and just beautiful. Every member of staff we encountered was very friendly & helpful and provided excellent service. The only negative bit during our stay was the food in the cellar bar. We were not impressed with the food, the bar itself is very nice though. 
Other than that everything was perfect. We’d definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,05,04
200,Terrific stay! We will return!,We stayed at the Merrion after arriving in Dublin from NYC - tired and looking for some R&R. We found it! The staff was terrific - friendly and helpful. The room was gorgeous and comfortable. And the amenities helped us ease out of jet lag and into vacation mode: a gorgeous heated pool and sauna revitalized us and made us ready for our grand adventure. Food was terrific and the grounds were beautiful. Highly recommend!,5,2018,05,03
200,Best Hotel in Dublin!,Our recent stay at The Merrion was amazing! From the time we pulled up in front of the hotel to the time we departed. We arrived with a car and different have to worry about parking in small spaces as they did the for us.The staff was very friendly and helpful. I called Housekeeping for extra pillows and they were brought within minutes. The breakfast was great!  Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2018,05,02
200,Two great nights at the Merrion.....,"In spite of the rain, we had a lovely time during our stay in Dublin. The hotel was so comfortable with impeccable service throughout.  We had a room that faced the garden and was on the third floor of the hotel.  The breakfast was good with many options to chose from in a buffet setting or from the menu.  I was most impressed with the staff  and had not one complaint....",5,2018,04,30
200,Dublin’s finest,The Merrion is without doubt Dublin’s  finest city centre hotel.  It exudes charm and sophistication.  Enjoy it from the moment you arrive until you must finally leave and make sure the last thing you do is to book again.,5,2018,04,29
200,Where Everyone Knows Your Name,"Most people think of Cheers, when they hear this classic phrase.   But I automatically think of The Merrion, as its home away from home.  Everyone from the Doormen to Housekeeping greet me by name and make you truly feel at home 👍",5,2018,04,28
200,Dublin at its finest,"An island of elegant calm in the 24/7 party that is a tourist's Dublin. It is hard to choose which was more outstanding, the staff or the accommodations.  From all the staff, always a cheery greeting and a smile. For the room, nicely stated elegance and one of the most comfortable beds ever.  Next time you are in Dublin, treat yourself and stay here.",5,2018,04,28
200,A lovely treat,"From start to finish everything was superb and nothing was any bother, we loved it. The pool was great and the spa was an additional bonus, the ladies working there couldnt have been more helpful and thoughtful. a big thanks to them.",5,2018,04,27
200,Business short stay at the Merrion.,"You get what you pay for in this life, and the Merrion is simply one of the very best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in regularly. The service is consistently excellent and their new facilities are simply gorgeous. The welcoming smell of an open fire and the home from home lounge areas are so enticing.",5,2018,04,26
200,Everything you could wish for in a classy hotel,"I'd never stayed at this hotel before but everything about it was spot on.  From the greeting at the door to the check out the next day, the staff were faultless.  The breakfast was stunning and I'm only sorry I didn't have time to enjoy more of the facilities there.",5,2018,04,25
200,Just Amazing,"The Merrion Hotel was my home for four great nights in April.  When I first checked in, I was feeling way too young.... but the place quickly grew on me.  It seems to draw business account and an older clientele.  But- 36 year old me quickly realized that despite the demographic difference- the place is great!  The room was beautiful, well appointed, cleaned twice daily, complete with the comfiest bed and slippers.  The bathroom had a large soaking tub and a shower.  Bottled water, umbrellas, robes, and power adapters were offered.  The pool and sauna were fabulous. Oh- when the concierge name drops “The Merrion” - you can get in at almost any restaurant in town.  The bar prices are reasonable and the bartenders awesome!  I could not live this place more.  Thank you!",5,2018,04,23
200,Very Impressive,"I was recently very lucky to stay in the Merrion hotel for two nights on business. I knew this was an excellent hotel, but was still impressed by how good it is. The staff are incredible, friendly, helpful and attentive. The location is fantastic, right in the heart of the city with a host of amenities within a short stroll. Even though it's located in the city centre, once you enter the hotel you immediately enter a very relaxed environment. The rooms are spotless, well sized and have an amazingly comfortable bed. Well worth checking it out if staying in Dublin. I really look forward to a return visit.",5,2018,04,23
200,Georgian Luxury in a modern capital,"Can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.  My third time staying in The Merrion did not fail to match my previous experiences.  The ideal place to escape from the hum drum of busy modern life, this hotel is an oasis of luxurious tranquility right in the heart of Dublin.  Staff are welcoming and friendly without being in the least bit intrusive.  The food is wonderful and the wine list is a temptation too hard to resist! Can't wait for my next visit!",5,2018,04,20

The room was spacious, bed comfortable, with the best pillows I ever experienced in a hotel! The food was excellent, again nothing was too much trouble. It was a fabulous experience from start to finish, one we hope to repeat later this year.",5,2018,04,18
200,Best Hotel Ever,"No, seriously, this is the best hotel ever.  From door staff to concierge to room service to housekeeping.  This is literally the best hotel I have ever stayed in.

200,Quality throughout,"From arrival and being upgraded to a suite, to quality of the room itself, to skills of the cocktail bartender everything was top drawer.

I would recommend it highly.",5,2018,04,17
200,Lovely Stay in Dublin,"My daughter and I stayed at the Merrion last week for a long weekend in Dublin. The hotel was absolutely lovely. We arrived very early in the morning to find our room ready and waiting for us, amazing! The room was large and lovely. The concierge was so helpful, both prior to our stay and during, helping us with restaurant reservations and time changes to existing plans. Tea at the Merrion is not to be missed, just delicious and cozy by the fireplace. The location is perfect to walk everywhere in the city.
Thank you to the welcoming and helpful staff, if I ever return to Dublin I would stay nowhere else.",5,2018,04,17

200,Te and little cakes to harp music - quaint!!,This hotel has a terrific reputation and we called in - unfortunately in tourist downbeat gear which seemed not to gain staff approval! However we were served excellent Earl Grey and cakes while the harpist played - elegant rooms and furnishings - a treat!,4,2018,04,17
200,Absolute Gem in the Heart of Dublin,"Had a fab stay here with my baby daughter. We were treated like royalty by all the staff who couldn’t do enough to help us. The hotel was so lovely, it’s hard to believe how big and impressive it was inside from the outside. Breakfast was very tasty. Would highly recommend it if you want to treat yourself for a special occasion in the lap of luxury!",5,2018,04,15
200,Outstanding!,This is an extremely impressive hotel which is in a league of its own.The location is excellent.There is a feeling of warmth and luxury the moment you enter the hotel.The staff are professional but friendly too.The garden in the city is so different and the buildings old and new marry together so well.The food and service is also of a high standard.We have stayed 4 times.The cost is top end but the experience was worth it.,5,2018,04,15
200,Good location,Had never been here before. Got a present of afternoon tea here. The staff were very and helpful. The presentation of the food was very good. The staff explained the food very well. There was one thing that I thought they should have had separate plates to eat your savory and sweet food. It was a very enjoyable experience .,4,2018,04,15
200,"Fantastic Hotel, Better Service ","First time to Dublin and staid at the Merrion. It’s elegant without being snobby.  The hotel is of high quality and comfort, but what makes the hotel is the excellent service from the doormen, reception, bar and wait staff everyone was outstanding.  Several unique bars for that evening nightcap as well.  Great place to stay. ",5,2018,04,13
200,Beautiful hotel and wonderful service,"Family of 5 stayed here for 2 nights at beginning of our 10 day trip around Ireland.  Besides the obvious that the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are luxurious, I was beyond pleased by the service.  While we were there, the staff were so nice and helpful.  However, after we left, the service got better.  We inadvertently left our passports in the room safe.  We did not even realize this - but the manager emailed me right away to let me know. Being on vacation, I didn't check my email until 3 days later when we were already in Killarney and not planning to be back to Dublin until the next week.  The manager - Shahid Malik - was wonderful.  He contacted the hotel where we would be staying the night before departing Ireland and made arrangements for a trusted staff member to deliver our passports to us.  I am so thankful for his care and assistance.  We will always make the Merrion my hotel of choice when in Dublin!",5,2018,04,13
200,Merrion Hotel Dublin,Short and very wonderful stay. We stayed there the night before our departure from Ireland after a 10 day trip.  It was extremely comfortable for that last night when you are exhausted!  Enjoyed the pool and steam room too.,5,2018,04,11
200,"Great Staff, Perfect Location","Brilliant Location! From the moment of arrival you are treated like a King. Staff are really friendly and helpful - there whenever needed but never overbearing.

The hotel is finished to a high end, and everything feels first class. 

You won't regret staying here, you will feel incredibly well looked after no matter the type of stay you have.",5,2018,04,11
200,Beautiful Hotel we had a hard time there,"The Merrion Hotel is beautiful.  The beds are comfortable and the gardens are wonderful.  The location is perfect.  I am giving this hotel a 3 star because I had a couple of issues while I was there.  They put our luggage in another American groups car as we were leaving for a 6 day tour of Ireland.   We did receive them the next night thanks to our driver and The Merrion hotel.  Then I was overcharged a night that I was not in the hotel, The Merrion fixed that as well but it was close to an argument over if I was lying about the night I was not there.  I have never had either problem before in a 5 star hotel.",3,2018,04,10
200,Laid back luxury,"I love this hotel. It is a beautifully cared for period building set in the heart of Dublin. Rooms, food, beverages, service, facilities are all to the highest standard but it does it with not an ounce of pretentiousness. The hotel has a sense of calm and a welcoming charm that comes from its exceptional staff. I would highly recommend it for a stay in Dublin.",5,2018,04,09
200,Just Perfect,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights - Thursday 5th April to Saturday 7th April 2018.

We had originally booked a Superior King Room in the Garden Wing with Garden View.....BUT...we were in for a VERY pleasant surprise!

On checking in with the delightful MS BOBBI at reception, Ms Bobbi asked why we had chosen to stay with them on this occasion so I mentioned we were there for our wedding anniversary. Ms Bobbi explained our room was not quite ready but offered to take us down to the Spa, gym, pool to relax whilst the room was readied for us.

So...we enjoyed the pool and poolside lounges and also the steam room. A short while later '..Your room is ready....you will be pleased to know we have, to celebrate your anniversary with us, UPGRADED you...'

WELL!! We were upgraded to the Colley Suite on the fist floor. Really, really lovely!! Just gorgeous.

No sooner had we started to unpack when a knock at the door: Two lovely little pastries set on a plate upon which was written in chocolate 'Happy Anniversary!'  

We were just constantly overwhelmed, throughout our stay there, at the very high standards of service. Whether the incredible housekeeping staff (my wife had left out a book with a scrap of discarded paper marking her page; we returned after a morning out and a nice new book mark had replaced the scrap of paper) - it was housekeeping Staff member MS HAIDY, I later found out. This was a small thing but we felt very touched by such care and thoughtfulness. 

This hotel is UTTERLY faultless, attentive staff throughout when addressed always dealt with any requests and always ended with '...and is there anything else I can help you with today?.. ' And always with the most sincerest of smiles!

The bed was sumptuous! The pillows: sumptuous! The bathrooms, Italian marble just exquisite! 

We had room service one night to eat in. The service was excellent, the meal was with us within 15 minutes and the guy set the table beautifully for us. The food hot and delicious!!

We had breakfast, on the last morning, downstairs in the Garden Room. Plenty of choice, cooked to perfection and in a lovely elegant room with a relaxing atmosphere.

When writing reviews I always try to portray a series of images that accurately reflect and recall our experiences of those hotels we have stayed at....this one - The Merrion - is the first one where as I go write something, describe something, describe a staff member I simply start to melt a little and sigh...this hotel (I know it is a five star hotel) just gets it right on every single level; it really is just truly perfect. 

If you want a really really special treat when visiting Dublin, do seriously consider The Merrion: the staff there and the facilities were (for us on our 29th Wedding anniversary) just outstanding!!

Thank - you to all at The Merrion for a truly memorable stay!",5,2018,04,09
200,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Merrion in Dublin twice on our spring break tour of Ireland, and it is a gem. Amazingly helpful staff, top notch facilities (incl. pool), excellent food, comfortable (and big rooms) in a beautiful building. They also have a great reservations team through Grand Luxury Hotels (you get assigned an individual, who not only organized everything but found a cheaper rate).  
Oh and on Easter they brought in chicks and a lamb for the kids - nice!",5,2018,04,08
200,Dublin's only true 5 star hotel,"I recently stayed in the Merrion hotel and i was very impressed with every part of my stay. From arrival to departure i could not fault anything. I will most certainly be returning to this hotel next time I am in Dublin. 5 star hotel, service and experience.",5,2018,04,05
200,"Elegant , Warm, & Welcoming. A Class Act.","Hello. We are currently at the hotel and leave tomorrow for New York. We stayed here the first night of our arrival into Dublin and our last night. In between, we visited Dingle, (where we did the Slea Head Drive on Easter), Cliffs of Mohr, and stayed in a real life castle! When we pulled up to this hotel on our first day in Dublin we were met with such a warm welcome.The hotel is warm, with stunning architecture/paintings, fresh flowers and feels as if you are staying at a friend's home. The service is top notch. We all enjoyed the pool at the spa and steam room. It is such a family friendly hotel. Our children are 7 and 10.",5,2018,04,04
200,Magic in the city,"We stayed just one night for an anniversary in the city instead of going down the country. Excellent location in the heart of the city, close to everything. The Hotel itself is elegant with an amazing selection of Art. We had great banter with the door men Robert and David and check in was a breeze. Our room was beautiful and bright, two huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the internal garden, bed was very comfortable and the Asprey toiletries were plentiful.  Any staff members we met were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.   Terrific Irish bar man in the cellar bar who regaled us with tales of his travels while live Irish music played in the background. We would definitely recommend this hotel  - 5 star all the way.",5,2018,04,04
200,Superb!,"A fabulous hotel, with friendly and attentive staff.  A perfect weekend break.  The service we received was second to none, but without being overpowering.  The room was lovely with every amenity necessary.  The Spa is highly recommended too!",5,2018,04,04

200,Spectacular,"This  is a late review from our stay in December 2017 - what an amazing hotel. Very deceptive from the front - a tardis! Wonderful rooms .
EVERY member of staff delivered 5 star service.
The food was sublime.  The pool was great.
The bar in the hotel did the best cocktails and  the best ""old fashioned"" ever.
Everything about this hotel was wonderful and we loved it  and will be back!",5,2018,04,02
200,Magical hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"Staying at the Merrion was a truly wonderful and luxurious experience. The service, rooms, and facilities are all top-notch, and every detail was meticulously looked after. The generosity and hospitality shown by the staff was incredible, and I don't think I've ever stayed in a more comfortable room in my life. I would fly back to Dublin for this hotel alone!",5,2018,04,02
200,Greatest hotel EVER!,You can't go wrong with The Merrion Hotel. Every detail of your stay will be in place. The staff is courteous and helpful. We will surely find an excuse to return to Dublin so we can stay at the Merrion again. One of my top two favorite hotels!,5,2018,04,01
200,Fabulous Stay!,"After a 7 hour red eye flight from the United States, our first stop directly from the airport was the Merrion Hotel at 8 am on a Saturday morning. The front desk couldn’t have been more pleasant and helpful. Our room was not ready so they showed us to the spa where we were told we could relax and freshen up until our room was ready. After relaxing in the spa for about 30 minutes, they came down to retrieve us to tell us our room was ready. The rooms were spacious and clean with tons of amenities. The hotel itself was beautiful. Bottles of water and chocolates were brought upstairs to our room as a welcome. Everyone at the Merrion, from the front desk to the concierge to the bell hops to the doormen to the wait staff at the restaurant couldn’t have been friendlier and over the top hospitable. I only wish we were staying in Dublin for more than one night. Despite our short time in Dublin, we had a wonderful stay at the Merrion and I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,04,01
200,The Best of the Best -- the only question is what hotel is No. 2?,"We landed in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day, and we truly had the luck of the Irish as our travel agent booked us into The Merrion. It is literally impossible to find fault with anything about The Merrion.  We stayed at some great hotels in Ireland, really incredible hotels, but The Merrion doesn't just beat them all, it towers over them.  The room we had was probably the nicest room I've ever had in more than 60 years traveling around the world. Memories of those delicious breakfasts make me want to get on the next plane back to Ireland just to start my day at The Merrion. But as good as the room was, as delicious as the breakfast was, as wonderful as the location was, what we'll always remember more than anything else, is the staff. They are knowledgable and helpful, and so friendly and charming that you just feel so privileged that you're staying at The Merrion.  I was traveling with my wife and my daughter, and the trip we stayed in five hotels throughout Ireland, very similar to our past trips to England, France, Italy, Russia, Scandinavia  and Spain, and, as is our custom, on the flight home we all make a list of our favorite hotels in order of preference.  This is the first time ever that we all agreed as to the ""best"" hotel of the trip, and when we talked about the hotels, each of us said there wasn't any doubt as to which one was the best, The Merrion!",5,2018,03,30
200,Long weekend in Dublin,"What a fabulous city and what a fabulous hotel Near on a perfect 3 nights Clean, efficient hotel and rooms and incredibly courteous and friendly staff A five star experience where nothing is too much trouble",5,2018,03,29
200,Delightful,"Stayed just after St Patrick’s Day and the service was impeccable.  Arrived by car the concierge took the keys and arranged valet parking.  Shown to our room in person which was perfect, well laid out with complementary water.  The swimming pool and facilities were spotless with clean laundered towels and complementary razors and assorted extras plus fresh crisp apples etc.  The bar area had a lovely atmosphere cocktails were well presented as was the Guinness.  We had an evening meal in the Garden restaurant and the steaks on the bone were cooked to perfection chips had their skin left on when we would have preferred traditional chunky chips without but minor issue as they tasted fine.  Service was impeccable my only issue was the closeness of the adjoining tables which hampered privacy.  Breakfast was delicious with freshly squeezed juice and fresh natural honey.  Service was prefessional and polite nothing was too much.  Definitely will be back.",5,2018,03,28
200,Exquisite,"I cannot say enough amazing things about this hotel.  From the decadence of the spa and pool to the luxury of the rooms, it's absolutely lovely.  After an overnight flight, we arrived way too early for check-in, however we were able to delight in the spa amenities, take a post-flight swim in the pool, shower and refresh long before our room was ready.  The staff was superb, from the car service to room service.  I'd give it 6 stars if we could!",5,2018,03,27
200,Amazing Weekend,"This hotel has everything needed for a romantic Dublin getaway.   However, what wins my heart is their staff and their incredible food.   From the gardens to the hotel facilities, everything you need  is within the grounds without needing to venture out into the real world ! :)",5,2018,03,27
200,the top of the line,"Merrion is one of the best and comfortable hotels I have ever stayed in.  From the moment we walked in to the time we left it was an extreme pleasure to stay.  It is worth every penny!  Sophisticated, under stated, friendly, superb!",5,2018,03,27
200,Nice Hotel with a Few Issues,"The Merrion is a nice hotel in the heart of Dublin.  
The rooms are nice but could use a few updates for modern travelers.  The beds and pillows are very comfortable.  The service is outstanding.  The breakfast buffet is a nice continental breakfast.  The pool is nice.  I'm not sure if it is part of the hotel or not but the restaurant in the basement (the Cellar) is very good.

The downsidescare that the rooms do not have enough outlets, no ubs ports, and no outlets in the bathroom.  Lack of outlets and UBS is pretty standard at boutique hotels but it's time to get them.  The biggest issue is the heater/air conditioning controls.  The controls are circular dials with a plus and minus marking on them with no reference to actual temp.  Our group had 5 rooms and everyone thought the rooms were too warm.  My personal room I ended up turning the temp all the way down and opening the window to make theroom comfortable.",4,2018,03,27
200,Understated elegance,"Some say you get what you pay for and while The Merrion is expensive, the quality of service and attention to detail is worth it. Understated elegance and the best city centre location puts 'The Merrion' firmly at the top of best hotels in Dublin. Highly recommended.",5,2018,03,27
200,One of my favorite hotels in the world!,"My husband and I traveled the world and we both agree The Merrion is World Class! Last week we visited Dublin for just 48 hours and it was our 4th time staying at The Merrion Hotel. We cant't say enough about the experience in terms of beauty, style and absolute professionalism of the entire staff from check-in - where we received an upgrade to room #185 with massively hight ceilings, a quiet garden view and easy exit access to the concierge who helped sort out dinner plans and the always smiling attitude of a happy and gracious place. The bar is inviting and timeless, the service impeccable! The bedding is to die for, all the details are first rate! We love you guys! Will return soon!",5,2018,03,26
200,Afternoon Tea,"A very comfortable and relaxing afternoon tea with lots of good food in central Dublin. 

The hotel was very busy. 

Comfortable clean and a nice atmosphere.

200,Merrion Hotel stay March 10 thru 13 2018,"We had an excellent experience all-around.  Staff was very helpful and friendly, rooms were great, meals were very good.

200,Another reason to return,"This hotel surpasses any other I’ve had to pleasure to experience in Dublin. Each year it builds on the outstanding reputation and delivers such a memorable stay for us - staff, surrounding, sleep and all that goes with it - 5 stars everytime ",5,2018,03,21
200,Exceptional Service,"A most wonderful experience staying at the Merrion Hotel, Dublin, the staff, reception,porters,room service and breakfast were nothing short of outstanding. The finer detail to the simple things, particularly in the bedroom, had to been to be believed.",5,2018,03,21
200,The Place to Shelter In Place During The Beast From The East,"If you're forced to shelter in place during the worst blizzard to hit Dublin since 1982, then I highly recommend The Merrion. We were here for seven nights the first week of March, and the hugs we gave the staff upon departure were heartfelt. Let me give a breakdown, in no particular order:

Rooms: We stayed in a garden view room. It was very nice, well-appointed, lots of amenities generously replenished daily. For Americans, there are plenty of adaptors if you forget yours -- or just want a really good one. 

Spa: What a staff. They let me hang out there in a chair, lounging, during the curfew. Brought me anything I wanted and even gave me a tutorial/sampling of hand and face creams. A special shout-out to Alice, who went way above and beyond.

Room Service: With the exception of the steak sandwich, which isn't all that, we enjoyed all of our room service meals. The pasta of the day was great each time I had it - so well done and with some imagination on the ingredients. 

Shoe Shine: I destroyed my boots in the snow. When I got them back the next morning, they looked even better than when I first got them new. How the back of the house operates is so telling of a hotel's caliber. And shoe shine nailed it.

Garden Cafe: We ate here 8 mornings in a row and one evening. The staff was lovely. The food was outstanding, especially the eggs florentine.

Front Desk: So nice, thank you for being so considerate of the Americans stuck in your hotel and constantly asking for change for tips. 

Concierge: I wish I could remember the name of the man who helped us on our last 2 days - he was so sharp and had such a dry wit. Mary Clare helped us the first 4 days and did her best under very difficult circumstances, as everything was closed due to snow.   

Door Men and Bell Staff: It's really nice to be greeted warmly, even though one is in transit and they have no idea if they'll ever see us again. Next time, though, I'm going to show you how people from Chicago and Boston shovel snow...please get a real snow shovel!

Housekeeping: How can we thank you for all your work, especially when the storm surge caused our bathroom to flood? You organized everything and made it a delight to spend time in the room.

Suffice to say, we'll be staying at The Merrion the next time we're in Dublin - and it can't come too soon.",5,2018,03,20
200,fabulous stay.,"I highly recommend that, if possible, you experience this wonderful hotel. the décor is magnificent but very comfortable and welcoming. Although everything is of the highest quality you weren't afraid to squash a cushion!  The staff are discreet, attentive and more importantly friendly. Every person spoke to us every time. If a simple ""good morning"" was all you had in mind, then that was fine, if you wanted  information or a bit of a blarney then that was o.k  too. We had a beautiful garden room. This was wonderfully comfortable and spotless. The maid did a lovely job of keeping it this way.",5,2018,03,20
200,Great property in a great Dublin loction.,We were only here for a night but the room and staff were excellent.  A very special hotel with extraordinary public rooms and beautiful art adorning the walls.  The fact that Ireland's best restaurant is accessible through a side door was also wonderful.  Having a cocktail in the lounge with a fire and comfortable chairs was a wonderful way to spend some time before dinner.,5,2018,03,16
200,Fantastic hotel - highly recommended,I stay at the Merrion from time to time on business and always find it very comfortable with great service. The location is particularly fantastic with all the city centre amenties on the doorstep. Highly recommended!,5,2018,03,15
200,sublime experience,"A wonderful hotel, with lots of character and history, very relaxing, lots of old paintings and the rooms are immaculate.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  It is very close to the city centre of Dublin located in a lovely area of the City.",5,2018,03,14
200,Perfectiin Done Right,"It was our first stay in Dublin and we enjoyed our stay at the Merrion Hotel.   The room was very clean.  Very comfortable beds and a generous size bathroom was a pleasant surprise.   The food at the Garden Restaurant and the drinks at the Cellar Bar was stellar.   Yes, this property is expensive, but you won’t be disappointed.  ",5,2018,03,14
200,"Stellar, incredibly posh, impeccable - indeed a 5 Star!","Wow!  This hotel hits absolutely every mark!  The Merrion is incredibly posh and every detail is truly impeccable.  The service is truly top notch.  The experience is luxurious and exquisite.  The staff are all attentive, warm and kind.  The Merrion truly helped to make our Dublin experience the special and memorable!  ",5,2018,03,13
200,An absolutely wonderful Dublin welcome!,"The moment you step through the doors of this stunning Georgian property, the hustle and bustle of Dublin fades away and you feel like you have returned to the home of a really good family friend...albeit a very wealthy friend, with great taste in art and a classic eye for design.  The Garden room is an oasis in the real sense of the word.  The Cellar Bar feels like it was designed by someone who really knows the meaning of getting off the beaten track...and the lunch we enjoyed was pretty special too...simply but elegantly prepared comfort food which set us all up for an afternoon at the Aviva.  Dinner in Patrick Guilbaud was flawless and fantastic in equal measure. Yet for all these splendid things it was the charm and warmth of the magnificent staff that made our visit...nothing was too much trouble, everyone genuinely wants to make sure that you are enjoying every second of your stay...and I mean everyone...whoever is responsible for the training in The Merrion is a wizard.  You will get no warmer or more genuine welcome in Dublin.",5,2018,03,12
200,Mother’s Day Lunch,"Booked a table for 2 just for my mother and myself on Mother’s Day. Decided a lunch just for the women was in order. I had requested a table overlooking the gardens at the Garden Restaurant at the Merrion Hotel and they delivered a perfect table. We started with champagne. Served lovely sourdough bread. Both of us had the ceviche which was fresh and tasted like the sea. I had the Dover Sole which was exquisite. My mother had the traditional roast beef. Best roast potatoes she has eaten and she is an exceptional cook herself. The meat was very tender and perfectly cooked medium rare ( unusual in Ireland) . Service was good except at  this type of restaurant I don’t expect to have to top up the wine. That is my only complaint. And a lovely gift of exceptional chocolates handmade by the Merrion chefs was given to us. Those were guzzled by one of my sons. Fiona was excellent and warm in looking after us but I wonder why they don’t have a sommelier in attendance. I will go back as the food is excellent, the location relaxing and the menu is extensive. So worth a visit...",5,2018,03,12
200,Brilliant treat in absolute luxury,"Enjoyed a very nice treat last Friday – afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel.  This is a beautiful and very classy hotel, right in the heart of Dublin.  It is exquisitely decorated and furnished, and the treats served at the Art Tea are influenced by the many artworks which adorn the walls of the hotel.  Each food offering is explained by a staff member, and whilst a lot of it went over our heads, we did enjoy tasting the delicious morsels.  They were quite small, which is just as well, because we filled up rather quickly, so rich were the offerings.  Don’t fret though, because the cakes that are remaining will be put in a little bag for you to take home.  It did feel that the sweet options far outweighed the savouries, so we were suffering from ‘sugar overload’ the following day too.  The room we were in was beautiful, and there was a young lady playing the harp in an adjoining room.  The chairs that we were on however were rather low, making it a bit uncomfortable to eat as we were almost at eye-level with the table.  Also, one other thing that we thought was strange – nobody offered to take our coats, so we had to either drape them across the back of our chairs or fold them onto the back of our chairs, making things just that wee bit awkward. Other than that, it was a lovely occasion, surroundings were fabulous and service second to none. They really do know how to look after people here.  It is an expensive place (but we were lucky enough to receive a gift of the afternoon tea for a special occasion) and not the sort of thing you would do regularly – unless you re mortgaged your house!",5,2018,03,12
200,Only place to stay in Dublin!,We have stayed at The Merrion now for our last 4 trips to Dublin and its the only hotel we will stay at now. The accommodations are superb and the staff pays attention to every detail. We love it there and cannot wait to go back!,5,2018,03,12
200,Top 5* hotel in Dublin,Excellent true 5 star hotel in Dublin.  Very well located in the center.  Excellent service and attention to detail.  Breakfast qualit was of the highest level.  Rooms extremely clean.  Nice that they had a pool.,5,2018,03,12
200,Unmatched in quality,"The Merrion never disappoints, providing a welcoming environment without being pretentious.  The best service by every member of the staff one could ever expect, and reliably reproducible upon every occasion of visiting the Merrion. One of our favorite hotels to visit in the world.",5,2018,03,10
200,The best ever,"Not sure where to start... this is a spectacular hotel .... service, decor, comfort, food... the list goes on... 
excellent location and incredible staff... I am gushing, but words truly fail me.. huge congratulations to the GM..",5,2018,03,09
200,The Merrion- the Dublin Hotel Highlight,"A spectacular place for a stay in Dublin.
Its location, the rooms, the Garden Room restaurant (NEW) and its lounge and bar areas portray the feeling of Ireland at its best . A most intimate and homey  place  with exquisite art in halllways and and public spaces  . The fire place will burn (real wood)  even if the outside temperature would not require it. 
The fairly recent and modern (architectural)additions and expansion blend in perfectly.  Service is extraordinary attentive .The breakfast buffet and service has been moved to the Garden Room with open views to the small but well manicured garden and reflecting pool. Must be spectacular in summer time with open windows and sunshine (check the weather report, though !). A most unique and wonderful hotel!

Please note that I have regularly visited this place for many years and never felt I should write a review. After completion of their (not always pleasant) renovation/additions over the past years I now do believe it’s time to share my review!",5,2018,03,07
200,Decade t,"Check in and out yourself in the hands of some world class professionals. From start to finish our stay was superb. The bar has a great atmosphere night or day and the choice of food on offer is perfection.
Go, stay, relax and forget what’s outside.",5,2018,03,05
200,Modern luxury with an eighteenth century facade,"The Merrion Hotel has a frontage of four Georgian houses on the street, the ground floors of which are used as bars and sitting rooms. Most of the bedrooms are round a courtyard in what would have been the gardens of the houses. The bedroom block is modern, which means that the rooms and bathrooms are all a good size. Two things make the hotel outstanding. One is the art collection: the owners are passionate about art, especially Irish art, and the pictures are hung throughout the hotel, as they would be in a private house. The other is the helpfulness of the staff and their pride in the hotel. And they are all knowlegdeable about the art collection: in the entrance hall there is a painting by an artist I recognised, and the doorman - whose job is simply to open the door - told me that if I went into a particular room, I would see another painting by the same artist.

One annoyance was that an alarm went off in one of the apartments at the top of the hotel. It was fixed eventually.

The hotel is not cheap; but then, Dublin generally is an expensive city.",5,2018,03,04
200,Fabulous meal,I recently had a sublime dinner with family at the Merrion hotel.  The food was superb; tasty; generous portions; served at the best temperature.  The wait staff was attentive without being intrusive.  The atmosphere was lovely.  The restaurant was full but you could talk without straining.  The tables were far enough apart for privacy.  Can't say enough good things about the place,5,2018,03,03
200,Best 5 star hotel Dublin,"The Merrion Hotel experience is all about the wonderful team who look after you. Their genuine care twined with their whit and charm make this hotel the best in Dublin. The Shelbourne Hotel is second. The Merrion is more like Mayfair and the Shelbourne Hotel is more like Chelsea if you get what i mean.  As 5 star hotels go, Dublin is nowhere to be seen in the world stage. There revenues are tiny compared to the large operators so don't expect anything special when it comes to the hardware. Lower your expectations when it comes to the facilities and the rooms. But taking the low room rates into account and the wonderful staff i think 5 stars is a fair review.",5,2018,02,26
200,Great hotel,"This is an excellent hotel in the city centre. Great staff quality service and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel . Highly recommend! Decoration is quaint which adds to the character, had room service and breakfast and food was very good. Would definitely return for business or pleasure!",5,2018,02,20
200,"Lovely stay, very attentive service","This is my second stay at the Merrion. I enjoy the combination of old and new world, the excellent service, location and spa facility. The new restaurant (garden room) has been a nice addition. Highly recommended",5,2018,02,20
200,The Real Deal,"Returned to the Merrion for a 3 night stay and it was just as wonderful as I remembered it.  This place epitomises warm hospitality and an efficient attention to detail that makes this possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The hotel was completely full one of the nights we were there, but the same quiet calm pervaded the hotel and my sleep was deep and uninterrupted as it was each of the nights we stayed.   Rooms are spacious and fabulously appointed with everything you can think of needing.   The cleaning staff do a wonderful job refreshing the rooms each day and it was truly a pleasure to come back to the room at the end of each busy day..  I left a 10 euro tip one morning by the bedside but when we returned to the room, it was still there.  The cleaning staff  wouldn't take it it!!!       That is the style of this place. Valet service for our rental car was always quick and efficient -- the car waiting for us at the kerb every time within 5 minutes of our request.  Finally, I realized after I checked out that I had left my retainer behind on my bedstand by accident.  Within 24 hours, they had it forwarded on to me by registered post, free of charge.  I just love this place and would never even consider staying anywhere else while in Dublin.",5,2018,02,20
200,The Merrion is Wonderful,"I returned to The Merrion after many years staying elsewhere. I stayed for four nights last week and it was wonderful. The staff are most accommodating, rooms very comfortable, lovely ambiance and relaxing",5,2018,02,20
200,Hope I can return,"The Merrion is a beautiful, elegant and classic hotel, combined with modern facilities. 
My room was large and beautifully furnished, the bed incredibly comfortable and bathrobe and slippers so soft.
I only stayed one night on business but would love to come back for a weekend with my husband.",5,2018,02,19
200,A Gem,"This truly is one of the gracious, great hotels of the world.  Not ostentatious.  But a place of unbounded hospitality and great competence.  It is not a place to see and be seen.  Rather, it is a place in which one can relax and enjoy not being seen.",5,2018,02,19
200,Great for families too,"Excellent property, great staff who were exceptionally engaging with our 5 year old son. Separate children’s menus and activity book both of 5 star quality.  Pool was deep but they brought out a floatation noodle and ball for our son to use. Music Thursday evening in the Cellar bar.",5,2018,02,18
200,I can see why it's rated no 1!,"Stayed at the Merrion for a meeting last week and had a great experience there.  The hotel staff were excellent throughout, we had a few small issues but these were sorted out quickly and with care and attention which was much appreciated.  

The rooms are very nice and well appointed, lots of little touches to make your stay more comfortable and luxurious.  Huge bathroom with a separate (large) shower which was very nice.  Probably the nicest bathrobe I've had as it was so fluffy and comfortable... 

As stated in other reviews, the bed is SO comfortable!  I found the room a little warm but having the window open a little helped that on the second night.

We all enjoyed the food at the hotel which was very good.  A lovely property if a little of a maze as it is four townhouses put together.  But that means it has lots of character.

Hope we can visit again another time as it was a good visit overall.  Thank you",5,2018,02,16
200,The Merrion Hotel,"Me and my friend stayed for 4 nights..... absolutely wonderful experience... staff is very friendly and very helpful .... room service is excellent, nothing is too much for staff always very happy to help..... bed is very very comfortable !",5,2018,02,13
200,Another fantastic trip,"Yet again the Merrion out performs the rest, we book a last minute stay as a well earned treat and the whole team welcomed us with a smile and true warmth. The new Garden Room resteraunt was excellent , the breakfast is simply the best we have ever experienced.   Cant wait to get back again.",5,2018,02,13
200,What a Hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion in November.. stunning is the only word I can use to describe this beautiful gem. 
The mixture of old town houses and modern additions make this a truly amazing experience. 
The service , staff , and quality of the rooms is exceptional.. five star rating all the way...",5,2018,02,12
200,Lovely classic hotel,"Stayed two nights in October. Loved the understated luxury,staff and room. Less keen on the cellar restaurant either for breakfast or dinner,but this was the last week before the new restaurant was due start operating. Favourite hotel in Ireland.",4,2018,02,12
200,Merrion Dublin = 4.25,"Located just off Stevens Green with great service and friendly staff.  Bathroom has only one sink, not conducive for couples (-.25 points).  Not as close to central shops at the other corner of St. Stevens Green (-.25 pts).  TV too small and limited channel choices (-.25 pts). ",4,2018,02,11
200,Merrion Hotel,Excellent experience. Fabulous friendly and efficient staff from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Dined in the restaurant on the first night for convenience.

200,Wow!!,"Stayed here with my husband as an anniversary celebration the last weekend in January. It is a beautiful hotel, very welcoming and amazing customer service. Breakfast is well worth booking, fabulous eggs Benedict, varied selection of fruits, pastries, cold meats etc.. we stayed in room 310 in the Garden wing, beautiful spacious room with a really comfortable bed. Have stayed in the Shelbourne a few times and enjoyed it, but now that I have tried the Merrion, it is definitely the Merrion I will be booking again for our next trip. Yes this is an expensive hotel but it is worth it for the great location, fabulous service, relaxed atmosphere and wonderful food.",5,2018,02,06

200,Perfection,"Just got back from Dublin. Stayed at the Merrion Hotel (this was our second time ) and it was as wonderful as the last time I was there in 2012. In fact, it is even better. The staff is wonderful, food delish, rooms lovely and spacious and the residents bar (open all night) is a godsend; especially if you have jet lag and are up at 4 am. The location is wonderful, we walked everywhere. The gardens are beautiful as well as their prized art collection. There is a great fitness center and spa/pool. It is the only place I would stay in Dublin. Lastly, the Michelin starred Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, is right next door to the hotel and is just devine! ",5,2018,01,29

200,Just Excellent,"The Best Hotel I have stayed for a while.
Everything was just perfect. From the door men, reception, housekeeping, restaurant and bar all staff was exceedingly friendly, helpful and professional. They all paid attention to details.
Upon arrival the front desk assigns a ""host"" who escorts you to the room explaining all the hotel features. This already was an excellent start. Room was very nice and spacious. 
Walking out of the hotel on a rainy day, no problem the ""door men"" is already waiting for you handing you an umbrella. Wow that is something you don't get in too many places.
Also in the brekafast room the staff is always present and it seems like they can read your mind when it comes to service.
Thanks to all the great employees keep up the good work.",5,2018,01,24

There was a bottle of champagne & fruit in the room by the window with a plate of chocolate chip cookie and 2 cups of milk. A small size robe and slipper for our boy to feel a real guest and not a tag along. The sound proofing in the rooms was great. Never heard another guest while there.

We have also had food at the bar at no 23 which was also just super and the new garden terrace restaurant is definitely our new go to place in Dublin. I could not recommend this hotel enough!! ",5,2018,01,06
200,First class and all class!,Our favorite hotel in the world and justly so.  Everything is first rate and everyone strives to please and take care of your every need. The drawing rooms with their wonderful fireplaces make the atmosphere unique and peaceful when just out the front door lies all the charms of Dublin. A must stay venue that is special!,5,2018,01,06
200,Dublins leading hotel,"Old world charm and luxury with exceptional service standards. A must for anyone looking for an extraordinary retreat int eh heart of Dublin City.  I would highly recommend a stay in the 'old house'. Great for business, couples and family!",5,2018,01,04
200,"Comfort , elegance and value for money , a rare combination","One of the most welcoming , comfortable and relaxing city centre hotels I have ever stayed in . Would strongly recommend and return in a heartbeat . Care and attention to detail outstanding and restaurant excellent .",5,2018,01,04
200,Dinner only review,"We were invited to eat by friends who were staying in the hotel. We ate in the a Garden Room, the true merits of which were somewhat obscured by the fact that it was a December night! Service was very attentive, and ambience pleasant. The food was good as opposed to brilliant, but my main gripe was that it was served warm rather than hot. I suspect that this may be a function of the size of the dining room,  it it was disappointing. If I’d not been a guest I’d probably have sent my meal back.....",3,2018,01,04
200,5 Star Plus Experience,I've stayed at the Merrion Hotel on a number of occasions over the last 4 years and it just keeps raising the bar for exceptional service and quality of accommodation. Relaxed elegance situated in beautiful Georgian Dublin and stroll away from all places of interest positions the Merrion as the number one hotel to enjoy during a visit to Dublin.,5,2018,01,03
200,The Merrion Hotel - a perfect 24 hours,"We had the pleasure of spending 24 hours in the Merrion Hotel and it was a perfect hotel experience in such a busy period. From the helpful and friendly front of house, to the housekeeping staff who helped me when I forgot my room number, to the wonderful food. Well done to the Merrion team, see you soon.",5,2018,01,02
200,"Unrivaled combination of elegance, service, location and comfort! THE best place to stay in Dublin.","We arrived in Dublin very early in the morning. We had arranged for the Merrion to have us picked up and it was very nice to see the driver waiting for us as soon as we exited customs. The hotel was decorated beautifully and made for a very festive December trip. From the check in to check out, everything about the Merrion was incredible. The breakfasts are terrific, and lots of gluten free options makes it especially great for me. The rooms are very clean, well kept and so quiet. We slept very well! We went to both bars - The Cellar and 23. They are very different but both were fantastic. The whiskey flights in 23 are a fun way to taste Irish whiskeys.

Again, service is so good, From housekeeping to bartenders, every single person at the Merrion was committed to making sure our stay was the best it could be.

The location is terrific. Walking distance to restaurants, pubs, Grafton Street, and Saint Stevens Green.

I highly recommend The Merrion. It is well worth a trip to Dublin just to stay there!",5,2018,01,01
200,The only place to stay in Dublin,"Five star experience, from staff to the amenities. Attention to detail is second to none and can't imagine staying anywhere else when in Dublin. Great location, great bars/restaurants/spa. A home away from home.",5,2017,12,31
200,"Top marks, you can’t beat the Merrion","From check in to check out our stay at the Morrison Hotel was beyond our expectations.. The staff were friendly and helpful , you got the feeling they enjoyed their job as the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. We stayed in room 301 which was a balcony room with a garden view. The Christmas lights in the garden and around the hotel added to the romantic and cozy feeling throughout the hotel. Our room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was very big and pristinely cleaned. The stationary was all of a very high standard and the little extras just add to the feeling of luxury and pampering. We ate in the new restaurant with a garden view (very romantic), the menu catered for all tastes with some very tasty vegetarian options. The restaurant staff were professional but not over the top like in some other 5star hotels. The service was excellent and couldn’t be faulted. I looked around to see if there was any areas that hadn’t paid attention to detail but couldn’t find anything. All the staff are immaculately groomed wearing uniforms that fit and were just as clean and perfectly turned out as the rest of the hotel. I’m afraid I didn’t get time to try any of the spa treatments. If I am lucky enough to go back and try one I will certainly write a review 😁. This hotel has earned its stars, treat yourself and try it out.",5,2017,12,31
200,Home away from Home,"We were given a warm welcome when we arrived. Very courteous doorman & bellboy. Then we were personally shown to our room by the front desk manager & all about the room explained.  The impression of the staff was that there was nothing that was too much to ask for! Friendly & engaging.....felt very welcome here in a ""homely"" way. Superb experience.",5,2017,12,30
200,"Wonderful, comfortable visit.  Great spa!","Excellent service.  We got in quite early and the staff worked hard to get us into a room well before the 3pm check in.  A warm, beautiful, relaxed, well run hotel.  My wife had a great massage in the spa with Anchall.",5,2017,12,29
200,Merry Christmas at the Merrion,"This was our second visit to the Merrion. Just as good, if not better than our last visit as the new Garden Room Restaurant is a great addition. We love the location, the understated elegance, the friendly staff and the attention to detail. Will definitely book in again when we are next in Dublin",5,2017,12,28
200,Afternoon Tea,"Recently visited the Merrion Hotel for afternoon tea which was delightful from start to finish, the staff and service was impeccable and we were put right beside a very toasty fire that was regularly topped up with crackling logs to eat our way through three plates of delicious treats - I loved the Mulled Wine Tea it was so fragrant and very drinkable.",4,2017,12,27
200,Fantastic - Just dont stay there if they are doing Afternoon Tea,Fantastic Hotel. BUT you are a 3 class citizen if they are doing afternoon Tea in the Hotel. You cant go for a drink in your own Hotel.So be warned if they are doing afternoon Tea don't stay there.. ... ...,5,2017,12,26
200,"The Garden Room restaurant- calm, good food and lovely ambiance",We had a lovely meal in the Garden Room .The food and wine were beautifully served with no fuss. The setting is very pretty and there was plenty of choice on the menu. Naturally at this time  of the year I went for the turkey and ham. The meat was moist and tender  and was served with seasonal veg and a little copper pot of gravy.The service was friendly and attentive and we weren't rushed. Lovely view of the Christmas lights .,5,2017,12,23
200,The Merrion,Without doubt the best hotel ever. Would highly recommend The Merrion. From the time we walked in to the time we left the staff were most helpful and so friendly. Service was great. Room amazing . Breakfast was not to be missed! Cannot wait to return. 👌🏻😀,5,2017,12,22
200,Very Expensive...,"If you do not mind paying way more Euro for an above average setting then you are fine here. The rooms are OK but expensive for what they are. Free water and chocolate in the room don't make up the expense. It is in an excellent location, but then so is the Shelbourne on St. Stephen;s Green which is where I will stay next time in Dublin. Just to see...
The breakfast was OK - not stellar and for 30 Euro each it should be stellar . The greasy spoon around the corner had more of a breakfast for 6.5 Euro and more flavor... you get the idea. It feels like it is trying to be a Claridges but fails (the afternoon tea tried way to hard) - maybe they should send their staff to Claridges and see how you can charge more and have customers who feel like it was absolutely worth it...? Would I go again? No.",4,2017,12,21
200,Luxury Hotel near Trinity College,"The Merrion is a Leading Hotel located by Merrion Square near Trinity, shopping and restaurants. The hotel rooms are luxurious and quiet. The spa features an indoor pool and the restaurant offers both indoor and patio dining. The staff is extremely helpful and will ensure your Dublin experience is memorable.",5,2017,12,21
200,A real treat.,"What a fantastic experience it was to stay at The Merrion again, I would highly recommend that everyone should put it on their ""To do"" list. Every moment of our stay was wonderful and we cannot wait to return.",5,2017,12,20
200,Outstanding Service,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is certainly among the best I've used anywhere in the world.  Even in comparison with top Asian hotels, the Merrion stands out for quality, thoughtful service, accommodating management and staff, great food and beverage facilities and outstanding ambiance.  The Merrion has become our ""go to"" hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,12,19
200,Watch the Credit Card,The hotel and service are exemplary and world class they got everything right up to taking payment for the bill. You need to experience it to believe it . They took the wrong amount twice then phoned me at home and took the right amount twice £3k for two nights!!!! I had to get on to Visa and cancel the lot and change to one payment myself what a mess!!!!!!!!,2,2017,12,18
200,Beautiful,Stayed for one night with my husband on a Christmas night out this December. We were both very impressed. Staff were very attentive but not over the top. The room we stayed in was not large but was absolutely beautiful with lovely neutral colours. It was so comfortable in every way! The location was perfect. Central yet quiet. Will definitely return. ,5,2017,12,18
200,Superb,"Stayed for short visit in October . From driving up and having car parked to leaving with bottle of water in Car when I drove off, service is absolutely first class.

Check in was quick and efficient and I was shown to my room by check in person, very good touch. Rooms are spacious and have everything you need, and more. Turn down service when you get back to room late is really special.

One of best hotels in Ireland, and for Dublin that’s a real bonus",5,2017,12,17
200,Truly Fantastic Hotel,"The Merrion is a beautiful hotel, well thought out, and extremely well staffed. 

The hotel was decked out in full Christmas decor and it was wonderful.

We quite enjoyed The Cellar, and the breakfast in the mornings at the Garden Room was a great way to start the day.

Highly recommended!",5,2017,12,17
200,"Incredible stay, excellent customer service","Booked to stay at the merrion for an anniversary, everything was lovely from the moment we got to the front steps. Upon check in we were given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite, beautiful spacious room with a very comfortable bed. Every detail is finished to the highest standard and the staff are the most courteous I have ever come across. Will certainly be returning! ",5,2017,12,14
200,A classic star to be preserved. The place to stay in Dublin.,"If you want to experience a classical calm , professional and charming hotel in Dublin you must stay at the Merrion. Perfect for business meetings with a lot of spots for discrete discussions all in a very historically shaped Irich environment. Its one of the few in Europe daring to keep the historical touch.",5,2017,12,13
200,Authentic Ireland,"What a pleasure in every way. The staff are gracious and accommodating. Rooms are clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds and crisp linens. WiFi is free and fast. This is an old building with an unusual floor plan— I think is converted from a residence or perhaps it is two buildings combined. In any case, it adds to the charm. The location is good, with several points of interest within walking distance. I travel to Dublin on business and previously have stayed in the large , chain hotels.  Next time I will return to the Merrion.",5,2017,12,13
200,Favorite hotel in Dublin ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"I traveled through the south of Ireland for a week and saved the Merrion for my last night. What a special treat! The concierge found a restaurant that met the dietary needs of all my guests (Roly’s), then helped make the reservations and transportation arrangements. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday and the service was wonderful. Thank you Merrion ♥️",5,2017,12,12
200,Lovely hotel,"We stayed in room 304 which is a lovely queen room with spacious bathroom.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was cleaned well twice a day.  The location is perfect, right next to the Oscar Wilde statue in Merrion Square and a very short walk to Grafton St for shopping.  The only issue was on the last night there was a smell of smoke in the room which appeared to be drawn in from outdoors.  We notified concierge and guest relations but just ended up turning off the vent and opening the windows.  Luckily, the situation improved.  The view from this room was not a pleasant one, buildings with weeds growing out of the roof.",5,2017,12,12
200,Exceptional Hotel,"Our recent stay at the Merrion Hotel was exceptional from start to finish. From our dealings with the outstanding Stacy in reservations and the wonderful welcome from Bobbi in reception to checking out following a delicious breakfast in the Garden Room, with the whole Patrick Guilbaud experience in between. If you want to experience an hotel stay that can only be described as phenomenal then The Merrion is the hotel for you.",5,2017,12,09
200,Art themed high tea,"You will always get wonderful service at this hotel. We had high tea here, as a group of 8 people, and we were made to feel special. The cakes were good, although maybe a little too rich. And, we all devoured the sandwich selection. Your waiter/waitress will explain how each miniature cake, you’re served, is inspired by a painting in the hotel. ",5,2017,12,09
200,Consistent Excellence,Another trip with service beyond expectations. Have sent many reviews complimenting the hotel staff and expressing my enormous satisfaction with the accommodations. The renovations and new location of rah restaurant are fabulous. Well Done!,5,2017,12,08
200,Peter's :Place,"Home away from Home !  The staff is always pleasant and eager to accommodate. The new remodel  elevates the experience without becoming just another cookie cutter Dublin Hotel. The ambiance of the smaller hotel is definitely a step above the hustle of the larger hotels,  AND its just a few blocks from FX Buckley Steak House :",5,2017,12,08
200,Outstanding,"The Merrion is one of my favourite hotels in the world. The property, service and ambiance are outstanding. Nothing is too much trouble. The swimming pool is fabulous and I love my visits to Dublin because of this hotel.",5,2017,12,08

200,the merrion at christmas,we spent a single night at the hotel on the way home from county Laois. it is to be recommended in every way. the room was exceptional and better than its pictures that guided us to it during the booking process,5,2017,12,02
200,Excellent stay,"From the moment of arriving at the hotel you felt from that point onwards everything would be taken care of and was. A warm welcome, luggage immediately taken care of, friendly and efficient front desk staff, nice escort to our room which was prepared for our arrival (pet peeve of arriving late to a hotel and going into a dark room), bags arrived immediately and the stress of our travels melted away. Large guestroom, well appointed, warm and lots of character. Staff were brilliant in anticipating needs.

Great location, I actually prefer to be a bit away from the Green and Grafton street but close enough. 

I did not have a lot of time to research the hotel beforehand which in this case was good because dinner at the Garden Room was superb, beautiful design and fantastic food and service.

Haven stayed at what I would imagine their competition, Westbury, Shelbourne, Conrad in my opinion I feel that the Merrion is the best in Dublin.

Highly recommended and hope to have the opportunity to stay again.
",5,2017,12,01
200,High class experience from a family friendly hotel,"My husband, one year old son and I stayed overnight at The Merrion this past Tuesday and from the moment we pulled up to the hotel, we were treated with a first class experience. I was a bit nervous about staying at a 5 star hotel with a one year old but my worries were immediately put to rest by the very kind staff at the door and front desk who both went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our room was beautiful and they even left milk and cookies out for our arrival. They also left a small robe for my son on his crib which was such a cute touch. We asked a staff member if he could show us where the pool was and he went out of his way to include a short tour of the cellar restaurant and bar which I would recommend everyone visiting as it's a piece of history in itself.
We decided to have dinner at the cellar restaurant and again I was a bit nervous about  bringing my son but once again the staff went out of their way to make us feel right at home. One woman even brought a coloring book and a balloon for my son to play with while we were waiting for our food. 
Overall, I have to say The Merrion went above and beyond my expectations. I have stayed in several nice hotels in Dublin but nothing compares to our experience with The Merrion. It is expensive, but the kindness of the staff and the beautiful facilities are worth it. We will definitely be staying at The Merrion the next time we are in Dublin. Thank you so much to all the staff there for our wonderful experience!",5,2017,12,01
200,Very Enjoyable,I try to stay at the Merrion when I am in Dublin.  The accommodation and service are great!  They have wonderful spa which provides a good way to wind down if you arrive on an early flight and your room is not yet ready.  The bar has a great old world feeling and is very well stocked.,5,2017,11,30

200,Luxury hotel in quiet location in central Dublin,"We have stayed several times in this lovely hotel. If you arrive by car the hotel staff will park it in their secure underground car park. The staff in reception are friendly and efficient. The rooms at the rear overlooking the garden are lovely. Quiet with pleasant outlook they are spacious and extremely well equipped with ironing board & iron, safe, hairdryer etc.
We had breakfast in the new restaurant on the ground floor which is pleasant and much nicer than the old cellar restaurant. I particularly liked the whole honeycomb set on the buffet table.",5,2017,11,28
200,The greatest hotel ever,"Our experience at The Merrion was amazing. The rooms were beautiful, the staff friendly and attentive and the personal touches thoughtful.

I love it here!",5,2017,11,25
200,Breakfast,"I went there for breakfast as I had to go to my embassy nearby. I ordered a very expensive fruit salad, but when it came I could see it was very big, it could have been for 2 people and it was made to order so very fresh. It is a nice hotel well decorated with professional staff.",5,2017,11,25
200,A wonderful expoerience right in the heart of the city,We really enjoyed our stay in the Merrion Hotel. We had a fabulous room. The service was friendly and efficient and we could not speak highly enough about the staff. We enjoyed the food and  the ambience of the cellar bar. We will also never forget the memorable food experience we had at Restaurant Patrick Guildbaud for lunch.,5,2017,11,24
200,Outstanding Stay,"Just incredible- friendly staff, beautiful room, celebrity guest hotspot. The cellar bar is a lovely hideout also. Will definitely stay again.

200,Excellent experience in every way,"I found the entire experience worthy of praise in almost every way possible. From the start, highly professional and polite staff. Which is not always the case in hotels, but here from the doorman to reception to bar staff to the maid, everyone was able to assist and went out of their way to make it an enjoyable experience. The complimentary glass of champagne sent up from the spa to augment the already relaxing evening post body massage was a nice personal touch. Room service food and service was unparalleled and it set me up for a restful night's sleep. The room as spotless and the bed extremely comfortable. I found the entire surroundings comfortable, luxurious and pleasant. Everything was perfect except that I only had one night and could not stay to enjoy a bubble bath or to eat breakfast or do the Art tour. I imagine they would have been equally enjoyable from what I could see. Well done on such a high quality hotel experience to be had in Dublin. It was like being in London or any other major city but the Irishness of the conversations were unique.",5,2017,11,23
200,Dublin's Best,"Absolutely the best hotel in Dublin , with perfect location and magnificent service we enjoyed our trip to Dublin mainly because of our comfortable accommodation 
 
luxurious and comfortable rooms , attentive service , good food and very prompt and friendly staff.
we have stayed in other five stars hotels in Dublin but this one is undoubtedly the best",5,2017,11,23
200,Garden Room at the Merrion,"I spent Friday evening at the new restaurant (Garden Room) and it was excellent! A quick cocktail at the bar was followed by dinner in the most beautifully decorated room! Our waitress was really nice - an Italian who chatted to us about our trips around Italy. The food was excellent and the wine delish. Best bit? The desert - the soufflé :)

Highly recommended on the basis of good quality food, service and ambiance. Very relaxing restaurant that will leave you feeling pampered!",5,2017,11,22
200,Great place in Dublin,This is a great property. It's well located has great rooms and a great staff.  The rooms are spacious with very nice bathrooms. The property is wonderful and the casual dining in the Cellar is very good.  We will stay here again for sure.,5,2017,11,21
200,One of the Leading Hotels of the World,"I selected this hotel because it was rated as one of the Leading Hotels of the World. Whenever a hotel gets such a high accolade, it sets a high bar for my expectations. This hotel did not reach the bar. It was a very stuffy hotel. It is an old school hotel with traditional decor. The decor did not appeal to me. Perhaps I am just not into Irish style. It felt too out of fashion for me. The service was average compared to what I expected. The rooms were average size. The garden was okay. I do not see why it was listed on the Leading Hotels of the World List. I have stayed at much nicer hotels. The location was a little out of the way.",3,2017,11,19
200,Best Hotel in Dublin...one suggestion ,"The Merrion is easily the best hotel in Dublin...sophisticated, elegant and timeless.  I live in Dublin so frequent the bar and restaurant regularly.  The only suggestion I would make is that the service in the hotel’s bar is consistently slow.  Its next to impossible to get someone to come and take your order...I think they need more more people working the room.  Other than that, I love the Merrion! ",5,2017,11,19
200,Love the new Garden Room Restaurant,"Visited as a group of 6 for lunch in the newly opened Garden Room.  The decor is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to visit when it is sunny.  We started off by sharing a few appetizers and snacks. The fritto misto and steak tartare were the stars of the show.....until the mains arrived. The black sole was heavenly, and even though it wasn't my dish, there was enough to share.  My veal was divine, as was the lamb and lemon sole.  Cheese boards to follow, all washed down with a glorious Malbec....and perhaps a couple of ports.  Best dining experience this year!",5,2017,11,17
200,Faultless luxury hotel,"The operation was slick from reservation (by phone) to checking out and everything in between. The professionalism/knowledge/approachability of all staff was apparent and we had a throughly enjoyable stay. Yes, The Merrion is expensive but then so are all hotels in Dublin but I felt the experience was worth paying that bit extra for.",5,2017,11,16
200,Great experience,I recommend the Merrion mostly because of the location and the great service. The bedding is so comfortable. Among the best beds I ever slept in. I would certainly stay at the Merrion again on a future visit of Dublin,5,2017,11,16
200,Fabulous Hotel,Excellent Hotel in a perfect location - close to St Stephen's Green with plenty of quality bars and restaurants close by but the Hotel itself is wonderfully calm.  Staff are professional and friendly. Rooms are beautifully appointed and clean.  The best Hotel we have stayed at in Dublin. We will certainly return.,5,2017,11,15
200,Lap of luxury,The best door staff ever - helpful and cheerful even though we hadn’t reserved a parking space. Room was on the small side but perfectly formed with in room amenities incl iron and hairdryer. Nice spa although quite a small pool and seating area.,5,2017,11,14
200,A fantastic place in an unbeatable location,"We truely enjoyed our stay. Amazing staff, very welcoming and professional, a beautiful place I. A very central but not noisy location. The pool is very big, the new breakfast restaurant bright and serving excellent food, including options for allergy sufferers. We will definitely return. ",5,2017,11,14

200,An amazing amazing experience,Stayed in hotel for three days on a business trip to Dublin. Had an amazing experience. Staff went out of way to make stay enjoyable and I felt like a valued customer although I was my first time at the hotel. ,5,2017,11,12
200,In a league of its own,"The best way I would describe the Merrion Hotel is old world elegance with modern conveniences and  impeccable service. From the moment we arrived and they valet parked my car, took my luggage and I was escorted to reception for Check In, I knew it was something special. The reception area is full of wing backed chairs and open fires with people reading papers and drinking hot chocolate ( at least they are in my head) Our room was a suite called The Merrion Suite and it is one of the most beautiful rooms I have ever been in. Breakfast was gorgeous and the staff are head and shoulders above most I have encountered, you can eat from the buffet or their is also a hot menu. My poached eggs were cooked to perfection and all the teapots and cutlery are silver with crisp white linen to add to the air of luxury. Breakfast was incredibly busy so if you don't want to queue you had better arrive before 10am.  If you style is contemporary this hotel may not be for you as the Merrion is all floral curtains and pelmets but the service is some of the best I have experienced and no request is a bridge too far for their concierge. After two nights in the Merrion, I am genuinely reluctant to ever go home to my 'boring' house again. I will most definitely return and in the interim I will tell everyone that listens what a truly superb hotel this is smack bang in the centre of Dublin City.",5,2017,11,12
200,Wonderful Stay!,We stayed for just one night at the Merrion in our travels to Dublin recently and the only issue was that it was only one night! We were greeted curbside by a wonderful gentleman who handled the car parking and luggage. We were greeted personally when we walked in the hotel and were told upon check in that we had been upgraded to a suite!  The room was gorgeous with all the modern amenities one could think of. It was so nice that it was hard to leave the room to explore the city on the one night we had. Everyone that worked at this hotel was extremely helpful and so very friendly. I would not hesitate staying here again when visiting Dublin.,5,2017,11,12
200,Great business stay,This hotel impressed from arrival to check out. Staff friendly and happy to help out with anything. Can't wait to visit again. This hotel and staff would ensure a great time heather it's business or pleasure. ,5,2017,11,11
200,Very smart,"Great experience, checked in and escorted to room... that is proper.
Large rooms, very comfortable.
Excellent service in the cellar bar with great food and excellent wines by the glass. 
Would not hesitate to return.

200,A real touch of class in the heart of Dublin,A warm inviting reception at The Merrion Hotel. Beautiful old buildings and world class arteork. Room was super luxurious with great facilities even an Nespresso machine and luxury chocolates to help you wind ! New dining room is so relaxing and breakfast with such a selection was top quality. Honey fresh in its honeycomb wasespecially delicious !,5,2017,11,08
200,Wonderful overnight stay on an Autumnal day in Dublin,"Truly a luxurious experience right in the heart of Dublin .Everything about this Hotel is 5 star but very welcoming and not at all stuffy.  The attention to detail displayed by staff, the wonderful courtyard garden and the works of art on all the walls all added to the occasion",5,2017,11,07
200,One of the best hotels I've ever gone,"I stayed for two nights in this hotel, and I must say, that this is the first time I havent seen anything wrong in a hotel

The level of detail and attention are incredible, everything is just perfect.

The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.

Everyone in this hotel were really kind and helpful.

I didn't have the chance to try the swimming pool but I must admit that it looks really nice.

This hotel is recommended 100%.

",5,2017,11,07
200,No words,"Well, what can I say. An absolutely stunning hotel in every sense of the word. From check in to check out. I’ve travelled all over the world and this place is hard to beat. I don’t know what to write other than. Stay, stay, stay.... amazing. Just book. Just do it. Would I return... mmmm ... I’ve just booked me and my wife for next month. Thank you.",5,2017,11,06
200,Excellent hostess for a long weekend stay,"The hotel is located in the posh area of South Dublin, walking distances to all major sites, including the Guinness factory if you're up getting >10k steps! Enjoyed the breakfast and impressed by the excellent service provided by the waitors. If you're a fan, give the hotel spa a go, a very nice way to wind down at the end of the day and get a glow ready for the next day! 
The only minor downside I would say, great swimming pool (good size and environment), the gym, however, could do with an upgrade.",5,2017,11,06
200,Quick stay,Only there for a night but hotel was beautiful. Friendly staff and very helpful. Location is great. Room was spotless and bathroom was beautiful. Decent size room too for a Dublin City hotel. Will be back.,5,2017,11,05
200,Beyond compare,"This is the most amazing hotel.  It is in the centre of Dublin and within easy reach of the many shops, bars and restaurants. The rooms are decorated beautifully and the beds, pillows and bed linen are perfect. However, what makes this hotel beyond compare is the staff. Without exception, they are the most courteous and efficient I have ever come across. There is minute attention to detail and absolutely nothing is too much trouble. Will definitely come back.",5,2017,11,03
200,"Incredible building, experience and people.","Seriously one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at, and I have stayed in premier hotels all over the world.
The service was exemplary, the location and structure were magnificent and the people were charismatic and so helpful. They anticipated every need. Don’t miss out if you travel to Dublin!",5,2017,11,02
200,Classic,"Simply gorgeous hotel and staff. We arrived very early in the am and were pleasantly surprised to find our room was upgraded and ready for us. Later on in the am, a lovely birthday gift was delivered which consisted of a lovely fruit box and chocolate, which was very much appreciated especially since the fruits were healthy and delicious. 
The room was beautiful, spacious, and clean and I had trouble getting out of bed because the bed was so comfortable. Loved the classic Georgian feel of the room. 
The afternoon tea experience was also wonderful, especially since the chef had an interesting take and perspective on the desserts. The sandwiches and treats were unique and tasty for my vegetarian palate. It's nice to see the afternoon tea had its own unique touch, as opposed to many other afternoon tea places that consist of very average and overpriced treats! 
The hotel is filled with surprises, from beautiful paintings to beautiful gardens to beautiful pool. Every corner that I saw was well maintained and I wish I had seen the garden during the day! The night views are still very beautiful. 
When we checked out, our takeaway breakfast was already sitting in the taxi waiting for us. All the doormen were super friendly and helpful! 
I had an overall wonderful one night stay at the Merrion and really wished I could have stayed longer. I will definitely be back at this hotel and will gladly recommend the hotel to friends and family! 
Stay beautiful Merrion family!",5,2017,10,30
200,Superb with one exception,"This hotel is among the most beautiful and well appointed in the world.  Unfortunately, our request for an airport taxi for international departure was not booked.  But for calling to confirm our wake up call, we would have been scrambling for a taxi before an international flight.  Given the level of service evident throughout this hotel, I think this was a genuine oversight, but at an establishment of this reputation, it does indicate room for improvement.",5,2017,10,29
200,Beautiful hotel,"Located on Upper Merrion Street, this hotel is centrally located and convenient.
Staff friendly and helpful.
Beautiful garden. Excellent breakfast in the Garden Room restaurant.
Self-guided art tour gives insight into many Irish artists' work.
Enthusiastic spa staff
Highly recommend

",5,2017,10,29
200,A disappointing anticlimax to Ireland,"We stayed at the Merrion in 2015 twice, appreciating the warmth and care of the staff, the Garden wing room overlooking the Garden courtyard, the drawing room, the doormen. The hotel has significantly expanded and upgraded since then, with a new restaurant about to open. In our opinion the culture has also significantly changed. Apart from the welcome at the door by Tommy and David, our 'Garden room' looked out on a wall with Fitness centre windows, and rubbish bins below. Drawing room younger staff smiled nicely but rather timidly, seemingly fearful of getting something wrong. There was no recognition of prior stay. Reception staff seemed stiff, even indifferent. It seems not now in the cultural ballpark of The Merchant or Marlfield. Others may find differently.",5,2017,10,28
200,Unparalleled ,"If you can, stay at the Merrion. The level of service, atmosphere and facilities are unparalleled in Dublin. The spa is great too and I can highly recommend the overnight shoe shine service too. 

The staff are so helpful; the restaurant is good too. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2017,10,28
200,Best Hotel I was ever in.,Myself and my wife overnighted during the week.....we arrived to a lovely warm welcome ...our room was beautiful ....these georgian houses are full of character...we had dinner in The Cellar.....nice atmosphere here and impeccable service...we shared The seafood tower.....I recommend this dish.....don't have a starter ...house red was lovely....raspberry soufflé to finish....fab evening in the bar open turf fire ....breakfast next morning was a feast ...eggs benedict with all the trimmings..5 star service here too.....wonderful time.,5,2017,10,28
200,The best in Dublin,"I do travel quite frequently to Dublin and I try to stay at the Merrion, Shelbourne or Westbury.....but must say that The Merrion is my favourite one....with margin. Stayed there just for one nightd becauase organised a business dinner at the Merrion for 20 clients and made total sense to use the hotel for my overnight stay.

The service and attention during our dinner was amazing. Had a private room for the dinner and everything went according to plan.  Great food, wine and service.

To the hotel itself......great, as usual. Amazing room, spacious, clean, well equipped,.....all of this supported by a great staff.

Honestly, there is not much to think here, The Merrion is ""the"" place in Dublin....and  ranks top 10 among the best ones I stayed in the world (which 100+ as can be seen in my profile)",5,2017,10,27
200,Excellent experience,"Great hotel in every respect. Felt like I was home with staff so friendly and helpful. Junior suite very spacious. Well appointed. Central location, close to Grafton Street, Trinity College and everything else in walking distance. Good pubs, restaurants in area. Very calming atmosphere in hotel central spaces. Quite Civilized,",5,2017,10,27
200,"Great location, beautiful rooms, restaurants, gardens and recreational spaces.  The staff goes above and beyond.","I would highly recommend the Merrion. We took advantage of the restaurant for breakfast and the bar area for lunch and drinks, both were delightful. We arrived in country early, although our rooms were not ready, the Merrion offered us a place to freshen up, relax and store our bags.  I look forward to returning!  😎",5,2017,10,25
200,Unique Art Tea at the Merrion Hotel,"We visited the Merrion Hotel while in Dublin to experience their ""Art Tea"", a different sort of afternoon tea. The hotel is beautiful and very well appointed. More importantly, the restaurant and lobby areas display the owner's extensive art collection - which also serves at the inspiration for part of the tea. In additional to a huge array of teas and coffees available, the tea also has a typical selection for snacks: finger sandwiches, scones (with clotted cream!), and various pastries. The ""second course"" is the real event, though - three of the works of art are chosen as inspiration for each day's ""art"" desserts, with the dessert decorated with the color/style of each of the three paintings. Pretty incredible, and delicious as well!",5,2017,10,24
200,Superb Hotel,"This is a true 5 star hotel. Rooms are very nice, bedding is very comfortable. Service is excellent. One of the best hotels we have experienced. They just opened a new restaurant inside the hotel. Very good food. Quiet with great cooling/heating.
Would stay again on a return to Dublin.",5,2017,10,24
200,Wonderful hotel,"Great location, extremely helpful and friendly staff, and lovely room.  Pool and steam bath were great to start the morning.  Afternoon tea were a delight.  We would stay here without question again.  Love the Merrion!",5,2017,10,23
200,Afternoon Tea,"Gorgeous tea and cakes, the staff were very friendly and helpful and there was a lovely calm atmosphere. 

Great value for money seeing as we shared one portion of the “art afternoon tea” between us.

Great amount of cakes and free refills on the tea! Recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing afternoon",5,2017,10,23
200,Luxury in Dublin,"Worthy of five stars.  Excellent location, staff and services.  Friendly staff always looking out for your needs.  Rooms comfortable and quiet.  Pool and steam room relaxing.  Easy walk to most Dublin destinations.  Nice neighborhood.",5,2017,10,22
200,Will absolutely return to The Merrion ,"We stayed for four nights and the hotel exceeded our expectations. The room was large, clean, and very nicely furnished. The bed was extremely comfortable, as were the pillows and the comforter. The bathroom was nicely done in marble and had a stand alone tub and separate shower.
There is a lot of closet space, and plenty of amenities: safe, coffee maker, hair dryer, a well-stocked mini bar, and a good tv.
Room service was very quick, and all the staff were helpful and very friendly.
There is a nice indoor pool and steam room which was lovely at the end of a cool rainy day.
There is a Michelin two star restaurant on the premises, and it should not be missed!
The hotel is in the perfect location; St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, The National Gallery, Trinity College and numerous restaurants and pubs are within easy walking distance. 
We will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,10,21
200,Family stay," We did not originally receive the room types that we reserved, although on our return trip at the end of the week we did and were very happy. There was some miscommunication about where our American Express platinum credit could be used and the cellar restaurant is very small and crowded for a large family with children. We never even saw the  Beautiful cellar bar which also has a restaurant menu and much larger Rooms to accommodate large, noisy groups Until our last night and we were told originally that our platinum credit did not apply there. That information was belatedly corrected but not in time to take advantage of it. Room service was fabulous, and the rooms were comfortable and large.  The continental breakfast at the cellar restaurant was OK, although they have a fabulous granola. Even ordering off the menu we never really found a breakfast option that we thoroughly enjoyed. Dinner was pleasant, but forgettable. For the most part, service was good. ",4,2017,10,21
200,The only hotel in Dublin,"I won't even consider another hotel.The experience and service are simply too good. While the hotel rate is high, the value is great. Service and support match the needs and focus of serious travelers.",5,2017,10,21
200,Fabulous Hotel,"I can't say enough about the Merrion Hotel. The service was outstanding, the location excellent and every person in the hotel could not have been more helpful.  The rooms were pristine and quite comfortable.  One night we decided to have food and drinks in the bar and it was all Very Good!",5,2017,10,19
200,Happily Surprised,"It doesn't happen often that you have this ""home"" feeling during a business trip, but the Merrion in Dublin made it happen. Stayed here in October 2017 and I really felt welcome. Warm welcome at the reception, a large, well appointed room and friendly staff everywhere you looked. This is one of the few places on the planet where everybody addresses you by name and where it does not feel awkward. Breakfast in the room was great. All in all a place I will return to when in Dublin again.",5,2017,10,19
200,Best of the best,"Money well worth spending.  We made last minute reservations, and although it was expensive, it was worth the cost.  First class service all the way around.  It will be the only place we stay in Dublin.  Close to everything but in a quieter area.  We had arranged for transportation to the airport, and it did not arrive.  The doorman was exceptional in getting us another taxi.  All personnel were responsive to our requests.",5,2017,10,19
200,A wonderful city escape,"The Merrion  is superbly located withing walking distance of numerous excellent restaurants, bars and shopping.   The staff are some of the best  I have ever encountered.  They couldn't be more courteous or helpful, without being intrusive. They go the extra mile, from putting bottles of water in  my car before I left to a cable tidy in my room for my iphone.  Every guest is made feel special and although It's expensive, it was worth it, Birthdays need to be celebrate!",5,2017,10,19
200,Outstanding Hotel!,"The Merrion was a fabulous hotel from the moment we arrived until our departure. If you love a beautiful hotel with outstanding service this is the hotel for you. We enjoyed the Cellar restaurant and unwinding at the end of the day in the beautiful setting of the bar.  Also, pack your swimsuit for the relaxing at the pool and sauna.",5,2017,10,18
200,"Merrion Hotel, Dublin","This is a very expensive hotel but you definitely get what you pay for i.e. it delivers on every level in terms of quality, service, food, accommodation - it is hard to fault it, I will definitely go back",5,2017,10,17
200,Great location and facility,"The Merrion is the quintessential high end hotel. Very proper service. Room was lovely, bed and pillows extremely comfortable, beautiful bath. Elegance all around. In the heart of Dublin so restaurants and pubs are within 1/2 block. Easy walking distance to the main pedestrian mall Grafton St. as well as Trinity College and other top sites of Dublin. The Cellar Bar was closed for 8 days of renovation when we were there which was unfortunate because I had looked forward to experiencing that. Over all a very lovely stay!",5,2017,10,17
200,One of the finest hotels in the world,"We stayed at the Merrion for five days and it is one of the finest hotels I which I have ever stayed (including the Regent in Berlin, Grosvenor Square in London, Shanga La in Singapore). This is a true five star property. Incredibly attentive staff in an amazing historic property. We stayed in the old section that is a collection of early town houses linked together, one of which is where the Duke of Wellington was born. Everything is exceptional, from the concierge, to staff who respond to the smallest request, to turn down service. This is the best hotel in Ireland and is centrally located across from government buildings and near St. Stephens Green and Merrion Square--absolutely lovey parks. The in house restaurant (Cellar) is wonderful for a great Irish or continental breakfast and also as a dinner or lunch option. The Michelin two starred Patrick Guilbaud restaurant is also in the building complex. Also, something I have never seen in any other hotel, the Merrion has an extensive art collection and there is an exceptionally well done audio guide and booklet to do a self-guided tour. Don't miss the James Joyce statue in the hotel's lovely garden. In short, this was a very memorable stay and we will be back. My highest recommendation for this world-class hotel!",5,2017,10,16
200,Best hotel we have ever stayed in,"Having read all the good reviews of The Merrion we booked our stay. We were not disappointed, every member of staff is a credit to the hotel, they can't do enough for you. Even when the Hurricane hit the Concierge kept an eye on our flight to keep us informed. The rooms are spotless, spacious, the beds super comfy, the little touches in the room were appreciated. Location is perfect and close to shops, pubs. Thank you for a lovely stay in Ireland.",5,2017,10,16
200,Best Service!,This was our first and best hotel during our stay in Ireland.  I can't say enough about the service- it was truly outstanding.  Located near good shopping and museums. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone that asks.,5,2017,10,16
200,Fabulous and wonderful staff..Loved our stay !! Can’t wait to go back to the Merrion,The food and service was fantastic.. Location was perfect walking distance to the pubs and shopping.. It was our 1st time in Dublin and The Merrion made the trip so exciting.. They have a wonderful afternoon tea.. ,5,2017,10,15
200,Loved The Merrion Experience!,"We requested that our room be ready for an early check-in, and it was.  We were able to have quick naps and then take off to visit Dublin.  The location is ideal for seeing some of the best downtown sites - Grafton Street shopping, Temple Bar area for food and drink, Trinity College and The Book of Kells, etc.  The footmen and concierge service were very friendly and helpful, offering assistance in handling our luggage, etc., and in finding good places to eat, etc.  Because this was our 5th visit to the city, we were not in need of much help getting around, but still appreciated their attentiveness.  Our room was spacious and included every amenity we might want.  The hotel is housed in three separate home plus an addition, and the Drawing Rooms were attractive and comfortable for afternoon tea, a drink, or some snacks to tide one over till dinner.  The service was attentive and thorough, and we felt that they were happy to assist us as needed.  We would come back here any time with positive anticipation!",5,2017,10,14
200,The Very Best!,"We arrived at the hotel at 3pm but our queen double room wasn't ready.  We were escorted to their lounge and offered complimentary tea and was told that the wait would be worth it.  It certainly was!  We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite and the Dungannon Suite #214 was simply fantastic!  Beautifully and tastefully decorated and everything that one would need.  We appreciated the many outlets and the two plug adaptors.  The suite had a living room with dining table, a full bath with tub and shower, a half bath, large closets and a separate study which was a perfect place to keep our suitcases out of the way.
We loved the hotel which is a historic Georgian building with lovely outdoor gardens, a wonderful large swimming pool, great restaurants, including The Cellar (reserve a table in one of the alcoves for a romantic setting).  The breakfast buffet and menu items were excellent and they served the best porridge we had in our two weeks in Ireland.
Besides the beautiful accommodations, our stay at The Merrion was wonderful because of the staff.  The service from the staff across the board was helpful, friendly and professional.  We absolutely loved our stay at The Merrion and highly recommend it.  It was The Very Best!",5,2017,10,13
200,Excellent balance of luxurious and comfortable,"We just stayed four nights at The Merrion Hotel.  It's beautiful with friendly staff and conveniently located near restaurants, bus lines, and walking distance to Trinity College.  We had a Garden Wing Queen room and it was very quiet.  Baggage handling, housekeeping, and concierge services were excellent.  Concierge staff had great restaurant and pub recommendations!  (One of their restaurants was under renovation so we looked elsewhere for most meals.)

There are several options for getting to and from the Dublin airport. If you are planning to do some sight seeing, check out packages from DoDublin or The Dublin Pass that include airport transfers.  For bus service, check out the Dublin ""Airlink"" route 757.  If you have two or three people and/or don't want to take extra time waiting for the bus or making extra stops, a cab will cost about €30 each way.

One thing we wish the concierge would have let us know when we ordered our taxi back to the airport is not all taxis in Dublin currently take credit cards.  We were trying to use up all our Euros before we left and ended up just short.  (The cab driver was very apologetic and we just had to run into the terminal to hit a cash machine.)

In addition to a beautiful hotel and clean room, the WiFi was good, a newspaper was at our door each morning, there were plenty of television stations, the shower was hot, and the water pressure was good.  We would recommend this hotel and we would stay there again!",5,2017,10,13
200,All round fabulous experience - Oct 17,"The Merrion staff with their professionalism and pleasantries gave  such an excellent service, joined with fabulous room amenities and quality of bed/bedding - resulted in an overall wonderful experience. We definitely plan on returning!",5,2017,10,12
200,Luxury,When we are looking for a little treat for ourselves and a little luxury and pampering ........ the Merrion is always the choice. The Merrion ia an oasis of tranquility and luxury with the bustling Dublin outside.,5,2017,10,12
200,A Home Away From Home,Wonderful Hotel to feel relaxed in and treat as your home in Dublin.  Within walking distance of historical sites.  Helpful and friendly staff and an easy and relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel.  Looking forward to our next stay!,5,2017,10,12
200,Perfection in Dublin,"Everything about the Merrion is perfect. The staff, the decor, the pillows, the mattresses. The quiet. The art work. The location. Even the complimentary apples, crisp and the right sweet. We spent two perfect nights, left with our shoes shined, our impressions of hospitality in Dublin reconfirmed-- one of the most welcoming places on earth.",5,2017,10,12
200,Fabulous,Every aspect of our stay was superb definitely 5 stars and can't stop telling friends about it.would definitely return to this hotel if we were ever back in Dublin.The whole experience was remarkable and I would recommend it highly.,5,2017,10,12
200,Absolutely wonderful!,"My wife and I made this the last stop in our very long visit to Ireland. We were not disappointed! The staff is wonderful! We were looking pretty rough after living out of backpacks for 2 weeks. Add to that my normal appearance (t-shirt, jeans, shaved head and arms covered in tattoos) and you can imagine the looks of disdain and less than average service I've received at other high end hotels.

Here, my appearance was of no obvious concern. We were pleasantly greeted and assisted with our bags immediately upon exiting our vehicle. We were led to the front desk and, although we were early for our check in time and were unable to get our room right away, we were offered immediate access to the other amenities they have to offer. The treatment we received from the staff there was incredibly warm, welcoming, respectful and personable. I truly believe they go out of their way to ensure any guest of their's feels welcomed.

We also took the opportunity to enjoy their afternoon Art Tea. My wife and I absolutely loved it! The creativity involved in coming up with plates resembling pieces from the hotel's art collection is truly amazing! With this being our first trip to Ireland, this definitely sealed the deal as far as my wife and I coming home with a daily tea habit! 

I regret that I'm awful with names and can't personally thank the staff members who ensured that our time spent there was nothing short of what you'd expect from a high caliber hotel. Thanks to all for the wonderful experience! Staying here will be mandatory for us in our future trips to Ireland. ",5,2017,10,12
200,Best Hotel in Ireland,"The service and amenities at the hotel were superb.  The entire staff was friendly and welcoming and went above and beyond to make the stay memorable.  The room in the main house was very spacious and extremely comfortable.  Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is the finest in the world.  The food is beyond delicious and the wine pairing was spot on.  Services was attentive, but not overbearing and Patrick was very charming.  There is no better hotel in all of Ireland and the UK.",5,2017,10,12
200,Our go-to hotel in Dublin,"As usual the Merrion delivered. This was our second visit to this fabulous establishment and has become our go-to hotel in Dublin. Perfectly appointed rooms, warm and efficient staff, and consistently top notch service. Only one small caveat; too many afternoon tea sittings on the Saturday we were there meant the two parlour rooms and the bar were packed, noisy and did not allow for a relaxing moment to read the paper. But i should have gone earlier in the day to do that and really, it was a Saturday on an extremely busy weekend (a rugby match and soccer match meant the city centre was buzzing). I recommend this hotel to anyone; just beware that it will spoil you for anything else!",5,2017,10,12
200,Average accomodations for $$$$$,"Greeting by front door staff was warm and welcoming. We also appreciated being escorted to our room. Our room was nothing of what we would expect of a hotel of that stature and reputation. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the mattress springs could be felt though.  While the bathroom was very lovely, the other furnishings were dated and quite plain. Also the carpet and chair were stained. Our breakfast took over 25 minutes to arrive at our table the next morning. No apologies. The table near us left without receiving their breakfast at all. That evening upon our return we stopped for a bite to eat in the hotel bar. Service was quick but again indifferent.  No smiles or chit chat. We don't mind spending money for high quality but our accommodations were average and we were treated by some staff like we were unwelcomed ""tourists"". The only place that happened throughout our trip to Ireland. ",2,2017,10,12
200,Exceptional Staff,From the moment we walked up the steps of the hotel we were treated like royalty.  The staff truly are exceptional and the main asset of this hotel. Everything about our stay was flawless! What a fabulous hotel. ,5,2017,10,12
200,Pure Indulgence,We requested to stay at the Merrion for our last night of a 30 day holiday across the British Isles.  Dublin is one of our favorite cities and the friendliness of the people keeps us coming back. Will always recommend staying at the Merrion. ,5,2017,10,11
200,Deserves a 6 Star Rating,"Our stay was only one day here, it warranted more time.  From the time we pulled into valet parking to the minute we checked out, the service was like no other.  The staff was professional, personable, and friendly.  Special kudos to Patrick who took exceptional care of us...parked our car, carried our bags, made special dinner reservations for us...all in a matter of minutes.  He is a special asset to this hotel.  The room was beyond perfection, comfortable bed, beautiful spacious bathroom, everything you could ask for was in the room.  The High Tea room was gorgeous as beautiful music was played from a harp.  The garden was beautifully manicured...you really don’t have to leave the hotel, your stay here is worth the visit to Dublin.  Highly recommend this as a definite lifetime experience.  Looking forward to returning as this is one of our favorite hotels.",5,2017,10,10
200,"Great room, love the 24-hour bar","Our room was lovely and well appointed, and concierge/staff were all very nice. Great location as well within short walking distance of all major things. 24 hour bar was much appreciated for jet lag. But it missed that special 'something' that would get me to return given there are so many other options in the area. If you upgrade to the better rooms, I am sure you'll like it more, but our basic room with a view of a side street was wonderful but not exceptional.",4,2017,10,09
200,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"The Merrion is perfectly located in the heart of Dublin.  Not far from the parks or Grafton Street.  This hotel was our home away from home during our recent stay in Dublin.  The staff is professional and very attentive.  We were traveling with my Mom, who uses a wheelchair, and were surrounded by staff to help us and a hotel that is handicap accessible. Be sure to have tea in the afternoon as it is not to be missed.  The Cellar is a lovely restaurant with delicious food.  They have a lovely outdoor garden where you can sit and read should you choose to.  But better to head out for a walk and enjoy this lovely city.  Staying at The Merrion, with its lovely, spacious rooms and outstanding service, will feel like home.",5,2017,10,09
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed here probably 1-2 times per year for the past 5 years or so.  It really doesn't get better than this in Dublin.  The hotel has that understated and unpretentious 5 star look, feel and service that really makes it stand out. An excellent place to stay.
This time we ate at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant.  Also very good service and exceptional food.",5,2017,10,09
200,Close to perfection,"We loved our recent stay. It is located on a quiet street and the room itself is very quiet. The room was very spacious and comfortable with easily controlled temperature, however, it seemed to get warmer at some point during the night. I would have liked pillows that were a bit softer and a top sheet instead of a duvet only. Regardless of those two things, we rested well. The staff was very friendly and professional. We enjoyed the included breakfast in The Cellar but wish it was available before 7:00 a.m. since we took a couple of early tours and weren't able to eat those mornings. The interior garden had a pleasant view and was away from the crowds and activity. The bathroom was well appointed and the toiletries were high end. It was close to perfection and we would love to return someday.",5,2017,10,09
200,Outstanding hidden gem in Dublin,"The place is understated but very elegant. We thoroughly enjoyed the spaciousness and thoughtful amenities, small touches, and overall quality of the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. The only thing I would suggest to the hotel is to build the garage pricing into the hotel stay.",5,2017,10,07
200,Vacation at the Merrion Hotel,"We had a very pleasant and relaxing stay at the Merrion Hotel. The breakfast service was excellent and the service staff were very attentative and accommodating to our dietary requirements, including arranging special ‘teas’ and ‘milk’ in our suite. ",4,2017,10,07
200,An exceptional hotel experience,"The Merrion Hotel is my absolute favorite in the world. The service is superb. The rooms are lovely and have every extra you can imagine. The gardens are abundant with beautiful trees,flowers, and statuary, making the patio a fine place to relax. There are two top notch restaurants. You don’t have to leave the premises to have a grand time. There is a spa with full facilities and large pool. We were there 4 days and enjoyed every minute of it. High tea is an experience you won’t forget, held in the fine drawing rooms. In addition, there is an extensive art collection throughout the hotel. ",5,2017,10,05
200,Ireland Check,The Merrion is a hotel that will make your travels to Ireland a definite once in a lifetime experience! The front desk staff are extremely accommodating and will be sure when you arrive your room is available for you immediately. The spa therapist are phenomenal. They make your spa experience relaxing and soothing. ,5,2017,10,05
200,"Fantastic hotel with amenities, charm and tremendous hospitality","We enjoyed every minute of the Merrion after touring the West and the South. We didn't even discover the gardens until our last morning when, walking, we sat for our morning coffee.  The room was exceptional. Front line staff and Lydia specifically were welcoming, responsive and attentive to recommendations.  Would absolutely stay here next time in Dublin.",5,2017,10,05
200,Simply the best...,"The Merrion remains one of my favorite hotels in Europe.   It is what a 5* hotel is supposed be:  elegant, pristine, with great and  discreet service.   Where to start, or where to stop: 

In its impeccable Georgian style, the hotel from the Drawing room to the No 23 Bar where you can have a pint and some food in front of a fire, exudes luxury, comfort and calm.   

Great room with all the amenities you can wish for including overnight shoe shine, turndown service... 

The staff is simply the most helpful. 
The place to stay. 
Ps: nice pool too.

200,Wonderful way to finish our trip,"Hotel was lovely.  Service was top notch, rooms were impeccable, location ideal and even the smell in the hotel was pleasing. Concierge services are 24 hours which was so nice. I highly recommend The Merrion.",5,2017,10,04
200,Quietly classy,"My sister and I had fantastic overnight stay here, a last minute booking due to an unexpected change in plans. We had a lovely warm welcome from Mery on the desk who changed our booked double room to a twin room, with a smile and absolutely no fuss. Patrick the concierge was efficient and attentive, greeting me by name each time I entered and left the hotel. I dont know how he managed to remember my name but I noticed he did this with several other guests. These acts of thoughtfulness summed up our stay at The Merrion. The attention to detail was wonderful, the staff were so attentive without being overbearing and we had the best nights sleep we have ever experienced in a hotel.The spa and the breakfast were the icing on the cake and the art collection is to die for. The management of this hotel should be proud of the team they have, and the hard work they put in to make everything seem so effortlessly efficient. Have already booked to return with my husband who hopes to run Dublin marathon at the end of this month, whilst I have coffee on the terrace with James Joyce .",5,2017,10,04
200,Wonderful Experience,"No where else to stay in Dublin that offers such a superb experience, quality with a smile. First class accommodation, warmth and a friendly hand to assist the full enjoyment of the stay, superb range of dining choices with quality of dining to match",5,2017,10,04
200,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed at the Merrion at the beginning of September for three nights.  The hotel is just beautiful!  Our suite was beautifully decorated, extremely well maintained and spotlessly clean.  The bed was fantastic! The staff was very approachable and kind.  The only caveat is the noise level outside of our suite during some afternoons and evenings.  The noise came from banquet areas on the first and ground floors.  Music, kids running in the hallways, the kind of things that happen at weddings.  If you don't need quiet until after 10 in the evening, you should be fine.  We stayed in the main house in the Pakenham Suite. These are rooms in the 180's.  Again, if you'll be out all day into the evening, you wouldn't notice this at all.  I would certainly stay at this beautiful property again, but I would be sure that I was in a different wing of the building.",5,2017,10,03
200,Great start to a wonderful vacation,The hotel is lovely and the staff is super.  From the minute you arrive everyone is attentive and helpful.  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  There are wonderful sitting areas and lovely grounds and flowers.  It is one of the most civilized hotels I have ever stayed in.  We will definitely be returning.,5,2017,10,03
200,Gracious Living,"I stayed at the Merrion for one night and then my husband joined me for a long weekend.
It was perfect.

The service is excellent.  Tea in the gracious Georgian drawing rooms was a perfect respite after a morning of sightseeing.
The location is fantastic.  We walked everywhere.   We will always remember sipping a night cap in the bar next to a warm fire and then wandering back to our lovely room made up for the night.
Highly recommend it,.",5,2017,10,02
200,Excellent service & fantastic sleep,"Stayed here on our anniversary and had a fantastic time. The room was exceptionally comfortable, excellently equipped and the bed was incredible. Someone had left a personalised note to congratulate us on our anniversary with gorgeous sweets. The brilliant service from incredible staff there really stood out for us especially with the friendly greeting and parking service through to reception and the spa area. The high customer service levels make it a true gem in Dublin. ",5,2017,10,02
200,One of the Finest Hotels anywhere,"I always look forward to my stays at the Merrion.  It is first class elegance all the way.  The staff are so warm and welcoming, the food is outstanding and the accommodations are the utmost in comfort.   The public spaces are elegantly decorated and simply lovely to be in and the location cannot be beat.  The Merrion is simply one of my favorite places in the world.  ",5,2017,10,02
200,I was moved from the Shelbourne,I stayed at this hotel because the heating at the Shelbourne was not working and could not be fixed.  Its a nice and the people helped me to settle in by offering me a warm Irish Coffee which was a nice touch.  It was a short stay.,4,2017,10,02
200,City Center Delight,The Merrion is in a perfect location for exploring Dublin. From the moment of check in till our departure we had a wonderful experience. The room was very spacious and was well appointed as was the bathroom. It was not only beautiful but had all of the amenities you would possibly need. We only had breakfast here and it was very good. As a travel agent I would highly recommend this hotel to my clients.,5,2017,10,02
200,Just Superb !,"I took my wife to the Merrion for a special anniversary celebration at the weekend and everything was fantastic from start to finish.  I arranged a private transfer from the train station to the hotel.  It was probably a bit over the top (and not cheap) but what the hell !  The driver was great and his knowledge of the backroads was a life saver as there was a large rally taking place in the city centre.  Check-in was great.  Our bags were lifted from the taxi and brought straight to our room.  We were very lucky and were upgraded to a suite in the garden wing.  The room was fabulous - large bedroom, two bathrooms, sitting room and a dressing room.  The fixtures and fittings are top quality giving the room a luxurious feel.  My wife had a Spa treatment (which was fabulous) and I used the swimming pool.  The leisure facilities are spotlessly clean and had lovely touches of quality soaps, shampoo, shaving gel etc.  The staff were very attentive, showed me around and made sure I knew what to do and were to go.  We had drinks in the No. 23 bar which was great - fabulous surroundings and atmosphere.   We then headed out for dinner.

That night we slept soundly in the very large double bed, overall the hotel was very quiet.  Check out the next morning was easy and super efficient, aside from the fact that we really did not want to leave !

Service throughout are stay was excellent - all the staff we met were very polite and helpful.

The hotel is not cheap but if absolutely delivers on value.  It is a truly unique experience and the best hotel in Dublin by far.  I look forward to going back in the not too distant future.

Thank you Merrion !",5,2017,10,02
200,A perfect experience,"This is one of the best hotels on the planet. Defines European elegance from the meticulous service to the beautiful gardens, tea room, spa, bar and restaurants.   The rooms are spacious and lovely. Will be the only place I stay whilst visiting Dublin. ",5,2017,10,01
200,Very nice,"I stayed at the merrion for a two night over a weekend in a standard room. Everything works as expected, from checkin to checkout. Nice spacious rooms overlooking the courtyard. The rooms are updated and the bed, furniture etc are very comfortable. 
A housekeeper offers you ice, fresh towels etc during the evening. 
Location are good, just a cast away from grafton street (main pedestrian street) 
Would highly recommend the merrion. 

A tip. The hotel house a two star Michelin restaurant, and I would recommend it, if you're fancy that kind, and be sure to bring your suit/dress for admission. 
",4,2017,10,01
200,One of a kind hotel,"Dublin has no shortage of places to stay and many of them are quite dear. The Merrion is unique because they deliver on the value for the money; you will not be disappointed. Every aspect, from the service, to the quality, and the cleanliness is over the top. I could not get a bathroom to shine like they do if you gave me several days to do it. The only downside is that you have to check out at some point and go back to reality!",5,2017,10,01
200,Magnificent Merrion,Outstanding service. Luxurious accommodation. You cannot beat the location.  You feel like you are in a lovely mansion rather than a hotel.  The art collection is as good as any museum.  Looking forward to then new restaurant and extended spa.,5,2017,10,01
200,Faultless ,"There couldn't possibly be a better hotel in ireland. 

We stayed in a garden facing room. The bed was simply enormous and beyond comfortable. The room itself I think is described as ""standard"" but this doesn't do it justice. It's superbly appointed with a fantastic bathroom ( with bath and walk in shower + beautiful products ) and nice classic furnishings. Everything has that super luxe feel right down to the black out curtains that are the heaviest I've ever felt in a hotel. 

Staff throughout our stay were excellent. Super Professional but effusing that warm irish charm ( even those that weren't irish! ) that has been missing in Dublin hotels of late. 

The hotel has facilities to match its 5 stars but I think the cellar bar which is a little more contemporary than the rest of the hotel really really hits the right note. Lovely bar food and a full range of wines priced to suit every wallet. ( I was surprised to see football on in the bars two big screens during our visit though....) 

Our bill was pretty hefty once food and a day of drinks was totted but I honestly feel we still got great value for what is, and will always be, one of life's real treats. 

Thanks Merrion Hotel - see you in 2018! ",5,2017,10,01
200,Elegance & Sophistication,"I was traveling with my wife, son and mother-in-law back to California and had a 17 hour layover in Dublin. So my wife booked us to stay at the Merrion for just one night with two Jr. suites.  We arrived at 1am and we did not want to have to deal with finding a taxi at that time of the morning so we asked the concierge to book a car to pick us up at the airport. They were very accommodating and communicated with us a few times prior to our arrival just to make sure all the arrangements were secure and did not change on our part. I give Sarah Cumiskey a 5 star for taking such good care of the car booking and the changes to our itinerary. The hotel was everything and more than what I expected. The rooms were immaculate and every detail was attended to. The beds were very comfortable! I can not wait for my next trip to Dublin and plan a much longer stay at the Merrion when we return next year...One night was not even close to enough time to enjoy the hotel they way I would have wanted to.",5,2017,09,30
200,Excellent place to stay,"The Merrion is top of the line for location. service & decor. From your first entry you are warmly greeted by the top hat attired doorman as well as the concierge & reception staff. Guest rooms & public areas are beautifully decorated. Fireplaces & gardens, sitting rooms, bar area are very welcoming.Don't miss the Cellar bar & restaurant downstairs. Great location near restaurants & Grafton Street.",5,2017,09,30
200,Great first impression......,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is perfection! We were greeted at the door by the smiling face of Tommy. Reception was welcoming and at the ready for all our needs. This hotel is 5 star all the way. The rooms and baths are meticulously clean and I wish I could have stayed there forever. Kudos to all staff. Can't wait for our return visit. Thanks for making traveling so easy.  Mary, Pennsylvania",5,2017,09,30
200,Only place to stay in Dublin,You get the best service in the cleanest and the nicest room in Dublin. It is located in the best area and quiet. Especially in Saturday night. All luxary hotel should be like this and they are not. It just old world classy and you have to experience it.,5,2017,09,28
200,"Be sure to stay at The Merrion, Dublin","You just can't beat The Merrion Hotel in Ireland for a full 5-star experience in a great location near St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, Ireland.  Every aspect of our stay was luxurious and staff were extremely courteous.  Service was always prompt.  We wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2017,09,28
200,Wonderful experience,"We spent a wonderful weekend at the Merrion in early September. Cannot stop raving about the hotel, room, afternoon tea service, pool, location, art collection in the lobby, service. Well, everything.",5,2017,09,28
200,Dublin at its best,We have just come back from a stay at the Merrion hotel oh my God what a beautiful well run hotel the staff couldn't be more helpful I would recommend this hotel to anyone I have been around the world but this is one of the best services I've ever had thank you so much for making my stay so wonderful,5,2017,09,28
200,The only thing I would do differently next time is stay longer.,"We booked a night in the Merrion for our 5 year anniversary. It was the perfect way to celebrate. If you could design your dream hotel in Dublin, you would end up with the Merrion. The location, the buildings and the rooms are all as good as you can imagine. The artwork is even better. Above all this, it is the wonderful staff who make your stay so memorable. They are always ready to help with whatever you need. They are friendly without being intrusive and polite without being stuffy. We are so well downstairs in Patrick Guilbaud for lunch, that we didn't have room for dinner in the Cellar Restaurant. We're going to have to come back, but there's no way we are waiting another 5 years!",5,2017,09,28
200,My Recent stay at The Merrion,"I recently stayed at The Merrion Dublin - Amazing experience as always from personalized  service , Luxury Accommodations to excellent cuisine - The location is wonderful - Top rated restaurants and Authentic Irish pubs at your doorstep.",5,2017,09,27
200,Treated Fabulously!,"For our last night in Dublin, before heading black to the states, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves (or rather be treated) to a luxury hotel stay. 

Let me be clear, this is an expensive hotel. For some people, I'm sure that the prices are no big deal, but we are a middle class family, so the prices are higher than we're used to. 

With that being said, we were treated marvelously! Even though my clothes looked a little rough from traveling, my brown and pink hair was thrown up into a ponytail, and my tattooed husband was wearing a simple tshirt, it felt like we were treated as respectfully as their wealthiest guests. I never felt snobbery. In fact the staff was quite friendly with us.

We also participated in the afternoon Art Tea, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The gentleman and young lady who were serving us were very kind and helpful. 

Another great thing is that they upgraded us to one of their Garden Suites for no cost! It was definitely the nicest and biggest hotel room (actually it had a huge bedroom, a small room with a large desk, a large sitting room, and a bath and a half!) I've ever stayed in! But again, we are average folks. We don't have a lot of experience in fancy hotels. 

Because this hotel is higher priced, I wouldn't recommend it for longer stays (unless of course you have the disposable income). But like I said, for our one last pampered night in the amazing country of Ireland, it was an excellent stay for us. 

",5,2017,09,27
200,A Wonderful Experience,"We were treated with the greatest of care and respect and had a fantastic experience at this stunning, perfectly located hotel. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was gorgeous and the pool elegant and refreshing after spending our days touring the great city of Dublin.",5,2017,09,27
200,Very Luxurious,The Merrion was a very luxurious hotel that was perfect and very comfortable to stay before a long flight back to the US. This was my second stay here and I intend to stay again on my next travels to Dublin!!,4,2017,09,26
200,The best of the best city hotel,From greeting to the end the service was friendly and exceptional. The architecture was old world charm with modern conveniences and infrastructure. The food was creative and tasty and wine selection awesome.,5,2017,09,26
200,Perfect location in Dublin,"Dublin is an interesting city but not a beautiful one.  The Merrion is a charming hotel,
located in an area surrounded by Georgian houses and near two parks and is the 
most convenient and pleasantest place to be when visiting the city.  Our room was 
large and beautifully appointed, overlooking the gardens - something I would
recommend over the main house.  Excellent service.  The National Gallery is just down the street and it is easy to walk to many of the historic places of interest.",5,2017,09,24
200,Dine and dream at the Merrion,Attention to detail in all aspects. From an efficient and friendly greeting at the door to a most beautifully appointed bedroom. Everything was spotless. I particularly enjoyed the audio guide to the hotel's interesting art collection. ,5,2017,09,24

200,Lovely property in an ideal location.,"The location was perfect- probably the best in Dublin. The service was superior, very friendly and helpful. Classic Irish charm. The casual dining venue- The Cellar was terrific, live music and interesting menu. ",4,2017,09,23
200,Old world elegance,"From the comfortable beds to the wonderful people, the Cellar restaurant's food, and the beautiful gardens and the absolute best Irish coffee anywhere.  Treat yourself to at least one night there.  I wish we could have stayed there longer.",5,2017,09,23
200,Lovely Hotel in heart of Dublin,"Historic hotel with five star service. We travelled with a baby and I felt maybe this hotel wasn't suited to travel with a baby. It had a lot of professionals / non family travellers staying here and at times I was conscious we didn't make too much disturbance. So if travelling with baby maybe look for a more casual hotel. But if I were to travel to a Dublin again sans baby I would book the Merrion. I had the Art Tea (afternoon high tea) they serve here and that was lovely. Breakfast was delicious.
We also stayed here whilst a rock band was staying here which was quite cool. Apparently all the big acts who play in Dublin stay here - so it says something about the quality of the hotel.",5,2017,09,21
200,Wow!!!,"5 Star all the way. Where to start..  Okay I'll keep it short. Staff, Some of the best I've ever encountered! Facility, In a word - unbelievable. Amenities, just go and try them for yourself. The pictures on their website are accurate!",5,2017,09,20
200,World Class - Absolutley Fantastic,"From start to finish, the best!  Arrived early (Noon) after a long flight and the staff welcomed us. ""Mr. Farmer, you're early but we have your room ready"".  Magical words since we were so tired from the flight that arrived at 5:00 a.m.  The room was perfect, perfect.  Totally loved the gardens.  I read all the James Joyce writings in the garden.  The guys at the front, ""the best ever"".  Great recommendations on restaurants and directions.  Great beds, showers, coffee, tea, etc.  Wonderful.  Note: If you want to eat at the Michelin Star restarurant "" Patrick Guilbaud"" attached to the hotel, make a reservation 2 months or more in advance.  The hotel is perfect as expected.  We came back very late on a Sunday night with friends and had a few drinks at the bar and the hotel was very accomodating.",5,2017,09,20
200,The Best,"We were fortunate enough to spend one might at this fabulous hotel. From the minute we arrived at the front door, we knew we were at a special place. From the doorman, to the excellent staff at reception, we realized we were at a true five star hotel. The linens, the towels, the comfort of the bed were all perfection. The next morning my husband went to breakfast. I'm not much of a breakfast person, so I stayed in the room. He immediately came back to the room, telling me I couldn't miss this breakfast. It was elegant with white tablecloths, starched linen napkins, beautiful china and silver, and the best French toast I've ever eaten. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. I will recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin. ",5,2017,09,20
200,Excellent!,"Wow! We have had a lovely stay here. The staff are very professional and extremely friendly. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Finishing touches like water next to your bed every night, a fruit basket on arrival, a book mark placed at your bedside next to your book. Worth every cent! Oh, and I forgot to mention the lovely gardens! Book a garden facing room.",5,2017,09,20
200,A place of peace in a busy city,Just enjoyed another two night stay in the Merrion Hotel which is not like any other hotel in Dublin. This hotel is easy to get to by car and the ability to park off the main road whilst your bags are being unloaded by the staff makes for pleasant start. All of the facilities in the hotel are of the highest standard and the staff are always available and eager to help. I can’t think of anything they could possibly do to improve this wonderful hotel.,5,2017,09,20
200,The rooms are beautiful and nothing is missing,"Lovely rooms - one somewhat trivial point:  the bidets in 2 rooms I saw, were too close to the adjacent wall or bath, so one couldn't actually get a leg round it!  But the whole experience was a delight, can't really fault anything - maybe a prettier view would be nice, but you could always go out for views!!  Perfect service.   Really nice and helpful people.   And with a smile...",5,2017,09,19
200,Truly 5 Star!,"Another reviewer has stated that this is not a luxury hotel but we travel a lot and for a city hotel, this is most definitely in the luxury category.  Expensive but worth it.  We stayed here for 3 nights in the run up to my son's wedding (which was not held at the hotel just to be clear).  For 2 nights we had 2 rooms and on the 3rd night we had 4 rooms, including one for the groom where his groomsmen were coming to help him prepare for his wedding.  Service for the first 2 nights was excellent, we had booked rooms in the Garden wing and were upgraded to a better category room in the same wing, which is what we'd booked for the final night.  This was great as we then didn't need to move rooms.  Reception staff and the Concierges were outstanding - couldn't have been more helpful.  We mentioned that our son was getting married and we were a little concerned that, although beautiful, the rooms were not huge and he had 7 groomsmen coming to help him.  With that the hotel upgraded him to a stunning suite, with a butler - it literally made his last night as a single man!  So much so that he would like to return to Dublin for his first anniversary and stay in the same room but have his beautiful wife with him this time!  If The Merrion read this, perhaps they can offer him a reduced rate so that he can afford it haha.  Seriously though, this hotel prides itself on understated luxurious service and they produce it magnificently.
The only downside to our stay was the recommendation from the Concierge that I should use Reds hairdresser on the morning of the wedding.  I did a trial at the salon on Thursday morning and they were great so they arranged to send a stylist to the hotel for 8 am to do my hair on our son's wedding day so that I didn't miss the family breakfast.  Sadly she didn't turn up until 9.15 so I was extremely stressed and missed the breakfast anyway.  It wasn't the hotel's fault and the concierge was amazing trying to find out where she was and why she was so late but it was their recommendation and it really spoiled the start of a very special day so hopefully they won't recommend Reds to anyone else in future.
With our new daughter-in-law's family living in Dublin, we will definitely be returning at some point in the future and will definitely stay at the Merrion.",5,2017,09,18
200,"Stately and grand hotel, modern, wonderful service","This stately and grand old hotel is very modern and up to date inside. There are lovely courtyards and areas for enjoying coffee or wine, snacks with company or alone. The rooms are big bright modern and clean. The service is bend over backwards to take care of you good. The location of this hotel is also the best.",5,2017,09,18
200,"Friendly staff, great and quiet guest rooms, convenient location.","We enjoyed my visit and stay in Dublin. The Merrion provided quiet, comfortable and a luxury stay. The Concierges were extremely helpful and spot on with their recommendations for lunch and dinner. The doormen were welcoming, smiling and friendly. The location of the hotel is convenient to walk to almost any destination a visitor would like to see. The entire  experience in Dublin left me craving to return to Ireland again....soon!",5,2017,09,17
200,Plush,"We tend to be do-it-yourself vacationers, so places like the Merrion are rare departures for us. But we're pleased with our decision to wrap ourselves in a bit of luxury after the transatlantic flight, and before our rural adventures in Leitrim.
The outside is dignified, if somewhat unprepossessing, and not really indicative of the splendor within.
We were utterly exhausted, but arrived a couple of hours before our room was ready. The concierge directed us into the lounge, where we had some coffee and biscuits that were nothing short of sublime, and revived us marvelously. My only very minor complaint is that after she served us, our waitress disappeared. I'd have adored a refill, but we had to hunt down someone who worked there who informed us that we couldn't put it on our room charge (?), so we paid and headed off to explore.
Beyond that, the service was exquisite. Friendly and helpful and thoroughly professional. Even when I came bopping through the lobby in a baseball cap and sparkles, making my fellow guests raise their eyebrows all the way above their lorngnettes, the staff kept poker faces and polite smiles, bless them.
And the footmen (I know, they're doormen, but I'm an Alice in Wonderland fan and I wanted footmen) were the best. They directed us around the city expertly, welcomed us home cheerily, and when we left (on the day of a half marathon so the street in front was closed) insisted on carrying our bags to nearest cab intersection and waiting 'To put ye're bags i' the boot, ye know.'
The bed was simply gorgeous. I honestly could have spent our entire 2 days in Dublin sleeping. Best. Bed. Ever.
Terrific bathtub. Sumptuous amenities. Fluffy fat towels and bathrobes. Seriously decadent.
Great food, too. And great service in the breakfast restaurant (we only took breakfast there.)
Wish I'd have thought to bring a bathing suit. The swimming pool looked amazing, but my attempt to buy one at the nearby mall was shockingly depressing.
We would stay at the Merrion again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,09,17
200,"Good standard, well situated hotel in Dublin","Not a luxury hotel but a comfortable modern one with efficient service. An ideal inner city hotel for those wishing to enjoy a short stay whilst enjoying the sites of Dublin. Excellent restaurant (2 stars) and others, like Etto (1 star) just a stone's throw away.",4,2017,09,16
200,Excellent location and impeccable service,"We asked Tom, the concierge, if the hotel had a deck of cards. He said no. But he took it upon himself to go out and buy us a deck and had it delivered to our room. Wow. Nothing else needs to be said. ",5,2017,09,16
200,Really the best,"Merrion Hotel in Dublin was exquisite. The bed was super comfy and down pillows and comforter were just right. Breakfast was great albeit I found a piece of broken porcelain in my banana bread while eating it! But no worries, lucky for me, my teeth are still intact! It was the most delicious bread... moist with plenty of banana flavor.  Service was exceptional.",5,2017,09,16
200,This hotel deserves its 5 stars,"The moment you step onto the grounds of the Merrion Hotel in Dublin, you feel you are in good hands. Checking in was smooth, our bags were waiting for us in our room when we got there. The facilities are luxurious, in excellent condition. The staff is top notch. We only stayed one day/one night but it was memorable . We ate dinner   at the restaurant downstairs and it was quiet, romantic, very special, and I had the best steak I ever had there! The next morning we took a taxi to the airport at about 6:15 AM, and when we got downstairs, the bellboy had the taxi waiting without any reminder that morning, so we hopped right into the taxi and left as smoothly as we arrived. A perfect overnight stay in Dublin! This hotel is within walking distance( a couple blocks away) from Trinity College, great shopping, and excellent museums. I highly recommend it, I can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin",5,2017,09,16
200,Amazing,The Merrion deserves all the accolades and more. The service is impeccable and the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. We could not have chosen a better hotel to celebrate our 48th anniversary. Both restaurants were exceptional. ,5,2017,09,12
200,A delightful treat,"This hotel is very well situated in Dublin and is a beautiful and luxurious place to stay. The staff are friendly and helpful.It is lovely to return here after sightseeing in Dublin, the reception rooms are attractive and the gardens are extensive for a city centre hotel and very attractively planted. The room was spacious and very clean. We were told we had a queen bed but it seemed to be a king! Certainly big enough for us.
There is an extensive and interesting art collection.",5,2017,09,10
200,First rate.,"Excellent location.  Very professional and friendly staff.  Fine art in the hotel. You can quibble with some minor things, but overall an excellent hotel. The restaurant, which is in 'the cellar,' is moving to a better location.  The food is above average. The packages can be a little misleading, so read the fine print.  I would return.",5,2017,09,09
200,10th Wedding Anniversary,"We were utterly spoilt.  Nothing was too difficult and the Hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a truly memorable experience, from our Suite, the champagne, scrumptious breakfasts, our relaxing spa treatment and then our meal at Patrick Guilbaud.  It was very special and we only hope that we might come back to the Merrion with our young family so that they too can experience the Merrion hospitality.  Thank you",5,2017,09,06
200,Top class as usual,Stayed here again for a couple of days in Dublin's fair city. As usual the bedrooms were perfect with comfortable beds and well appointed bathrooms. Service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. The garden terrace has been finished since our last stay and is the perfect sun trap.,5,2017,09,05
200,Simply the finest!,"It is so rare today to find a hotel that lives up to its reputation.  The Merrion does that and strives to exceed your expectations.   The staff was uniformly well trained, knowledgeable and efficient.  Our room in the old building was exceptionally roomy, light filled with a king bed and large sitting area.  Food and beverage services were excellent.  Great location for exploring Dublin.  We couldn't have been more pleased!",5,2017,09,03
200,Can't go wrong at The Merrion,"Not cheap, obviously, but superb. We opted for a splurge at the beginning of our trip when we knew we'd be jet-lagged. The reception rooms are gorgeous, the location perfect for us, the service attentive and friendly. Our room, a suite in the Garden Wing, was spacious and so comfortable, especially when we woke up at odd hours of the night. One of us could retreat to the living room without disturbing the other.  The Merrion is an old school hotel experience updated for modern travelers. We loved it.",5,2017,09,01
200,Perfect in every way,"This hotel knows how to do luxury.  Every space from the rooms to the lobby is beautiful.  Staff members are friendly and attentive - they responded so quickly to every request.  The art is great.  Just sitting in the tea room or the bar is a wonderful relaxing time.  It is not inexpensive, but worth every Euro.",5,2017,08,31
200,Very nice place,"everything was excellent highly  recommend this place, great service wonderful bed and pillows.beautiful place.wonderful staff overall the best hotel with stay in Ireland.From the three cities that we visited on the trip.",5,2017,08,31
200,The Merrion~ Excellent And Exceeds Expectations!,"Cannot sing enough praises about this magnificent property from various criteria such as customer service, amenities, simple elegance, and quality of food! 

Having arrived early morning on a Sunday, their full service Tethra Spa was the perfect offering for us weary travelers. It was no longer about the wait, but a time to enjoy their Roman bath inspired indoor pool, relaxing steam room, and poolside cushioned chairs to slumber away. Their gracious attendant Renee welcomed us and even offered blankets if we needed to seriously pass out on said chairs. 

Our Queen room 308 was readied by noon and the wow factor wasn't lost on this jet lagged couple. The lovely front desk representative escorted us to our room, and might as well have handed us a bouquet of flowers as she explained everything about our gorgeous and comfortable space. We appreciate their design- as their website stated- understated elegance. The pastel colors matching their garden's hydrangeas welcomed the much needed relaxation and sleep. 

After a rejuvenating four hour nap, I ventured downstairs to the floral drawing room. No better way to reset one's clock than sipping malt whiskey flavored tea, nibbling on buttery shortbread cookies, against the whispered conversations, tea ware clinking, and cherubic musical stylings from their daily harpist. 

Next morning's breakfast in the Cellar was equally delightful with hearty blueberry pancakes, as well locks & eggs, both from the a la carte menu. And again I must note how friendly and engaging the staff was with each attentive pour of their robust coffee. Just what we needed for a day of walking & exploration. 

We hope you enjoy your stay as well at The Merrion. As a service professional myself, I appreciate that they really think of everything to make it a pleasure of a stay. May seem insignificant to some but having stayed at numerous Europe hotels of the same ilk ~ 
a) this is the first that positively confirmed on the phone before arrival that a US-Ireland plug adaptor will be available (as opposed to the front desk/ concierge rummaging through a drawer then shrugging their shoulders). 
b) their website reminds guests of their free lobby wifi (believe for rooms as well but double check first) in anticipation of costly roaming charges. 
So it's also the little things ...
Cheers!",5,2017,08,31
200,Extraordinary Service & Courteousy,"The staff was exemplary and as courteous as any we've ever experienced. The cooked breakfasts were elegantly served, but could have been a bit fresher. We were disappointed with our Anniversary dinner. We ordered the same type of fish we had enjoyed the night before at a local restaurant and the Cellar's preparation was sub-par to the local fish restaurant's Nonetheless, we loved the Merrion..",5,2017,08,30
200,Grand hotel with wonderful services,"The Merrion has a terrific location. It is made up of four Grade 1 buildings adjoined. The layout is therefore a little unusual, but workable. Staff was fantastic. They assisted us with planning our excursions around Dublin. The private tour guides they connected us with were spectacular. Our every request was met with swift accommodation. They offer a tour of their art collection followed by a tea that was educational and delightful.",5,2017,08,30
200,Beyond Expectations,"First, Dublin is great.  It's like Orlando for Adults.  Good, clean, fun and full of bars and restaurants.  We had good weather the whole week.  The Merrion is a super 5 star hotel and Patrick Guibaud's lives up to it's 2 Michelin stars.  The bed is fabulous.  We bought sets of sheets and pillows.  The cellar bar makes GREAT Margaritas.  Better than Mexico or San Antonio.  Great location and history.",5,2017,08,30
200,30 august,Excellent . Fabulous hotel. great location.  lovely gardens . Looks like a private home from the front but a gorgeous  hotel inside. Amazing spa . Very friendly and lovely staff.Overall superb stay. Highly recommended.,5,2017,08,30
200,Outstanding hotel,"The Merrion is an old, lovely hotel in the heart of beautiful Dublin. We were only there overnight but if we were to return we would definitely stay there again.
The rooms were lovely, warm and inviting and altho we missed the Michelin star restaurant our dining experience was god.",5,2017,08,29
200,Lovely Hotel ,"We stayed here bank holiday and had a lovely time, we didn't stay around the hotel however when we did the Staff were really friendly and made a good effort to speak to us at any point, 

Lovely rooms with everything that was needed.

Location was a bit out the way but the weather was lovely and we enjoyed the walk. 
",4,2017,08,29
200,Polished luxury,"This is a great hotel that provides first-rate service.  The rooms and all amenities are well-done.  What I believe is the most important aspect,however, is that the staff are all very professional, friendly, and helpful.  The restaurants there are very pricey but the Merrion's great locations means that there are wonderful dining choices just a short walk away.",5,2017,08,28
200,Marquee hotel in Dublin,"Spend a lot of time in Dublin for business and pleasure and this is the marquee hotel in terms of luxury and service However it does come at a price. Great rooms with all the details there, however some are small and we had one in particular with a view onto an alleyway. Great basement bar and restaurant we often use if we are in town. Overall a great hotel but at the top end of the price scale",4,2017,08,28
200,Classy hotel with great location and without the drama,"This hotel is fantastic and not as ostentatious as say the Shelbourne which is dripping with opulence from the outside. Instead the Merrion leaves everything for the inside behind its lovely Georgian house exterior.

The staff are absolutely lovely and the service is first rate. We use the hotel for work and have found dealing with them to always be a pleasure and nothing is too hard to try and accommodate.

The rooms are great, clean and everything you'd expect from a five star hotel.

You have lovely tea rooms out the front and then a great casual dining spot down in the cellars below. There is also the famous two hatted Michelin restaurant, the only one in Dublin I believe.

If you want a fantastic hotel with a great location, then the Merrion is for you.",5,2017,08,27
200,Can't Go Wrong at the Merrion,"The Merrion is a classic luxury hotel with well appointed and nice sized rooms, top notch service, a central location, and beautiful decor in the public spaces.  The art on the walls and sculptures are museum quality.  We opted for a couple of the more casual neighborhood restaurants within 2 blocks - Matt the Thresher and The Unicorn (Italian) - rather than the pricey French food at Patrick Guilbaud (which is in the same building as the Merrion but not owned by them).  If you are having a drink at the bar or the beautiful patio, stick with wine.  As we discovered in Ireland, if you're used to ""American"" size pours on hard liquor drinks, you're going to have to order a triple and it will set you back about the price of a bottle of Grey Goose in the U.S.  The gardens were undergoing some renovation while we were there so we could not experience it's entire beauty but it is clear that keeping everything pristine at the hotel is the #1 priority.  When you book your room, make sure you specifically ask for one that is not next to an elevator shaft. They are a bit noisy.  We wound up moving rooms as a result  but they were extremely accommodating to resolve the issue.  The bathrooms had great showers and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Oh, and one more thing...It was the former residence of the Duke Of Wellington and you can find the plaque commemorating it next to one of the doors.",5,2017,08,27
200,Excellent and elegant hotel!,We stayed for two nights before our Windstar cruise to Norway and Iceland. I'm sorry we didn't stay a few more days. Beautiful hotel. Excellent service. Lovely afternoon tea! Excellent breakfast! Outstanding room with comfortable bedding. Can't say enough about this hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to make our short stay enjoyable.,5,2017,08,26
200,Such an amazing hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights with 2 young children and with grandparents.  We all absolutely loved it.  Arrived early after a redeye flight from the US and hotel staff worked hard to get us into a room as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast in the cellar and then let the kids play happily in the beautiful spa pool.  The suites were large, clean, and charming, and when we arrived we found champagne, chocolates, and kid-friendly bathrobes and bath products.  The grounds are just beautiful, and you cannot beat the location.  Staff was amazing--so gracious and helpful, whether you need a taxi, a pub recommendation, or reservations.  Indeed, my daughter had a bit of a tantrum one morning while in the throes of jet lag (while we were racing to get to an event), and not only did the Cellar staff go out of their way to get us everything quickly, they were kind to our daughter and even acted as if they were happy to see her again the next morning!  I can't see us ever staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2017,08,26
200,Great Dublin Destination Hotel,"We booked a three night stay at the Merrion as our launching point for a three day exploration of Dublin and the surrounding Irish countryside.  While we arrived with a list of activities and some ideas as to what we wanted to do, everyone from the bellman to the desk staff and concierge team were super helpful in insuring our plans were reasonable and representative of our visit goals.  In addition, the property itself is magnificent with beautiful artwork gracing the walls, warm and cozy places to sit, relax, have a drink or just ""people watch.""  The Merrion location made much of what we wanted to do in central Dublin walkable, with museums, historic sites and restaurants all nearby.  Overall, a great hotel.  The pictures on their website well represent the elegance and luxury of the property.",5,2017,08,26
200,"Merrion Hotel, Dublin","Regular business client - consistent high quality, friendly service! There are obviously cheaper options in Dublin, but in my mind The Merrion is top of the league for value. I will continue to use the Merrion for my regular business trips",5,2017,08,24
200,Truly sophisticated,"I never considered staying any other place on this visit to Dublin and the Merrion Hotel did not disappoint!  The setting, in a series of townhomes on a quiet street, provides  pure and perfect  Irish hospitality in an historic location.  The restaurants are excellent and the bar charming.  Impeccable service adds to the pleasure. It is within walking distance of all the major Dublin sights.",5,2017,08,23
200,A cultivated & cultural cocoon,"Warm, welcoming and efficient, The Merrion provides the highest  standards of modern hospitality and food in a Georgian ambiance - with a wonderful art collection. 'A team effort' by Staff and Management make for a wonderfully relaxed experience.",5,2017,08,23
200,Best hotel in Dublin,This is our 5th stay at the Merrion. We would not stay anywhere else! Top notch staff. Rooms impeccable. Location cannot be beat.Spectacular Spa-----perfect way to wake up in the morning or relax after shopping and sightseeing in the city.,5,2017,08,22
200,Nice but Cramped ,"The Merrion is a beautiful hotel with a lot of history, It's a nice classy elegant building but the bedrooms are very small.
I understand that there's not much that can be done about this in an old city building but I did find it a little claustrophobic.
I had the same issue with the breakfast room. There was a long queue for a windowless room in the basement.
But the lobby was gorgeous and it was decorated beautifully for Christmas.",3,2017,08,21
200,Top class,"Dublin has several 5 star hotels.
I stayed at THE MERRION because, in my opinion, it is above the others.
Excellent location. Quiet rooms. Elegant traditionally furnished public areas. Great heated pool, spa and gym. Charming garden courtyard with small water features. 
I experienced a Jr suite of generous size with perfect comfortable  sitting  area. 
Fantastic bed reminding the days of high beds in the Country Houses. You sleep as in heaven.
Marble bathroom with separate shower cabin and a very appreciated bidet. 
WIFI through out all hotel,  easy to connect and high speed.
Very good breakfast and restaurant.
A charming top class hotel build into three converted Georgian town houses plus a contemporary wing blending in, facing the garden courtyard. Elegant and with everything you expect.
Kind & well trained staff.
Could not be better !",5,2017,08,21
200,Simply the Best,"It doesn't get any better than this. The hotel is stunning, the flowers in the garden magical the public rooms magnificent, the room and bathroom wonderfully large stocked with lovely products and a working heated towel bar and as for the bed and linens you will not find anything finer. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and genuine. My hat goes off to each and every one there; from the doormen, to the bell staff, the front desk staff and the service staff in the restaurant.In  my 40 years of travelling this was in the top 5 of best all around. Everything here is perfect. Thank you for letting us have a most enjoyable time there.",5,2017,08,21
200,Wonderful Hotel In Dublin !,"The Merrion is a terrific hotel in a great location. The rooms are beautiful, the linens nice, the bathroom beautiful. overall a very comfortable stay. The staff is friendly and the concierge very helpful and kind. Breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant was great. Wished we would have stayed longer !",5,2017,08,21
200,Treat Yourself,"Our room was a garden view but there really wasn't a view of a garden. Still that didn't matter as the bed was amazing, beautiful linen, fresh and soft. The bathroom was gorgeous, beautiful bath and lovely toiletries.",5,2017,08,20
200,Doesn't get better than this,"The Merrion is simply superior in every way.  The room was stunning and comfortable, the public rooms were elegant but warm, and the staff was efficient and friendly.   There is simply no way to fault this hotel.",5,2017,08,19
200,I will stay no where but The Merrion when in Dublin,"Service that exceeds any that I have experienced elsewhere..hands down the best choice in Dublin.. has never failed to excel in the 10 years that I have been a guest. The location, accommodations, the staff are experts in pampering their guests. ..5 star all the way! simply the best!!",5,2017,08,18
200,One of the very best Hotels in Dublin,"It looks like, and is, a row of three or so Georgian buildings but behind those big doors is a quite big hotel. It's a five star masterpiece. Great service, beautiful rooms, great food, expensive drinks. Hey, it's five star. Very central location too. ONLY downside is that the government buildings (beautiful) are across the street so there's a lot of politicians milling about and that always leaves a bad smell.",5,2017,08,17
200,"Beautiful room, excellent service","We splurged for the junior suite, and it was a stunning room - really felt like a luxury experience.  The service was friendly, warm, and professional, and they delivered a special treat every day, which was an extra treat.  The workout area is a bit sad - dark and small, but everything else was great.  We really enjoyed the unique art collection as well.   Awesome location, close to most major sites.  Would definitely recommend the Merrion, especially the junior suite!",5,2017,08,17
200,Lovely garden ,"Stopped by for a touring break for drinks in the lovely hidden garden oasis. Top of the mark service and such a quite beautiful internal garden makes for a perfect place to take a relaxing break. Enjoy choosing from Lovely wine list, enjoy a coffee or lunch. ",5,2017,08,16
200,Perfect,"A perfect hotel situated in the centre of Dublin, beautiful decor and very helpful staff.  

The hotel was positioned in a lovely area of Dublin, and within easy access of the main city.  

We tried the on-site restaurant in the basement which was very good and highly recommended.

Would most certainly return.  ",5,2017,08,16
200,Best (by far) Hotel in Bath,"Wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Merrion during a recent visit to Ireland.  Was directed to the Merrion by a friend who worked in the resort business in Ireland.  He knew what he was talking about.  At check-in we were offered a glass of Irish Whiskey.  Perfect location, large rooms and bathrooms, great restaurants and bar...nice pool and spa....lovely.  Highly recommend.",5,2017,08,14
200,Great room poor wifi,"Great hotel and location. Excellent staff. Beautiful suite 
Great breakfast. Good quality very high  Nice job with laundry services. Beautiful foyer area. infuriating wifi. Nice swimming pool but gym could use improvement. ",4,2017,08,14
200,Highly recommend this hotel.,Excellent location and service. Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in the country this is by far one of the best can't recommend this hotel enough. Reservations staff were very helpful and organised a nice birthday surprise in the room upon arrival.,5,2017,08,13
200,Perfect location in Dublin,"We spent two nights at The Merrion, and were so pleased with our choice. The location is perfect, in the Georgian section, with Dublin close at hand, but a bit removed from too much city noise. The hotels rooms and public spaces are well-maintained and quite beautiful, with interesting artwork displayed throughout. The staff is attentive and welcoming. We dined in the adjoining Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, and enjoyed the high level of service and the delicious food. ",5,2017,08,13
200,Superb,Fantastic hotel in a superb location . Service cant be falted and food met all expectations . Atmosphere was lovely . Perf couples stay.. our room eas worth the stay highly recommend . No need to go past hotel restaurant,5,2017,08,12
200,Great Hotel,this was the second time we had stayed at the Merrion.  It was better the second time.  The staff and service was impeccable.  Our room was great.  Very centrally located.  Next time in Dublin we are definitely going to staff here again.,5,2017,08,12
200,Spotless and amazing beds,"This hotel has amazing, California king-size beds that made me so blissed out to collapse on each night. It's honestly the #1 thing I remember about The Merrion.

Nice breakfast and smooth check-in, no complaints there. The location is just OK, it is very convenient for the museums, although a bit of a trek (20-30min) to Guinness and the centre.

I came down with something here which made me feel awful. The turndown service maid was a godsend, I felt bad about it but she was very kind when I was sick. The Cellar restaurant also kindly sent up our food to our room when I had to rush out of the restaurant and specially made me a plain salad to eat when I couldn't stomach anything else (I wish I could have eaten it!).

Keeping me from giving it 5 stars:
-- The pipes in the toilet are REALLY loud. Every time we used them it would go on for ages afterwards -- this made for an unpleasant experience if you had to wake up to go to the bathroom.
-- The steam room and pool were nice but there is no sauna in the spa. Also the slippers they give you aren't very pleasant to walk around in in the wet.
-- We were told we got a room upgrade but I wasn't very impressed, our room overlooked the ceiling of the walkway below, so almost no view to speak of.

All in all a solid 4/5 and a nice stay in Dublin although it didn't exactly have the 'wow' factor, aside from the beds!",4,2017,08,12
200,Lovely hotel in a great location!,"We enjoyed a wonderful 3 night stay at the Merrion Hotel.  The staff was some of the best that we've encountered.  They were top notch!  We had two connecting rooms for our family of five.  Not exactly an ideal hotel for little kids but our teens enjoyed the luxury of this hotel.  Breakfast at the Cellar was fantastic and the excellent service continued.  Beds were very comfortable and rooms were light and airy.  Bathrooms were beautifully appointed and well done in white and grey color scheme.  One comment that I want to share was that the shower stall was very small (and my husband and I are tiny people).  My other comment was that there was no dresser or shelves to store our clothing which is never a deal breaker for me, but just a minor annoyance as it makes unpacking very tricky for two people.  The courtyard areas are lovely and if the weather cooperates, it is perfect to sit outside in the afternoon and have tea or an early cocktail.  My biggest complaint was that we encountered two different guests who were very rude to the staff at the Merrion.  Once upon check in and the other time at breakfast.  My teens were actually offended by the rudeness of the guests and they claimed that ""there were too many high maintenance guests"" at the hotel.  In both cases, the staff handled the situations very well and it is a good reminder that it is never acceptable to be rude.  The location is the best as the hotel in a quieter area of town but close enough to walk to many of the restaurants in town so you never have to call a cab/Uber.  We look forward to staying here again on another trip to Dublin.",5,2017,08,10
200,Beyond Compare,"The Merrion hotel is the best hotel in Dublin and it deserves this title.  I look forward to staying there anytime I am in Ireland.  The staff go beyond what is expected for them, and they are very genuine in their wishes for you to be completely happy in the hotel.  I love the food.  It is beautifully cooked and of top quality.  The breakfasts are amazing, the selection from the buffet if enormous and wonderful, as are the cooked items.  Rooms, beds and bathrooms are sparkling clean.  I particularly like the room that looks out to the amazing garden. If you are in Dublin and appreciate a hotel that is one of the best you can experience, then you must stay at the Merrion.  It is one of the Leading Hotels of the World.",5,2017,08,10
200,Classy establishment ,"Relatively unassuming from the outside but a joy to enter. Lovely traditional decor and artwork. First class staff who, without exception, were a joy. A very comfortable and well appointed room. And not expensive. What more could you ask. ",5,2017,08,09
200,Perfect in many ways.,"You can't recognize the hotel from the street.  It's charming, centrally located and the first floor makes you feel like you are in a giant living room.  The staff is amazing the rooms are great.  The courtyard is so serene and the artwork is among the best in any hotel in the world.",5,2017,08,07
200,Room adjacent to alley,"I agree with a previous poster that this hotel does not respect its affiliation with FHR. We arrived at 12:30. The lobby is simple and beautiful, and all the staff were lovely.
Via Amex platinum we have a guaranteed check-in at noon, at 11:30 we were told there was no room ready. We didn't mind at all--said  ""no big deal, we have lots to do. We are only here one night, have to leave early, so can we have a quiet room?"" Then we trotted off to walk around Dublin.  Had a ball on the Trinity historic walking tour went to Guinness, and dinner and back to the hotel exhausted around 9:30 to be brought to a room on the ground floor where the window is on ground level with a road. ""Um, this seems like it isn't going to be a quiet room.."" no! It is. 
Well, of course it isn't. Ground floor, it's not a busy street but-street noise and on top of that we were in the middle of a block of rooms of a family who are slamming doors and going into each other's rooms and shouting down the hallways until 1am! Surely management knew we were in their midst. 
Not sure what the morning will bring but I'm still up at 2am feeling frustrated by not insisting on checking in earlier when we were here. At the very least I thought our flexibility and cheerfulness wouldn't be a mark against us ! Oh well. A previous poster mentioned that they don't like the Amex Platinum partnership and this must be the case. Haven't yet had the breakfast or lunch included. But for the record-guaranteed early check in and room upgrade are a no-go here. ",2,2017,08,06
200,Great Location in Dublin,"Not only is the hotel top notch in every way, but it is also located in a very central part of the city.  The square where it is located is one of the most beautiful of the Dublin city squares.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,06
200,Great Old Hotel ... Excellent Service,"This wonderful old hotel is located in the heart of Dublin.  It is a short walk to shopping, pubs, and quaint restaurants.  The service at The Merrion is almost ""over the top"" in terms of quality of staff, helpfulness and efficiency.  Our room was very nice and the bedding was magnificent.  Breakfast was good and the drinks in The Cellar Bar were very well made by highly professional bartenders.  The Desk and Bell Staffs were especially nice and friendly ... no request was considered too small or insignificant.  We very much enjoyed our stay at The Merrion.",5,2017,08,06
200,I don't get it.,"I don't get why this hotel is reviewed as it is. Are the accommodations in Ireland in general less nice than in other parts of the world? I cannot figure out how this hotel merits so many five-star reviews. I am legitimately puzzled. The service is VERY GOOD--that I cannot fault. However, the facilities are kinda like if you were to go to an Eastern European country and stay at a hotel built pre-communism that has never come back to its former glory. The carpet is dingy, the lighting throughout the hotel is dim and yellow. The spa made me cringe and I left quickly. My bathroom looks like it is out of a hospital, except a hospital bathroom would not have the stained old marble tiles. First I was given a room that had a small industrial iron balcony with a large white blockade. This was to cover the sight of construction below. They quickly switched me (as I said, good service) to another room which, though it looked out on a chipped, painted black wall was much nicer as it had two windows that let in light (my sister later checked in and received my old room, so I didn't escape it). I wanted to get something special for my mother, so I booked her a very pricey ""special suite."" A ""special suite"" is a normal room with a desk blocking the old doorway. Attached is a colossal, semi-furnished room with a very tiny ""fire"", the electric sort that sends up colored mist. We laughed at this. My mother tried (and is trying, as I am still at the hotel) to be nice, since I booked the room to ""give her something special"" and the cost was substantial, but I caught her talking to the front desk and trying to vacate it (she could not, the hotel is fully booked). I am going to tell the whole truth in this review and here it is--I immediately burst into tears and fled to my room and cried while looking at the black, chipped wall. I felt like an absolute failure booking this hotel for my family (I booked a total of four rooms). I FEEL like an absolute failure, as I am still here. Now, it is true in general that I call myself spoiled. I don't live in splendor, but I live very nicely and am used to staying in very nice places. Here, the sheets are nice. The pillows are rather nice. The rest of it--I don't get it. In truth, I would give this hotel two stars for facilities, four or five for service. The food is neither good nor bad. This is the first place I have stayed in Dublin, the fourth in Ireland, and I have to say honestly--I just don't get it.",3,2017,08,06
200,5 Star Luxury Hotel,Outstanding 5 Star in City Centre of Dublin Ireland. Excellent location close to all the important site seeing venues and there is a Bank across the street. The Restaurant is also extremely good. Very good breakfast and the waitresses are very friendly and efficient. ,5,2017,08,06
200,Classy ," Nothing ostentetios. Just pure class.  Excellent location,  service and anything else you should expect to see  in the 5 star hotel. Nice beds, excellent  tea service, and the 2 star Michelin restaurant next door

200,The best 5 star in Dublin,"We wanted a light lunch and found just the thing in the Merrion lobby bar. We had the ""number 23"" each which consisted of a small bowl of delicious soup, a small assortment of (crust less) sandwiches and a small chocolate dessert. It just hit the spot. 
The surroundings are beautiful with some excellent decor and art. 
Just sit and de stress after a days shopping on Grafton Street. ",5,2017,08,04
200,Perfection,"This world class hotel is an unexpected delight. Impeccably managed with discrete service and understated elegance, the hotel is now undergoing a barely perceptible expansion/renovation that is sure to put it in the same league as Paris' Bristol and London's Connaught. Sumptuous indoor pool that rivals the pool at the Ritz in Paris. Quiet drawing rooms where tour groups mercifully would feel out of place. For those accustomed to privilege  who value tradition and luxury.",5,2017,08,03
200,Wonderful Experience,"We love to stay at the Merrion as it is a home away from home. Everyone is so welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate your every request. It is also a very beautiful hotel! The location is perfect with easy access to Grafton Street, the National Gallery, St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College.",5,2017,08,02
200,Afternoon Tea Review,"I am giving this review a rate of 3/5 purely based on my afternoon tea experience.

I was very underwhelmed by the experience I had last Saturday afternoon with a friend. 

The portions were very small.
Scones were not warm and clotted cream was straight out of the fridge so could not be spread.

On paper the savoury menu looks interesting and tasty but again everything was tiny and not filling.

I had to request two fresh pots of tea twice and they were left on a table behind me and I had to pour them myself several times and the teapots were extremely hot. I have never had to do that in any other hotel.

The desserts I have to say were beautiful and delicious - best part of the afternoon.

They appeared to not have enough staff on for the number of guests attending afternoon tea which is a real shame. Only when I made brief eye contact with a staff member they would come over and attend. Also, the tables are quite low too - I understand that may be the décor but just it doesn't do it for me.

I really had high expectations for this hotel given its reputation for being exquisite and beautiful, but I was let down immensely. €47 per person was not justified.

I am sure it is a fantastic hotel to stay in, but I would not be in a rush to go back for afternoon tea.",3,2017,08,02
200,first visit to ireland - excellent,"stayed at the Merrion on the recommendation of a colleague who said it was the best hotel he ever stayed at.    After staying two nights, I put in my own top 10!!  This has a great location, excellent staff, sumptuous breakfast and overall of the charts experience.  Highly recommend!!",5,2017,08,01
200,Excellent,"Really lovely bar food in Cellar bar.  Very well priced and wonderful staff 
Great location for meeting with friends and a wonderful choice of drinks 
Would recommend it for groups as a few lovely alcoves
Will be back",5,2017,07,31
200,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed in four different hotels in Dublin around St Stephen's Green that are all in the same price range.  Last week, I tried The Merrion Hotel - it is my new favourite of them all.

I arrived in the morning and my room was not yet ready.  However, they offered the spa to me to wash up and get ready for the day - it was more than adequate.  They also took my bags, and flawlessly had them waiting for me in my room when I got back in the evening.

Front desk service was impeccable. The agents were professional, efficient and friendly, and provided for a terrific experience. I did not try the Michelin star restaurant, but did have breakfast downstairs (not bad, a bit expensive).  Rooms were large, beautiful, and classy.  Premises are also elegant and relaxing - I ate my takeout dinner in one of the interior courtyards which was very nice.  

I would love to come back to The Merrion.  If I ever bring my family to Dublin, it will be my hotel of choice.  I wish I had more time to spend at this hotel and enjoy more of what it has to offer.",5,2017,07,30
200,Golf Travel,"Place is awesome, don't waste your time going anywhere else. Service is excellent and the staff is very attentive. We ate in the excellent Cellar Bar and used the hotel as a hub for golf travel in the NE part of Ireland.",5,2017,07,30
200,Elegance Personified,"Everything is great about this hotel.  From the reception, to the room service, to the 23 Bar.  Just perfect.  Bed was so comfortable, the shower has great pressure, and the location could not have been better.  Plus, Toners pub is just around the corner!",5,2017,07,30
200,Top Shelf,The Merrion hotel is a true gem the city. World class accommodations presented with exceptional service and style. A wonderful experience. My family and I will certainly make this our Dublin home away from home.,5,2017,07,29
200,Outstanding in Every Way,On a recent trip to Ireland we had two occasions to stay at The Merrion and found it one of the nicest hotels we've ever visited.  The staff was incredibly helpful.  The room was well appointed and comfortable.  The breakfasts were superb.  And the hotel was well located for walking everywhere.  We hope to return before too long.,5,2017,07,26
200,Truly excellent!,"This is a truly warm wonderful place where the staff are excellent and treat you beautifully.  The location is excellent for walking around and seeing the sights.  The food in the restaurant is truly excellent.  It is like a wine vault.  I loved the atmosphere.  Very warm and comfortable. The food was great and they easily accommodated my vegan diet with a gourmet healthy meal.  We visited both bars and loved both.  It seems the parlor bar is open for as long as you would like to stay.  How great is that?  But we didn't stay long.  Just liked knowing we could.  It is a very traditional place.  I thought the rooms were very comfortable and traditionally decorated.   The funny thing I noticed is that if you want to blow dry your hair or curl it in the bathroom, it really isn't possible.  This is common in England and Ireland.  It seems the only outlet usually only accommodates a man's shaver.  I look forward to going back.  If you are looking for something hip and happening, this may not be the choice for you.  If you are looking for 5 star everything, you will be pleased!",5,2017,07,25
200,Fantastic Lunch visit,"Went to the Cellar bar for lunch. Service was exemplary, very friendly but professional at the same time. The drinks and lunch were delicious. Following this, went for a drink on the terrace outside, beautiful setting and a very enjoyable afternoon all in. Would highly recommend.",5,2017,07,25
200,:),"Amazing place to stay absolutely gorgeous and the food is amazing very clean place to stay as me and my wife have gone travelling too class and would definitely recommend to friends, me and my wife loved it",4,2017,07,24
200,Excellent and Elegant,"This is a grand hotel in a perfect city location near St. Stephen’s Green and Merrion Square. This is the elegant part of old Dublin and the hotel is understated in the way that only grand dames can be. I was here as the guest of a Dublin headquartered organization and they actually chose this hotel. It was my first stay and I was very impressed. I’ve stayed at many Dublin hotels over the years and I must say this is by far the most charming. Service, style, amenities and food are all first rate. The hotel itself has won most every #1 category in Dublin hotels over the years and I am not surprised. I look forward to my return. Do take some time and a brochure to appreciate the fine art here especially the Paul Henry landscapes.",5,2017,07,24
200,A beautiful hotel,"We arrived in Dublin at the end of a wonderful week's holiday in Ireland and the Merrion was the perfect ending. From the smiles and friendliness of the Staff, the care taken over every detail, the simply beautiful accommodation - the Merrion truly manages to make you feel cosseted and privileged to stay there - a real jewel.",5,2017,07,24
200,Beautiful hotel.,"We were welcomed like we were old friends and happy to see us.
The service was beyond works. All of the help could not be more
upbeat and truly wanted to be helpful in every situation.
Dinner was lovely in the cellar and we had scones for breakfast in the
library the next morning. Unfortunately we were on our way to a cruise.
Would like to have stayed another day or two.",5,2017,07,24
200,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel, great staff and excellent rooms. Couldn't do enough to help us and even managed to extend our stay when the hotel was fully booked. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. We had a ground floor room but didnt hear any noise from outside (next to quiet street), the air con unit is individually controlled and worked well.

A special note was the complimentary shoe shining service, I placed my shoes outside the door at 2.30am and they had been thoroughly cleaned and shined by the time I woke up at 9am. Indicative of the great service available. ",5,2017,07,24
200,Truly five star experience every time.,"Have stayed at The Merrion on four different occasions now and every time has been a truly five star experience.  Every thing is smooth from arrival to departure.  Have stayed in different rooms between the Garden wing and the Main House and although they have been different in size and amenities, each have been luxurious with everything you need for a comfortable stay. 

Have dined in the cellar restaurant during each stay and have always found the food to be excellent and beautifully presented.  Looking forward to when restaurant is moved to first floor so garden views can be enjoyed while dining!

The staff are always most pleasant and courteous and attend to your every requirement.

This is one of our most favorite hotels and we can't help going back again and again.  Looking forward to our next stay, hopefully soon.",5,2017,07,21
200,Annual Return Visit,"Started staying at The Merrion many years ago and make sure that I visit at least once a year. Just returned from a 4 day trip and not disappointed. The staff are excellent from the moment you arrive until departure, always great to have a chat with and will go out of their way to help.
So far we have only stayed in the Garden Wing as the view is pleasant. At the moment there is building work, and some noise, from a new wing being developed opposite this Wing. However, you are warned about his when booking and is only weekdays 9-5 and should be completed later this year - did not find this to be a problem.
The rooms are very well furnished with lovely bathrooms, good soundproofing and always great housekeeping.
Recent improvements include a new glass passage to the Garden Wing which has made the Drawing Rooms quieter and more private and has allowed extension to the Terrace area.
Definitely the best 5 star hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,07,21
200,Nice hotel but,"Nice hotel but
We went there because of the reviews.   It was a mistake to overlook the negative reviews because they were right about everything.  The terrible breakfast, the bad food at their Patrick whatever Michelin restaurant, the attitude of the staff, the small rooms, the noise from construction….This is not a five star hotel, it is a 4.  Next time, will stay at the Shelbourne or The Brooks.  You have been warned.",3,2017,07,19
200,Absolutely Perfect!,"From the welcoming bellmen in top hats to the warm front desk staff, everyone at The Merrion could not be more helpful. 

Our room was spacious, as was the beautiful marble bathroom with separate bathtub and shower and 2 sinks. Our bed was ever so comfortable with luxurious linens and down comforter. The Merrion robes are super fluffy and the slippers comfortable.

We were staying at the hotel as part of a theater tour, so enjoyed our buffet breakfast every morning in the private Wellington room, with spectacular high ceilings, plaster work and chandeliers. I felt like royalty while I enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast. 

If you are visiting Dublin, the Merrion is a must!",5,2017,07,19
200,Consistently Excellent,Stayed at the Merrion for two nights in July. This was our second time to the hotel and we were not disappointed. The staff maintains a level of excellence that is found in very few hotels. Always warmly welcomed and professionally looked after. Our room was lovely and well appointed. Fabulous bed and linens. Everything you could think of is provided for you. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.,5,2017,07,19
200,Great Location,Very stylish hotel in the heart of the city of Dublin. The different attached buildings are a little confusing and distracting. Rooms very nice and roomy. Staff was a little mixed up at times which shocked me for a high end hotel.,4,2017,07,19
200,2 night stay,"My second visit to this hotel. Despite being a little further from the centre than say the Westbury, it remains a favourite. Rooms are of a generous size and service is faultless. The cellar bar makes a mean cocktail!!",5,2017,07,19
200,This hotel is perfection ,"Where do I begin... my husband and I chose to celebrate our wedding here last year and it truly was the best day. Everything was perfect. The team in the Merrion made everything so stress free. Our family and friends still talk about how well they were looked after. The service, food and professionalism were outstanding. Thank you for making our day something we will treasure for ever. ",5,2017,07,18
200,outstanding hotel,"we stayed 3 nights at the merrion - was excellent from rooms to attentive staff
could not ask for better experience

my family and i arrived in the morning- we had 2 rooms and we were able to get into one early to freshen up from redeye flight",5,2017,07,18
200,Best Stay at The Merrion Ever! I love this hotel.,"My sisters and I stayed here recently for the weekend. And we were pampered and spoiled by the wonderful staff from start to finish. Our room was gorgeous - I love how the bathrooms at The Merrion are so spacious - and we received a free bottle of champers upon arrival.

We ate in the Cellar Bar one night - lovely food and fab service.

There is one particular aspect of the stay that I would like to highlight, because it was the highlight for me. I booked into the Tetra Spa for a fitness massage. My therapist was a truly wonderful and gorgeous lady called Esther. She was incredible and even spent extra time on my massage to get out all my knots. She was friendly, funny - such a beautiful person and a real delight to be with.

So I would like to send my thanks to Esther for a wonderful experience in the Spa - and for the lovely little sorbet at the end (what a treat.)

The Merrion is luxurious, it is plush, it is in the best location - but most of all it is the staff that make The Merrion the best place to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,07,18
200,Understated Elegance,"We've stayed here on a couple of occasions, attended a wedding and frequented the cellar bar countless times! It has never disappointed. We stayed once in the old house and once in the garden wing. Love the old house, it's  character and rooms, while the garden wing is modern and spacious. If I'm ever asked to recommend a hotel in Dublin, it's always The Merrion! Excellent rooms, excellent service, lovely atmosphere. Am quite partial to their afternoon tea too!",4,2017,07,18
200,"First class, friendly, fantastic.","From the moment we drew up outside the hotel the staff were very friendly attentive and helpful.  This extremely well appointed hotel is second to none and perfectly positioned near Merrion Square and St.Stephen's Green for access to shopping, restaurants, etc.  Our room was very quiet, overlooking the garden and beautifully decorated.  This was our first visit to the Merrion and is is now our favourite stop in Dublin.   Very highly recommended.",5,2017,07,16
200,Best Hotel experience!,"We have returned to the Merrion every summer for years and it is far and away our favorite hotel...anywhere! It is the perfect combination of old world glamour with modern accommodations. The best part of our experience is always the people. The Merrion staff is by far the best we have experienced. They are professional, welcoming and kind. There is not a request they can't handle. All in all, an amazing experience...thank you, Bernie and crew!",5,2017,07,16
200,Brief but special visit ,"My husband and I stayed here in March 2017 for one night as a special treat to celebrate his nomination for a teaching award. From the moment we pulled up in the car we were made feel special. Our room was large, elegant and spotlessly clean. Breakfast the next morning was just stunning. We couldn't have picked a better hotel to spoil ourselves. We will definitely find another reason to return. ",5,2017,07,15
200,DON'T GO,"My exact specification was a quiet, safe room, however I received the opposite twice and a promise of rectifying it by the manager (Garrett) but when I later asked he completely ""forgot"" the conversation. I'd recommend anywhere else",1,2017,07,14
200,Exceptional stay,"Just back from an amzing experience in the merrion hotel,  It was a great place to stay. The staff were very welcoming , the food was lovely and the rooms were tastefully decorated and comfortable.",5,2017,07,14
200,Just a lovely hotel! ,"Here for the weekend between Paris (Le Tremoille Hotel) and London (the Mondrian).  Beautifully appointed rooms, charming staff, fabulous art collection and terrific breakfast.  Go to the Shelburne for the lively bar but stay here! ",5,2017,07,13
200,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merion Hotel in Dublin is the absolute nicest place in all of Ireland.  Our stay there was a gift from my brother in law.  I have just finished a year of cancer treatment.  The staff were the best I have ever experienced.  The room, the food, the location--were all beyond excellent!!",5,2017,07,13
200,Lovely Dublin hotel,"This hotel in Dublin is a beautiful place, the staff could not be friendlier and the location is perfect for sightseeing in Dublin.  The rooms are large and extremely comfortable.  We will not hesitate to stay here next time we go to Dublin, one of our favorite cities in the world!",5,2017,07,13
200,Pure Elegance and A Five Star Experience,"This hotel is in a category that is hard to find these days. You are greeted by white gloved and top hatted bellmen, and reception at check in makes sure they accompany you personally to your room. The hotel is understated on the outside, and this adds to its charm, and it is exceptionally classy on the inside blending contemporary and antique decor and furnishings. However, the art collection is a site to see in itself as there is a special self guided tour you can take with the brochure they have explaining each piece of art. While we had a standard room, the bed was exceptionally comfortable (one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in) and the marble bathroom, toiletries were top notch. The highlight of our stay here was the gourmet dinner at the hotel's world famous Patrick Guillard restaurant.",5,2017,07,13
200,Wonderful Historic Townhouse Hotel,"We finished our trip to Ireland with three nights in Dublin, and happily we stayed at the Hotel Merrion.  Located in three historic Dublin townhouses (one of which was the Duke of Wellington's childhood home), the hotel is luxurious in an understated way, and very charming.  It's location is excellent, and the service is first rate.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,07,12
200,Outstanding service,"Not only is the Merrion a gorgeous hotel in a central Dublin location, the staff are the most friendly and professional I have ever encountered, and I travel frequently.  No request was too small, and every effort was made constantly to ensure guests were treated with royal respect.",5,2017,07,12
200,The Merrion is special,The Merrion is in a unique location proximate to just about everything. Access to the DART is great and up around the bend is some of the nicest dining. Their Concierge could not be more helpful and all the recommendations and advice were spot on. ,5,2017,07,12
200,Wonderful!,"This was our second trip to Ireland, and we knew we had to stay at the Merrion again.  The hotel is under renovation, and should be awesome when finished. There was construction noise during the day, but who spends time in a hotel room while in Dublin? Overall, we were as pleased with this hotel as we were 5 years ago.  The beds are comfy, the bathroom is large, and the Cellar bar is cozy with great drinks and staff. We also love the fabulous location, near great restaurants, pubs and public places.  We will stay agin if we return to Ireland.",5,2017,07,11
200,Excellent city,Hotel definitely five star with service to go with it ! The bedroom I had was in wonderful taste so calm and cool in a perfect state of repair as was the bathroom with very high quality Asprey amenities. The room was also a very good size and extremely comfortable the beds were superb quality as was the bed linen I shall return shortly!,5,2017,07,11
200,The best of the best!,"We stayed one night at the Merrion during the middle of a two-week trip to Scotland and Ireland. Wish we'd spent more time in Dublin, but we're not really city people so we were eager to move on to the Dingle Peninsula. But in retrospect we should have given this fabulous city more than one day, and the Merrion more than one night.

We'd booked a king room in the main house, and surprise surprise - when we checked in we found they'd upgraded us (no charge) to a huge suite! This was extremely welcome - we'd just come from Scotland where we had a very tiny room, so the extra space was a treat. 

The luxury factor was the max...from the moment you walk in, through the check-in process, to the staff member taking us to our room (sincere apologies to the young man who brought us and our luggage there - we'd just arrived and hadn't had a chance to obtain any cash yet so weren't able to tip him - which didn't seem to faze him at all). The room itself is spectacular - pictures don't do it justice.  The bathroom is enormous and deluxe in every way.  We had several questions, and the desk staff were always friendly and quick to answer. They also happily stored our luggage for the day after we checked out, so we could tour the city before collecting it and moving on.

The public rooms are exquisite, and the art collection fabulous! We also took advantage of the afternoon tea as a nice relaxation after our day of touring the city. It was served with aplomb, and certainly the setting can't be beat!

The only criticism I can offer is that we had dinner in the cellar restaurant, which was delicious, but the service was severely slow. After dinner we wanted a light dessert, but it took forever for the waitress to return to take our orders. We both ordered the mango sorbet, but then it literally took 40 minutes for it to arrive. We were both very tired after our journey and would have much preferred to spend that time enjoying our luxurious room rather than sitting in the restaurant, charming as it was! Given how splendid everything else was at the Merrion, I would suggest management have a wee chat with the wait staff in the Cellar restaurant, especially when they have a couple of very tired looking tourists fading in their chairs. I hesitate to only give four starts for service, given how wonderful everything else was, but this was a notable lapse.

Feeling as if we only dipped our toes in all that Dublin has to offer, we will return, and will stay at the Merrion.",5,2017,07,10
200,Small Boutique Hotel the tics all the boxes,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel for 2 nights, and yes, it lives up to the hype.  After traveling the world for 30 years one can figure out very quickly how a hotel runs.  Obviously, the management here has done a great job of creating a culture of high end service.  Staff on all levels knows how to cater to guest needs.  This is certainly is a 5 star property with a great location, we would certainly considering returning to this property.",5,2017,07,10
200,"Loved the Merrion, Dublin","Although the Merrion looks rather plan, everything changes once you are met by the door man.  Inside is filled with many wonderful antiques.  Everything was first class.  The spa area and especially the swimming pool is to be experience...totally magic.",5,2017,07,10
200,Discreet with impeccable service,I have been privileged to stay at The Merrion many times whilst in Dublin. It should have been more stays but the hotel is often full. It is central but well away from the clatter of many Dublin hotels. The Merrion sits in my top ten places to stay alongside The Grand Hyatt Tokyo and The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai. Splendid!,5,2017,07,10
200,Good location but...,"First of all, there was major construction and it was never disclosed to us, which put a damper on spending any time in or around the hotel. Secondly, for what they charge, a simple cup of coffee or tea in the morning is not too much to ask for. Instead, an outrageously priced cup is available in the main parlor.

Overall, the old-world charm of a classic high-end hotel is there, but they need to start catering to a younger clientele.

Family-wise, I can't picture my children, when they were younger, being welcomed there.",4,2017,07,09
200,Hidden Gem,"Behind a seemingly ordinary brick facade is a beautifully renovated hotel.  What was the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington offers lovely courtyards, well appointed rooms and charming cellar restaurant.  Service was excellent and the location can't be beat.   Appreciated that they could offer us connecting rooms for the kids.",4,2017,07,08
200,Beautiful,This hotel focuses on service.  It also has an impressive art collection spread throughout the hotel.  The business center is small but I was able to print my boarding passes.  It is pricey but worth it for a special occasion.,5,2017,07,08
200,Great place in the heart of Dublin!,We were able to walk to most places and really experience top notch service during our stay at the Merrion. I highly recommend this hotel and check out the cellar bar. It is unique and original to the building. ,5,2017,07,08
200,Shame about the noise,"The Merrion is a beautiful, very elegant hotel with delightful public and private rooms to match. The staff were courteous, friendly and helpful and the meals we ate there were excellent. Our only criticism relates to noise, and if you are untroubled by extraneous noise at night then this is certainly the place to stay in Dublin. We, however, had stressed both to the agent who booked our trip and to the reception staff when we checked in, that we wanted a quiet room well away from lifts, extraction units or other audible machinery, as we preferred to open windows at night rather than use the in-room air conditioning. Sadly, when we opened our windows in room 201 at bedtime, we discovered that two vents - each with a grill about 16' x 8' in size, and which are located in the central courtyard gardens, rumbled all night as well as all day. We later learned that these ventilate the beautiful cellars with lovely vaulted ceilings, where the dining rooms and kitchens are located. We found the noise from these excessive and so had to keep the windows closed. The in-room air conditioning was not quiet either so was also switched off, and our night was therefore hot and stuffy.
We realise we should have asked for a different room for our second night, but we were now tired and with a very busy second day prearranged we couldn't face the upheaval, as we were due to leave on the day following that.
We're happy to recommend this hotel, but for anyone needing a quiet bedroom we would strongly advise you to check with the windows open before accepting a room, because many bedrooms in addition to 201, which overlook the courtyard garden, must be similarly affected by the kitchen/restaurant ventilation.",4,2017,07,07
200,Expensive but the hotel is not value for the charged price.,"Terrible quality breakfast (continental) at 24 Euro's with a room at 410 Euro's a night. Horrible quality of sliced ham and/or the ""sweaty"" cheese slices. They didn't even bother to serve rehydrated prunes without the stones. Restaurant patrick Guilbaud is fine. Rooms are noisy.",2,2017,07,07
200,You must read my review,"The hotel did not disclose that construction was going on.  We requested a very quiet room but not only we had a view of the construction, it was so unbearable we had to leave our room early in the morning.  We took a couple of pictures and videos and showed them to reception.  They promised to “do something about it” and did not.  The room they gave us was very small.  In the bathroom there was no sufficient space for our amenities. We wanted a special place to celebrate an anniversary and they recommended a restaurant.  We did not know it was in the hotel.  They did not disclose it to us.  When we went there it was too late to obtain any other reservation.  The restaurant both extremely boring, stuck up and extremely expensive for what it is.  The food despite the two Michelin stars was incredibly mediocre.  The staff looked depressed.  One dish was so salty it was not eatable.  We spent about 600 euros.  When we returned to the room the turn down service was not done. Every step of the way, if you do not tip, you do not get a smile.  In the breakfast room it was a miracle to obtain a croissant.  The buffet was miserable.  I have never seen such a small and poor buffet.  It looked like a cheap hotel’s buffet.  The soy milk was old a turned when poured into my coffee.  There was bad smell in the elevators all the time and very strong smell of pesticide in the corridors.   After returning from our day excursion we had to insist to have supper in the drawing room or in the bar because the receptionist told us it was not feasible and we had to eat in our room.  We of course refused as it was advertised that room service menu could be served 24 hours a day across from the reception.  These are the main issues. We are members of the LHW.",1,2017,07,07
200,Amazing hotel and experience,"Great hotel, superb service, great breakfasts and good location. If you can afford this hotel as it's up there in price, this is a great place to stay in Dublin. Loved the pool as did laps each day and had a wonderful hot stone massage on last day. Staff are so well trained they predict your every need.",5,2017,07,06
200,Delightful sojourn in Dublin,"Service is amazing, rooms are pretty and great location in the city.  Felt coddled from the moment I arrived to when I left.  Cellar bar for dinner in the hotel is a must.  Front desk was extremely helpful with ideas, arranging driver for the countryside and directions.",5,2017,07,05
200,The host with the most,"Merrion strikes you as an elite and non-friendly establishment as you approach the laneway but, that sentiment disappears as soon as the cab door opens....sublime! Doormen are hospital, greeting was personable, rooms, though a bit antiquated, were lovely. A rather robust renovation was the only draw back",4,2017,07,01
200,EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE AGAIN!,"The Merrion Hotel is my absolute favourite whenever I visit Dublin, whether for business or pleasure.  I have been staying at the hotel for over 5 years and have never had a bad experience.  This time, my wife and I were upgraded to the Lord Monckton Suite in the Main House which was an amazing suite of world class rooms....a really memorable experience.  The changes being made to the hotel, including the new restaurant will simply make it even better.",5,2017,07,01
200,First Class Hotel,"First Class 5 star hotel. Excellent service comfortable room overlooking the central courtyard. Well situated in the centre of Dublin within 15 minutes of Trinity College. They are building a new restaurant on the side of the lovely central courtyard with its statue of James Joyce and water feature. If you wish to sleep after 11am book elsewhere. Otherwise the noise is not intrusive. The work is scheduled to be finished by September early October when the Cellar restaurant, where breakfast is served, will be transferred. Not cheap but you pay for that little feeling of luxury. There is a 2 star Michelin restaurant attached to the hotel and another restaurant nearby called the Pearl Brasserie, both of which are excellent and are described separately by me on Tripadvisor. The staff were all great especially in The Cellar Bar in the basement which is a relaxed place to meet, drink and eat. Afternoon tea in the lounge with its Irish paintings is very posh.",5,2017,06,30
200,An Elegant Oasis in the Heart of Dublin,"We stayed here at both the beginning and end of an extended rail tour of Ireland. 

We really enjoyed our Junior Suite in the ‘older’ (Main House) part of the hotel - high ceilings, a large bathroom with huge tub and a nice big bed. All of the amenities were perfect as was the seamless service experience. We had a chance to try the well equipped spa as well for a massage and both the actual treatment and the spa/gym facilities were excellent. One tip is to check out the steam room or pool if you have a chance.

The location is very central, short steps to St. Stephen's Green and within strolling distance of several of the national museums as well as Trinity College. Pubs and restaurants abound nearby and one of the best restaurants in Dublin is right next door. 

All in all a great property in a great location and truly a place to stay if you are in Dublin.",5,2017,06,29
200,Beware Hotel Construction,Overall The Merrion is a great hotel in a very good location with fantastic service. However the construction at the hotel is terribly disappointing.  Our superior garden view room overlooked a construction site-photos attached. I would recommend staying elsewhere until construction is complete-it is messy and noisy. The hotel tries to minimize the extent of construction. Also not ideal for children.,3,2017,06,29
200,4 Day stay belated Anniversary trip. January 2017,"They hotel is very nice.  The indoor pool, steam room, and spa is great.  I give the massage therapist give five stars.  They give a signature skin treatment with massage for no additional cost.  The private bar for hotel guests was very nice.  The breakfast was delicious each morning, with the except of bacon, the Irish version of bacon is much different than USA bacon, theirs is almost like Canadian bacon. The housekeeping was great and room service was nice too.  The overnight staff were great and very helpful, thank you Keenan and  His co-worker.  We didn't get our wake up call on our last night before flight back to USA , arr.  Over attentive at times, example would call to see if we got ice bucket delivered to room or extra pillow for instance.  Housekeeping broke a Glass in the bathroom and missed a piece that almost cut my foot on.  Antonio (From Brazil) was great in housekeeping.   We did have issue with with the refrigerator, maintenance guy state it work when it didn't, water/condesation inside refrigerator (like warm) he was also condescending to my wife, with rude comments.  Another nicer gentleman brought a replacement refrigerator the next day.  The art work in the hallways and Christmas tree were very nice.  The protester were very loud one day outside city hall? Protesting for under privileged people looking for affordable housing. Not sure if this protest was something that happens every week or something that's just happens randomly?  The Michelin pastry Chef made some delicious little desserts cupcakes for my wife and I for our anniversary and some tangerines and got a nice bottle of champagne.  I was feeling a little sick and front desk guy  was nice enough to have someone get me some hot herbal tea one day and gave me directions to nearest pharmacy. The German concierge guy I was very nice as well we had some very intellgent conservations and he gave good suggestions on things to see.  Strange toilet seat, smaller than the toilet rim. A lot of celebrities stay here.",4,2017,06,28
200,Will stay again,The Merrion is very well located in Dublin.  Understated entrance but once inside it is very sophisticated.  The staff goes out of their way to meet your needs. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.,5,2017,06,27
200,Always a pleasure ,"The Merrion is one of Dublin's best hotels  and a real gem. Old world style & elegance. Service is excellent and staff always willing to go that extra mile. Highly recommended, particularly good for business meetings. ",4,2017,06,26
200,Sophisticated but comfortable,"Great hotel for service, comfort, food and amenities.  Great location in walking distance of many excellent restaurants and historic sites.  The courtyard cafe appeared to be a wonderful place, but we were never able to be seated since it was perpetually fully occupied.  I suggest that hotel guests be given some priority.",5,2017,06,26
200,Always a favourite . . .,"I travel to Dublin quite a lot. I either stay at the Westbury or the Merrion. I think I may lean a little in favour of the Merrion as I feel the staff do go a bit out of their way to make my stays special and I love the massive ceiling heights of the old rooms.

The position is great, just around the corner from St Stephen's Green and an easy walk to Grafton Street. 

Lovely restaurant with vaulted ceiling in the basement. 

I will definitely be staying there again.   ",4,2017,06,25
200,RELAXING SPOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESS,"I found that the city of Dublin was rather ugly and dull.  If you are not into pubs and crowds an a not so pretty city, the Merrion Hotel is the place for you.  Just off Merrion Square, this hotel is a quiet relief to the mess outside. The inside garden is lovely with a little patio where you can order food.  The style of the hotel is period with all the modern touches that you need for a nice stay.  While not cheap, the rooms in the Garden block I think preferable to those in the actual 4 town houses that make up the older part of the hotel.  The rooms are really large and well equipped with baths including tubs and a separate shower. There is much more room in those rooms than in the main hotel as they include two chairs and a coffee table which in the main hotel make the rooms appear crowded.
Plus in the Garden rooms, you have direct access to the pool and the Cellar breakfast restaurant.  There is also a wonderful little pub call The Cellar which was an old wine cellar.  
In the main hotel is the tea room and another whiskey bar which are also nice and used a lot by locals.
There are other hotels doted all over Dublin, but the Merrion is a great place where you can walk to everything like Trinity College and a little farther away Temple Bar where there is even more pubs and people. Bless the Merrion for being such a relaxing place in the middle of this crowded city.",5,2017,06,25
200,An amazing experience,"The Merrion Hotel is the ONLY place I would choose to stay when in Dublin.  Every aspect of the experience is exceptional, from the facilities to the food, but the staff is what makes this hotel amazing.  Without exception each and every staff member is an embodiment of perfect service.",5,2017,06,22
200,Exceptional Hotel,Great location!  Walking distance to so very much! Cellar bar at hotel is lovely & fun! Rooms are truly pretty and staff went above & beyond to assist us. The massages we had at the hotel were very inexpensive and FABULOUS!  This is a privately owned hotel and the attention to detail was amazing!,5,2017,06,21
200,mother/daughter trip,"We stayed in Dublin for four nights at the Merrion hotel and it was amazing. I arranged an airport transfer and there was some kind of a mix up and we were left waiting for our ride for about a half hour. The concierge made sure we had transportation asap and took it off our bill for us having to wait! We arrived a little early for check in, but luckily we didn't have to wait long for our room to be ready. They would store your luggage while you went out if there was going to be a long wait. Every time we were in the lobby area there was at least 6 people waiting to help you with whatever you could possibly need. From the doorman, to the front desk, to housekeeping everyone was so nice and helpful! The bed was amazing and so comfy! I have never said that about a hotel before. Even the pillows were perfect for this side sleeper. Overall, best hotel I've stayed at anywhere.",5,2017,06,21
200,Brilliant ,"Stayed here a few weeks ago with my husband. Great rooms, great facilities and good staff. 

The bed was comfy, the shower was great and the water pressure was perfect. 

We really felt welcome here and will definitely come back, thank you for a great stay. ",4,2017,06,18
200,Perfect stay at the grand old dame ,Beautiful hotel with a really lovely drawing room. Hotel is undergoing some upgrading work but don't let that stop you from staying here. It's got great staff and a short 15min walk from the main shopping street: ,5,2017,06,18
200,wedding anniversary,"merrion hotel what can we say , from the moment we arrived until we left it was just beatiful.we celebrate our 15 year wedding anniversary.spa treatment just wonderfull, got upgraded to a merrion suite( thank you for the litlle cakes and fruits) , dinner at the michellin restaurant was wonderfull, afternoon tea was such a nice experience. a big thank you from us to all the staff that made our anniversary so special.",5,2017,06,18
200,The best hotel experience in Ireland,"The Merrion hits top rating in every aspect of hospitality.   The environment, the quality of public areas and bedrooms and especially the compete staff team are outstanding.   They have the ability to make you feel at home and valued. B",5,2017,06,18
200,5 star elegance,"We loved the Merrion.  Old world elegance in the original Georgian structure with a new addition of spacious modern rooms surrounding a beautiful garden.  There ar e 2 restaurants, one which is Michelin starred.  Front door and front desk service is fantastic.  A new wing with private residences is being added so there was a bit of construction noise.  This was not a bother since we were touring all day.",5,2017,06,16
200,Brilliance,"The most conscientious staff,  amidst excellent facilities and a hotel that takes full advantage of its prime city centre location for its customers, The Merrion is the best hotel in terms of quality, authenticity, and humanity that I've ever had the pleasure to stay in.",5,2017,06,16
200,Magnificent Hotel,My husband and I stayed 5 wonderful days in this gorgeous hotel; the staff went above and beyond to be helpful and could not have been more professional and friendly. If it were possible to do so I would give this hotel a higher rating.,5,2017,06,14
200,Merrion - excellent choice,"The Merrion is a first class hotel. Our room was wonderful, the hotel is conveniently located with plenty for travelers to do and see.

The only downside is the remodeling project currently, however, we were there on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, so no interruptions to our stay.",5,2017,06,14
200,Disappointed in the Art Tea,"I took my parents here to celebrate a special anniversary and booked the afternoon art tea. Getting a reservation was straightforward if you e-mail the hotel. 

We were disappointed with the art tea. I trust TA wholeheartedly and had read wonderful things about the afternoon tea, but we had a very different experience from others. We had to constantly ask the waiters to refill our cups, only one of the four sandwiches were tasty and the pastries were too sweet. The tea was also brewed for too long and was very bitter by the time we got to a second cup. This happens with tea leaves, but at a five star hotel, you'd expect more.

There were businessmen walking in and out of the parlor where the tea was served and we felt like we were seated next to a highway. For the price, go elsewhere. The art collection at the Merrion is nice, but it's not worth paying so much for an afternoon that's memorable for all the wrong reasons.",2,2017,06,14
200,Elegance in Dublin,"This is a lovely spot in the center of Dublin, from which you can walk to many of the sights to see.  The staff is wonderful, and our room was spacious and comfortable.  The common areas are beautiful and feature an extensive art collection, the enjoyment of which is enhanced by a complementary audio tour.  It is expensive to stay here, but the splurge is worth is for a night or two.",5,2017,06,12
200,Elegant,"We rate our stay at the Marion as the best experience we've had during our 14 city tour of the U.K. And Ireland. The staff, room, and focus on details were extraordinary. The staff aimed to please in every contact we had.",5,2017,06,12
200,Art afternoon tea ,"My sister booked an afternoon tea for my birthday & it was beautiful.5* afternoon tea.
 We were warmly greeted at the door & directed to where we needed to go.
The tea was explained to us in great detail & we were shown the art to which it was chosen ,which was lovely.
Our tiered tea arrived & it was beautiful - a lovely selection of very fresh, tasty sandwiches which consisted of cucumber sandwiches, free range egg on mini bruschetta, chicken & sun dried tomato as well as salmon on brown bread.
 The mini selection of scones were very nice & they were accompanied by jam, cream & a lemon curd - also served was a fruit cake & iced batten-burgs which were very colourful.
 The plate of desserts was a piece of art in itself. Mine came very nicely  presented wishing me a happy Birthday which was a very nice touch. Each one was full of flavour, light & delicious.
 We drank tea to our hearts content & the silver service was top class.
 Staff were very informative, friendly & chatty.
A lovely day & highly recommended.  ",5,2017,06,11
200,A high-quality five star hotel,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Merrion. The room service was excellent, and the art collection of this hotel is outstanding. We personnally preferred the audio tour in the hotel than the actual visit of the Nation Art Gallery.
We very much enjoyed the two star restaurant. The only disappointment we experienced was the lunch. We wanted to eat in the hotel and asked for a table, and the waiter wasn't very friendly when he answered (as though we were cumbersome). This was shocking (the place is supposed to be open to guests 24h/24). When you are guests at this sort of hotel, the waiter must find a solution, that's the policy of such a hotel in which guests must be cared for in priority. Several tables were not occupied, and a solution could be found.",5,2017,06,11
200,Perfectly Lovely,"We stayed one night on the front end of our Ireland trip and one night before departing for home.  This hotel has a wonderfully old-school feel but with all the first class, updated amenities one would expect in this level of accommodation  I LOVED the professional, but warm service--so very Irish.  My daughter left a small, but precious personal item behind in the room, and the hotel was able to secure the item and have it waiting for her upon our return.  THANK YOU!!

I truly enjoyed lounging about in ""Bar 23"".  Order the delicious item with a soup, sandwich and sweet treat.  The perfect light meal.  The bartenders are wonderfully stylish and professional as they create specialty cocktails.  This is a relaxing spot to observe guests coming and going and get a feel for who visits Dublin.  Good stealth people watching and eavesdropping for an American on the go.

Finally, room service pizza is quite tasty and the staff makes a special effort to get the order ""just right.""  At breakfast try the ""Killowen Farm"" Wexford Rhubarb yogurt.  What a treat, if you enjoy European style yogurt.

The Merrion delivers Irish graciousness paired with upscale hotel service. Well done, bravo!",5,2017,06,09
200,Get Breakfast System Fixed,"Nice hotel. Plenty of elegant meeting space for small groups or conversations. Rooms were updated and stylish. The two garden atriums made the interior section come to life.  The biggest complaint is the way they run the breakfast area. 1. doesn't open till 7:00am 2) despite seeing twenty people waiting, they opened 3 minutes late one day 3) they gate control people entering the breakfast area in order to get room number. This could easily be managed by the wait staff as they get coffee and meal orders. This is unnecessary when vacationers and business folks are trying to get fast start to their day.",4,2017,06,08
200,Beautiful hotel!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Merrion for several days and loved it.  It's a beautiful hotel, the room was fabulous and perfectly clean and neat.  We especially loved resting up and sitting in the bar each evening after a day of touring.  The staff was friendly and wonderful. We will most definitely be back to the Merrion!!",5,2017,06,07
200,Second Stay,"We stayed 6 nights for our second time, what a lovely hotel! Staff is so kind & helpful. Rooms are very comfortable, beds are awesome with soft linens. Large bathroom with large plush towels. The hotel was full while we were there & still so quiet in our room. Hotel is 5 min walk to St. Stephens Green & Grafton St. Breakfast in morning was really good with either cold buffet or order hot meal from menu...coffee is excellent as well. One day I did the self audio tour of hotel's art work, enjoyed that. We had asked for the same room as we had for our first stay when we booked many months ago & we had same room...thank you to all the employees were so great, especially Valeria who served us breakfast & Fernando who did turn down service.",5,2017,06,07
200,at home in Dublin,Delightful experience in reclaimed town homes that houses a wonderful art collection as well.  Food was very good and the service was impeccable.  Nicely situated near shops and parks but very quiet in the midst of a vibrant city.,5,2017,06,06
200,Nice hotel.,"Central Dublin hotel.  The hotel was undergoing some renovations during our stay, so I'm not sure we saw it at its best. Our room was comfortable, nicely decorated with a large comfortable bed. We ate in the bar and the food was excellent, with very pleasant waiting service. We will return but probably request a better room.",4,2017,06,04
200,Simply Superb,"This hotel is truly the standard by which all luxury hotels should be judged. The staff are, without exception, thoughtful and caring. The attention is not fawning, not obligatory, but part of culture of anticipating the guest's needs. We were repeatedly surprised by the little touches, both in our room and in the public areas. Everything was perfect, with an unmatched feeling of comfort.",5,2017,06,04
200,"Welcoming,quiet elegance in perfect Dublin location ","Everything here was first class beginning with the staff ( very accommodating)and carrying over to the beautiful ,comfortable rooms and tasteful decor and artwork 

The food was excellent - breakfast ,lunch and dinner   The cellar restaurant was lots of fun as well as delicious.  Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try their Michelin rated restaurant as our schedule was too booked. 

",5,2017,06,04
200,"The Merrion, Dublin","The staff and facilities at the Merrion were exceptional. We were treated as though we were VIP's and the most important people staying there. If we needed help finding someplace within the hotel the staff walked us there. Anyone we asked for recommendations about sights or dining was more than willing to talk with us. The breakfasts at The Cellar were wonderful - loved our little silver racks of toast! The 23 Bar is like hanging out at your friend's house. Comfortable chairs and love seats, silver serving cups of nuts, bar mix and olives to munch on. The most sumptuous bathroom in any hotel we have stayed at. Heated towel rack!! Can't say enough about one experience there except that it wasn't long enough.",5,2017,06,03
200,For Sure For Sure,Surely the best Hotel in Dublin For Sure. What a wonderful location in the very heart of the City. We could step out of the door and walk to the National Gallery and the shops ant not forgetting the best Irish pubs,5,2017,06,03
200,Great Hotel & Great Staff,"I stayed at this hotel repeatedly while traveling on business.  Now I stop in mainly for lunch or afternoon tea, sometimes a drink in their downstairs bar where one can always bump into a local politician.  It is a lovely hotel, with very professional staff, centrally located.  While staying here for work, they often left a bottle me of champagne and Swiss chocolates.  The hotel is is centrally located in Dublin 2, near St. Stephens Green.  The entrance can be a bit tricky to find if one is not familiar with the streets and is arriving privately, with a car vs. a taxi.  The rooms can be a bit noisy, but they always triy to do everything possibly to accommodate  their guests.",5,2017,06,01
200,Another Great Stay!!,"This was our second time staying at the Merrion. Again, it exceeded our expectations. The room, the staff, the food and bar areas and the location were fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing!! Highly recommend the Merrion.",5,2017,06,01
200,Great stay in a great town,The Merrion is a first class hotel with terrific service. We greatly enjoyed our stay. The staff throughout was top notch. We had a medical issue and the concierge obtained a doctor for us who came right away and provided very good advice and comfort.,5,2017,05,31
200,All around wonderful experience,"From the minute we arrived we knew we had chosen a special hotel.  The staff all were totally helpful, friendly, and efficient.  Our room was sized right, with comfortable chairs, a place to store clothes, a very comfortable bed, and it was quiet.  The hotel is charming, filled with beautiful art. The restaurant is excellent - food, service, choices, friendliness - can't rave enough.",5,2017,05,31
200,The Merrion Experience,"I have been staying at The Merrion for many years and the service has been consistently top quality.  The rooms are fresh and clean, the reception staff very pleasant and will do anything to make your stay.  The bell staff are always available and accommodating.",5,2017,05,31
200,Wonderful!,Truly one of our favorite hotel stays of all time.  The room embodied understated elegance and comfort.  Triple paned windows kept out the street noise while allowing our unobstructed view of the classic facades of the government buildings across the street.  Staff was friendly and helpful without being intrusive.  Easy walking distance to primary Dublin sites and shopping.  Just a joy to stay there.,5,2017,05,31
200,Fantastic looking hotel but let down by certain things,Staff were fantastic but we were very disappointed with the breakfast and the fact that we were not informed that there was building works and as you can see in the photo right outside the room this was the view and at 8am the builders were working and the noise woke us up. Also there was 3 hoovers left out permanently all the time in the corridors.  ,3,2017,05,30
200,Stepping into elegance,"This hotel provides a welcome and elegant retreat from the spring in the step bustle of Dublin. High ceilinged sitting rooms with Irish antique furniture, modern, well equipped bedrooms & attractive courtyard gardens. Fantastic (expensive) gourmet restaurant & more reasonable, still good quality, cellar based dining room for breakfast & through the day. Charming staff. ",5,2017,05,28
200,Excellent stay,"The people at the front desk, concierge and doormen were wonderful.  Barmen and waitress staff were engaging, excellently helpful and fun. We so enjoyed it. Concierge helped us to purchase tickets online for the train and print information.",5,2017,05,27
200,second visit good as first,"This was the second time I have stayed at the merrion and I returned with good memories of my initial visit. The staff there is great. Probably the best staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. The bed is comfortable, the breakfasts are great, the dinners very good and the art on the wall museum quality. I look forward to staying there in the future.",5,2017,05,26
200,Perfection,THE best hotel in Dublin. From the service to the rooms to the food. You cannot experience anything better! An outstanding experience from start to finish. Thanks again to Bernie for a great stay! I look forward to returning soon.,5,2017,05,25
200,Still lovely,"This remains my favourite hotel in Dublin. The rooms are very restful, the staff kind and helpful and the food in the Cellar Restaurant and the Cellar Bar is fantastic. A lovely pint of Guinness too!!!",5,2017,05,24
200,Elegant luxury,"You are stepping into a piece of Irish history when you enter the hotel. The entrance lobby with liveried staff is most welcoming. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The Merrion is just a few steps away from the heart of Dublin where you will find many excellent restaurants, bars and other attractions.
The city tour buses pass by the door which is great for seeing the city and deciding where to go next.
The breakfasts were filling and of good quality. Don't forget to ask for the full menu!
Staff are very pleasant and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them.",5,2017,05,24
200,Perfection,"We have just spent the most fabulous weekend in The Merrion Hotel, it was quite simply stunning.  The hotel is sheer perfection from the staff to the rooms to the location.  Restaurant Patricck Guilbauds is fabulous and the new restaurant which is due to open shortly will be a wonderful addition as the Cellar restaurant is lovely but a little dark.  The art on the walls everywhere you look is just amazing, it's like staying in an art gallery!  Could not say enough wonderful things about this hotel, simply five stars all the way.
",5,2017,05,24
200,"Fine hotel,great art collection","Merrion is an excellent Dublin hotel.
Nice room,large in old building.
Staff excellent and service top notch.
Only reservation is dining facilities in basement and not attractive.
Has an excellent collection of works by leading Irish artists.",4,2017,05,23
200,Gracious Hotel in Dublin,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Merrion in Dublin. The hotel is excellently located, within walking distance of Trinity College, the major shopping district and Temple Bar.
This is an older property, but very well-maintained and updated. Our room, a superior king, was a graciously sized corner room with a comfortable sitting area and large, marble bath. The bed was among the best we experienced in Ireland, and the room was quiet, not something you can always obtain in a downtown hotel.
The staff at the Merrion was helpful and competent. A lot of the staff members appear to be German. Check in was efficient and friendly.
We ate breakfast every morning at their casual restaurant located near the spa. The breakfast selections were excellent and reasonably priced for a city hotel. You could choose from a ""continental"" breakfast, which is essentially the buffet with multiple hot and cold offerings, or choose from a menu, which included such things as eggs Benedict. No complaints.
Although we did not use the spa facilities, we looked around and admired the lovely pool and steam/sauna areas. The spa seemed quiet and relaxing during our brief tour.
We did enjoy the hotel bar on several occasions, and even ate a post-theatre meal at the bar on a Saturday night. While the menu selections were limited at that hour, our choice of club sandwich was perfectly prepared and we enjoyed every bite.
We did have occasion to look around the Shelbourne Hotel, located nearby, and it appeared to be an older, much larger property that is now being run by Marriott. We did not see any of their rooms, but the lobby appeared hectic, noisy and a little shop worn by comparison with the Merrion.
We would definitely come back to the Merrion if we ever had occasion to return to Dublin.",5,2017,05,23
200,Top quality with only a couple of small gripes,"3 nights with my wife for a work related conference and very well done by the Merrion. Old style elegance with modern touches and a lovely ground floor courtyard and basement pool. The main house lounges are amazing, the art excellent and the service almost without fault. Only 2 slight glitches - no shampoo in shower in spa and the wall mounted bottle was empty two days running. The cellar bar closed fairly early so we then decamped to the residents bar. The hotel should make it clearer what time the cellar bar closes or at least the bar staff should as we would have gone straight to the residents bar if we'd known. The residents bar is fine so no need to go to the cellar at all frankly (if we'd known). 
Small issues but when you set the 'bar' high like this hotel does the little lapses show.  ",5,2017,05,23
200,One of the great hotels in the world,"This is an update of a previously posted review.  For our first stay we arrived at 2:30 pm and our room was not ready. We were escorted to the bar lounge for a drink and crossword puzzle as they readied the room. We were advised at checkin that they were upgrading us to a junior suite in the main house versus the booked superior room in the garden wing. I now realize what an exceptional gift this was to us. The main building has the original Georgian architectural features and our spacious (and I do mean spacious) room had a crystal chandelier and ornate plaster ceiling. Everything about the suite is comfortable and beautiful. The bathroom alone is about the size of the B&B room we had the previous night. The service is outstanding from the bellmen, reception, DR staff (only minor lapses like failing to remove unused cups, forgetting the butter with the toast) and doorman. The location is stupendous and we can walk to most of what we want to see in Dublin. I am ranking this hotel on par with the Peninsula in HK, the Mandarin in Tokyo and the Ritz Carlton in Kyoto and that is a high standard indeed. One of the truly memorable hotels in the world.

Update:  as we were leaving, our rental car flashed a warning that the battery was not charging.  I made Tom turn around and return to the Merrion.  Seven hours later we finally left with a replacement car but only after multiple calls to Enterprise UK, Enterprise Ireland, Volvo support, roadside service etc.  The final resolution was to give us a BMW in exchange for the defective Volvo but we had to taxi to Dublin airport to pick it up.  If we had not been at the Merrion I don't know how we would have done it all.  The porters were wonderful about making the calls, unloading the old car, calling us when the roadside service people came (we had left to go to a museum based on the estimated time), reloading the taxi, handling issues after we left (the repair place thought the car belonged to the Merrion).  During the ordeal we had a lovely place to stay instead of being on the side of a road. 

When we turned on to Upper Merrion St for our second stay a genuine feeling of relief welled up because I knew we would be splendidly cared for by the Merrion staff.  This hotel is a true oasis (and I don't use this word very often in reviewing hotels) of beauty, comfort, and service.   

It turns out I had accidentally reviewed Hotel 41 (London) on the internal Merrion survey web site.  They read how Hotel 41 had provided me with a yoga mat, foam roller and distilled water for a CPAP machine.   This time around they provided the same!  (Our first stay they advised me I would have to go to the spa to use the roller.)  I was amazed that instead of disregarding the erroneous review, they used it to improved their own service by meeting a guest's need that previously had not been fulfilled.  This just demonstrates the attention to detail and focus on the guest.  

Other amenities are the availability of power strips with adapters so you could set up a charging station on the desk for the paraphernalia one travels with these days without crawling on your hands and knees to find usually scarce free outlets, safes at a height where you can easily see the contents and not leave items, cutlery and dishes in the room already provided, doors with soft closures to avoid slamming.  An extremely well thought out hotel.  I love it!

Room Tip: We had room 186 which was wonderful. Junior suite with sitting area, office area, sleeping, bathroom.  On our second stay they upgraded us once again to 283 which was smaller but also very spacious and comfortable.  283 faces the garden, 186 faces the street.

200,7 Stars - that is what this hotel is!,"We stayed on two occasions at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin, I had seen it several years ago on a visit and thought I must try it.  I was not disappointed.  This hotel sets the standard that other like minded hotels should follow.  Amazing staff who go beyond and above what they should to ensure your stay is....PERFECTION. Our room was located in the old buildings along the front and we had friends who stayed in the garden wings.  Both are amazing but if you want that old world charm the townhouse rooms are large, comfortable and amazing!  This is a great example for paying for what you get.  It is expensive but it is well worth every cent.  This will be my home away from home next time I visit.  WELL DONE!",5,2017,05,20
200,You will not be disappointed,"This is a beautiful destination set in the centre of Dublin. From the greeting at the door you know you have made a good choice.The bar is a bustling place with various people meeting there,either having food or a drink. The bar food is tasty if a bit expensive however we would not let that put you off.",5,2017,05,19
200,Irish visit,"First 2 nights of our Ireland trip  were spent here... felt like royalty, staff couldn't have been nicer or helpful! Rooms were very well appointed, spacious, clean and comfortable. Top notch hotel- one of nicest we have ever stayed in!",5,2017,05,17
200,First Class,"The old adage ""You get what you pay for""  applies for this hotel. Yes, it is on the pricey side, but we found everything about the hotel first rate. The Staff was courteous, friendly, and helpful. The amenities were very nice and the room was excellent. I really don't have anything negative to say about it",5,2017,05,17
200,Adjoining rooms,"We had adjoining rooms with our grandchildren. They were spacious, clean and above expectations. The children were delighted with chocolates every day. The staff was above and beyond expectations. The location was perfect.",5,2017,05,17

200,"A classic old style hotel with a great deal of charm, a traditional tea room near St. Stephen's Green.","This charming old hotel is located around the corner from St. Stephen's Green and my favorite pub, O'Donoghues. The service is exemplary and the rooms are well appointed.
But, it is a bit pricey for what it is.  It is a quiet and well managed hotel.",4,2017,05,16
200,Elegance,"My wife and I stayed in the Merrion on a Saturday night in may as a anniversary treat. 

The hotel it's self is easy to get to being so close to Stephan's green, when we pulled up we were greeted courteously and very friendly by the door man and the concierge team, they were all polite friendly and very welcoming, there was a few of them parking the car, helping with the bags and the likes but never once did any of them make us feel intimidated. 

The reception team were all friendly and very knowledgeable and very courteous. 

The room was on the ground floor but there was absolutely no noise at all all night, the room was very clean and they thought of every amenity in the rooms, and anything not in the rooms is easily available from the hotel. 

The gardens are a lovely, open place to spend an hour with a coffee or beer 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will stay here again and look forward to our next visit. ",5,2017,05,15
200,Never disappoints!,Honestly the nicest hotel ever! We have stayed a few times and it never fails to make us really happy. Staff are amazing...everyone of them. It's just all so special. Cannot wait to go back. A complete treat. Thank you!,5,2017,05,15
200,Amazing Stay!,"Definitely the best choice for Dublin! Staff was great, very friendly and accomodating. The building and rooms were unreal. The hotel is in a great location to walk to pubs, shopping, and tourist sites. Make sure to check out the Cellar bar/restaurant.",5,2017,05,14
200,Close to perfection,"We stay frequently at four seasons and Ritz Carlton but the welcome and attention to detail is extraordinary.
Nothing is too much trouble.
Numerous attentive multinational staff all warm and friendly.
Superb rooms.
We stayed in the Lord monck suite.
Expensive but hard to beat anywhere. 
Friendly public rooms and fireplaces with real wood

Well done ",5,2017,05,14
200,A Fantastic Team To Look After You...,"Each and every member of the team are true ambassadors for this lovely hotel. There was a Croatian waiter who entertained a baby and several children at breakfast while mom and dad quaffed their eggs.
The room attendants were charming and smiling. The concierge assisted all, with charm and wit. As for the Front desk staff they were so professional in how they dealt with so many guests.
The Hotel's General Manager was the perfect host as he glided from guest to guest with warmth and charisma.
I can not remember the last time I was so warmly welcomed into a hotel for the perfect stay. But then this is Ireland and this is Dublin's best address!
Breakfast is a must if you stay here the porridge is cooked to perfection
The mini brown loaves just melt in your mouth. 
This is Irelands best hotel. Spoil yourself and stay here.",5,2017,05,14
200,Dublin's best luxury boutique hotel...,"...that is if you lean towards boutique, private, charming, and bespoke. If you like larger, more modern, or corporate hotels with bigger facilities, this is not for you. The Westbury is the other hotel in Dublin that I think lives in the same tier as The Merrion, but we were not as impressed. Once you get past the private entrance with Range Rovers and a lux shopping arcade right off Grafton Street, the interior, whilst pretty, is more modern, sprawling, and feels far more trafficked and corporate, less intimate. The Merrion is built into a period Georgian townhouse in a perfect part of town, close enough to everything but not annoyingly close to touristy or buzzy avenues like, well, Grafton Street or St Stephens Green. The Merrion feels private, tucked in and away, personal, and it boasts the largest private collection of art of any hotel in the world. We did not indulge in the hotel's restaurant, which is a Michelin starred destination packed every night. We did not indulge in the tea service, that is supposed to be a delightful experience amidst the period furnishings, brocade drapes, fireplaces and Chippendale. The waiters and front desk staff, the sweet Irish gals who bring you cocktails and coffee in the two Georgian lounges, they are all terribly nice and attentive. It is all very quaint and genteel. We booked through our travel agent who belongs to a Virtuoso agency so amongst the perks we gleaned - a double upgrade at check in. It resulted in room 182 which I would highly recommend. A junior suite with views over the front of the entrance. The fact that they so generously upgraded us was in itself, a huge statement on their service motto. Our room had a seated area and extraordinary ceilings, 30ft high or more. Bathrooms were enrobed in marble, the bed and duvet were glorious, even the hotel hair dryer was a surprise, not cheap or travel size but the real deal. Bell caps were speedy, breakfast was incredibly friendly and yummy, albeit did get a bit boring after a few days bc the menu is delicious but small, as is the buffet of fruits, cheeses and pastries. A gorgeous garden patio with fountained seating area was closed off sadly bc there is apparently a grand expansion going on but during warmer days in Summer, when it reopens, it would easily be a sublime spot to chill with a beverage. We were surprised at how few 5 star, lux grade hotels were available in Dublin. No Ritz Carlton even, and limited choices of the boutique size compared to cities like London where the hi end choices are endless. Nonetheless, were we to go back to Dublin, and until the hotel offerings grow in Dublin, I would always opt for The Merrion. Bar none. I would say my only surprise is how many Americans were there. They get very busy during check in and check out bc the lobby is so quaint, and it felt like the hotel was largely inhabited by Americans which was a little surprising. We normally enjoy interacting with more foreigners and Europeans when we stay abroad, so we could have done with a few, fewer loud Americans. That is not a knock, just an observation. PS: If you want a pub that is not a tourist mecca, head around the corner to Doheny & Nesbitt. While we are on noteworthy and charming pubs that are not Temple Bar tourist traps, the Stags Head and Kehoes, are musts if you want to rub shoulders with locals. And once you have exhausted yourself on fish and chips and all other pub grub, if you want a sublime Italian dinner, across the street from The Merrion is Unicorn. I'm telling you, I think it was the best pasta dinner we have ever enjoyed. And next door to The Merrion is another top rated and on trend spot that seems to be a longtime favorite - The Pearl.",4,2017,05,12
200,The only place to stay in Dublin!,I travel a lot and experience the good and bad of hotels. Sadly it's not often that I am 'wowed' enough to write a review. The Merrion is a total WOW. The staff and service are exceptional and went above and beyond to make our stay perfection. Location is amazing and the breakfast is to die for. I would tell any hotel wonder looking to up their game to come and stay at the Merrion and learn from THE BEST. Cannot wait to go back!,5,2017,05,12
200,Awesome,"Our first two nights in Dublin we were guests at the Merrion. We cant say enough good stuff about this hotel!!  We love the cellar bar and the atmosphere and rooms are incredible.  It is a five star hotel for a reason.  They cater to their guests like no other.  We love this place and highly recommend it to anyone traveling here.  The price is a bit more than some establishments in the area, but, you get what you pay for and we were more than happy to pay for our stay, first class all the way.",5,2017,05,12
200,Elegant lunch ,"Had an elegant lunch with my wife at the Merrion hotel / restaurant which was delicious but enjoyed our duck salad and soup, sandwich, and dessert dish.  The Victorian period furnishings are a time turner for this wonderful era.  Enjoy the tea and sandwiches!",4,2017,05,11
200,Superior in Every Way,I have been staying at the Merrion Hotel for more than ten years while in Dublin for business and occasionally for touring.  The staff is outstanding.  No one misses a beat in extending courtesy and offering service.  The hotel is quiet and comfortable while well located in central Dublin.  Food and beverage is top quality.,5,2017,05,11
200,Favourite Hotel in Ireland,"Thoroughly enjoyed  a recent trip to the Merrion,  The  Staff are excellent, and always make you feel welcome and valued.   Rooms are very luxurious and relaxing.

200,a very pleasant place to stay in Dublin,"The Merrion is a mix of old (the place where Wellington was born) with superb rooms in the ground floor which are used as the bar, the living room, and the classic of the rooms. The ground floor hosts a very nice art collection, as the halls, and the restaurant and the lower floor. Walls are painted in nice Irish yellow, or green, those colours that probably one wouldn't think of having, but which are very nice. This makes a very comfortable and pleasant place to stay. 
The rooms are of good size, with grey marble bathrooms. Amenities are from Asprey, and in quantity. 
The breakfast is good, with a limited choice of coldcuts and cheese, but a buffet of wonderful homemade pastries! (try them!). Eggs benedict are also wonderful!!! 
Staff is pleasant and very helpful.",5,2017,05,08
200,Timeless Oasis in Dublin,"Comfortable rooms; wonderful attentive but not intrusive service throughout 

The art in itself is worth a wander

Excellent location in the center but peaceful and relaxing once enter through the welcoming doors ",5,2017,05,07

200,Wonderful stay,"Friendly, helpful staff with great service at The Merrion.  I have a great time there, enjoyed the bar setting and service and the exquisite tea in the beautifully appointed lounge.  The room I hd was truly excellent.  Will definitely return and can recommend the hotel.  one of the best hotels I have stayed in for a while",5,2017,05,05
200,Tenth Anniversary,We spent our tenth anniversary in Dublin. The Merrion staff made sure it was the best vacation my wife and I had ever had. It is a beautiful hotel with artwork at every turn. The staff exemplifies integrity and exceeds the industry standard in hospitality. We can't stop talking about our experience. The location is central to everything in Dublin. We felt like we were staying at a friend's home.,5,2017,05,05
200,"amazing hotel, first class experience",The staff at the Merrion hotel provide excellent customer service. I informed reception staff that myself and my partner were celebrating our anniversary and we were upgraded to a suite as a surprise. Bar and breakfast both excellent. The swimming pool is so relaxing. Our favourite hotel in Dublin!,5,2017,05,05
200,"WOW, JUST WOW!!","I stayed at this beautiful hotel for three nights last week for a business trip.   I have travelled all over the world - have visited 29 countries - and I have never, ever experienced anything like The Merrion.  

I don't even know where to start.  The staff was beyond exceptional.   From the moment I arrived and was greeted by their superb doorman, I was addressed by name and felt as if I were royalty.   Each and every staff member I encountered was so very professional, warm, nice, and friendly.   I can only imagine the kind of service training the staff goes through, but without a doubt they provided the absolute best service I have ever had at any hotel.  Kudos to all!!

My spotless room (131) was near the elevator but I did not hear a peep from anyone my whole stay either from the elevator area or from my neighbors.  My very large window overlooked the garden and the room itself was quite spacious with beautiful furnishings.  The bathroom (with both a tub and separate shower) was very big and the marble floors were beautiful.   

I did not want for anything the whole stay.  From the slippers, robe, towel warmer in the bathroom, very nice toiletries, glass bottles of spring water being left every evening, these are just some of the small touches that left me wanting to just stay in my room and not venture out.   The free wifi worked very nicely and there is a printer with two desktops in the business center (next to room 111 on the ground floor).  

Breakfast (included with the room) was a buffet in The Cellar restaurant in the basement.  What a feast.  Again, every employee I encountered here was amazing.

If given the opportunity to visit Dublin, do not consider staying anywhere but The Merrion Hotel.   I was spoiled and will now be comparing every hotel I stay at to this fine establishment.",5,2017,05,03
200,Start of a Ireland Exploration,Commencing with the doorman to the final check-out the experience was excellent.  The location provided easy walking access to all the Dublin has to offer.  The stay was the commencement of our Ireland journey.,5,2017,05,03
200,Dublin trip,"No.23 Room: Classic aperitif bar situated in very nice Merrion hotel. It's a great place to enjoy afternoon tea or cocktail before a dinner. We made a excellent choice ""The Cello"" and really enjoy relaxing time in the No.23
For the ones who admire paintings there is ""The art collection"" to enjoy to. ",5,2017,05,02
200,Excellent customer Service and Great Hotel,"Myself and coworkers stayed at the Marrion for 2 nights, where we were greeted by very friendly staff at Reception. We could drop off bags very early in the morning, with no issues. Our room was fantastic, spacious, clean, with a great view of the Hotel Garden. Breakfast wasn't too bad, not a huge option, but the free coffee machine that's available in the room certainly made up for it. Can't really fault the hotel at all, staff were helpful and polite, the room was great, and the location was fantastic just walk distance to major locations. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2017,05,01
200,Luxury in Dublin!,"Excellent hotel. Rooms are large, well appointed and lots of extras like nice toiletries, robes, slippers etc.  All of the staff were very welcoming and helpful, especially the gentlemen at the front door and the concierge team. 

Breakfast was very good and one of our group used the swimming pool and reported that it was very nice. 

Location wise you don't get much better. It is very central: shops, pubs and restaurants all within walking distance but it is also a nice haven to relax in after a busy day in Dublin. If it's luxury you are after, this rates highly!

I would recommend and will definitely be back!",5,2017,05,01
200,Great food. Great service,"Many hotels tend to suffer from bad press when it comes to their culinary efforts and as a general rule of thumb I always try to dine out rather than in, when I'm staying in a hotel unless its reputation dictates otherwise. The Merrion is one of those hotels. The quality of the food is excellent and the presentation top class. Service is what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel.",5,2017,05,01
200,Best hotel I've ever stayed in!,"The Merrion is quite simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in.
It was perfect from start to finish.  The check in, room, the afternoon tea was out of this world, the pool and gym, the bar... 
we will be back just as soon as we can afford it! ",5,2017,05,01
200,Afternoon tea in stylr,What an amazing experience. The service was amazing. Food was delicious. Presentation perfection and more tea than you can possibly drink. The staff could not do enough for us. They took pains to explain all about the afternoon tea and how it is linked to the artwork at the hotel. The location was great. All round the best afternoon tea experience I have had to date and I have had MANY.   I will definitely be back. Thanks the Merrion Hotel. ,5,2017,04,30
200,Great Experience,"Business takes me to Dublin several times a year.   Having looked at other properties, the Merrion offers Service Excellence, without the hustle and bustle associated with other facilities.  The staff knows your name when your return and makes you feel at home.   ",5,2017,04,30
200,A tranquil lap of luxury,"A perfect place to stay for a few days of peace, with attentive and courteous service of the highest order.  The location is ideal, set as it is in the Georgian heart of the city, close to the principal sites and good restaurants.",5,2017,04,30
200,Superb hotel.,"From start to finish a polished,genuinely friendly top class hotel.Staff are the finest you will encounter for many a day.Location is perfect for cental Dublin and options for eating and dining within the hotel are very fine.",5,2017,04,30
200,Esquisite,"If you are staying in Dublin and seek the 5 star experience it's The Merrion you must book. From second one the friendly and professional staff are A1. They even pre-empt your needs in every way. We booked a sibling trip and the Merrion made the icing on the cake. After pre show dinner we attended a show and retired to the sumptuous surroundings. Old world class with modern efficiency best describes it. Beds, linen and class interior decor made sleeping a dream. Being walking distance or short taxi ride to every venue made the location.  Breakfast was ceremoniously delivered and moorishly eaten. Absolutely nothing to fault. I could complain I can't stay longer... but who cares when it recharged me for road!!",5,2017,04,30
200,"Our stay in Merrion Hotel, excellent hotel",The Merrion hotel is truly one of the best hotel we have stayed at over the years.  We find the hotel staff to be very friendly and respectful and courteous.  They really went out of their ways to be helpful.  We did not have any negative issue during our 3 day stay.  ,5,2017,04,29
200,The Very Best ,"The Merrion Hotel overall is  the very best luxury hotel we've ever experienced. The rooms are spacious, the services is superb, the beds are super comfortable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Nothing was out of place or unkept. With a Michelin 2 star restaurant & the Cellar Bar, we didn't want to venture from the lovely hotel. If you like luxury and being pampered, this is the place to stay! ",5,2017,04,29
200,Superb overnight stay at end of holiday,"Arrived back into Dublin from a luxury holiday in Mauritius, and had booked a night in the Merrion to round things off before facing back into reality! It really is an exceptional hotel, and this time it again exceeded expectations. Arriving tired after an overnight trip, I was greeted with a really warm and genuine welcome as a returning guest,  given a beautiful room in the main house and was set up within 10 minutes of arrival. Nothing was too much trouble, I was made to feel like a very special guest during my stay. It is very difficult to achieve this across all the various staff involved, but somehow the warmth, friendliness and professionalism shines through every member. Although I had just returned from a 5 star property ( the Residence) in Mauritius, and that was wonderful in itself, the Merrion surpassed it in every respect ..... Bar the weather, of course! A small example, but typical, was the offer of complimentary tea coffee or water by a member of staff who was just passing by as I was working in the business centre.... My water arrived on a silver salver.....and  complete with a rose posy! These little touches make the Merrion the stand out 5 star in Dublin. Add in the exceptional breakfast and the general ambience, and in my view it is impossible to beat.",5,2017,04,26
200,Treat yourself!!,What can you say other then a superb hotel experience. Staff is beyond exceptional. Rooms borderline perfect. Hard to voice an area that needs improvement....all thats really left is to enjoy your stay and trust me you will.,5,2017,04,24
200,Charm and Sophistication,"From bottom to top, an very polished and elegant hotel. The room was beautiful and comfortable, with every amenity. The service is unobtrusive, but always available. Concierge service was always spot on with recommendations for dining. My wife also loved the spa. I cannot imagine a better experience than what we had here during our trip to Dublin.",5,2017,04,24
200,An Odd Experience,"Simply put this is a mediocre City hotel and is not the truly great hotel is aspires to be. We stayed as a couple earlier recently for a night. The whole hotel seems to lack management and whilst the staff are very friendly, it falls way short of what they seem to be trying to achieve.

Check in is at 3pm (according to the website) - its not. Apparently its ""from 3pm"". This is what I was told when I asked again for the room at 3.30pm after waiting over an hour sitting 5 metres from the desk waiting to be called like we were promised. 

The rooms are beautiful. The shower pressure is very poor.

Dinner was fine and well prepared. Service was slow and not that attentive. I had to pour the wine myself. 

Breakfast is not great at all. My breakfast order was wrong (even though I ordered the exact same as my wife). The breakfast pastries were stale. The hot food seemed to be reheated and was tepid. 

Ordering coffee at breakfast was bizarre. I ordered 3 cups of white coffee throughout breakfast - each of them was different.

My wife's tea arrived in a large silver tea pot. It was left on the table by the waiter - no offer to pour it. The handle was red hot so we just left it there.

Plates were removed randomly. Some were just left there. We left soon after. 

The staff like to address you by name (Mr. X etc.). This is a nice touch. Only problem is that both times I was called by the wrong name. This is just odd.

Myself and another guest was ignored by 4 staff waiting behind the desk. We both had to signal for attention. The younger staff member assisted us both. The older staff member continued their conversation. 

The staff in the fitness centre were rude. I was challenged when I entered the centre after signing in. The lady who arrived seemed to assume I had wandered in off the street. 

The Merrion is fine. It just fails to deliver. 
Try The Westbury across town.",3,2017,04,24
200,A Sunday afternoon treat,"Walk pass this hotel quite often, Walking to Stephens Green . So today whilst in the area ,thought I'd pop in for a cocktail with my other half . Well on appearance it's classy,Irish and quite !!!  (not so Irish ) but loved the ambience and solem atmosphere. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon ! Will be back , with a little hint to my beloved!That we need to stay over night next time we visit !! Here's hoping 😁😁",5,2017,04,23
200,lovely weekend,"wonderful relaxing weekend , hotel and the staff were just superb The gardens took your breath away , such fine detail amazing
a five star hotel and every star is well deserved , we will definatly be returning here in the near future",4,2017,04,23
200,Exceptional,"The ultimate 5 star treatment.   Nothing bad to say.   Facilities were exceptional,  staff were of the highest standard.   Everything one would expect from a 5 star establishment.  Excellent location too, minutes walk from Dublin's Grafton street and south side CBD. ",5,2017,04,23
200,5 Star MEANS 5 Star in this hotel.......,"Five Star means Five Star in this excellent establishment. 

Definitely the best hotel I've ever stayed in; staff are polite, knowledgeable, courteous and plentiful. 
Ambiance is serene, new garden is fantastic. Our room was something to behold. 
Minor issues were dealt with swiftly, I have difficulty finding any faults.

A couple of anecdotes which proves how special  this place is:

  - We arrived at 4pm on a Friday,our room wasn't ready........we were asked if we'd like to wait in the bar and have a drink/coffee on the house - we had two coffees and two beers
 - We ordered a bottle of Prosecco to the room, they delivered Champagne in error. We were not charged at all  due to the error.

Some places claim to have class, The Merrion exudes class, without even trying - I only wish I could give it a six star rating.",5,2017,04,22
200,Wonderful stay in Dublin at the Merrion,"I highly recommend this lovely hotel for your stay in Dublin.  The location is ideal and the service and accommodations superb.  Our concierge, Patrick, assured upon our arrival on Good Friday that we had a place to dine at Matt the Thresher when not many places were open.  His recommendation was perfect! Drinks by the fire in the drawing rooms a must. Elegant hotel with attention to detail at every turn.",5,2017,04,22

200,Great Family experience,"My self, Husband and 9 & 6 year old daughters had a lovely stay at the Merrion for Easter weekend. The hotel was amazing and the service and staff were so friendly and professional. For Easter the choloclate treat in the room was to die for and the kids loved the Easter Hunt - so much effort by the hotel and staff. Thanks for a lovely long weekend.",5,2017,04,20
200,Excellent stay at The Merrion Hotel,"Had a very relaxing stay at The Merrion Hotel, which we had booked as a birthday treat. Could feel the stress melting away as 
soon as we arrived in our room (
 we were upgraded to a suite which was amazing). Food, service, spa and gym facilities were all excellent as you you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Would highly recommend The Merrion if you are looking for a high quality hotel experience for a special occasion in an excellent Dublin City centre location.",5,2017,04,20
200,Exquisite as ever,"From the moment you arrive you know you are on holiday. I love the efficiency and courtesy of the staff, from the moment you arrive to the time you depart, all your needs are met. A weekend in Dublin, staying in the Merrion is our guilty pleasure.",5,2017,04,20
200,An oasis,"During my Dublin hotel selection, I was torn between three options, each a marquee names.  I eventually opted for The Merrion and was so very pleased.

This hotel is run with old world elegance and charm, a rarity in today’s glitz and razzle dazzle endeavors.  You are cordially welcomed and greeted during every step of your check in process, from the doorman, to the front desk to the staff escorting you to your room.  I am not sure if this charm is the Irish component or the genuine hospitality being extended.  In either case, it is a welcome respite after a journey.

The hotel itself is an aggregate of four different Georgian-period townhouses.  The exterior is very elegant, understated, easy to miss, with no banners, flags or logos.  The doorman with the top hat may be your only obvious clue that you have arrived.  The check in desk is well staffed, no waiting, in an area more akin to a parlor than a reception desk.  Check in processes are efficient and you are promptly escorted to your room.  Your luggage arrives post haste.

The room continues with old world elegance and tasteful furnishings.  I was fortunate to have been upgraded courtesy of Amex, so my observations may be skewed.  The bathroom was luxe, with a shower stall, bath tub, single sink, well lit, ample mirrors and for those who require it, a lit magnifying shaving/make up mirror.  A nice thoughtful touch – two luggage racks, not one.  The linen is top notch as you would expect, the mattress very comfortable indeed.  

The hotel is very centrally located, a stone’s throw from St Steven’s Green and Grafton Street.  As someone who enjoys walking, I walked everywhere from The Merrion.  There is a very attractive inner courtyard on the premise with landscaped greenery and a fountain making for a very calm zen experience.

If there is one issue I would flag, and it is not even an issue, it is that the hotel is four different townhouses.  So while the architecture has been well thought through, you are often going between connected buildings from your room to the breakfast restaurant to the lounge etc.  This could be charm, it could be annoying, depending on your own personal perspective.

I loved my visit to The Merrion.  I wished I could have stayed a few more days!

200,This hotel is at least a 6 star!!!!,"An amazing visit.  This hotel is not inexpensive, but it is and excellent value,  Worth every Euro++++

Upgrade to the Lord Antrim Suite, for starters.  Incredible room, champagne and cakes for my wife's birthday, service beyond anything we have ever experienced, and wonderful people.

The entire staff, from Patrick at the door, Sean and Igor at the Concierge Desk, Ana at Reception, the wait staff, the folks in the Fitness Center and Housekeeping were focused on making our stay memorable--and it was.

How everyone knew our names on sight is beyond me--but everyone did.

The food in The Cellar was an excellent way to start the day, and the lamb in puff pastry I had on our last night was a real treat..  My wife is a vegetarian  and gluten intolerant, and they easily and happily addressed those issues with a smile.

The Concierge Desk had many helpful suggestions for sightseeing, meals and Irish music.

We could not have had a better trip--thanks to everyone at the hotel that made my wife's birthday celebration so special.",5,2017,04,17
200,Visiting Ireland,"We were blown away by this hotel, the hotel staff and our overall stay. The service by hotel staff was first class, the rooms were lovely. Our food during our stay could not be faulted. We loved this hotel and if we decide to visit from Germany again we would stay here once more.",4,2017,04,17
200,Pure luxury,"The hotel is very well placed for shopping and sightseeing, rooms are comfortable and well equipped but it is the staff that make the Merrion. Every single member of staff was efficient, courteous and pleasant. The place runs like clockwork but manages to feel friendly and welcoming. One of the nicest hotels that I have ever stayed in. ",5,2017,04,17
200,Fantastic service,"Thanks to the staff at the Merrion Hotel, they really helped me celebrate my 50th birthday. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a suite, what a fantastic treat.  Later that day the hote management sent to the room a bottle of champagne together with fruit and some muffins. The whole experience was amazing. The staff are incredibly well trained, polite and efficient, everything you want from a true 5 star hotel. Most definitely we will be back again.",5,2017,04,16
200,Really the best!,"I've been fortunate to stay in some beautiful hotels in my life - The Jumeriah, The Peninsula in Hong Kong and many others - but I don't think I have ever loved a hotel more than The Merrion.  First of all, the staff is truly exceptional across the board - every person you encounter is kind, warm, hospitable and helpful.  The hotel itself is gorgeous - we were upgraded to a suite which was such a wonderful gesture and it was really the most perfect group of rooms I've ever stayed in.  The beds were extremely comfortable, the location quiet yet convenient, and the breakfast was absolutely delicious.  The wait staff in the dining room were so friendly to our twin daughters - we loved going there.  I love this hotel and it will be the standard which I will judge every one I stay at from now on.  An exceptional, beautiful, magical and memorable place.",5,2017,04,16
200,Pure pleasure,"7 nights celebrating a birthday. Arrived early morning to a hearty welcome from cheerful doormen. Check-in was fast and professional. Over the moon that our room was ready.  But wait -- upgraded to a suite, and escorted to the room. Flowers, fruit, little birthday cupcakes, champagne. Never once waited in line or searched for help. Amazingly well-staffed. Calm, unfussy tone throughout. Housekeeping absolute perfection. Breakfast crew wonderfully personable and pampering -- never hovering. Concierge truly available day or night. Morning fires burning in the lounges. Overall ambience both quiet and relaxed at the same time. 

Unbelievable location -- everything seemed a 10 minute stroll away. Walked to the Botanical Garden hoping for a long walk but even that seemed close. Perfect weather does help. Visit Hansel & Gretel Bakery if you are serious about cream puffs. 

Wish I could suggest improvements but I can't.",5,2017,04,16
200,The service was amazing ,"Stayed here for 2 nights  for a family wedding in Dublin, the service was the best I have ever experienced, the staff are faultless, the hotel is amazing particularly the pool area, but at the end of the day I think the staff make this hotel so special, they couldn't do enough for us, will be back for sure 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏",5,2017,04,15
200,"Great location, exceptional service, wonderful room","This is a really great property.  The location, two blocks from Saint Stephen's Green and within walking distance of just about everywhere in Dublin, is great but what really makes it special are the warm welcome, the high level of service by absolutely everyone, the beautiful public spaces, and the exceedingly comfortable rooms.  We stayed in the new wing and were very happy with our spacious room, despite a bit of construction noise during the day.  The breakfasts were a real highlight because of the terrific food as well as the friendly, efficient staff.  The only downside  -- and after a week staying there, it's really the only thing we could find to take any issue with -- is that the exercise room just isn't big enough and doesn't open as early as we would have liked.  Be sure to go to the bar in the cellar at least once and have an after-dinner drink the upstairs bar.",5,2017,04,14
200,Whether you are attending a fancy wedding or just having a coffee the merrion is perfect !!,"I love the Merrion Hotel. From meeting the porter on the steps to the wonderful staff in any of the reception areas, you are welcomed warmly ! We visited recently for morning coffee and although our bill was relatively small we were treated like royalty ! That's what makes a hotel special and makes you want to return again and again. We are already planning our next family celebration there ! ",5,2017,04,14
200,Good customer service,"The room was lovely and we were upgraded also which was nice. Staff could not have been friendlier and more helpful. 
We were underwhelmed by the dinner in the cellar restaurant but staff again couldn't have been nicer so that helped!
The pool and spa was lovely; well maintained and very relaxing.",4,2017,04,14
200,Never fails to impress and excel.,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion again for three nights last week.  From start to finish our experience was one of pure enjoyment.  My initial reservation was handled professionally and politely by Stefan, in fact all the staff throughout our stay were exemplary.  You could argue that this is just what you should expect from a five star hotel, but somehow the staff at The Merrion seem to deliver it with their 'understated elegance'.

There was visual evidence of building work being carried out at the hotel, but at no point were we disturbed or in fact hear any noise.

We will certainly stay at the hotel again when we next visit Dublin.  Thank you.",5,2017,04,14
200,Highly recommend,"Thank you Merrion staff for the wonderful welcome! I have always heard that the Irish are amazing, friendly people...this visit surpassed my expectations! Best hotel ever! I am looking forward to returning and seeing all the changes and upgrades you are in the process of making! Spectacular location and excellent staff!",5,2017,04,14
200,Loved this hotel,"We had a wonderful 2 night stay at this hotel last week.  The thing I liked best was the high quality of service, and how much they treated us like family.  Everyone there was genuinely nice and went out of their way to help us.  Club 23 cocktail bar was a delight and the drinks were wonderful!  It's hidden behind a door in the lobby, and felt like entering a secret club.  The hotel even made all the arrangements for me to rent a car from home.  All I had to do was show up with my credit card.  They made it so easy!  The location is great, right by Trinity College and St. Stephens Green, and close to Grafton Street, and many other sights.  They have a special Sunday-Monday stay rate that made our stay less expensive, which was a nice bonus.  I love this hotel and will definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2017,04,14
200,Great breakfast ,"It's really a great place and somewhat flawless. From the front door to the reception area , the bar. Restaurant, the art work, tea and scones ...place is just class. Bit pricy but location is magnificent. ",5,2017,04,13
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Perfect location.  Exceptional attentive staff.  Lovely comfortable rooms and great choices for food.  You can go from simple to gastronomic genius!!  Afternoon tea with all the trimmings to room service which was also excellent!

It's a wonderful hotel to experience beautiful Dublin and to be honest, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2017,04,13
200,Delightful Surprise,"The hotel I was supposed to stay in was fully booked and so I chose The Merrion for city convenience and got so much more.  

Everything from check-in to my room, the room itself, to room service, their amazing Club Sandwich in No23, fabulous Cosmo's in The Cellar Bar - all top notch!  We even had the pleasure of seeing Enda Kenny in The Cellar!!!  

It seems to be a favourite for American tourists (Obama has stayed there) and movie stars (although I didn't see anyone) but I thought it was fabulous and would definitely stay there again.

Mr Peter MacCann - if you're reading - thank you!!  Your staff and customer service were excellent!!",5,2017,04,13
200,"Old World Class,","We stayed for one night as part of our first anniversary, this is an amazing old world hotel with a great spa facility, everything falls into first class from the staff who are very attentive to the food service which is really first class. The only disappointment we had was our view was we though garden view, but instead we only viewed a laneway and bin, but other than that the service is great and everything feels well cared for and maintained. 

We will look to go back for a night or two again in the future.",5,2017,04,12
200,Great stay at the Merrion.,We loved the Merrion.  It has a perfect location in Dublin and is within walking distance to anything.  The staff and restaurant is top notch.  We particularly enjoyed breakfast in the Cellar restaurant during our stay.,5,2017,04,11
200,Belated Birthday Afternoon Tea,"Spent a lovely afternoon last Thursday eating afternoon tea at The Merrion. The service was brilliant and the afternoon tea scrumptious, we were sat in front of a lovely log fire and thoroughly pampered, we even had Happy Birthday iced on our desert plates! Thanks to Julie for looking after us so well.  We will be back.",5,2017,04,11
200,The finest hotel in Dublin,I stayed one night in The Merrion on business and it is the pinnacle of Irish hospitality. The doormen are courteous and friendly and all of the staff make sure that you are looked after throughout your stay. Dublin city centre and particularly government buildings are on your doorstep. The rooms are elegantly appointed and the food both in the Cellar Bar and at breakfast was thoroughly enjoyable. A must for any visit to Dublin.,5,2017,04,11
200,Lovely hotel,Brilliant hotel great staff. Room was lovely. Be careful when they hold a credit card it took over 3 weeks to get the €1900 they held on in put back in my account  took 3 phone calls for this to be done,5,2017,04,11
200,Uttterly ok,"I am honestly quite surprised that this is a five star hotel because literally everything is just ok. You check-in and your room isn't ready. Your room comes with free cocktails and appetizers but they are not available when you are at the bar. As an avid traveler, I would honestly stay somewhere else although it is a decent location if you are on a company expense account.",2,2017,04,08
200,Perfect location with lovely facilities ,"The staff greeted us warmly and were very personable and showed us to our room quickly and luggage was also delivered quick. Room was lovely and well equipped. 

The location cannot be beat, a quick walk to St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street, and a variety of other sites. Convenient to public transportation as well. Many pubs and other small dining options. 

Hotel is large and only drawback is finding your way around each time! But so much to see and explore! Very quiet. Lots of mirrors in bathroom..

Beautiful Oscar Wilde themed water each day in room:) Staff arranged ride to airport and were very attentive mailing postcards for us, making recommendations and answering questions. ",5,2017,04,07
200,Elegant with high attention to detail.,"The best hotel in Dublin. The room was beautiful, the location and The Cellar restaurant were good, and the staff was great. The only downside was construction on the property. I didn't hear the workmen until 9am.",5,2017,04,07
200,I have always stayed in 5-star hotels all over the world but this hotel is one of my best so far.,"Very good location - you can walk to Stephen's Green park, to Grafton St shopping area, Trinity College where the Book of Kells is and other must-see places in Dublin! The Parliament is just across the street so it is a very safe area. Bars are everywhere nearby. You can walk alone at night and still feel very safe. ",5,2017,04,07
200,Engaged at The Merrion!,"Oh my goodness - I can't even think of where to begin with describing this fantastic property. When we arrived we were greeted by the amazing door staff who took our bags immediately. Check in took about 5 minutes and we were given a personal tour of the hotel (the man at the front desk was great, and I cannot remember his name - but he was French and such a joy!). Our room was absolutely amazing. We did have a view of the gym across the street but I wasn't too concerned because we planned on spending most of our time in the city - so if that's an issue for you make sure you request a garden view of the courtyard. Didn't bother me one bit. 

The bed was a dream come true! Super comfortable. The bathroom was also amazing. The staff? Some of the BEST staff I've ever encountered in all of my travels. From the desk, to the housekeeping, to the bar and restaurant staff - above and beyond any expectations. The housekeeping staff not only cleaned our room, but even organized and folded some of my belongings that I haphazardly had thrown on a chair/etc. The housekeeping staff is the best I've ever had in my life.

Location is the best you could ask for. Pubs around the corner, Spar, and St Stephen's Green is about a 5 minute walk - also the shopping center is right there. Oscar Wilde house and museums are less than a ten minute walk. 

If you have the chance to attend the Art Tea I HIGHLY recommend it. The entire experience was so great, and the food was delicious. The hotel itself has a huge private collection which is scattered throughout the property. When you check in you'll receive a booklet that gives you a little self guided tour if you'd like to walk around the hotel. These are the original works and it's pretty amazing to be in the presence of them while walking to the main entrance. 

The courtyard is beautiful, and if the weather was warmer I would have loved to have sit outside and had lunch - so this just means I'll have to come back. 

To top it all off, my boyfriend (now fiance!) proposed on our last night there. The bar staff treated us to champagne and helped us celebrate. I couldn't have asked for a more magical stay and I can't wait to be back - possibly honeymoon? 

I am sure I've missed a ton of other incredible points but if you have the opportunity BOOK this hotel. You will NOT be disappointing.",5,2017,04,06
200,"Good, but not outstanding.....","This is regarded as one of the best hotels in Dublin and perhaps I am looking with the eyes of a spoiled Dutch guy, but I was not convinced. The location is in the center of Dublin two streets away from e.g. Trinity College. It´s large, but the entrance is not spectacular. The staff is nice, however mostly non-UK/Irish.

The interior of the lounge is classic and nice, but the hall way to the rooms is some chaotic. Lot of contractor activity in the building.

The room is nice, beds are outstanding, bathroom is ok. Interior needs an upgrade. My room was within the building overlooking a buildingsite, small windows.

Breakfast is standard, the staff is doing its best. This hotel doesn´t have the 5 star standard in my opinion.",3,2017,04,06
200,Still King of Dublin Hotels,"Having stayed in many of Dublin's hotels the Merrion stays top because the guest is King, unlike other hotels in Dublin where the bar clientele rule. From the welcome on the front steps to all levels of service they deliver.",4,2017,04,05
200,Dublin extravaganza,"Really the best hotel in Dublin. Excellent service, rooms are outstanding in the original building. Would recommend booking afternoon tea in advance since very popular. Location perfect for a full Dublin experience ",5,2017,04,05
200,Simply Stunning ,"My husband and I checked in for 1 nite on Friday 31st. From the moment we arrived at the valet parking we felt welcome. Check in was seemless, our room was ready early which is as fantastic. Stunning room with two windows, beautiful decor with a fireplace. Our first reaction was Wow, what a beautiful room!. We had some lunch in No 23 and even though there was a wedding on and it was pretty busy, the staff were calm and efficient. Lunch was delicious as were desserts. I found all staff excellent and very professional. Cocktails were very well made. The king size bed was super comfy. Turndown service was wonderful, superb attention to detail. Breakfast was relaxing with a great choice surrounded by paintings in a white cave.
Definitely worth a visit. A real 5 star experience. We both agreed, the nicest room we've stayed in in town.",5,2017,04,05
200,Definatley a 5* Hotel!,We had an superb time at the Meriion Hotel. All the staff was so welcoming and really put our needs first! All areas of service was great from the recepton to the pool! Would really recommend this for a stay in Dublin and its definatley worth its 5* rating!!!!,5,2017,04,04
200,Classy,Small scale front reception rooms give way to a large hotel.  Efficiently managed - if a bit obsequious - driven by the shear volume of activity of many many guests.   The location cannot be beat.  The concierge service ranged from superior to mediocre - however - so pick your person (they change often during the day) carefully.  I was in the garden wing which was a delightful room on the inside - but nothing to look at.  I think it's better to have a interior garden room - or - if you like old world - stay in the front building itself.,4,2017,04,04
200,Superb hotel,"Staff were efficient and welcoming. Hotel was lovely. Room was beautiful and spacious, with plenty of nice touches, and a really comfortable bed.
Was quite expensive but the price was reflected in the quality and it was worth it.",5,2017,04,04
200,Perfect stay in Dublin,Came here for a two day stay with my family before departing onto other destinations in ireland.  We arrived mid morning and were able to check into our room early.  The staff was so accommodating and helpful at our arrival.  No other hotel in Ireland could compare to the Merrion.  We loved the breakfast in the Cellar restaurant.  Our room was extraordinary and the location made everything within walking distance.,5,2017,04,03
200,Amazing Service,"These people really take the cake for 5 star. As I was getting my bags out of the cab I hired from the airport, they were pushing me away from them so that they could get it. The elevators are little dated, but you're only in it for 30 seconds. The room I stayed in (206) was spacious and luxurious. The King sized bed was so soft, and they also provided a fruit basket with chocolate strawberries and some small chocolates. The pool is amazing and super large, also with a small steam room (the size of the hotel bathrooms) to relax in. The shower rooms are nice. Just overall a nice hotel.",5,2017,04,03
200,Excellent Stay in Dublin,Recently had a 3 night stay at the Merrion in Dublin with my daughter and friends.  Great location and wonderful service.  The concierge was very helpful.  We enjoyed the breakfast as well!  Rooms were beautiful and very well equipped.,5,2017,04,02
200,Reliable leading world hotel,"Bar area a bit drab and dark could do with a make over 
Shame David collins dead he could something special with it
Cakes in afternoon tea a a marvel
Moe fresh flowers compare it with flower arrangements 
In George V in Paris which always uplifting 
I would say a bit dull
",5,2017,04,02
200,Top notch,"Booked through Centurion and had a fabulous upgrade ,even if we did have to wait 45 mins,and on a rugby weekend !
Treated like regular guests and made to feel very much at home . Lovely huge room in the original building overlooking St Stephens,extremely comfortable and spotless.
Excellent spread for breakfast and equally good service. Fine relaxing pool and spa complex. Great bunch of guys running the concierge service.
It is the best in Dublin by far.",5,2017,03,31
200,"Lovely hotel, can be a tad stuffy","We loved The Merrion Hotel but at times felt that some of the guests in the lobby seating area appeared snobby and looked down at us in our tourist clothes.  My husband prefers to wear shorts and golf shirts in the summer and doesn't dress for dinner but once or twice while on vacation.  The walk through the lobby to our rooms in the evening was awkward and uncomfortable so we won't be returning this summer to The Merrion. I believe this is a place to be seen and feel important so American tourists, not dressed for the evening are frowned upon by some visitors/guests.   Never did the staff make us feel uncomfortable, in fact they were amazing.  The rooms were beautiful and extremely comfortable.  The gardens are beautiful and the location was convenient.",5,2017,03,30
200,Best Dublin Hotel,You will find no other lodging with the meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of operation.  From the entrance greeting to housekeeping to the wonderful Cellar Restaurant and Bar.  Look no further.,5,2017,03,30
200,First stay at the Merrion ,"As my driver said on my way to the hotel, for my first stay there in Dublin, it is the best in town. Truly is. Discreet frontage opens into an impressive lounge. Great service from entrance to check out. Front desk staff superb. Helpful. Rooms very spacious. Room service excellent. It's a hotel to do on holiday with family or a loved one when coming to Dublin. Great first stay, though a short one. ",5,2017,03,29
200,Highly Recommended,We were aware that The Merrion Hotel had good reviews on TA which is why we booked it.  And we were not disappointed.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels but can honestly say this is the best.  What makes it stand out is the staff and the service they provide; nothing is too much trouble.  There are renovations going on at the moment - even the builders were considerate.  My gf left her mobile phone in an Uber - as I write it is winging its way back to us courtesy of The Merrion.  The hotel is clean and spacious and has an air of grandeur.  Yet it's relaxed too.  Our room was well equipped and spacious.  We would definitely return and definitely recommend.,5,2017,03,29
200,Amazing hotel in a fantastic location!,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is used to exceptional service, great food and a superb location and you won't be disappointed. I had the best oatmeal of my life, they call it Irish Porridge, but I just thought of it as amazing oatmeal!",5,2017,03,29
200,Fantastic experience,"My wife and I had one of the most enjoyable experiences at the Merrion hotel. This was our first stay at the Merrion and there is nothing I could fault, from the minute we checked in until the moment we checked out the experience was superb. We have stayed in most if not all of the 4/5 star hotels in Dublin and I can say without doubt this is the best. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,03,29
200,Great City Hotel,"Great location and staff at this hotel, the even posted my, left behind, mobile phone charger to my home, after one quick email. Food in Cellar restaurant was excellent, room was comfortable and quiet",5,2017,03,29
200,Good Classic Dublin Hotel,"Very Good Dublin Hotel, conveniently situated - short distance from all the good restaurants and shops. Also a very good quality breakfast, with very pleasant staff.  I would thoroughly recommend the Hotel.",4,2017,03,29
200,Great Hotel!,"Service, friendliness and professionalism of all staff exceptional.
All areas clean and tidy. Gracious and calm and restful atmosphere.
Loved the historical elements of the hotel and the great art!
We will return!",5,2017,03,29
200,Wonderful Afternoon 'Art' Tea!,"My sister and I decided to stop here for the Merrion Afternoon 'Art' Tea. It was a great twist on something we've done rather a lot of!

The rooms are absolutely beautiful.  The staff are very friendly and attentive. We were given a personal copy of a book on the art on display in the hotel and a menu to select our tea from.  

The food was served in two courses - firstly a 3-tiered cake tray filled with sandwiches, cakes and scones and then a serving of 3 miniature desserts based on 3 of the pieces of art in the book.

We were absolutely defeated by the amount of food there was for just the two of us in the first course.  Fortunately the staff are obviously familiar with the look on our faces and arranged for our remaining cakes to be packaged up in a lovely bag for us to take home.  They did the same for another couple on a nearby table.

The second course was absolutely unique! We were served with 3 desserts each on a lovely decorated tray. The staff explained each of the desserts and how they represent the artwork.  It was a wonderful lavish experience that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good afternoon tea!",5,2017,03,27
200,Wonderful hotel,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed in the Merrion never want to return home,so beautiful and the staff are truly amazing. There was absolutely nothing to fault will be returning again this year can not wait!!!! ",5,2017,03,26
200,Best Hotel In Dublin,"The Hotel offers period charm, modern facilities, large rooms, location that can't be beat, fantastic food and the best staff in Dublin. Would recommend for business or leisure, families or couples",5,2017,03,25
200,The Perfect Hotel,"Everyone says the Irish are the most hospitable people, but it should be that hospitality extends beyond just the Irish as this an international staff - all wonderful, knowledable and goes out of their way.  The rooms are big, comfortable an kept well. The bathrooms are all marble.  While the gardens are under construction, they are still lovely to stroll.  Breakfast is a highlight.  My son is still saying the kippers were his best meal in Dublin.  A special thanks to Ali in reception and the entire crew for making it a memorable stay.",5,2017,03,25
200,Excellent from start to finish,"Superb from the moment you arrived to the moment you leave the food both dinner and breakfast wonderful and rooms so clean and comfortable , the staff were friendly and couldn't do enough the rooms were spotless with lovely robes and slippers ",5,2017,03,25
200,Great Vacation Time,"The hotel is really nice and the service is of really great quality. Food was excellent. They keep in mind every small detail for you to be comfortable. 
Patrick Guillbard restaurant was an extraordinary experience, worth the michelin stars he has. ",5,2017,03,25
200,Few days ,"Very clean and smart hotel charming staff great location. Bar very quiet which would perhaps suits some quests but I had no desire to sit there but as I say it's situated close to many bars.  Best Guinness nearby is Foley's across the road or Neary's off grafton street 

",5,2017,03,24
200,Wonderful,"Stayed here with my daughter recently. An initial mix up with the room was resolved with an upgrade to a beautiful suite, amply compensating for the earlier inconvenience. I had booked two one hour treatments in the spa which were heavenly. I would say that there lacks a quiet relaxing place to unwind after treatments. The spa lobby can be busy and is off the gym so not exactly zen. However the service in the spa was very warm and friendly and the treatment was finished off with a delicious sorbet. After dinner and a show, we ended our evening in front of a roaring fire with a beautifully executed cocktail in the hotel drawing room - probably the best hotel drawing room in Dublin. ",5,2017,03,23
200,"Nice place, nice staff but a bit imposing staff","The place is nice, well kept and the bedrooms are of very good size.
The only annoying part I found was the staff who is simply nice but simply too much there, asking you all the time if you need something, something I find particularly annoying, especially at breakfast. Asking someone if they want orange juice knowing that it is available from the buffet is simply too much in my view.
This is clearly a way management wants its staff to behave as they all behave the same way, ask the same questions in the same order etc. and don't seem to adjust to the client body language (mine being clearly (I think) that I don't need anything).",3,2017,03,23
200,An exceptionally good hotel,"Nothing flashy but beautifully designed and decorated. Our garden room was extremely comfortable and quiet. Everything needed was there and it all worked. The staff in all areas are charming and extremely competent at everything they do. Dublin is a great city to visit and the Merrion sets an amazing standard for other aspiring hotels to follow. 
",5,2017,03,22
200,St Patrick's Weekend. ,"Just came back from a few days stay at this hotel. Location was superb being just slightly out of town but close enough to walk into Grafton Street. Fabulously located near Toners a great local bar with a good pint of Guinness. 

Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the accommodation was very comfortable although it was hard to get the room cool enough so had to have the window open. Not too much of a problem as a little off the main road but still a little bit of noise. 

Breakfast was good with plenty of choice however maybe just due to the amount of people service could have been a little quicker. We ate in the hotel on the Friday night and our group was split on the food. Those that had the fish thought it was good food and those that had the steak thought it was average. 

Overall a good friendly stay and I would recommend ",4,2017,03,22
200,Another perfect stay,"Every year they deliver a truly relaxing and luxurious stay - remarkably uncommon!  Staff are so courteous, restaurants and services are fantastic and I recommend that should you ever visit Dublin a visit to the Merrion is a must!

",5,2017,03,22
200,Great visit to the Merrion!,"We stayed here our first 2 nights in Ireland.  I would easily recommend the Merrion to anyone looking for a first class hotel in a great location.  We were within easy walking distance to St Stephens Green, many pubs, our Dublin walking tour and great restaurants.  Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious (try the eggs Benedict!). 

We stayed in a 2 bedroom Garden Wing suite which was perfect as my husband and I were traveling with our two adult children so we all had our own space but were still ""together"".  The beds were very, very comfortable!  They brought us complimentary champagne and dessert pastries which was a very nice touch!

The service was exceptional!  Would definitely stay at the Merrion again!",5,2017,03,19
200,My tour of Dublin,Reasonable price for very high end service. Staff was extremely accommodating and very friendly. Stayed 5 nights after a very early arrival which was immediately made simple by ushering me to a room that was ready (not the exact one I'd booked but it was 7:30am) and very happy to get me settled. Bar was lovely as was the gym and pool was exceptional. Food was excellent and location really perfect. The heart of Dublin I'd say...it was almost too nice! I would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,03,16
200,Just gorgeous!,"My wife and I have stayed here a few times but not recently. 

It felt like coming home, it's just such a wonderful experience and a very calming place to be. We just love the place. It is expensive but worth every penny!

If you can appreciate and enjoy the finer things in life you will feel at home here. 

I'm going to leave it here because I could go on writing something as long a War and Peace but I won't!!

Thank you Merrion,  justifiably number 1",5,2017,03,15
200,Birthday Treat in 5 star heaven!,"Having spent a night in the merrion hotel this week for my husbands 40th birthday I had to write a review.  From the moment we arrived until the minute we left was nothing but luxury and 5* service.  The room was beautilful lavish furnishings and the most comfortable bed ever!! The pool was lovely, didnt use the spa but will be on our return visit.  Everything was catered for and also our toddler daughter.  They go the extra mile here with attention to detail.  Breakfast was superb, best I have had in a 5* hotel.  We cannot wait to come back, staff are so nice and pleasant and nothing is too much trouble.  
Also, we were upgraded for my hubbys birthday with cupcakes with happy birthday greeting in the room on our arrival.  Top class service, thanks to all at the merrion.  We will be back..",5,2017,03,15
200,"Great place to stay in the city, very classy and beautiful.","My family and our family friends all traveled to this hotel together for a total of twelve people. Upon arrival the hotel wowed you by the entrance and the foyer, both were so gorgeous. The staff was friendly and had our rooms ready for us right away and took our luggage to our rooms promptly and in an organized fashion. 

The rooms were clean and pretty, nothing extravagant. Although, you still knew you were in a high class hotel. Our view on the balcony of our room was unexpected for having been located in the city. It overlooked a pretty courtyard that was nicely taken care of. The amenities were luxurious, the pool was stunning and the workout room was large and nice to use in the mornings in the city. The staff was easy to get along with and recommended us a nice restaurant to eat nearly that we enjoyed.",5,2017,03,14
200,Fantastic hotel,"An amazing hotel with superb customer service and care. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and really enjoyed our time there.

The rooms are lovely and spacious with very comfortable beds. There is also a spa to use which is relaxing. The cocktail bar offers delicious cocktails. 

A truly enjoyable stay!",5,2017,03,14
200,"Incredibly attentive, friendly service","My husband and I have travelled the World, staying at some incredible hotels - but we both agree that the service at The Merrion was the friendliest, most efficient and high quality we have ever experienced. We stayed just for two nights and will absolutely be back. The room, although not the most expensive on offer, was huge, with lovely detail, such as Asprey toiletries and slippers laid out during the evening turn-down service. We had dinner in the attached 2* Michelin restaurant which I would highly recommend. One small thing to beware of, which I have fallen foul of before - the hotel takes an initial payment on your card to cover any incidentals, which then gets topped up if you exceed the amount. I hadn't clicked and when I saw 2 x large amounts having come out on my card before we checked out, I thought I had been the victim of credit card fraud and called my bank to investigate! However, a beautiful hotel, with wonderful, friendly staff, in a perfect location from which walk around the city. There is no-where else I would choose to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,03,14
200,Sweet dreams.....the Merrion is exquisite.....,"Our first night in Ireland...we were tired, we were hungry.....they sure made us feel at home. The Merrion is exquisite and yet quite comfortable. Our room had the loveliest amenities and the bed made me want to stay forever! The tea rooms, the bar, the everything made us feel like we had stepped back into the history of Dublin. The food, especially the breakfast, was perfect, right down to the silver toast rack!",5,2017,03,13
200,Superb Hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel comprising a terrace of houses on Merrion Street with a new wing being built behind.

Staff are all extremely friendly and helpful.

There is building work going on but this is kept to daylight hours so does not interfere with the enjoyment of the hotel.

Room very good with all amenities required.

A special mention has to be made of the breakfast here.  Too many places nowadays have a self-service buffet breakfast including hot items - not at the Merrion.  Although there is a self selection for cereals etc. the hot breakfast is cooked to order with table service including service of fruit juice, toast, and tea/coffee.  Nothing too much trouble for the staff who are very attentive.

It is also well situated with plenty of restaurants in very close proximity.",5,2017,03,13
200,Great hotel with excellent amenities and service.,"I've only spent one night at the hotel and made me wish I stayed longer. I will definitely go back if I ever get to visit Dublin again. Rooms are nice and quite big, service was excellent and very friendly. Concierge helped me plan my evening and I really enjoyed myself.",5,2017,03,13
200,Perfect stay,"My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at The Merrion and could not have been more pleased at the choice. The staff were exceedingly friendly, polite and helpful. The interior of the hotel is perfectly done, elegant, but comfortable. We had the smaller room, but it was more than large enough for us, again, perfectly and freshly decorated. We loved the bathroom, and having a Nespresso machine in our room that was well-stocked.

We made use of the spa services and the pool, which again, exceeded our expectations. There is no doubt, that our next return to Dublin will include a stay at the Merrion.",5,2017,03,12
200,"Excellent, elegant hotel","I have stayed here twice.  This beautiful hotel merged several classic townhouses into a single complex. The location is excellent - Dublin is an extremely walkable city - and the Merrion is centrally located. 
Quite nice amenities. They have a great pool with beautiful mosaic tile work, and a small fitness area. A steam room is accessible from the pool.  The fitness center changing rooms are very nice, and have everything you might need.  They offer spa services, including massages and facials. 
The rooms are well appointed and classically decorated.  The rooms are nicely sized.  I've stayed in other older hotels in Dublin where the rooms were a bit claustrophobic. Immaculately clean.  Lovely tea time service.  Excellent staff, they are very helpful and kind, and always extremely professional. If you arrive on a red eye they do their best to get a room ready for you, or set you up with a place to freshen up or even nap if you need it.  
The Merrion is my favorite hotel in Dublin, I always stay here if they have availability.",5,2017,03,11
200,Outstanding service and facilities,"I am pleased to confirm that our faith was restored in this very fine hotel after a disappointment last Autumn.  We were greeted by Concierge on arrival from the airport by taxi and our (heavy) suitcase found its way quickly to our room.  Reception staff gave us a warm and helpful welcome, passing over the Dublin to Belfast rail tickets which Concierge had pre-ordered for us. The young lady showed us to Room 284 in the main part of the hotel and this offered superb facilities.
The bathroom was excellent and I particularly enjoyed the large walk-in shower with the prominent safety handle – a feature sadly still absent in many good quality hotels.  The room was beautifully furnished and we enjoyed a wonderful sleep, thanks to the large king-size bed and the perfect double glazing which ensured no noise at all from the road.
We had lunch in the lounge and much enjoyed the delicious soup, sandwiches and dessert (eu 16.00pp). It was attractively presented and just the right quantity.  Breakfast (eu 25.00 for the Full Irish) was to a similarly high standard and I loved the local oak-smoked kippers with warm soda bread whilst my wife took full opportunity to indulge the fruit and cereal on offer.
This hotel is well placed on the south side of the river near to good shops, restaurants and bars. It is housed in a lovely Georgian building and will be even more luxurious when current developments are concluded before the summer. Recommended without hesitation as Dublin's finest luxury hotel",5,2017,03,11
200,"Good hotel, with access to  fitness next door","Overall this is a good hotel with the usual amenities. However, it is worth mentioning that there is also a fitness center around the block where you can buy access to (10€ pr. day) - which is essentially a low-end fitness center - but if you are looking for a wide range of equipment this is a lot better than a hotel GYM. The hotel has a small gym - but I would go for the bigger one.",5,2017,03,10
200,5* Experiencce,"Stayed at the Merrion as a treat for my wife's birthday, I have to say that the experience is 2nd to none. The staff treated us very well, and the whole experience was that of attention to the little things of making stay the best experience - as the quote goes the difference between good and greatness is attention to detail.  The Merrion has this down to a fine art",5,2017,03,08
200,Very nice and elegant experience.,"Stayed at the Merrion for one night in early March. Hotel is extremely well positioned in the center of Dublin and, maybe helped by it being a Sunday night, offered a quiet, very elegant and calm haven. Good quality public rooms, very well decorated, nice art collection and good attention to detail. Elegant residents bar with knowledgeable and super friendly staff who worked together to provide a very good experience. Nice spacious, very bright and airy bedroom in the main house, backing on to the rear courtyard, staff super efficient and very efficiently managed a couple of requests to make our stay more comfortable. Nice touches for my partner's birthday. Was a very good stay all-up. Few marginal areas for feedback; unfortunately on the night we visited the main restaurant was closed so we had dinner in the 'cellar' - very good service but food quality was a little variable (very tough fillet; tough salmon 'sashimi') still was an OK experience; elevator and corridor in the main house (floor two) had a funky smell to it which could be easily addressed; finally and most likely due to the age of the property the room directly above us had creaky floorboards and an early rising guest staying in it which caused some early morning disturbance). Certainly somewhere I would recommend as an excellent base for exploring Dublin.",4,2017,03,08
200,The Best Place to Stay in Dublin.,"If you want to stay in Pure luxury and have the best food and drinks and the most relaxing time you wont find a greater place than the Merrion Hotel. Its hard to believe this is in the heart of Dublin as its so quite. This should be recognized as a 6/7 STAR Hotel as they leave nothing out in their exceptional customer service., you will be amazed the level of detail they go too to make your experience so great. I would give this a 100% mark - Outstanding in everything they do.  A.Guy.",5,2017,03,07
200,A special place for a special occasion,"For a special occasion there is no more special place to choose in Dublin than the Merrion , 
It is a five star in every way from the moment you walk in the door  .... They pay great attention to detail and ensure your stay is as perfect and personal as possible from start to finish , Thank you to all the staff who made our weekend so memorable for all the right reasons , excellent customer service and friendliness , a beautiful room and great food and service ... as very special thank you to Dusan , Ast.  front of house manager for organisng every aspect of our stay and meeting and exceeding our expectations",5,2017,03,06
200,Best city hotel ?,"This place is truly lovely, welcoming , cosy and gracious. In the centre of Dublin , yet you could be in a country house. The welcome on the from door steps from Patrick sets the standard for a stay at the Merrion.  Try it , you won't be disappointed.......and whether you have soup and a sandwich in the bar or dine in style at Patrick Giulbaud you will feel spoilt.",5,2017,03,05
200,The perfect stay,"Absolute perfection from beginning to end. We stayed for 2 nights in a suite and I truly wish it had been longer. He staff, ambience and charm of this hotel are second to none in Dublin, genuinely. It is superbly located within 5 minutes of Dublin's main shopping street with superb bars and restaurants in every direction. However, you don't really need to leave the hotel grounds for anything at all, the exceptional Patrick Gilbauds restaurant and the wonderful Cellar Bar are all under the same roof. This was our most perfect Dublin stay ever. We cannot wait to revisit. ",5,2017,03,04
200,Romantic escape,"We stay in The Merrion a couple of of times a year and really love the place, the rooms food service and staff are amazing. Unfortunately the last time we stayed there was a bit of a mix up with our room but it was rectified and we are assured that it won't happen on our next visit. That maybe says all you need to know about this place, even mistakes are delt with well and this one certainly would not deter us from returning. Perfect for a shopping/sightseeing trip to Dublin, cosy bar for evening drinks in the winter or beautiful afternoon tea overlooking the gardens in the summer. Superb !! We will keep returning ",5,2017,03,03
200,Excellent hotel!!,"We had an amazing weekend. Room, food, service, it was all just perfect. 
It was like being in a dolls house. Staff is very professional and always there for you. Very comfortable place, love the lobby.",5,2017,03,02
200,Relaxing Visit to the Emerald Isle,"We looked at most of the hotels listed on trip advisor and settle for the Number 1 hotel in Dublin. We arrived on a Monday evening late (23:00) and were greeted by the doorman, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble and the staff (Irish) could not do enough for us. A special mention goes out to Laura (food and drink) who went way above what would normally be expected of any staff member and we are currently enjoying the various recommendations of places to visit and stay. Thanks

The room was well equipped and spotless. The bed was to die for and is probably one of the best nights sleep I have had in a hotel ever. The various free products are all from Asprey which were lovely, even though we brought our own (LOL).

I can say that staying in the hotel was like staying at home, everything was perfect and we will be back.

The gym is small, but has everything you will need, from treadmill to free weights. Pool was a reasonable size and well worth a visit.

We spent most evenings in the Cellar bar which offers both intimate locations as well as the more sociable areas if thats what you want. Food is well priced and excellent quality, make sure you pay it a visit. If you want Michelin star quality food the Patrick Guilbrand restaurant is next door and you can get seats if you speak to concierge.

This is a hotel I will definitely visit again 5 star all the way.

We wished to extend our stay due to enjoying it so much, however someone had decided to book a six nations rugby team(French) into the hotel so no availability. Next time will make sure book for longer.",5,2017,03,01
200,Ann,"We have stayed here numerous times and as usual it doesn't disappoint 
Location is fantastic for seeing the city and staff , service , food and ambience are of the highest standard . I highly recommend the Merrion ",5,2017,03,01
200,Luxury in Dublin,"The Merrion does everything so well - it's an experience which is hard to beat. We have stayed many times and it's consistency of service is to be commended. In addition it is so well located, with great facilities for a city hotel. ",5,2017,03,01
200,"Warm staff, great concierge.. felt like being in aristocratic old London","Loved loved loved the Merrion, staff was awesome, the room was amazing and that bed!!! tjoooo!! Only had a bit of a hiccup on the last night when hotel was fully booked and my neighbours came in noisily at 3.30am! but as soon as I called front desk it was sorted! Would recommend for anyone in Dublin!.",5,2017,02,28
200,Perfect weekend hotel,"Excellent central location in good area.Temple Bar 5 minutes walk. Good restaurants nearby. 
Lovely sofas by log fires to collapse into at the end of the day. Interesting art throughout hotel.
Charmimg,friendly service  and very helpful concierge who tracked our lost bag at the airport :he  got it to us quickly without any fuss. 
Well equipped rooms with very comfy beds,soft towels,good separate shower etc.
Inviting ,warm pool and spa.Good range of treatments....

What not to like.?",5,2017,02,27
200,"Terrific service, warm and delightful","Beautiful hotel with wonderful service, a genuinely warm and inviting place to stay.  Lunch in the cellar bar was delicious and room service likewise.  The team were so helpful and always there with a smile.",5,2017,02,27
200,"Excellent, will be back","Stayed here while visiting a friend recently, suited all my needs perfectly. Reception staff were brilliant from the outset and catered for everything with a smile. Bed was extremely comfortable and the room was warm enough without being too warm. Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. Will be returning..",5,2017,02,25
200,Irish Splendor and Charm in Digital,"Everyone we asked said the Merrion is one of the 2 best Hotels in Dublin, and I agree.  Greeted by the doorman in top-hat, inside the door to your right is a bellman operating a computer terminal, servicing patron requests and inquiries.  You are greeted in the Lobby by a host of employees, all anxious to serve.  Everything about the Merrion is top-drawer, yet they are not ""class"" conscious.  They realize the new social reality of the .com world.  They leave no one out and nothing to chance in serving their guests.
The Merrion is in a great location, close to all the action.  Don't miss the splendor, amenities, and comfort of this hotel if you get the opportunity.",5,2017,02,25
200,The Merrion Dublin,"Excellent hotel, superb experience. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. One of the best hotels I have stayed in. If ever you are in Dublin, a dinner at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is a MUST. It is Ireland’s only Two Star Michelin restaurant. The Cellar Bar is also an excellent venue.",5,2017,02,25
200,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at,"The Merrion is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The room and facilities were impeccably clean, the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, the service was excellent, and the location was great.  The hotel was seriously one of the best parts of Dublin.  I don't think I've ever experienced such perfect service in a hotel.  Wifi is great, pool is beautiful (my only ""complaint"" about the hotel is that I wish the water temperature were a bit warmer), bed was among the most comfortable I've slept in, bathroom was gorgeous...I could go on.  Amazing in all ways. I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough.",5,2017,02,24
200,Feels like home,"Fantastic and beautiful hotel. Everything you would need from a 5 star hotel. Large and clean rooms. Bar is great as well as the pool area. Breakfast is medium so try find a nice place nearby and probably much cheaper. 
",5,2017,02,22
200,Excellent,"It's difficult to find fault with this hotel as we were so happy with it.

We received a warm welcome when getting out of the taxi and after a quick check in process were escorted to our room.

The room is lovely, nice and big and spotlessly clean as you would expect from this sort of hotel.

Staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We went into Bar 23 for a drink but it was full so a member of staff suggested we tried the Cellar Bar.  He then escorted us to the bar which is appreciated.

Whilst we were out for dinner the room was turned out and at the same time the bottls of water and tea bags were topped up.  A very nice touch.

We both slept very well.  The shower was excellent, the temperature was consistent and I really liked the smell of the shampoo and shower gel.

Next time we're in Dublin we will definitely stay here.",5,2017,02,22
200,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff who couldn't do enough for you. Worth every penny, would definitely stay again. The location is perfect, Grafton St and Temple Bar is within walking distance and surrounded by great bars and restaurants. The hotel's own Cellar Bar is also great.",5,2017,02,22
200,Fabulous stay in the Merrion,We recently stayed at the Merrion to celebrate a special anniversary and from the moment we arrived that was exactly how we felt.  The facilities and staff are excellent and the quality of service was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking  for an oasis in the centre of the city.,5,2017,02,22
200,Five star experience,"A true five star hotel,impeccably clean and very friendly and helpful staff. Some rooms have unpleasant and uninteresting views so should be cheaper. There is a lack of lobby sitting area as Afternoon Tea customers avail of these. Service in the Cellar reataurant is too quick .  A beautiful hotel to explore with some very interesting art work and period features.",5,2017,02,22
200,Great little escape into the city,"The perfect romantic getaway for Valentines Day. Amazing location, the comfiest bed and the most delicious breakfast! I cannot fault the service and staff were the friendliest I've come across in Dublin.",5,2017,02,22
200,The perfect stay,"We like to treat ourselves to an annual break in the city and we like to try different hotels in the search for ""the perfect stay"". 
Well, our search is over. We have found the perfect hotel. In The Merrion Hotel, we have found the perfect location, perfect balance of elegance, character and charm. From the second we were greeted at the front door, we were treated to the most wonderful hospitality, nothing fawning or brash, just simple charm. 
Coupled with the perfect dinner in Ireland's only 2 Michelin star restaurant - Patrick Gilbauds, The Merrion's Michelin package was (here's that word again...) perfect. 
We WILL be coming back and WILL be recommending the hotel to everyone we meet. 
But again, a hotel is only as good as its staff and the staff here are exceptional. 
So sad that our annual stay has come to an end... I'm already counting down the time till we meet again Merrion. 
*****",5,2017,02,22
200,Luxury City Break,This hotel is not cheap but you get what you pay for. There was very little to fault it. The service was first class and the room / facilities were top. There was a bit of building work ongoing which may annoy some but didn't bother us. The only issue was a very expensive inaccurate breakfast in room order. Minor issue as was resolved quickly. The rest of catering and the pool were great.   Overall this is a top class hotel.,5,2017,02,21
200,"Fantastic hotel, a real treat.",Stayed one night in the Merrion as a birthday treat. It is beautiful. From the moment you step inside the staff can't do enough to help. The rooms are fabulous with everything you could want. The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Everything about the stay was amazing. I can't wait to stay again. I've stayed in a few 5* hotels and this was by far the best. There is some building work going on at the moment so I'm even more excited to stay when the new restaurant is open. ,5,2017,02,19
200,Perfection,"What else can I say that others haven't said already? This is a wonderful property. Our stay was perfect in every way. The hotel itself is beautiful - especially the lovely courtyard/gardens within the hotel. Our room was a complete sanctuary and much appreciated after our long haul flight. The staff here is amazing. Though the hotel had been full the night prior to our arrival, they were able to get us into our room, with no advanced notice, before 10 a.m. I am eternally grateful for that : ) They also stocked our car with water to drink when we departed and the doormen made sure we knew where we were headed and gave us some much appreciated travel advice on off the beaten path-type things to enjoy at our next destination. The location is great, by the way. It's on a fairly quiet street but just a short walk to St. Stephen's Green.",5,2017,02,19
200,Perfect in Every Regard,"This was our second time at the Merrion. We love Dublin and this hotel is an absolutely perfect indulgence when we can find time to go there. Fabulous service. Comfortable. Friendly. Quiet yet in the middle of the city. Delicious food. High quality linens, a luxurious shower and high quality amenities. 
We will be back soon.",5,2017,02,19
200,I wish there were 6 stars,"The Merrion would usually be out of my price range, but prices are very reasonable in January mid-week, so I sprung for it.  I was NOT disappointed.  This hotel is what fine travel is all about.  You are transported back in time  - in a good way.  You are walked to your room, your room is gorgeous, the staff knows your name, you are giving a calling card, and the bars, lounge, spa, and restaurants are world class.  I did not want to leave.  I mean that in all seriousness.

From the moment I walked in the door, I was treated like royalty.  My room was smallish with no view (hence the good price) and I could have lived out my days there.  I haven't stayed at a hotel with turn down service in a while and I relished it.  Housekeeping laid out slippers for me with a glass and a bottle of water.  No tacky plastic at this hotel!

Let's face it, nobody really gets into a hotel bathtub anymore.  I'm not really a germiphobe, but I have some standards about tubs with showers.  But the stand alone soaking tub in my room was too marvelous to pass up.  I hooked up my laptop and watched The Crown while taking a nice soak and sipping some champagne.  

This was a great hotel and it made my trip something I will not forget.",5,2017,02,19
200,Elegant and Classic Dublin,"Lots of history here and nothing but the highest quality in service and accommodations.  Great location.  Easily one of the finest places to stay in Dublin.  Terrific for hosting business groups.  Great for couples on a romantic getaway, too.",5,2017,02,18
200,Exceptional hotel in Ireland,"Every part of our experience in the Merrion Hotel is exceptional. The friendliness of all staff, the ready offer of help, the quality of service and food all make it a pleasure to stay in during our business and family visits to the hotel.   The location is perfect for our business and social needs with banking, restaurants, cafes and shops all a short walk away from the front door.",5,2017,02,18
200,Friendly and elegant,"We had a wonderful but brief stay at the Merrion.  Our plane got in very early and they went out of their way to accommodate us by getting us into a room ahead of schedule.  The staff was so very friendly.  Our room was large and beautiful.  The bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing (great water pressure).  Location was perfect - we could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go and was within a minute of the stop for the Airlink bus to and from the airport (although we were perhaps the only guests to take the bus - we scrimp on transportation so we can splurge on the hotel).  This was the perfect place to stay in Dublin and well worth the splurge.  HOnestly it was a great value.  Highly, highly recommend.",5,2017,02,17
200,Breakfast,"Typical hotel breakfast fare
Good selection, 
The sausages were top class , plenty of every thing, but total lack of customer awareness, as i waited over ten mins for a refresh of coffee and when it arrived, not a word to say sorry for delay, 
Food was acceptsble , customer service not

200,Dublin Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great service, very large rooms (especially for Ireland). We had a very early flight arrival and they gave us early check in at 6:30 am.  They normally do include free breakfast with the room and we were told on the phone that breakfast was included but then a short while later the front desk called and said we would not get free breakfast. Very good valet service.",4,2017,02,15
200,"Construction Work, but not Intrusive","My usual January trip to my favorite Dublin hotel.  Major works underway in the garden as they create a new restaurant and spa in a new building. I don't think there are plans for guest rooms in that wing. This was on-going my last stay but really very intensive now. There is definitely some noise that can be heard periodically (daytime only) , and the garden view isn't particularly nice right now, but I have never stayed at any hotel that handled the situation better than the Merrion is doing now.  Very little real inconvenience (if any) and the usual lovely service from a very polite, professional and friendly staff.",5,2017,02,15
200,Afternoon tea,My wife and I visited the Merrion Hotel yesterday 14/2/17. We had booked in for Afternoon tea. We were greeted with courtesy and shown to our table in one of the drawing rooms. The drawing rooms are very stylish and calm. The food was excellent and lots of exquisite teas to choose from. We were served by Rhianna (spelling might be wrong) who is an excellent waitress with great knowledge of the menu. She was never in your face but always on hand if you needed anything. All in all a lovely experience and well worth a visit for a special occasion. Afternnon tea costs 45euro and 57.50 with a glass of excellent champagne.,4,2017,02,15
200,Absolutly Fab,"We spent The weekend with friends, the Hotel is classic, great taste, room is  Faboluous, quiet, great bed, the staff are the reception incredible helpful, also at the pool, very professional and  friendly, location is the best, Historical aerea in Dublin, walking distance to great restaurants and coffees, the best Holidays relax and peace!",5,2017,02,15
200,Impeccable service and top experience,"This is a long overdue review and one that I hope will help those looking for the perfect hotel in Dublin. In October 2016, we took 41 people to the Dublin Theatre Festival. We booked 26 rooms for 8 days at the Merrion. After the rave comments from our folks, I can say that we had HANDS DOWN the most wonderful experience in any hotel our group has stayed with in any city.

Elegant and classic, but never pretentious, the Merrion finds the perfect balance with sincere, selfless service without ever being overly doating or patronizing.

The rooms including the garden wing were comfortable, invoked an understated elegance and become a quiet restful haven after sightseeing and events.  The food and bar service were prompt and delicious. We booked afternoon tea for over 44 people. There's simply no words to describe the whimsical, delectable experience of Art Tea at the Merrion.

The rare art collection at the hotel is breathtaking and worth an hour exploring and taking the self guided audio tour.  It is lovely to have museum pieces just outside ones door.

Thank you to all the staff and management at the Merrion for making all 41 of our guests feel truly at home, welcome and comforted while in Ireland. From the reception staff, to the maids, concierge and doormen, to the charming young waiters and servers for our breakfasts and our lively discussions after each play, all were a delight.   Special thank you to Conor for effortlessly responding to the challenges of such a large group (even a special drink request was taken care of each night).

We will return.  Until then.... very fond memories.",5,2017,02,14
200,"Fab, if twee","Brilliant hotel, with touches of class throughout. check-in can be annoying with the eastern European faux Dublin accent, complete with Ts ending in an S, running through the prepared script of how ones journey was. 

Wine list is all French - this is presumably to try and up-posh itself, since Yanks will think French is fancy. New World can also be exceptionally good, and The Merrion should get some in, sharpish. 

They will not serve hot food in the drawing room, which is more than annoying and excuses meted out are plain daft. 

But overall, a polished and classy offering.",5,2017,02,14
200,Attention to detail was flawless,My partner and I celebrated a Birthday here on a wintry Saturday in February. We spent our entire stay inside the hotel. Our room was large and cosy. The staff had arranged for some treats to be left for us on arrival which was a lovely surprise. The pool area is so relaxed that we went twice. We had dinner in the Cellar bar which was top class. There are many places around the hotel to lounge in comfort. The breakfast was immense and varied. This Hotel gets a well deserved 5 Star rating.,5,2017,02,14
200,Quite honestly the best hotel I've ever stayed in ,"From the minute the taxi dropped us at the door to the moment we got back in the taxi back to the airport or was absolutely superb. The service was second to none. The room was spotless, well equipped and comfortable. The bar serves wonderful cocktails. The spa and pool is great. Not much else I can say except wish I could afford to stay longer. ",5,2017,02,13
200,The Merrion Dublin,"We stayed recently and I found the Staff extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem. The breakfast the next morning was lovely and freshly cooked and again staff were fabulous. I  would recommend the Merrion to anyone.",5,2017,02,13
200,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is truly beautiful- open fire, regal furniture, intriguing art work. To add to the wonderful surroundings, you couldn't ask for more when it comes to the staff's hospitality. I would highly recommend this for business and leisure visitors. Thank you for a great stay!!!",5,2017,02,08
200,Understated elegance -- and friendly.  True class.,"My fourth stay here so I knew the hotel would be lovely, but we really tested them. Spent the holidays here with five cousins (!) and really ran the Merrion staff through their paces with our shifting plans, varied needs, room-switching, restaurant reservations, baggage-storing, and general zaniness.  They were unflappable, truly friendly, and incredibly accommodating. The rooms were spacious and pretty, the bathrooms enormous and fully equipped.  Love the Asprey products.  Restaurants are terrific, and the bar and lobby are quiet and gracious. Staying here makes you realize how awesome Dublin is, because it only a great city could get you to leave a hotel this nice and go out and about.",5,2017,02,06
200,Somewhat disappointed!,"The Merrion is in a great location and the old building is all you would expect from a hotel of its class. The public areas of the Garden Wing, however, leave a lot to be desired- clean, but soulless. The room was lovely, but breakfast was a great disappointment. A somewhat dreary basement room, pretty dreadful coffee, and a very uninspired breakfast. The staff were generally friendly and efficient. If I could give three and a half stars I would!",3,2017,02,06
200,Perfect,"We stayed in October 2016 so this review is a bit late. We received a wedding gift of a night in the Merrion, for the night before we went on honeymoon. Everything was perfect. We were upgraded to an amazing suite with champagne and mini desserts laid out for us, such a nice way to start our honeymoon. We ate in the cellar restaurant that night, food and service were lovely. The drawing room is such a nice spot for a few drinks by the fire. The pool is small but clean and relaxing. Every single member of staff we met were friendly, helpful and polite, the service is 5 star while managing to remain understated. Top class! ",5,2017,02,05
200,Full of Character,"Only spent 2 nights at the Merrion but room spacious and comfortable but with a limited view. The cellar bar was our favourite with great food, cocktails and atmosphere.  A good location with just a short, pleasant walk (about 20 mins) to Temple Bar area and shops. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2017,02,04
200,simply perfect,From the taxi stopping infront of the hotel until getting back into the taxi just let the professional staff of the Merrion worry about anything regarding your accomodation and at least that part of your stay in Dublin will be perfect.,5,2017,02,02
200,Our favorite hotel...ever!,"Returning to the Merrion is like opening a great bottle of wine you have been saving.  It's just a sweet, full-bodied and fabulous as you recalled.  The service is understated, warm & professional.  The world-class art collection that adorns the walls in the hotel adds to the beauty of the property.    The public space/drawing rooms are spectacular and if timed allowed I would spend my entire time there, relaxing and drinking tea by the wood and turf-burning fireplaces.  Completely cozy and inviting......",5,2017,02,02
200,Days of Awesomeness,"I stayed at the Merrion on Business with 4 other co workers a few weeks ago  We travel all over the world and this stay was one of the most relaxed and efficient experiences.  The location is in the center of world class restaurants, pubs, shopping, and local landmarks. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",5,2017,02,02
200,Elegance .... and Class..,Amazing Stay Again staff are the best in the buisness Patrick at the front door on top of his game the check in makes you feel like an old friend coming to stay in a close friends house the welcome very genuine ....,5,2017,02,02
200,Romantic night in city,Beautiful old building in heart of Dublin City....close to everything. Definitely 5 star.💜 got upgraded for or Wedding Anniversary with lovely baileys and chocolates in room. Very unexpected but very #polished 😊,5,2017,02,01
200,Fabulous,"The level of service in the Merrion hotel is a decided cut above the rest. Having previously stayed in The Shelbourne , VASTLY overrated and the former Four Seasons, very shabby and dated with indifferent service, it was such a pleasure to be in the Merrion. There are renovations going on at present but they did not interfere with our visit in any way. The art collection alone is worth the trip. Delicious freshly prepared breakfasts are served in the Cellar restaurant with plenty of choices. We sampled a few whiskies in No.23 where the barman was extremely knowledgeable and certainly added to our visit. I really cannot say enough about this hotel. It is elegant, discrete, very central and we cannot wait to return.",5,2017,02,01
200,Stylish stay in Dublin,"This is a stylish, classy hotel in the heart of Dublin - dinner in the cellar bar was good though the first table we were given was in it's own little area like a cell! We asked to move and next table was much better. Breakfast in the room was fantastic. Definitely the place to stay in Ireland's capital city.",5,2017,02,01
200,Great location traditional ambience,We recently spent a weekend at the Merrion Hotel. The older part of the building is really attractive with lovely high ceilings even in the bedrooms. We thought the new wing reached by a corridor at the rear of the property lost a lot of the charm of the older portion. Staff were very helpful. Breakfast was excellent though served in a cramped restaurant area which has a basement feel with low ceilings and close tables. The spa is very limited. Overall we felt it was overpriced.,3,2017,01,31
200,Irish Holiday ,"Spend several days at The Merrion Hotel which was one of the best experiences in my life. The hotel is located in the perfect area for tourists and the level of service was excellent. The rooms were very well appointed and the staff went out of the way to treat the guest with very professional service. The food was very well prepared and the staff were very professional in the restaurants, pub, High Tea and the bar. I will return in the future and make  this hotel my Dublin residency. This hotel is highly recommended for guest who expected the highest level of service. ",4,2017,01,31
200,Highly Recommend this 5 star hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion. The staff are lovely, rooms are spacious and clean, the spa and pool area is wonderful, beds very comfortable and food delicious. Worth paying the extra money for a wonderful service. The hotel is centrally located and a short walk from the shops and some lovely restaurant and bars. Highly recommend and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,01,31
200,Superb hotel,Everything about this hotel is first class! The staff is friendly and efficient! The breakfasts are wonderful. The room was spacious and impeccably clean. Room service was perfection! I would highly recommend this hotel!,5,2017,01,31
200,Great location and perfect service throughout,"This is a lovely hotel, elegant and not at all showy.  You can barely tell it's a hotel from its exterior. You're greeted by the doormen and then a well staffed reception area, there's no waiting. We were on an early flight so we first went to drop our luggage. 
When we returned later we were shown to our room and our luggage was waiting. We had ordered Champagne for the room upon arrival, that was there with glasses and some little cakes with Happy Birthday written in chocolate (it was my 40th).
The room was clean and light and well equipped. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower. The TV was excellent - satellite TV channels and free movies. WIFI was super fast, and free.
There was a pool and gym - we used the pool twice - this was very nice, dimly lit and relaxing.
We ate dinner one night in The Cellar restaurant and we also had the afternoon tea, which was during the week The Berkeley, London, were in residence serving their fashion inspired Pret A Portea. This was beautiful.  Attentive and informative service, music from a harpist and lots of mouth watering food!
The location was ideal for us - not far to walk to Temple Bar/Grafton Street etc - opposite Government Building which is next to the Natural History Museum, The Archaeology museum and the National gallery were a few minutes walk too. There's a bus stop right outside too to use the city buses and the open top tour buses.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I would have no hesitation in returning.",5,2017,01,31
200,Perfect Stay!,"We can't say enough positive things about this property. Our stay was flawless from check-in to check-out, and the staff, room quality/decor and dining options were impeccable. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever experienced and the rooms were elegant and beautifully appointed. The staff's attention to detail was first rate and we hope to return to Dublin, and to The Merrion, very soon!",5,2017,01,30
200,5* Breakfast ,"We had an amazing coffee break , an earl grey tea and scones in the Drawing Room, it's a great combination, what a lovely treat! 
Service was absolutely flawless ! 
 
The scones are small and pretty pricy but they taste really fresh . 

If you want to make a good impression on someone, this is the place to go !",5,2017,01,30
200,worthy of 5 stars,"this hotel in Dublin is a wonderful place to stay - centrally located, infrastructure excellent and the service is superb - it is a 5 star hotel worthy of its rating - restaurant in hotel is good; also many fine restaurants within 2-3 blocks of the hotel",5,2017,01,29
200,Another chill at The Merrion,"Wonderful hotel, staff are efficient and friendly,great atmosphere. We were upgraded to a junior suite which really added to our experience.
We ate in the Cellar restaurant which was lovely,it was so relaxing just to come downstairs to eat. Can't wait to return.",5,2017,01,29
200,"Stunning hotel, great service and perfect location.","My new favourite Dublin Hotel.  Beautiful well appointed bedrooms, charming decor,  staff are so curtious and helpful and location is central and yet so quiet.    Beautiful lounges and bar.  Loved our stay and can't wait to return.",5,2017,01,28
200,Merrion,As a regular guest everything except the Cellar Bar was the usual Merrion high standard Bar service was at very best disinterested at worst very poor. An unusual experience at the Merrion which is generally excellent,4,2017,01,28
200,Unbelievable staff,Celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary here and had a superb time. The staff couldn't have done enough for us. They were so helpful and friendly all the time   The reception rooms are lovely and cosy and the bar was lively in the evening. Our room was on the top floor and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had a suite with a tv,5,2017,01,28
200,Exceptional in all respects,"We visit Dublin every year in January for business and over 20+ years of doing so have stayed in all of its top rated hotels. The Merrion is in a class by itself. No detail is missed. If it's comfort and first class service you seek, The Merrion is were you want to be.",5,2017,01,27
200,Fantastic stay. Beautiful hotel. Exceptional service.,"My fiancé and I stayed for  2 nights. The service from all staff throughout our visit was exemplary! At check-in, we mentioned that we were celebrating a late Christmas (mid Jan), when we returned to our room, we found a delicious plate of cakes decorated with Christmas trees and a lovely message - a lovely and personal touch! The communal areas are very enticing; decorated and furnished to a very high standard and a lovely place to enjoy a cup of tea or a cheeky cocktail. Our room was perfect - the bed, duvet and pillows were clearly very high quality and conducive to an extremely comfortable nights sleep. The bathroom was enormous, and again, very clean and tastefully decorated with everything we needed. Without hesitation we will stay here again on our next trip to Dublin. ",5,2017,01,26
200,Mum & Daughter weekend,"My brothers and I organized to bring my Mum away for her 70th birthday and we had the most amazing experience. The hotel is immaculate in its presentation, the staff are engaging and helpful and the food is Michelin quality. Having decided we wanted eat in the hotel one of the staff phoned our restaurant to cancel on our behalf. every effort was made to make us feel welcome.",5,2017,01,26
200,Pimped up home from home,"We had a fantastic girls weekend to Dublin. The hotel facilitated interlinked rooms to enhance our experience. The staff were amazing, the bedrooms sublime and spa heavenly. I cannot recommend The Merrion highly enough.",5,2017,01,25
200,Excellent stay,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay, rooms and service were excellent.  Location is ideal for city centre and for Bord Gais Arena (10 min walk) where we were attending a show.  Would recommend for anyone.  A five star experience",5,2017,01,25
200,Night away,"This is a fabulous hotel, everything was truly superb (staff, room, food etc). The staff are the hotel's true asset along with the hotel itself. The hotel is so clean and comfortable. Nothing is a problem.",5,2017,01,25
200,Escape,"Gorgeous luxury hotel,staff are superb ,one small quibble breakfast in room bit below hotel standard, on previous stay breakfast in dining room poor,why? In such an otherwise magnificent hotel,surely it's possible to correctly fill a breakfast order?",5,2017,01,25
200,A truly 5 star experience,Beautiful hotel both in public areas and in the bedrooms.  Excellent staff who go the extra mile to make the experience memorable.  The restaurant is excellent with a great selection for breakfast and the evening meal was just great.  Lovely leisure facilities which will only get better when the renovations are complete.  Will definitely be back,5,2017,01,25
200,Excellence close to home,"Sometimes being a guest in your own city is exactly what you need. We travel all over the world and have stayed in many beautiful hotels but on this occasion we chose to have a luxury break closer to home. Dublin is a fantastic city on a bright winter's day and the comfort, warm welcome and excellent facilities at the Merrion hotel are hard to beat. We particularly enjoyed the spa, breakfast, dinner at the cellar restaurant and after dinner drinks in front of an open fire. The staff are first class with that perfect balance of professionalism and warmth.",5,2017,01,25
200,Very elegant and stylish hotel,"If you like to pamper yourself together with your best friends , this is the place to be for a city break. Stylish, elegant with a great reception area and bar. There are clasics fireplaces very welcoming, especially in a cold winter day. It feels peaceful and relaxing.",5,2017,01,24
200,"Fantastic hotel, Excellent Service, a birthday treat to remember","We booked a night at the Merrion Hotel for a weekend in Dublin for my partners birthday. We arrived in Dublin at 9am and check in was not until 3pm. 
I had emailed the hotel a week prior to our visit to ask would it be possible to pay for early check in but the reply from the hotel advised that the only way to achieve this with guarantee was to pay for the Friday night at full room rate, this was a little disheartening but the hotel offered to keep our luggage for us and invited us to use the spa facilities until our room was ready.
When we arrived to hand our luggage in at the hotel we were overwhelmed by the service from all staff, they had noted that we were staying for a birthday treat and had allocated us a room that was ready for early check in, they couldn't do enough for us. Our bag was taken to our room, and we were shown all the facilities.
The room was beautiful and oozed class, with high quality furnishings and carpet with a very neutral design. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in, the bars and restaurants were great and the room service menu was extensive. The mini bar was very well stocked.
My partner was left little cupcakes iced with 'happy birthday' in the room when we popped out, such a simple but appreciated touch. 
Our stay wasn't long enough to make the most of the hotel facilities which is a great excuse to return as soon as possible.
Amazing hotel, a must visit, simply stunning. ",5,2017,01,24
200,Fabulous stay,"I was fortunate to be able to stay once again at this beautiful hotel recently to celebrate my wedding anniversary.  We were greeting by the concierge & reception staff like old friends.  The suite we stayed in was immaculate throughout & housekeeping standards very high.  The evening meal in the cellar restaurant was excellent, as was the breakfast on both days.  The staff training at this hotel is of a very high standard & I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,23
200,"Great location, lots of history, excellent service.","Visited Dublin around the 2016 Christmas period. Had a wonderful stay at the Merrion Hotel. Well located. Within walking distance of parks, shops and places to see. A short walk to the hop-on/hop off bus stops. Excellent service and great accomodations. Try the Cellar Bar downstairs for a pint of Guinnes! Guaranted!",5,2017,01,21
200,Brilliant.,"The experience at The Merrion was exceptional from the moment we arrived. The ability of all staff members to do the right thing always was a joy to see. It was not cheap,but everyone should experience the Merrion.",5,2017,01,19
200,Oozing grandeur,"We were parents and two children staying in inter-connecting rooms on a family promotion for one night. Unfortunately we were staying during the recent renovation works and there were builders clanging and banging outside our window on scaffolding throughout the day. So I think it's impossible to write a fair review of a hotel that I imagine is very peaceful and beautiful on a 'normal day'. It is fair to say however that if you love opulent and lavish hotels then this is perfect for you. For me personally it's too ostentatious but then I just prefer more down to earth, quirky places.  My kids loved it and thought they were on a movie set, with mini bath robes and slippers at their disposal and a pool to themselves. There were fruit platters, juice and chocolates on arrival, and bottled mineral water that was replaced during a turn-down service. Breakfast is a white table cloth, waiter service affair - the food was great. Of course, location wise it's perfect for exploring Dublin on foot and the concierge and porters were so kind ad helpful in getting us to wherever we wanted to go. So in summary, I think the noise slightly spoilt our stay and prevented us from experiencing the real Merrion, which I am sure is oozing grandeur!",4,2017,01,18
200,"Classic, classy, beautiful and a lovely experience","We loved the Merrion. From the minute we arrived in the morning from the airport to when we left four days later our stay perfect. We travel frequently with Olivia aged 4, however not all hotels are as welcoming with young children. The room décor is classic, clean and comfortable, housekeeping were unintrusive, polite and attentive. The hotel has all the trimmings of excellent service without being overboard. Travelling long haul with our 4 year old isn't always easy and the staff were wonderful, especially in the pool/spa area where she played happily without us feeling she was a bother. Olivia was provided her own little white fluffy dressing gown which made her day. The concierge/doorman are knowledgeable on everything from local pub fair to nice breakfast spots and always have a smile. Reception are welcoming and accommodating from arrival (we were far too early and they accommodated us best they could after a very early morning flight). We had early drinks in the lobby area and high tea looked devine although we didn't try anything as it was too late, the waiting staff again were brilliant looking after us and Olivia after a very cold day sightseeing in Dublin. The open fires and two rooms in the lobby/bar area are welcoming with comfoy chair. By far one of the best hotels I've stayed in. If you're looking for classic décor, first class hospitality and great location in Dublin this is definitely worth a visit. We didn't have time to eat in the restaurant cellar but it looks lovely so next time we'll definitely make time when we stay again on the recommendation of the friendly locals.",5,2017,01,18
200,Hotel with high standard. !,"Very high standard hotel, historic building, very well placed in Centre near St. Stephens Green, good connection to airport (bus 757 takes 25 minutes), clean and very friendly staff, recommended for short stays in Dublin",4,2017,01,18
200,One of My Favorite Hotels,This hotel deserves high praise. Great location for walking and getting around. Breakfast here was excellent each morning. Even the children loved it. The bar is cozy and inviting with extended hours. We enjoyed the afternoon tea with the artist theme. I would have loved a tour of all the artwork in the hotel.,5,2017,01,17
200,"Luxury city centre hotel, but not a spa hotel!","Lovely hotel, with great staff, amazing central location but lacking in spa features.
Being heavily pregnant I was looking for a central hotel which offered great spa features, which this seemed to offer online though in reality it was a bit disappointing. 

The hotel itself is beautiful, great size rooms (we had ""garden view"" on ground floor which due to the construction work, isn't actually garden view, though we knew this on booking), very good amenities in terms of breakfast service, and the staff in the bars, reception and restaurant (breakfast) were outstanding.

Both myself and my husband had booked in for spa treatments, and used the pool.
The pool, though small, is completely sufficient size wise.
There is a small gym (we didn't use) that looks like it has the basics you'd expect for a quick workout.
The menu of spa treatments is quite good, but the facilities for them is disappointing in part. 
My husband was in a spa treatment room off the gym/spa reception area. He could hear the music playing outside the room, as well as conversations, alongside the different ""relaxing"" music within his treatment room. Though the noise from outside was muffled somewhat, it was clear enough to disturb the treatment. His treatment was also around 10 minutes less than it was meant to be.
When you're paying 5 star prices, you would expect better.
I was in a treatment room upstairs from the spa (ground floor) which was well appointed and the pregnancy massage offered was excellent. Staff really seemed competent and confident in how they facilitated my massage, and having had pregnancy massages elsewhere, would say the Merrion was the best I experienced. 
The relaxation area after the massage is a few loungers beside the reception area - so not your typical quiet darkened room - there's actually quite a lot of coming & going and no guarantee those loungers will actually be available. I was then left waiting for my sorbet, again having to ask after close to 10 minutes. 

Given the rest of the hotels features and standards, I would be hopeful that when the extension is completed more time and attention is put into the spa, or else the cost of the treatments is adjusted to be more reflective of the experience and spa amenities. ",5,2017,01,17
200,Cozy and friendly,"A quiet and clean nicely equipped room, chocolates at arrival, fresh water every day, all you expect from this type of upper class hotel. The employees make the difference: friendly, showing interest, helping out when needed. Certainly a place to return to.",5,2017,01,16
200,MiniMoon,"What a great hotel,old world charm and a warm welcome just love it. The room was bright,spacious and Luxurious, it was a shame to have to leave for dinner plans. We had room service for Breakfast which was a delight. Many thanks for a great break and the sweet treats",5,2017,01,15
200,As hotels should be,"Everything about the Merrion is done well, from the friendly and helpful doorman, to the check in staff, cleanliness and grandeur. A wonderful hotel, well worth its five star rating. Great location opposite parliament. One of the best indoor hotel pools we can remember,  and all this for actually a very reasonable rate. Whenever we are in Dublin we will now only stay here for sure. ",5,2017,01,15
200,A fantastic experience all round,"This is by far the best hotel we stay in. The overall experience is a complete treat and it is down to the luxurious facilities, atmosphere and particularly the staff.  Every one of them make you feel special. ",5,2017,01,15
200,This is tops,A trip to Dublin would be unsurpassed if it included a stay at the Merrion. We have stayed there twice now and each time was amazing. The service and friendly staff are wonderful. Decor is luxurious and new. (Some exterior project is taking place now (Jan '17) which we barely noticed but which I believe will make outdoor spaces and pass throughs even lovelier). We ate a few meals on premesis which were excellent. Drinks and/or tea in the drawing rooms was terrific. Rooms were sizable and beautiful and comfortable and utterly clean. Can't say enough good things about it!,5,2017,01,12
200,Great Spot in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed two nights and wished it were more. Hotel is well situated and easy to miss as it does not look like a traditional hotel from the outside.  Service is friendly and efficient. Breakfast and bar are both downstairs and are well decorated and offer wonderful food and drinks. The Cellar Bar is stunningly lit with gorgeous brick work. 

We did want to try afternoon tea one day but were told they were full. No special consideration for hotel guests. This was the one disappointment. 

Pool and spa were as nice as the rest of the property.",5,2017,01,12
200,What an amazing experience!,"Outstanding experience. Despite living in Dublin, My wife and I usually spend Dec 23 away from the children in a Dublin hotel. The atmosphere at this time of year is fantastic. Our experience in the Merrion was by far the best to date. We have already reserved our room for next year!",5,2017,01,09
200,Love this hotel,Truly 5 star .. comfortable .. wonderful service in every department ... one of my favourite hotels in the world .... amazing and food out of this world ... both at dinner on 2 nights and breakfast ... can't wait to go back,5,2017,01,08
200,Magical," The Merrion hotel is a unique property in a fabulous location. They pride themselves on service and attention to detail. We arrived in the early morning from the US, and they were only too happy to give us a early check-in which was wonderful. The rooms are world class. Love the location close enough to all of the wonders that Dublin has to offer, but also in a location which is serene and quiet. ",5,2017,01,07
200,"""Such  a treat""","Such a beautiful experience from the moment i was met at the front door. Gorgeous hotel, the food was exceptional the staff were so friendly and their uniform was very smart. Very near the theatre and Fire restaurant where we had bookings.Beautiful rooms and gardens, only downfall was the stay went too quick.",5,2017,01,06
200,The Best!,"I am very late in writing this review on The Merrion.  I can only say it is the best.  The hotel makes me want to return to Dublin.  It is the only Dublin hotel that I will stay in; it is the only hotel that I would recommend to friends and family.

My stay was refined and elegant; yet, I felt as comfortable as being in my own home.  All of my small requests were handled effortlessly.

I have to thank all of the staff that I interacted with -- the Reservationist, the Doormen, the Bellmen, the Concierge, the Kitchen Staff, the Turn Down Service, Housekeeping, the Front Desk, the IT staff who helped me with any tech/electrical issues.  Thank you to all of you.

My only regret was that I did not personally thank Mr. McCann, who is the General Manager.  I believe quality of this type starts at the top...and so, thank you, Mr. McCann.",5,2017,01,06
200,Great Honeymoon Stay,"My wife and I loved our stay at the Merrion (April 2016) during out Honeymoon.  Our room was beautiful and the staff was attentive, friendly, and very helpful.  Outside of the room itself and location, our favorite part of our stay was the Art Tea.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay while in Dublin.",5,2017,01,05
200,Cozy elegance,"I recently stayed here over New Year's on a solo trip. The hotel has a warm, boutique, artsy feel that I loved but with five star elegance and service.  It felt more like an aristocratic house than a *hotel* which is why I chose it. Every member of staff I encountered was consistently friendly and welcoming. Upon check in, I was escorted to my room which I always appreciate and come to expect with high-end places.

I had a queen room in the garden wing that was nicely appointed and spacious. The wing was being renovated but I heard no noises or experienced any disruption at all.

The location is great: it's near Merrion Square, across from the Natural History Museum, and a few yards away from a Hop On/Hop Off bus stop. St. Stephen's Green and bustling Grafton Street are a short walk away. There are also several reasonably priced and good quality cafes in the area. It's generally a quiet neighborhood even on New Year's Eve.

Don't miss the James Joyce sundial statue in the garden! Even some native Dubliners don't know about this gem. As the sun moves, Joyce's shadow falls on lines from Ulysses that are carved on the statue's base. So, you can see what the novel's protagonist was doing at particular times of the day. It's really clever and quite striking.

I highly recommend this hotel and I would happily stay here again.",5,2017,01,05
200,My wife's birthday,"Spent a night in the Merrion after Christmas with my wife to celebrate her birthday. 

Really enjoyed it, the staff and service are top class. It's discreet luxury and everything from room to hotel layout was faultless. Really liked Cellars bar for a drink and we also had afternoon tea which was very nice.

The location is as good as it gets in Dublin.

Will definitely return some time. ",5,2017,01,05
200,"Impeccable level of service and comfort, world class hotel","This hotel is bar none one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The service is underrepresented, the actual rooms are spectacular (the beds are incredibly comfortable) and we had never felt more comfortable and relaxed in a hotel before. Highly highly recommend for anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2017,01,05
200,Christmas Treat,My wife & I head into Dublin every Christmas to meet friends for a meal and we normally like to stay over and either shop or meet our children for lunch the next day. For the past number of years we have used the Merrion as our Christmas overnight hotel and we both agree that it is a part of Christmas the we really look forward to. In all the time we have been coming to the Merrion we can honestly say we have had no complaints whatsoever. From the moment we pull up in the car to the moment we leave we are treated like royalty and the staff are in my opinion the most professional and friendly in any hotel I have ever stayed in.,5,2017,01,05
200,Luxury Hotel - Great Location,Stayed here 5 days and enjoyed the each of the day. I was suprised when we arrived because it doesnt look like a hotel from outside at all but inside very farm familiy hotel atmostphare. Hotel is also famous for afternoon tee i suppose since the lounge near reception was full almost entire day. Rooms are good size and very clean. Comfortable beds. Hotel also have a SPA which is a must to try.Recommend it highly.,5,2017,01,05
200,Stunning,"I'll be honest with you: most of the time, having a member of staff wait on you hand and foot is a little excessive; it felt like he was hanging around every corner. However, the breakfast was one of the best we've ad at any hotel and everything about this place is immaculate. It feels like something out of Doctor Who. A little bit alien and unreal.",5,2017,01,04
200,"Elegant, beautiful hotel with some service issues","We stayed here for a couple of nights recently. This is a beautiful hotel - feels more like a boutique country house filled with art. Our stay started off on a good note - fast efficient reponses from Coim the concierge and other staff before our stay. When we got there, the concierge also organised afternoon tea for us at very short notice. It was wonderful - the drawing room is probably unparalleled in Dublin - comfy sofas, a harpist, delicious scones and sandwiches and we were sat by a painting of Moorea, where we spent our honeymoon. The service from the staff was exceptional as were their friendliness.

Later on that evening, we ordered room service. The club sandwich was good, although the bread was toasted a bit too much and service again was impeccable.

A quick word on location - if you are a younger couple you might want to stay somewhere a bit buzzier such as The Westbury. The Merrion is in a quiet spot, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. If you want to be in the centre of the action, this is not the place to stay. Also, if you want to raise the entertainment and 'place to be seen' factor, you might want to consider staying at The Shelbourne. When we visited, it appeared to have less of a formal stuffy atmosphere - Liam Neeson apparently recently stayed there and the horseshoe bar is pretty cool!

So, why a four star review and not five? Things started going wrong for us the next day at breakfast. We waited for what seemed like ages with no food. So much so that we left as we had a busy day of sightseeing. This level of service needs to be improved especially given that they are charging 29 Euros for a modest breakfast (word of advice - you can get something a quarter of the price at nearby Kilkenny's with much more generous portions). The table next to us had their breakfasts delivered but were waiting a long time for toast. When we explained to the hostess at the door, we were leaving, she asked us what table we were sitting at, despite her seating us. When we returned to our room, we got a call saying that the breakfast could be delivered. I explained that it was delivered too late - 'fifteen minutes only' was the explanation. Rather than offer an abrupt defensive explanation, a better response would have been to simply apologise for the lateness.

The shoddy service continued when we asked the concierge whether the Book of Kells exhibition was open. 'Yes'. We arrived at Trinity College and it was closed for New Year's Day. I would also add that the concierge also recommended dining at Fade Street Social - my internet researches showed this place had been recently served with a food safety notice and was temporarily shut (obviously news to the highly attuned Merrion staff).

In the evening we tried to get a drink at the hotel cocktail bar but all the tables were busy.

On our last day, we experienced the spa facilities - the manager had obviously noted my complaints and the service we experienced was exceptional and we very much enjoyed our stay. To her credit, she did apologise also for the poor level of services - but hey, a discount or freebie would have been better eh?

Unfortunately, the service issues re-appeared when a taxi was ordered for us. 'Can I use credit card?' 'Of course, sir!' Just before alighting at the airport the driver expressed surprise. 'Oh heck, they usually tell us before customer's use visa cards' A wait of five minutes ensued as the hapless driver took my details.

Would I stay at the Merrion again? Probably not. The Shelbourne or Westbury looked like better bets in terms of smoother and more reliable service and somewhere with atmosphere without pretension. However, still a four star review as it is a very good hotel.",4,2017,01,04
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"Ah I love the merrion,  feels like home every time I return. Beautifully appointed rooms,  great service.

I'd say ditch breakfast (the only not so lovely part of the hotel), go for an early morning swim in the lovely pool,  then order avocado and poached eggs on toast in your room afterwards. ",5,2017,01,04
200,Lovely hotel but service is horrendeous,This is a lovely five star hotel.  However the service in the bar does not live up to the five star prices. Having finished dinner we decided to visit the hotel bar for a drink.  We ordered cocktails (€20 each) and were very surprised that it took 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive given that the bar was practically empty.  Nonetheless the drinks were delicious.  We debated ordering more but couldn't wait that long again.  So we asked for the bill.  Paid the bill and then waited 25 minutes for our change.  Again the bar was not that busy.  Pretty poor service and very disappointed.  Not sure how'd they cope with a crowd.,3,2017,01,04
200,Just perfect !,Third time we have stayed here and just love it . First and foremost is the staff which I have not enough superbitives to describe. Secondly the decor and condition of the hotel is immaculate . Facilities including the tethra spa and treatments are brilliant. Restaurants and food excellent. Oh did I mention how good the staff are! Already looking to book flights across from Scotland for our next visit,5,2017,01,03
200,"Elegant, Understated....Perfect!","We stayed at the Merrion for 4 nights in October 2016 and loved it....for multiple reasons.

The staff is incredible...the decor is traditional, yet light and airy...the ""little things"" are exceptional--comfortable beds & chairs, plenty of hangers, adequate counter top space in the bathroom, the bar soap so good I took an extra bar home (yes, it's really that good!)...the location just right--turn right as you leave the front door & you are within easy walking distance of Trinity College, Temple Bar area, etc., turn left & you are close to St. Stephens Green, many great restaurants, historic pubs & even a very good coffee & pastry shop.

The clientele is virtually 100% American couples aged 55 to 75.  That's us to a T but may not appeal to everyone.  

We have been to Europe many times over the last 35 years.  The Merrion is the best ""big city"" hotel we have experienced.  We will only return to Dublin if we can get in there.

200,New Year's Eve Saved!,"Aer Lingus messed up our connection home to New York on New Year's Eve and we could not get home until the next day....  It was 3:30 in the afternoon, we were stranded in the Dublin airport.  We called the Merrion Hotel on the off chance they had two rooms for the four of us on New Year's Eve.  They went out of their way to make room for us ~ two (gorgeous) rooms and we jumped in a cab!  

Upon arrival, the concierge started working on a place for us to have New Year's Eve dinner.  She quickly arranged for us to have a late lunch in the bar at a lovely table as we were starving (waited on the Aer Lingus customer service line from 1:00pm to 3:30pm to rebook our flight).  The entire staff went out of their way for us!  They felt so bad that we were not home for NYE and made us feel incredibly at home at the Merrion.

The hotel is beautiful, situated in a gorgeous part of  Dublin.  We could not have been stranded in a better place!  Our rooms were gorgeous, the food delicious and the staff WONDERFUL.  Thank you Merrion for a lovely and unexpected 2016 New Year's Eve.",5,2017,01,02
200,Christmas Stay,"The Merrion did a wonderful job for our family of 5. Ciara the Christmas Coordinator, made our bookings, changes and stay welcoming and very smooth. Service throughout, from doormen, concierge, front desk, restaurants was superb. Friendly, low key and superbly professional made it a 6* experience. Nothing was too much trouble. Great rooms, food and atmosphere. Dublin's Number 1.",5,2017,01,01
200,Great hotel in the centre of Dublin ,We stayed in The Merrion Hotel for one night for our anniversary. The location is fantastic in such a good area of Dublin. The room was a really good size with a bath and a shower in the huge marble bathroom. The bed was very big and so comfortable. We arrived slightly earlier and even though our room wasn't ready yet we were allowed to check in to another room. The staff had prepared a welcome plate of cupcakes for our anniversary. I paid a trip to the spa which was small but had brilliant service. We ate dinner in the cellar restaurant which was amazing. Breakfast the next morning was also in the cellar restaurant and was great. Make sure to get down early on busy weekend mornings to avoid a wait though. We will be back again! ,4,2017,01,01
200,Amazing hotel in one of Dublin's prettiest areas,"We have stayed at the Merrion twice while visiting Dublin and will always choose it again when possible. We always feel very well taken care of while at the Merrion and the staff is attentive, professional and seems to have a way of making things happen almost before you realize you need something. On our most recent visit we stayed in the older area of the hotel and we very much enjoyed the larger room with a fireplace, sitting area and large beautiful windows overlooking the street. Staying at the Merrion allows us to enjoy the things we like best about Dublin with great proximity to shopping, restaurants, the park and more.",5,2016,12,31
200,Too many details wrong for it to be a 5-star hotel at this price,"Our overall experience was 'grand', but for the price, I didn't feel like we got good value and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.

The 'Superior' room we booked was lovely, but a long, long way from reception and that journey took us through freezing cold glass-walled corridors and other connecting spaces that felt like something temporary (with sloping and bouncy wooden floors) erected by a builder while awaiting construction to be completed. We noticed that there are not enough lifts and we had to wait, sometimes quite a while, every single time we came to and from our room.
 
Also, our room was distinctly chilly on arrival. The heating system was listed as A/C on the booking but was a crude fan hidden in the ceiling with a +/- temperature button and three settings - noisy, very noisy and unbearably noisy. We couldn't sleep with it on and it was too cold to sleep with it off.

We had a lovely marble bathroom, but the shower pressure was poor and the bathrobes were made for munchkins! (which we only discovered when we got out of our baths).

The wifi was not quick enough.

The staff were super-friendly and helpful and I don't wish to sound churlish, but with a few exceptions, they came across as insincere and gushing with phoney smiles and fake 'How was your Christmas?' inquiries. The Concierges and Doorman were the exception to this - old hands, great at the chat, genuinely interested. The other staff radiated that their interpersonal style was 'trained in' - none of it felt genuine and so it became intrusive. The predominantly young, fresh-faced staff are keen as mustard and lovely, but they're simply not good enough to work in a hotel of this standard and price. (By contrast, I used this hotel a few weeks ago when I was speaking at a business event and found the banqueting staff to be superb and detail-oriented.) 

Finally, to charge €35 per head for breakfast on top of a not-at-all-cheap city-centre hotel room price is frankly ridiculous and mealy-mouthed. Also, we had to wait to be seated for breakfast, because the hotel has outgrown the number of seats it has in its restaurant and that part of the building programme is not yet complete.

Too much reliance on name and location, not enough consideration of the total guest experience. I have stayed in the best hotels in the world throughout my business career and The Merrion is trying hard, but getting it wrong on way too many details.",3,2016,12,30
200,Too pricey for what we got,"Beautiful room and good attention to detail, with a nice greeting for our wedding anniversary (and cupcakes!), and the turndown service etc was good.  That being said, we weren't exactly blown away by the hotel. It has sprawled out to a much larger physical size since our last visit, so the walks to and from the room were long. There aren't enough elevators, and we had to wait every time to get one - to a degree that became irritating.  Our room was chilly when we arrived and the heater (a flush-mounted ceiling fan) was noisy, slow and inefficient. We couldn't sleep with it on, even at the low setting, and the room was cold without it. That is simply not good enough for a hotel in this price range. Also, our bathrobes were made for munchkins, which we only discovered when we were getting out of the bath, dripping wet and cold.  We had a long walk to and from our room and had to wait each time for the elevator, to a degree that became noticeable and irritating. More elevators needed in your much-bigger-than-before hotel please! Also, we found ourselves walking down cold glazed corridors and through what felt like temporary 'prefab' connecting lobbies to get to the wing we were staying in. Expansion is fine in any hotel, but dropping your standards of design and comfort to achieve that expansion is not.  The staff are very well-trained but their youth and inexperience made their greetings and interruptions feel gushing/unctuous, rather than warm and welcoming. Perhaps that's what tourists like or expect, but the only staff who felt 'genuine' in their chit-chat were the doormen and concierges. None of the other smiles quite reached the eyes and the whole experience felt rather perfunctory. They were, as I say, very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for any of them.   And finally, to charge €35 per head for a basic breakfast on top of a very pricey room is mealy-mouthed crap. Especially when you made us stand for 5-10 minutes waiting to be seated. This hotel has become much larger than it was in recent years (and I noticed a large building programme going on next door to expand it even further) but they haven't expanded the dining room - hence the wait.",3,2016,12,30
200,Wonderful short break,Terrific staff. Beautiful hotel. Convenient walking distance of central Dublin but quiet and comfortable. Rooms are lovely and a very good size. Our second visit and we will return. One of the best hotels in the world. ,5,2016,12,30
200,My Merrion stay,Wonderful hotel. Great staff. Welcoming and relaxed. Breakfast is a real treat. Beds are so comfortable. Attention to detail is outstanding. The swimming pool was great. The location is superb. Waking distance to all major tourist sites. National gallery is two minutes away for example. Enjoy.,5,2016,12,30
200,The Merrion Hotel,Fantastic hotel! The staff was top notch and so helpful. The room was so comfortable and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. Location is ideal as well. We did not have a chance to use the spa facilities unfortunately but we hope to be back!,5,2016,12,29
200,Home for Christmas,"I really don't like to stay in hotels for Christmas, I found it impersonal somehow. Anyway, I ended up staying at the Merrion and I was delighted. The arrival was excellent, they confirmed all my details for the 4 days and made me feel very welcome. The room was specious and they provide turn down service every night. I had dinner in the Cellar twice, the food and service was impeccable. Everyday I had a coffee front to the fire in the lounge and it really felt like a home as apposed to a clinical lounge that you often found. The staff even knew my name. I was really happy with my stay and can't wait to return. ",5,2016,12,29
200,Amazing Hotel,We recently stayed here just for one night and had an amazing stay. We checked in after lunchtime and all the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.  We enjoyed our stay so much we went back in on Christmas Eve to get a voucher for my parents in law. ,5,2016,12,28
200,Merrion is a top rated hotel,"Staff are professional and efficient. Rooms are clean, beautifully appointed and spacious.  Food is delicious. The SPA is amazing.  The indoor pool and steam room is a must di during your stay here.  Centrally located and unassuming from the street.  The hotel is quite expansive on the inside.  Tea in the sitting room off the lobby is lovely as is a walk in the in the gardens  courtyard in the center of the building.",5,2016,12,28
200,"Great location, even better service","The Merrion is nicely situated in downtown Dublin within walking distance from most everything. The hotel is charming, hospitable, incredibly friendly staff and features some fantastic cocktails in their parlour to boot. Try The Big Fella for a great twist on an old fashioned.",5,2016,12,28
200,Lovely interlude,"We enjoyed a fine breakfast in comfortable and relaxing surroundings. From the varied menu we opted for a full cooked dish and it was grand. 

The staff were pleasant and helpful. When leaving they offered a takeaway coffee which was a nice gesture.",5,2016,12,24
200,Christmas meal,Lovely food. Great service. Steak was nice but a little tough however and the peppercorn sauce was slightly overly creamy/milky. (Perhaps I'm overly critical). Would still recommend as the service was flawless. Pianist was also fantastic.,4,2016,12,24
200,Fantastic ,"Had the privilege of staying in one of the hotels finest rooms. The service was top class, from the valet to room service it was impeccable. The spa was not the most relaxing place I've ever been but it was grand. The cellar restaurant was lovely. For me, it was all about the staff and the service.",5,2016,12,23
200,They let us down with a restaurant booking...,"The most disappointing stay I've had in the Merrion.
The experience left us feeling very let down.
Having been told by the consierge that a restaurant was booked for us when we arrived there was no booking.
Emabasssing and very disappointing.",2,2016,12,21
200,Lovely festive afternoon tea,"My partner and I went to the Merrion today for the Festive afternoon tea whilst visiting Dublin. I have to say that the service was fantastic, they were very attentive and offered to take our coats for us and sat us in a lovely seat next to a roaring fire. The hotel was dressed for Christmas and was warming and welcoming. I liked the antiquity of the Georgian drawing rooms.

The tea itself comprises of a selection of sandwiches, a range of tea cakes and some special Christmas treats like a pistachio and raspberry Christmas tree, a white chocolate snowman macaroon & some mince pies. 

All was lovely although the slices of battenburg and fruit loaf were quite heavy for an afternoon tea. One minor niggle was that they stated there would be a mixture of mini plain and fruit scones whereas there was actually only one plain and 5 little fruit scones and my partner does not like fruit scones. However we asked for some plain and they kindly brought some more out were very good about it. One other very small issue was that although they stated that drinks were unlimited and you could try as many different types as you liked, the same did not apply to the food. Although it was plentiful, it is always nice to have the offer of replenished sandwiches etc and we have found this with other high end tea institutions like Claridges, Savoy and with the Chesterfield afternoon tea in London, they offer more throughout your tea. It's a minor niggle as I said and certainly did not spoil our experience, however at 45 euros each it is probably not something which should be begrudged. 

They do however offer you a range of drinks from their extensive tea menu, all of which were delicious. I tried the Irish Assam, ginger and lemon ice tea and also the hot chocolate. The choice is excellent and tea is served in lovely silver tea pots with fine bone China. 

All in all a wonderful pre Christmas experience with excellent service. I would recommend.",4,2016,12,19
200,"Almost two years later, same quality and service in all aspects","Proper old style 5 star hotel, great service, superb facilities. Was very happy to see that almost 2 years since my first visit, the standards have not changed a bit. Will surely come back. Not the cheapest option but you do get the quality.",5,2016,12,19
200,Excellent stay at a fabulous hotel,"My husband and I came to Dublin for a short relaxing pre- Christmas break. The hotel was fabulous and we spent a great deal of time in our room, in the bar and using the gym and pool. We easily could have spent the whole trip without even leaving the hotel. The staff were attentive and informative and welcoming at every opportunity. We can't wait to come back. ",5,2016,12,18
200,Amazing family break.,"Staff were fantastic.  Couldn't do enough to help. The little things and thought to detail really shone through. Amazing location in the heart of the city.  
Great place to get in to the Christmas spirit. Looking forward to next year already. ",5,2016,12,18
200,A bit disappointed ,"The hotel is supposed to be first rate. Very inconsistent. Construction going on and odors abound.
Service people good. Hike to small king room.
Would we do it again? No Nie shoshine good morning paper.9",3,2016,12,16
200,Christmas treat,I went to merrion for a treat with my little girl and 2 small nephews.  From start to finish it was a great stay.  The staff were amazing and friendly.  Nothing was a problem.  The attention to detail was brilliant and the little people loved it all.  They didn't want to leave.  This hotel offers real 5 star treatment.  It really is a great place and I look forward to returning.,5,2016,12,15
200,Excellent Staff,"Practically everything about this hotel is excellent. The Golden Nugget however is the staff. From the minute we drove up to the front door, everybody was so friendly. Our luggage was taken to our room and our car was parked while we were checking in.  A receptionist escorted us to our room which was tastily decorated. Beautiful artwork in the hotel. Dinner was first class.",5,2016,12,15
200,A Thanksgiving weekend in Dublin at the Merrion,"We are a family of five and stayed at the Merrion for getaway Thanksgiving holiday in Dublin. We had joining rooms -- our three daughters stayed in a room with two beds and a nice cot and we had a room with a king. Very nice rooms, well appointed and cozy. There is a great pool and steam room to relax in; great breakfasts, high tea and lounge area, and excellent location. The concierge arranged a private car tour of County Wicklow -- we had an amazing time, and provided us with great suggestions of restaurants and things to see. We can't wait to return!",5,2016,12,14
200,Love the Merrion,"Best hotel in Dublin. Great breakfast. The s TV ice for breakfast is very efficient and they will cook whatever you want. 

Nice pool. Helpful staff. Really festive around Christmas. I really like the beds too.                                     

The open fires are very welcoming. ",5,2016,12,13
200,Wonderful Stay,"Just one night stopover to do some Christmas shopping.  Loved this hotel from the moment I walked in the door.  Room was quiet, spacious, intelligently laid out.  Gorgeous marble bathroom.  Everything sparkling clean.  Warm and helpful staff from the porter on down to the cleaning staff.   Very convenient location -- very close to the hustle and bustle of Grafton street shopping area.   Minibar selections are delicious -- I had a a half bottle of the white bordeaux (the chairman of the hotel group owns the winery).  At $35, the wine wasn't cheap but the price was only a 35% mark up over retail, and was absolutely delicious.  No idea I would like white bordeaux so much.  A serendipitious discovery courtesy of the Merrion.   I'll definitely stay in the Merrion when next I am in Dublin.  Next time, I will bring my family so we can all enjoy the hotel's warm hospitality and convenient location.",5,2016,12,11
200,Afternoon tea,"Went to the Merrion for afternoon tea and it was not as good as I anticipated. 
The hotel itself and the ambience are magnificent. The staff were exactly what you would expect from a five star hotel. 
The only downfall was the actual eating of the tea. The savoury sandwiches were very run of the mill apart from the duck egg brioche. 
The sweet tray bakes were a little old fashioned and unimaginative. 
The sweet desserts were nearly too sweat. 
It was good but not great.
I have had other afternoon teas in other five star hotels in Dublin and their food is better however the Merrion wins on the ambience and atmosphere aspect which is why I am giving it 4 out of 5.
",4,2016,12,11
200,Excellent Upscale Hotel in a Good Location,"Although a large hotel, it is an upscale, modern and luxury hotel. The rooms are modern with all the necessary features, including towel warmers. The loony and bar area are lees modern with a more traditional look. the service was perfect throughout the hotel, including the restaurant. The breakfast is also very good - buffet and menu but is a bit pricey - Full Irish breakfast was €30. Short walk to St. Stephen's Green, shopping and restaurants.",5,2016,12,11
200,Faultless ,"What can I say.. an truly unforgettable experience.  Hotel is in a class of its own. Probably the nicest hotel I have ever had the pleasure to stay in.

200,Simply the finest,"It isn't hard to understand why this is the best hotel in Ireland and one of the finest in Europe, if not the world. I have been lucky to stay in properties around the world that exemplify luxury, service and excellence. I would put the Merrion in the class of the world's finest hotels. Early check-in after an overnight flight, delicious attentive breakfast that was served with perfection and a guest room that defined elegance, luxury and beauty. Like others who have stayed here, I was sorry to leave. They are over-staffed (a good thing), doting (a good thing) and above all they are sincere. If you can...stay at The Merrion. ",5,2016,12,08
200,Great Hotel with Superior Staff,"The Merrion is a great hotel with big rooms nicely appointed. Plenty of space in both the bedroom and bath. But the thing that really makes this hotel is the staff. The concierge Sean could not have been more helpful. The bar staff were very accommodating for our party of 6, regardless of which bar we were in! 
Great experience, we'll be back!",5,2016,12,08
200,Highest level of attention to details,"Great location, close to everything but quiet.  Lovely cellar restaurant, great traditional pub across the street, pool and gym are wonderfully welcoming.  Yeats and other masterpieces line the walls.  A delight to be in this city this time of the year.",5,2016,12,05
200,DISAPPOINTED-to leave!!!,My husband and I have just  checked out of the hotel. We stayed as a special treat to yourselves for Christmas. We did some shopping in town and then checked in. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well. Their prize asset is the staff. We met loads of them and they all have the same characteristic-they seem genuinely happy to work there and are so pleasant. The food was delicious. The attention to detail is outstanding. Housekeeping turned down the bed and spruced up the room again while we had dinner. we would definitely love to stay here again. Thanks Merrion hotel. Happy Christmas to all the staff.,5,2016,12,05
200,Pure Luxury in the heart of Dublin,We loved this hotel. It is the finest example of old world understated elegance and charm.  The doorman was our first touchpoint and he did not disappoint with his welcoming warm smile and greeting and her remembered our name every time with came and went - so charming.   The rooms are well appointed and the baths lavish.  The Purple Water products are so yummy we bought some to take home. The location could not be better and we walked to many of Dublins iconic pubs - wish I could have stayed longer and my husbands dream is to live in this hotel!,5,2016,12,04
200,Old world luxury,"I'm Irish, living abroad for many years, who normally on my home trip stay with family and not in hotels. Thanks to a Google event I got spoilt. So how do I rate it overall..
Service was amazing. I felt that no request was too big. 
Rooms were spacious, clean and very well kept. Turn down service was very welcome. 
Fires were a perfect added bonus for a trip to Dublin in winter. I'm only sorry I didn't have time to use the spa or eat in the evening, but overall it was a great experience. ",5,2016,12,04
200,Fabulous in every way!,"This was our first trip to Dublin. The Merrion was an excellent choice. We stayed five nights. Everything was great. The hotel was beautiful, staff were extremely helpful & friendly. We ate twice in the restaurants and had fantastic meals. Best hamburger ever! We were there when Bruce Springsteen played in Dublin & stayed at the Merrion. That was a blast (we didn't see him perform). We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,12,01
200,"True luxury with excellent location, excellent service","This was by far the nicest hotel we visited on our recent trip to Ireland from the US.  I am always amazed at how much better Europeans can do hospitality and this hotel was worth it.  

While they have an international staff, the service is top notch and anticipatory.  The people genuinely seemed happy and friendly to us on all accounts.  We felt very taken care of while there.

The room are also extremely nice, excellent bedding, quality bathrooms with a shower and tub and all the personal bespoke touches that make staying in a place like this extra nice and worth the bill.  

Room service was perfect, rooms were perfect (quiet even despite being near an elevator), all perfect.  I hope to stay there again.  The bill was clear and straightforward and I feel that all charges were fair (room service, minibar, etc.)

Of note, is does appear that they are expanding with a new wing.  I hope they are able to keep the same level of service and intimate feel that characterizes the current hotel.",5,2016,11,30

200,Understated Charm and refinement,"Quite simply our stay was a joy from start to finish, every member of staff from the concierge on arrival to the concierge on departure was warm polite and professional, each with their own personal touch. The room and facilities were second to none and it was a joy to stay in such refined surroundings. I only wish we had more time to experience the ambience that The Merrion Hotel brings.",5,2016,11,28

200,Comfortable and quite upscale hotel in the heart of the city,"Very professional, attentive, 5-star staff. Up to date facilities with just a touch of ""olde"".  Excellent restaurants on site.  Walking distance to several museums and other sites.  Multiple choices for tea, snacks, drinks or group conversations in the lounges and bars, and the garden when it reopens.  We were not able to try all four of the on-site dining options, but liked what we did sample.  Bathrooms are luxurious, although some rooms may be less spacious than others.  But the downstairs lounge, garden and bar provide options for gatherings, with peat fires and attentive staff ready to provide food and drink.",5,2016,11,27
200,Thanksgiving Weekend in Dublin,We had a wonderful stay at the historic Merrion in the original building. Through our LHW membership we were upgraded to the The Lord Monck Suite. This was one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in ever. The hotel is perfectly located and the staff is very nice and helpful. Only negative comments are the older heating system in the room made noise at night and the doors and walls are thin thus you can hear people in the halls. Old world charm. We would highly recommend this spot. ,5,2016,11,27
200,Best hotel in Dublin,I love staying at the Merrion. The hotel is easily the best in Dublin and the service is impeccable. Refurbishments are underway and it will be wonderful when they are finished.  I am always welcomed when I return and enjoyed a wonderful swim in the pool before a great dinner at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.,5,2016,11,26
200,Gift from our eldest son and his wife,Great experience -beautiful hotel. Situated in the heart of city close to the seat of Government and Stphens green for shopping. Great buzz around Dublin even on a Sunday night . Valet parking was an impressive feature. Works going on during our stay.,4,2016,11,24
200,Unmitigated luxury!,"We stayed at the Merrion for our wedding night & it was a truly unforgettable experience. We arrived late at night & were shown to our room by a lovely member of staff. We were given an upgrade to the Packenham Suite which is the most exquisite room I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. 
It is an enormous Georgian room with original plasterwork & two vast sash windows plus a huge bed with a canopy. To top it off there was also a bottle of Champagne on ice & plate of cupcakes for us!
We have stayed at the Merrion on a number of special occasions & every time it just gets better. It is the barometer against which we compare all other hotels. 
The big difference between the Merrion & other hotels are the members of staff. They are just so friendly & kind with no affectations. They really do make the difference between a good hotel & an outstanding hotel & overall experience. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2016,11,24
200,So Worth it!,Comfortable and cosy with lovely quiet rooms. No banging doors at 2am! Fantastic staff with great attention to detail. Proper spa with lovely pool and gym. Great location on Merrion Street beside government buildings with the main shopping area and some of the finest restaurants steps away. A refuge from the real world outside. ,5,2016,11,23
200,YOUR RESIDENCE IN DUBLIN,"Extraordinarily High Standards of service and facilities maintained over many years. Inventive, relaxing ,interesting common spaces in gardens,art work displays and the Spa. Excels equally as a family, tourist, spa, gastronomes' or business hotel. These high service levels are maintained even when hotel is full to bursting  and there is a  big event in the City.",5,2016,11,23
200,Understated luxury,"Great location, great facilities.  Staff was ever-present but never intrusive.  Room was very well appointed and comfortable. Concierge was helpful. Breakfast in restaurant was very good as well.  Excellent spot to use as a base while visiting Dublin.",5,2016,11,23
200,Elegant and luxurious,"This was our first visit to The Merrion, and we can't wait to go back! Our room was totally 5-star, and extremely comfortable with excellent amenities. We loved the Georgian drawing rooms and hotel bar (fabulous cocktails). Service is second-to-none. The Merrion is undeniably a cut above. It was the perfect finale to a great visit to Ireland.",5,2016,11,21
200,"unparalleled, understated luxury","We stayed as a family of 5 in March 2016 for the Rugby and to see a concert in the Olympia and this will remain one of the best city breaks I've had. From the minute you pull up, the valet parking and and the understated exterior help to set the standard for the rest of the stay. The reception area is stunning and great for people watching. the cellar bar is so quaint and and classy. Our adjoining rooms looked on to the courtyard and the decor is so beautiful and the bathrooms are great. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings and were so satisfied with the massive selection on offer. All in all there is nothing I could fault.",5,2016,11,21
200,"Good, but could be better ","I like the Merrion, it is a lovely Dublin hotel with a great location, friendly staff and well appointed rooms. At the moment they are in the middle of a large building programme but the disruption is less than minimal - I hope however that the expansion does not lose any of the character. 

Like many things in Dublin now it isn't cheap and I think for the money you are paying they should tighten up in areas. Breakfast always seems a bit shambolic, I'm not sure they have ever got my order completely right and while there are a lot of staff they all seem to multitask. This results in jobs being half done. It is not unusual for instance to find uncleared tables left for far too long. 

The hotel does get busy with people coming for afternoon tea and the like, which is fine but they don't have guest only seating anywhere so you can find yourself unable to go to the bar or lounge in your own hotel. 

On my last trip I went to the cellar bar and the food was generally poor. Instead of apologising the chef made excuses for instance when I said the melon wasn't ripe it was reported back to me it was that time of year! Either get ripe melon or don't serve it, don't blame the season. I don't think this is typical of the food however. 

Overall the positives easily outweigh the negatives (I just think these are eminently addressable and should be sorted) It is a lovely hotel and well worth a stay. ",4,2016,11,21
200,Wonderful Merrion Experience,"Had a brief one night experience at the Merrion Hotel - last night in Dublin before departure.  Great location - walking distance to shops, pubs, restaurants and gardens.  Wonderful wine cellar located on property - worth grabbing a drink and meal at the bar!  Clean, comfortable, quiet spacious rooms with all required amenities and modern/elegant feel and attention to details (within bathroom and closets).  Professional, friendly and very attentive & helpful staff.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this property to others.  And we will stay here again!...Elfie",5,2016,11,21
200,very special hotel,I stayed at the Merrion Hotel last week and had a very enjoyable time.   From the moment of our arrival to our departure the service was excellent.   This is a very special hotel and I could not recommend it more as you will not be disappointed.  The Hotel has all the old world charm which is  magical and pure escapism.,5,2016,11,21
200,Classic luxury hotel that retains a feeling of yesteryear,"The Merrion is a beautiful old hotel, which has been modernised without losing any of it's charm. The public rooms are great, and look like a greta place to have afternoon tea. 

My room overlooked the courtyard, so it was quiet. I slept very well in the large comfy bed.

Breakfast was very good.

Service is of a high standard. Upon checkout I was taken to my room. How unusual as usually at other hotels, being shown the direction of the lift is about the best you can hope for.

Good location for St Stephen's Green and other landmarks.",4,2016,11,21
200,City center style,"On par with my favorite, The Lowell in Manhattan, this hotel is superb. My favorite attraction is the hotels art collection. The in-room service is exacting and in the dining areas, friendly and knowledgeable. Oh, and the Irish smiles on check in are supreme.",5,2016,11,20
200,Stylish hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed on a visit to Dublin to see family and friends and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The cellar bar was a perfect destination on our first evening after travelling over, with each drink served with care and by people who always had a smile on their face. We also ate in the restaurant and enjoyed both the food and the service. The room itself was immaculately presented with all the facilities one would expect, although the bath robes and towels are a bit rough. The only notable downside was the noise from the works they are having completed in the garden area - there were drills and hammering from around 8.30am on the Saturday morning which we felt was a bit early. But all round, a fabulous hotel and one we'll visit again someday I'm sure. ",4,2016,11,20
200,Nice hotel but not on the list to revisit,The best part of this hotel is it's location and very friendly staff. On arrival we were shown to our room through a very cold glass hallway that reminded me of an airport terminal building. The room was nicely furnished with gorgeous bed linen but was one of the smallest hotel rooms that I have stayed in. We had a two night stay and breakfast both mornings was very disappointing. I was given the breakfast menu which had only 3 options on it the first morning. The table beside me got a different more extensive menu which really annoyed me. When queried I was told breakfast was included in my package 310 Euro per night!!!!How I would have appreciated the option of an omelette !!! Not too unrealistic considering the cost. Also we had to eat our dinner in the room on the second night as they could not facilitate a hot meal anywhere else. We also ate lunch in the bar which was a very bland experience. Due to revisit in 2 weeks but will be staying in a hotel that reflects the customers requests.,3,2016,11,20
200,Not enough time,"We had such a short stay at the Merrion but it was an absolutely lovely one! The location of the hotel can't be beat, we had the most comfortable beds of our whole stay in Ireland, and the staff was incredibly helpful and warm. We only had one night at the Merrion but we're already looking forward to our return!",5,2016,11,19
200,Stylish,"I might be biased (the young lady at the check-in counter upgraded me to a junior suite), but I am not. During the 8 years I spent in Dublin, the Merrion has always been the favorite address for breakfast, lunch, dinner and one of the places I suggested to people coming to town. Great location (very central, facing the building where the prime minister works) is also a national landmark: the 1st Duke of Wellington (who went down in history for, among other things, having beaten Napoleon at Waterloo) was born in that building. Moving around may look a little complicated. It is, after all, a very old building and the hotel layout is not as rational as a modern days' building would be. And yet, that too has its advantages: an obvious show of what patrician dwellings looked like 200-300 years ago. ",4,2016,11,18
200,Very Nice Hotel,We traveled to see a band play in Dublin and stayed at The Merrion (turns out some band members were staying there as well).  The hotel was nice and when there was a noise issue with the property next door (the building next to our room was doing construction/renovation) the hotel did their best to have them keep noisy activities to a minimum until a decent waking hour.,5,2016,11,16
200,One of the best hotels I've ever set foot in,"This place was lovely and welcoming.  Luxury around every corner, but not snooty (no one batted an eye at our jeans and t-shirts).  When we had to leave early in the morning for the airport, the hotel packed us a gourmet breakfast to-go.  The pool and restaurants were perfect, and the location can't be beat.  The only difficulty was pulling the car up to the valet in busy traffic.  But you're in Dublin, so that's sure to be a challenge anywhere.",5,2016,11,16
200,It was very pleasant but I wasn't 5 star blown away,"Stayed for 1 night. Arrived early mid week and received a nice greeting. The room wasn't available at this point (10am'ish) but they state it won't be ready until 3 which was fine. Left hotel having dropped luggage to go site seeing - received a call from hotel about 30 mins after leaving saying room ready for us which was nice to know. When we got back from site seeing and were walked to room by staff there were flowers and balloons set up that I had pre ordered and the hotel had added some free muffin type cakes and chocolates too - nice touch - and good that it was all set up. The room a standard queen was pleasant and clean - the toilet large clean but felt a bit tired, shower not 5 star at all - very poor pressure. When we were having a rest in the afternoon a member of staff knocked and proceeded to walk straight in to our room - no gap between knocking and entering - thankfully we were only resting on the bed!! I had to mention this to reception as not acceptable to knock and walk straight in. There was a lot of door banging in the corridor - we were on the 2nd floor. I think, and I could be wrong, there were rooms staff were using quite frequently either side of the corridor. This wasn't an issue at night but late afternoon / early morning it was very frequent and loud. We are lunch in one of the hotel bars, nothing special at all but 5 star prices. We had breakfast in the room - very very expensive and again nothing special at all and not much of it either like a bottle of water as an extra etc. It also appeared like construction work was underway as some of the corridors you walk through felt bit rough and ready for 5 star. It wasn't a bad experience but being a 5 star - could do better.",4,2016,11,16
200,Amazing Staff and Service,"Highly recommend this hotel if it's best in class service that you are looking for.  The staff really do go the extra mile and they seem to genuinely want to help you enjoy your experience, unlike many hotels where they seem to be working to a script.  I recommend the cellar for an evening meal - the food is excellent and value for money + the ambience is quite unique.    I found some of the other public areas a little pretentious.  Some people like this - I don't particularly.  I do think that some people visit the hotel for afternoon tea, evening drinks etc. so that they can dress up and act pretentious - each to their own.  We paid extra for a superior garden room - however, it wasn't a garden that we saw when we looked out of our window, it was construction work and builders.  Unfortunately we weren't advised of this in advance and it wasn't reflected in the room rate either.  So, any benefit of having a garden room was diminished by the view and the noise.    That said, the staff moved us to another room so that we only had a ""side view"" of the works.  It's unavoidable when a hotel is expanding  investing in it's development, and to be fair, I think they really tried to keep the noise level to a minimum, but had I known, I would have chosen to stay somewhere else on this occasion.  The room itself was very comfortable, but an average size for the price paid.  You can get much bigger rooms for less money, even in London...  Would I come back?  Maybe - I just didn't think it was an authentic experience.  Very few Irish staff, but that's typical of a lot of City hotels to be fair... but, not much Irishness in food choices in the menus either.  Most inbound guests will be looking for an authentic experience, but as I said to my husband when we were sitting in the bar, "" we could be in Milan, Paris, Berlin...""    Unfortunately, Europe seems to be becoming homogenized, particularly in city hotels.",4,2016,11,16
200,Definitely 5*,"The Merrion is most definitely 5* - we were lucky enough to spend a night there recently & our experience was without doubt faultless.  The rooms are fab, the service is top class.  The staff are extremely professional, well trained & friendly.  The food is delicious & the ambiance in the whole hotel is one of calmness & relaxation - everything you would want from a hotel of this standard.  Thanks to everyone in the Merrion for looking after us so well.",5,2016,11,16
200,One night stay,"This is a top class 5star hotel. At street level you are met by porters with courtesy and Irish welcome. That sets the tone for your visit because that attitude permeates the Merrion staff through to the manager. Rooms are excellent as are the common areas which have been upgraded to a new high standard. Unfortunately work is on going but in a discrete way.
Patrick Gilbaud restaurant is one of the very best Michelin star 2 restaurants in Ireland and is just reopening after a 6 month upgrade and is attached to the hotel. Expensive but if you want the best this is it.",5,2016,11,15
200,Incredible Hotel,"What an incredible hotel! The service is top notch and they go above and beyond for every guest. The hotel has expanded recently, but they have done a great job still treating guests like individuals. Location is great. The rooms are incredible with beautiful bathrooms. Definitely top notch.",5,2016,11,12
200,Top notch service,"From the moment we checked in till the moment we left we were treated like VIP guests. This is the first time ever when the very sweet check in person took us all the way to our room. The hotel was undergoing a little bit of construction so if you are getting there on weekday expect a little bit of noise during the day. The bed was so comfy. The bathroom is beautiful and spacious with both the shower and the bathtub. The wi-fi works great. There is tea and coffee in the room. The turn down service gives you a bottle of water. We also did the tea time and would highly recommend it (although we would trade some pastry for sandwiches). The tea room is super cute and cozy with the fireplace and that old living room feel. We valet-parked our car and it was extra $25 a day. We were a bit underwhelmed with the spa amenities but there is a very nice (deep as in ""you can't walk on the bottom"" deep) pool and the gym has a lot of weights (and kettlebells!). I think it was a terrific value for the money. We'll be back (side notes - there is a cute coffee shop right on the corner next the hotel. The brasserie next to the hotel was spectacular for our jetlagged selves. There is a cool pub right around the corner and Etto is also on that same block! Amazing location)",5,2016,11,12
200,Comfortable Stay,I love this hotel and have stayed here several times.  the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Unfortunately this time my room was not ready until later than expected which made me late for an appointment.,4,2016,11,11
200,"Luxury, old style ,expensive","Very luxury with a lot of employees who would do everything (too much?) for you, even knock on your door to serve you icecubes as roomservice. The swimmingpool was exellent. Nice location with pubs, restaurants, park and stop of airportbus nearby..",4,2016,11,11
200,The Real Dublin Charme,"The hotel's position is perfect, in the centre but very quiet and has a very elegant and warm atmosfere. The rooms are very comfortable.The staff is always present to satisfy any needs of their guests. The breakfast room is not very practical but they are now moving it upstairs.",5,2016,11,10
200,BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN?,"If this isn't the best hotel in Dublin there must be a well kept secret.Everything smacks of quality, the staff; the rooms; the restaurants, bar and lounge. On top of all that is a very good location near the centre of the city.Every staff member I met (reception,concierge,valet parking,lounge,bar, restaurants,spa) was charming, service oriented and knowledgable.I have stayed in may of the great hotels of the world and I'm not particularly easy to please but I can't think of anything there which needs improvement.",5,2016,11,08
200,No 23 - a place to relax,"Went to No 23 at The Merrion with my sister and her husband on Friday 4th November for a pre dinner drink (we were on our way to Hugo's, just around the corner).  No 23 is my type of place - leather chairs, warm decoration and first class service.  The champagne cocktail we had was excellent - sorry can't recall the name.  At £20 a glass probably a little expensive if you are planning to have  a few but for one pre drink it was perfect and well worth the cost.  The olives and nut selection, included free, were a good addition.  Would highly recommend No 23.",4,2016,11,07
200,Charming Beautiful Hotel,The Merrion is filled with polite professional staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. The pool spa and workout facilities were exceptional. The rooms are lovely and comfortable as well. Dublin is a good walkable city and the location of The Merrion is terrific.,5,2016,11,06
200,lovely 2 night stay,"We have just returned from a weekend in the Merrion. Was a lovely treat. The hotel is currently extending so we were a little apprehensive about this but it didn't impact on our stay in the slightest. We stayed in a queen room in the garden wing. The room was very well laid out, with a nespresso machine, separate shower and bath, large tv with lots of channels. Everything in the room was to a very high standard. 

Pros: 
1. Beautiful old building, decor very nice
2. Rooms are very quiet
3. Very comfortable bed and bedding
4. Lovely bath products
5. Staff very attentive and helpful
6. Good food in the cellar bar, great service
7. The location is excellent, couldn't get any better

Cons
1. Although the rooms have air con you can't specifically adjust the temperature to a certain degree, if you like to sleep in a very cold room this could be an issue. 
2. The pool is very nice, large and warm with a steam room. But there is no sauna or jacuzzi. 

Overall a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.",4,2016,11,06
200,Highly recommended,We stayed here for the Dublin Marathon weekend and were very impressed. Our room in the Garden Wing was spotlessly clean as were the swimming pool and steam room. Staff very friendly and efficient. The hotel in general is very well presented and maintained. Nice touches for the Marathon weekend - Marathon menu in the Cellar Bar restaurant and Spa recovery drinks and snacks available after the race. I left my Garmin charger in the room which was immediately posted back free of charge after I phoned to enquire - great customer service. We have stayed in some really nice hotels around the world and would definitely recommend the Merrion.,5,2016,11,06
200,Some things wonderful; some things not so great...,"This hotel, funnily, is NOT an easy hotel to review.  Some things about it were absolutely lovely, other aspects rather destroyed the ""luxury"" experience one would wish to have had:

On the PLUS side of the equation:  The LOCATION is terriffic: in the centre of  and walking distance from just about everything the visitor to Dublin would wish to see--Trinity College, Book of Kells, etc, etc. etc.   ""AMENITIES"":  super!  There was an IRON AND AN IRONING BOARD!!!!  How GREAT is THAT!! (so I could re-stow the stupid Travel iron I always have to cart along in my hand luggage!)  NESPRESSO machine! (AND they kept the pod supply, etc. fully re-stocked!)  ASPREY'S soaps, shampoo, bath gel--amply re-stocked  twice a day to the point of almost absurdity (I am NOT complaining!  I took HOME a two-year supply of  boxes of Asprey's soap!) Bottled mineral water generously re-stocked at all times....etc., etc.   STAFF: certainly efficient and helpful: for instance, when we checked in to our (ground floor room) and discovered that there were other rooms with BALCONIES--I am a smoker and always need somewhere to escape to--they instantly switched our room to an upstairs one with a balcony!   LUGGAGE service: brought TO (both!) our rooms when we checked in, COLLECTED when we checked out....  The Hotel DOORMEN were friendly, chatty and a delight!  Waiters we encountered in the Bar and at Breakfast were efficient and pleasant (especially the lovely Luis!).  BREAKFAST buffet was ample, bread crusty and fresh and delicious, and the cooked breakfast, although a bit on the dry, tasteless side, was GENEROUS to the extreme! (if you order kippers, you get enough for a month on one plate!)   BATHROOM: GIGANTIC!  Great ""shelf space"", hot water, etc., etc. etc.

However, on the MINUS side:  ROOM: ours was a ""Superior"" in the Garden Wing.  There were lots of small niggling things that one found quite annoying:  It was on the smallish side, lighting was ""low"" (too ""low"", in fact! ) While a full-length mirror was provided, it was in a corner and  BEHIND a ""comfy chair"" and thus useless.  (They SHOULD have put it inside the wardrobe door so that one could have USED IT!)  MINI-BAR:  Why DO hotels bother with these stupid things? Prices of the stock were SO RIDICULOUS that ONLY someone on an Expense Account (who couldn't care less WHAT anything costs) or a MORON (who doesn't know what a 1000% mark-up on a miniscule packet of crisps IS!) would use this ""service"".  BAR:  Wine choices (at ""reasonable"" prices) very LIMITED!   CELLAR BAR:  ""low lit"" and TOMBLIKE!  Seriously dreadful  and off-putting ambience--scary, even! (I have been in archaeological excavations and catacombs  with more lifelike ""ambiente""!)  RESTAURANT:  the room where Breakfast is served is similarly too ""low lit"" and one was exceedingly HAPPY TO ESCAPE out into the fresh air and LIGHT of the day outside!!!!  DRAWING ROOM:  While there certainly is an ATTEMPT at "" Georgian elegance"" in these rooms, they miss the mark by 100%!  They are NOT ""elegantly comfy/cosy"", but cold and ""ersatz"". (being in them felt almost like a plastic pastiche of what a REAL Georgian Drawing Room would feel like to be in! They are NOT ""relaxing"", but stiff and with the pseudo-formality of the strange staff ""pushing"" orders that borders on the Monty Pythonesque).

So, all in all, a mixed-bag here!",4,2016,11,05
200,Great location,"Perfect hotel within walking distance of almost everything.  Great staff, comfortable beds and great pillows. Large bathrooms with excellent amenities and robes. We always try to stay here when in Dublin.",5,2016,11,04
200,Anniversary stay,"This hotel is quite simply the epitome of unpretentious luxury. It is extremely well positioned to give access to everywhere you would want to go in Dublin. Although the hotel was undergoing some redevelopment, that did not spoil our trip. A hotel to revisit",5,2016,11,04
200,good quality service,"after arriving late at night, we were agreeably surpised to be received with a huge smile and to be given good advice about restaurants and bars near by.
the facilities are top level, definitively recommanded.",4,2016,11,03
200,"Excellent Service, central and convenient location and Stylish","Was a bit surprise to see a Hotel that looks like an Apartment building from the outside but within, Hotel is very stylish.  Check-in was prompt, room is spacious, clean and the bed are super comfortable. Service was excellent during my stay, upon arrival doorman takes your luggage and brings it to your room in a timely fashion . Hotel is central and convenient to many attraction sites, majority of it are within 20 minutes walk. For some taking a Taxi or Uber to many attraction sites from the hotel is around 8 - 12 Euro depending on traffic. Hotel have many variety of food to order for room service 24/7. Depend on your room, you might have a view of the Government building in front of the Hotel.",5,2016,11,02
200,Surprise night away,My son organised a night in this beautiful hotel in Dublin as a birthday present ...From the minute we arrived till we checked out I was blown away by the service that we received.From check in we were accompanied by staff to our room which overlooked the gardens...The room was spacious and very comfortable with a lovely small balcony overlooking the gardens...My son had booked us in for dinner in the restaurant which was a delightful experience and the staff were so intentive and friendly...Next my full body massage which was the next morning in their wonderful spa .my therapist was a delight and felt @ home straight away ...Breakfast was served in my room following my trip to the spa and the staff even allowed us to check out an hour later than usual...Overall this hotel oozes charm old style and I cannot find any thing negative to say ..Every member of staff were very helpful polite and engaged well with us from the porters to the cleaning staff.It's was truely a wonderful experience and would love to visit again in the future ...,5,2016,11,02
200,Art Afternoon Tea at The Merrion,"An unforgettable experience. As an ""Afternoon Tea"" addicted, everytime I am in the UK or Ireland I indulge and reserve an afternoon tea. Without any doubt this has been among the best three I have ever had: sitting in a splendid room, in front of a warm and cracking fire, assisted by a very gentle lady, savouring tasty sandwiches, mouthwashing scones and pastry, sipping a perfect tea, all served in generous portions. Just wonderful !",5,2016,11,02
200,Amazing!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for one night. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and the location is perfect, right in the heart of the centre. The rooms are big and spacious with a very comfortable bed! We used the leisure facilities which were lovely and relaxing. I had a massage which was probably one of the nicest massage's I have ever had! 

The service is brilliant, very attentive and efficient staff, nothing was a problem. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,11,01
200,"A beautiful stay, classy!","As a participant in the marathon, we wanted a central luxury base and to be honest this hotel couldn't be better placed, as entry into the start lines is 200 metres away!

The service is top class and the concierge was excellent in getting us reservations in restaurants despite the masses attending the marathon.

My partner and her sister took advantage of the spa and I was told that it was one of the best hot stone treatments she has ever had, this was high praise, as she's had a few.

We had room service breakfast which was excellent, as were the cocktails in the bar.

The room was superb, great bed, lovely big bathroom and well stocked mini bar.

Overall an amazing stay, we will be back.",5,2016,10,31
200,Would stay again in a heartbeat,"Just back from a two night stay in The Merrion Hotel Dublin. Amazeballs! Is anybody there ever in a bad mood. From start to finish nothing is a hassle.

Its superb rooms, public spaces, restaurant and location would be enough to make any business traveler very happy. What puts it into the ranks of the world's best hotels for business travelers is the absolutely world class service that its staff provides. To a person, every member of the staff with whom I have had contact has provided a level of warm, friendly and excellent service that is second to none. I highly recommend a stay here when in Dublin.",5,2016,10,30
200,Georgian chaem,"We loved our 2-night stay here. From the doorman Tommy to the bell hop who introduced us to our room, all staff were exceptionally competent and friendly. The bar tender in the Cellar Bar was very professional but had time for conversation. Try the baked cheese & toasts to go with your Guinness! Breakfast was lovely and formal. Site has some construction at present, but it was no bother. Pretty garden area view out our 3rd floor window. Hope to return!  ",5,2016,10,30
200,Quick stop in Dublin!,"We recently stayed at the Merrion Hotel for three nights during a short leg of a two week trip.

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming, and although our room was not ready upon check-in, they were quick to offer us a place to rest and relax or local attractions to visit.  I don't know if I have ever met such a welcoming reception staff.

We stayed in a standard King room with garden view-which was quiet and comfortable.  The bathroom was huge with separate sinks, a bathtub and a shower.  The in-room amenities were nice: coffee and bottled water replacement daily.  The hotel is currently undergoing construction, but we did not find this to be an inconvenience in any way.

We did eat breakfast both mornings in their dining room (additional charge).  The staff was so pleasant and friendly, the service quick, and the food delicious!  We loved the Irish breakfast, as well as the large spread for Continental breakfast (the yogurt is amazing!)

The hotel is in a great location-walking distance to numerous attractions and shopping.  The concierge is quick to recommend local pubs and restaurants away from the hustle and bustle of tourists.

Although our stay at the Merrion was very short, we would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2016,10,30
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion is all you would want from a luxury hotel--incredible, kind, quiet service, gorgeous quiet rooms, marble large bathroom with bathrobes and 2-3 blocks from St. Stephen's Square-the center of town.  We had tea in the afternoon in their beautiful drawing room with a fireplace and dinner at the casual and atmospheric Cellar Bar downstairs.  We didn't want to leave!",5,2016,10,30
200,JMarrion hotel short stay,"Classy traditional style hotel with excellent service and well spppointrrd rooms. Afternoon tea a real treat and the staff all very helpful and pleasant.
The Marrion is expensive but ideally situated and exuding old world charm

I am staying there again in December!",4,2016,10,29
200,Splendid!,"Beautiful hotel made up of four old brownstones!  Service was top notch and the staff could not have been more courteous and friendly.  Room was HUGE, with a sitting area and a large bathroom!  Everything was spotless and comfortable, with all amenities you could ask for (including 3 bars of chocolate!!).  Highly recommend!",5,2016,10,29
200,"Best, most enjoyable hotel in Europe we've ever stayed.","My wife and I have been to Europe 9 times....nothing compares to the service, attention and its elegant understated charm. Great pool too! Why the maid even provided a book marker for the novel my wife was reading.",5,2016,10,29
200,wow wow and even more wow,"We stayed her on an anniversary back in 2015. I am only getting around to writing this now as life seem to get in the way.
My wife and I have visited many 5 star hotels and this ranks up as the cream.
In Dublin there are other 5 stars that catch more of the media attention and scream out that they are great but if you want descreet class that does not need to shout to prove what it is then this is the hotel for you.
Every room, nuck and cranny is well looked after.The rooms are beautiful. But while the building is stunning the service betters it and that is impressive. You are made to feel special. This hotel is a real credit to the Management and staff for their hard work. Yes it is expensive but if you shopping for the best and want to spend the money this hotel will not let you down.  I would go back in a heart beat. If you get the chance....Stay!!",5,2016,10,24
200,Three nights at the Merrion,"We arrived sat the hotel at 7:00 am and although we requested early check in there was nothing available till later, they offered to try and get a room ready by noon but that was the earliest.  Asked if we would like to go to breakfast but we were not hungary.  We got on the hop off hop on bus and did the tour of Dublin.  When we arrived sat the hotel the doorman was right there to greet us and brought our luggage in right away and stored it for us. He was so pleasant.  When we arrived back at the hotel our room was ready so the girl in reception took us to the room, we just wanted to sleep after long night and flight. Our room was a very nice room, however it was right at the end of the hall where the construction was going on. No one had mentioned the noise to us when we booked or checked in. The first night we went out to a pub and had dinner and  then returned to hotel bar for a night cap.  When asked for a glass of port the young man said her is the menu for drinks, we don't have port. My husband asked him to get someone else and it turned out the young man was only just training. The other bar tender got me a glass of port.  The next day we went down for breakfast which was not included in the room which was 450. euros a night. The brekfast was part continental and menu offer. We both chose the full irish and when it came the eggs that were supposed to over easy were cooked iwth no yolk and the breakast meats were cold as if they sat awhile. Was not impressed. We spent the day shopping and then went to the pub around the corner which was great. Again same doorman very nice.  We decided to order room service and i had the chicken noodle soup which was good and my husband had ordered the filet of beef. I was asked how the meat shouldbe cooked and I said rare to medium rare. The room service person was very prompt and set everything out.  My husband removed the tray to find mash potatoes, greasy onion rings and a filet that you could have used as a hockey puck. Very disappointing. Third day went down to the concierge and Tom helped us with a car rental and gave us train times times and sceduale to go to the seaside town of Howth. Very nice trip. Leaving the hotel we were met by the same doorman who got us a cab and helped put our luggage into the taxi. Nice hotel beds comfortable but needs improvement in some of its dining choices.",4,2016,10,22
200,Easy Walking,"Classic and beautiful hotel.  Centrally located and easy to get around.  Staff was very courteous and helpful.  This hotel is definitely more old school vibe compared to the other LHW in Dublin, but great location and elegant.",5,2016,10,22
200,Wonderful Stay,"My room was in the new section and everything about it was flawless.   It was quite large for a room in a major city, with lots of closet space and a spacious bathroom; and staff had prepared it with good attention to detail.  My toom was quiet and comfortable and I slept very well.  

The hotel itself is located in a very nice section of Dublin, very close to major attractions but on a quiet street.   It's very clean and well maintained with a large and very helpful staff, as you would expect in this price range.  It also has an interesting art collection  The concierge staff in particular was very knowledgeable and tried very hard to be helpful and almost succeeded.",5,2016,10,22
200,I would choose to stay here at any opportunity,"I have been fortunate enough to stay here regularly over the years and this is an exceptional hotel.  The staff are superb, the rooms are beautiful, the lounge area and bar have a lovely comfortable atmosphere with top quality food and drinks served.  Every time you stay in this hotel it feels special.  The decor and the art collection in the hotel are stunning.  Breakfast served in your room is of such a high standard it would be difficult to explain.  Luxury without stuffiness is how I would sum up this fabulous hotel.",5,2016,10,21
200,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Our favourite hotel in Dublin. The staff always look after us so well. Fabulous art collection and cosy bar in the winter.
The hotel has a pool and small gym.
The gardens are lovely too.
If you can stay in the old building, it is charming.",5,2016,10,19
200,Amazing location and accomadation,This hotel has it all. Staff are excellent and located in the nicest area of Dublin city. Slightly more expensive than many of Dublin's hotels but in a different league. You will not need any transport from this location as all of the city highlights are within walking distance. I will be back again.,5,2016,10,19
200,Must book if you are headed to Dublin,"I cannot say enough about our stay at the Merrion Hotel.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated as if we were the only guests staying at the hotel.  It was a level of customer service I have never experienced anywhere else.

Our room size was splendid and I enjoyed our open window views of the courtyard.  I have read some reviews condemning the ongoing construction.  While certainly visible from our room (directly across the courtyard), we had no issues with the sound.  My wife and I slept comfortably and were not awoken one time.

In addition to the amazing staff and great rooms, the hotel is well located within a short walk of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.  And if you are feeling up to it, the walk to and from The Temple Bar area is great.

We stayed at another hotel in Dublin on the back end of our trip, and I would do anything to erase that decision and stay at the Merrion again.  If you are going to spend any time in Dublin, I cannot recommend the Merrion Hotel enough.",5,2016,10,18
200,Simply the BEST!,"One of the nicest hotels in which we have ever stayed.  5-Star all the way.  Great location, beautiful exterior, attentive and polite staff, lovely huge rooms, well appointed, spacious bathroom with gorgeous fixtures. The breakfasts were scrumptious. Easy walking distance to all the sites.  We couldn't have asked for more from a downtown hotel. Made our stay in Dublin that much more enjoyable.",5,2016,10,18
200,City centre luxury,"We stayed here for one night after going to a show. The staff are so welcoming and helpful, polite and courteous. Our room was a suite, big and spacious. It was in "" The Garden wing"" but all we saw were two street views with direct views into two offices! 
The breakfast was superb with assortments of food to delight any visitor. Service was attentive and smart. There is a spa, gym and gorgeous swimming pool which I had to myself ! This hotel is a treat from the stereotype of city hotel and worth the expense.",4,2016,10,18
200,Great stay ,"We stayed 2 night on the second floor . The reason I gave them a 4 out of 5 is they didn't mention the construction out the window nor the scaffolding out the bedroom window on Friday they starts construction at 8:30 am . The room itself was very nice large and wonderful bathroom with walk in shower and tub . They offered turn down service with slippers a nice touch . 
The location for tourists is wonderful a easy city to walk , from shopping , restaurant, university , and churches .   ",4,2016,10,17
200,Great hotel but complete letdown for guest,"The Merrion is a very nice hotel.  We had a garden room which was nice and large.  The breakfasts are excellent.  The concierges are outstanding.  Why 3 starts then?  Answer: the drilling and jackhammer outside our room on Monday morning.  I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel (or any hotel)  where major construction was taking place outside my room so it was impossible to read or think.  When we checked in if we had been told of the expected noise, we would have asked for a different room or moved to the Shelburne which is about one block away.  Instead we left for the airport early and are now sitting in the lounge.  So I ask the manger of the Merrion, why do you let this noise bother your guests?  You should tell your guest when they check in or post a notice on your website--jackhammers beware!",3,2016,10,17
200,Beautiful hotel.. Cannot wait to return!,"I don't really know where to start with this lovely hotel. It has everything you need in such a wonderful place!
The Merrion is in the heart of Dublin, the outside of the hotel is a grand house and you are immediately welcomed by friendly door men. 
Our flight landed at lunchtime and our room wasn't meant to be ready until 3pm, luckily it was ready when we arrived! Room 204 was a spacious, luxurious room with fluffy carpets and melt in the middle bed with the biggest bathroom full of gorgeous Asprey minis :) 
The room was fabulous and the mini bar reasonably priced stocked full of coconut water and top rate snacks. 
I ordered room service breakfast every morning,The Irish breakfast is yummy but a little over priced. 
The bar they have downstairs is really nice, it's a wine cellar where they show the football and golf, you can get bar snacks or a proper meal. The only down side was that it shuts at 6pm on a Sunday :( 
The bar upstairs is also nice but more for a quiet drink with no TV's, they do some lovely cocktails at the bar upstairs.
I had two treatments while I was here and my therapist was Niamh, she was wonderful and made me feel so relaxed. The treatments are well worth it here and I would recommend you have a pedicure if you do choose to have one. The swimming pool is a lovely temperature and they also have a steam room. 
I felt at home at The Merrion and I really didn't want to leave. The hotel is pure luxury and if you want to escape real life then this is the place to come. 
Best spots for lunch or dinner, The Cliff Townhouse or FX Buckley. 
Cannot wait to return next year! :)",5,2016,10,17
200,Amazing! ,"Came to The Merrion as a treat for art afternoon tea and were not disappointed! Food was divine, service was absolutely amazing felt every bit it's 5 stars. We have had afternoon tea at The Ritz and Betty's several times and felt this was better. Well worth the money. ",5,2016,10,16
200,Wonderful hotel,We stayed two nights here and it is a lovely place to stay... the rooms are large and comfortable with all one could want - even an iron and board! ....tea and coffee in the room too. Staff are all a great asset to the hotel .... always ready and willing to help..... and smiling! We loved it!,5,2016,10,15
200,Great stay,"The Merrion is probably Dublin's best hotel. It's cozy and historic feeling. Tea on a chilly afternoon in front of one of the many fireplaces is a treat! Our room was large and well appointed and the so was the bathroom (which was also well lighted, with a magnifying mirror). My husband felt the shower was a bit small but that was his only complaint. The staff is friendly and breakfast in the cellar dining room was quite enjoyable. We had dinner there one night too and, while the food was quite good, we felt it lacked atmosphere. There is another restaurant in the hotel but it was closed during our visit. We had drinks one night in the bar and enjoyed their many whisky offerings. ",5,2016,10,14
200,Excellent Stay,"An amazing experience at an amazing hotel.You were looked after from the moment you pulled up in a taxi until the moment you left.All the staff were pleasant and helpful and the extras in the room were superb,the fruit was a lovely touch.",5,2016,10,14
200,"Great Stay, Perfect Location & Gracious Staff","We had a very relaxing stay at the Merrion.  We were surprised to have fresh flowers in the room and the staff could not have been kinder.  We will make a point to ""splurge"" st the Merrion again in the future!",5,2016,10,12
200,anniversary stay,"Great stay, did not disappoint. Heavenly bed and bathroom. Food and drink available 24hours. Excellent food for dinner or snacks. Quiet, clean, convenient location. Just check so you won't be disappointed if their fine dining restaurant is renovating.",5,2016,10,12
200,Dublin Experience of Merrion Hotel,Very attentive staff throughout. Discovered a leak at base of the toilet - bit of a shock when you step into water in the middle of the night as one pays a visit - certainly awakes you from your slumber. Ken McM,5,2016,10,12
200,A most wonderful hotel experience,"My recent stay at The Merrion Dublin must be rated as one of the more memorable hotel experiences of recent years.
Excellence is a word that sums up everything from check-in to check-out.
Thank you staff !
",5,2016,10,11
200,Luxurious experience throughout!,"Went for a drink which turned into a totally luxurious experience throughout.
Not only were the staff extremely polite, they  not only met our needs, they anticipated them.wow.
We were given complimentary nibbles whilst we had our drinks.
Everyone should treat themselves to visiting this hotel at least once in their lives.",5,2016,10,11
200,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"Having stayed at the Merrion a number of times I have always been impressed.  I am staying again in October. Great rooms, nice bar and amazing service. 
Last time I also had the breakfast. Pancakes and coffee to compare to the best. 
Nothing is too much trouble and the location is decent. It is definitely not cheap but if you are looking at this price point you should definitely use the Merrion. 
Rooms are fantastic and I have not ever had a bad one without a bath etc. The rooms are always clean and they provide a free bottle of still water and a free bottle of sparkling water which is a nice touch. 
Looking forward to my next stay on October 12th. ",5,2016,10,10
200,Work related,"Good hotel. Friendly staff. Rooms are mostly tidy and quiet. Good area to stay in, especially after a long trip if you want to catch up on sleep etc. Haven't tried the restaurant. I usually go out to the nearby shawarma or kebab places as there quite a few there. ",4,2016,10,08
200,The top hotel in Dublin!,I have been to many hotels of the world but this one hits the top. The room was exquisite in fact I slept in the same bed that the boss Bruce Springsteen slept in.  They give you home made chocolate bars. ,5,2016,10,07
200,Nice Stay,"It's a nice hotel in a nice location but that's about it really.....if you're looking for 5 star service with beautiful interiors this may not be the place, to be honest it was just a bit underwhelming. I expected more but in saying that I couldn't fault it, staff were fine, service was fine, room was nicely appointed but it didn't bowl me over, just average for a five star property.",4,2016,10,06
200,Wonderful Small Hotel,"The Merrion is a special small hotel in Dublin.  The service is superb and all the staff were very helpful. The rooms are spatious and well appointed. We were tired after a long flight from the States so had a bite in their bar the first night.....it was spectacular with a nice selection. Just around the left at the corner, you will find a great Pub Doheny and Nesbitt.",5,2016,10,06
200,Great place to Stay in Dublin,My wife and I were visiting Italy and our flight stopped in Dublin so we decided to extend our trip for another three days in Dublin.  We stayed at the Merrion Hotel which is in a great location to see the Dublin sites.  The hotel was more than we expected and staff  could not be more helpful.  This is a first class establishment with great rooms and service and location.  I would stay here again and would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.,5,2016,10,05
200,Surprise Stay,I recently booked the Merrion Hotel as a surprise for my partner. We really enjoyed our stay and found the staff and service excellent. I would recommend an earlier check-in as we arrived early in the morning.,5,2016,10,05
200,Wonderful stay,Booked this hotel for an anniversary stay on the back of TripAdvisor ratings!  We weren't disappointed.  Very friendly staff and service was bang on point.  Our room was excellent with the added touch of cake and a card from the hotel.  Beautiful decor and just an understated elegance about the whole hotel.  We felt really special staying there.  Part of the hotel is currently under refurbishment but this did not affect our stay in anyway whatsoever.,5,2016,10,05
200,Wonderful stay at the Merrion Hotel,"We booked into the Merrion Hotel for a shopping trip to Dublin. We booked the overnight package to include dinner, bed and breakfast and champagne. On arrival, we were upgraded to a beautiful room in the Main House and the room was so luxurious that we will definitely book the Main House on our next visit.  Lunch in No. 23  was delicious and dinner later that evening in the Cellar Restaurant was sublime! Wonderful service from start to finish made this a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait to stay again!",5,2016,10,05
200,Great ambiance and place to stay!,"An outstanding place to stay in the center of Dublin. Old World experience combined with  the modern amenities. Sunday afternoon tea was grand and he breakfast was a full Irish breakfast plus some.

The only drawback was the wifi, it did not work at all. They have two systems and both resulted in frequent drops despite asking the front desk and IT people for help. They need to get that fixed for the modern traveler who relies on the internet for pleasure and business.",5,2016,10,04
200,Beautiful property!,We stayed here with Railtours of Ireland. Beautiful hotel-the rooms are well appointed and absolutely lovely. The art collection in the hotel is vast and very interesting. Great location in Dublin as well. Loved our stay but was too short!,5,2016,10,02
200,Disappointed this time,"My wife and I have stayed at the Merrion a few times with only small complaints. It is listed as an exclusive property and I did use my AMEX travel ""fine hotel"" booking to set the reservation. One of the perks of using AMEX is that you can receive an early check in at noon. We arrived at 10:00am and while I did not expect a room at that time, I did feel we would be at the top of the cue for a room. After visiting some local sites, we returned at 2:30 and were told we could not check in until 3:00p. We sat and watched numerous individuals check in without problem. Finally, we were given a room, but it was clearly one of the worst rooms in the house. I guess you can't win them all, but caution in the fine print with this hotel. Next stop.......a complaint to AMEX and a request for them to review this ""fine"" hotel. Who knows, many the Merrion doesn't necessarily like American Express.....",1,2016,10,02
200,Expensive but a really good hotel,"Great location in the heart of Dublin with Grafton Street and all its shops, bars and cafes about 10 minutes away.

The rooms in the main hotel and garden wing are spacious, with good bathrooms. We were there for 3 nights and had an extremely comfortable bed and thus a good sleep each night.

The concierge was extremely knowledgeable of restaurants, exhibitions etc.
Front of house staff were helpful and the quirky art on the wall fun to see.

The slight downer was the 2 bars. Neither of them had any atmosphere even though the cocktails were good. Service however was slow. So go out and enjoy the rich bar scene in Dublin.
Breakfast was plentiful and the coffee tasty.",4,2016,10,02
200,Overpriced but nice,"We arrived early morning to the hotel but our room was not available till 4pm . This is far to be a good 1st impression if we talk about a luxury hotel . I dont care about how many check out has the hotel on my arrival day.
Aside from this , the location is good , not perfect. The room was nice with a  very comfortable King size bed. Some european hotels should learn about that the size matters on this issue. I have to say that the linen was of the highest quality and extremely clean.",4,2016,09,30
200,Unbeatable,"A wonderful one night stay in this beautiful hotel. Great location in the city centre.beautiful well appointed garden room. Fabulous pool. Great food and exceptional staff......and a great art collection. Lovely reception rooms, stylish but very relaxed. One of the best places I have ever stayed.",5,2016,09,30
200,Quiet Elegance at the Merrion,"We stayed here for 6 nights and found the service absolutely flawless.  Our room was a recently refurbished king room in the main house, which exuded a refined country feeling.  From the lovely painted furniture to the high quality linens to the fresh flowers, it was as if you were staying at a private manor and not a hotel in the middle of a busy city.  Room service was the fastest I've ever experienced, it was almost as if they were cooking the food in the room next to us.  When we called to have the table removed, again service was so prompt, I thought they must have been hovering outside my door.  Evening turn down was perfect, no stupid chocolate on the pillows, instead a more intuitive choice; a silver bucket filled with ice and plenty of bottled water.  I have read some reviews that described the staff as snobby and/or standoffish...this is simply untrue.  They keep a respectful distance and allow the guest to set the tone of the interaction.  As soon as you engage them in any conversation, as with all Dubliner's, they are warm, and delightfully enthusiastic. Go out and enjoy all that a hectic and fun,(sometimes too much fun), Dublin has to offer and then come back home to the Merrion and let them take very, very good care of you.",5,2016,09,29
200,Superb!  Surpassed Our Expectations in Every Way!,"The hotel is a superb one-of-a-kind experience, with a fantastic art collection (check out the works by Lavery and also the James Joyce sculpture / fountain in the garden).  The cellar bar is actually an old wine cellar from the late 1700's.  

The linens are great, bathrooms wonderful - every detail - towel warmers, etc.  But the staff is what really makes it top-notch.  We were gone for a weekend and when we checked in the second time, the staff greeted us by name right when we got out of the cab!   Everything is taken care of for you.  Don't forget your swimsuit.  The infinity pool is beautiful and relaxing - even if you can only get a few minutes in for a swim.",5,2016,09,28
200,Friendly luxury in Dublin City,"The Merrion is the star of Dublin.  Friendly staff, immaculate rooms, great location.  Taste of classic Ireland with all of the modern conveniences. I wish there was a Merrion in every city I travel too.",5,2016,09,28
200,Nice Traditional Hotel,"The Merrion is an elegant hotel within walking distance of many sights (or a short drive). Staff is courteous and pleasant. The rooms and common areas could use some updating to really bring this hotel up to modern standards. There was some construction working taking place during our stay, but it did not impact us at all.",3,2016,09,26
200,Honeymoon ,"From the minute we pulled up in the car we where so well looked after.
We just got married Friday and when the staff found out we where upgraded and treated like royalty.
Food was fab and service was top class",5,2016,09,26
200,subdued luxury,"1st class hotel.. even better employee.. Bobbi from Bulgaria on the front desk.. due to a demonstration going on in the area on our day of arrival, the taxi could not drop us off at the hotel.. and due to this we had to walk with luggage in the rain.. and I arrived, less than humored and was a tad gruff with Bobbi, when we arrived, yet, like trooper, just never flinched... and even upgraded us to a JR suite.... upon reflection, I decided to apologize for my 1st impression, and she was more than gracious ... a SUPER employee... the facility was great in every way.. yet, this interaction speaks volumes with the caliber of the management, as the employees are 6 stars...
And if you have read some of my reviews, I am not so easily impressed.. yet, I was!",5,2016,09,26
200,Fabulous hotel in heart of Dublin,The Merrion Hotel provides guests with spacious and comfortable rooms and a great location in Dublin within walking distance of Trinity College. The staff and service in The Cellar Restaurant were good. The lobby and public areas were formal and yet inviting for a cup of tea and pastries. Definitely a great choice for a visit to Dublin. ☘,5,2016,09,24
200,Exceeded all (very high) expectations!,"We recently stayed at the Merrion the night before my daughter was to be married. Everything about the hotel, from the initial contact, to my daughter leaving for the church was absolutely perfect! Our reservation was complicated. It included a large group of guests traveling from the US with different arrival and departure dates, with plenty of queries and special requests. Nothing was a problem for the staff and management and every aspect was handled with extreme professionalism, courtesy and in the friendliest manner imaginable. I could not recommend hotel enough!",5,2016,09,24
200,Best,"No disrespect to the Shelbourne Hotel or many of the other fine hotels in Dublin, but the Merrion Hotel simply is the best, in my view.  Staff are enormously competent and gracious, without being ingratiating.  Not a few of the guests display a sense of entitlement, and the staff handle that with real aplomb.  Details matter and are managed impeccably.  Rooms are elegant but also bright and welcoming.  The place has an air of refinement but also self-assurance (although not self-importance), and rightly so.  When the Merrion is available, I am delighted and do not consider staying anywhere else.",5,2016,09,24
200,Not worth the money,"Excited to stay at the Merrion, but the service delivered and the amenities did not deliver the value for the cost of the stay.  I would recommend finding a nice, but less high profile stay in Dublin, especially since you'll be exploring the city and given there are few amenities to enjoy at the Merrion.",2,2016,09,22
200,Vacation,Very subdued establishment .Staff first rate.Our room was well done.Great location .The cellar restaurant is not warm and inviting.The food was  quite good.The common rooms are spacious and well appointed.,5,2016,09,22
200,Holiday ,A very welcoming reception also the helpful Porters and Doormen. We had a garden room on the third floor excellent accommodation. Everywhere there were little extras that showed someone had taken great care to ensure everything was just so. The Michelin stared restaurant is not open on Sunday and Monday how ever there is a good restaurant in the basement which is also used for Breakfast which is excellent. If you like good wine plenty on offer .If you want just a half bottle of champagne let them know beforehand as they do not cool half bottles unless requested.Taxi cabs are plentiful but traffic is often congested so order just a little bit earlier than you thought. One great advantage is that the Merrion hotel is very close to one of the airport shuttle bus stops. If you are coming from the airport it's the stop after Merrion square (fare 6 Euro one way) only yards away from the hotel entrance. Nb there are two routes make sure you get on the right one.If you are thinking of  driving it's unwise the streets are narrow and congested and there are pedestrian areas so not recommended . The street names are in Irish and in English but having both makes some of them difficult to read as you pass in a car.The Merrion hotel is a wonderful and memorable experience of how things should be done but rarely are these days.....a real gem.,5,2016,09,21
200,The Old will Rot if not Cared for,"The Merrion rides on its history, however its preservation is poor. A number of friendly and welcoming staff plus its location cloak the underlining factor that the hotel needs a full and expensive overhaul. The patchwork renovations will always keep this property in a 4star hotel experience.",3,2016,09,21
200,Dapper in Downtown Dublin,"Stayed here for two nights on a family trip. The staff here were all absolutely lovely and could not have been more accommodating! The rooms were nice, the bathrooms were especially lush, the tub was to die for! They have a nice selection of free movies to watch.  The pool is beautiful (I did not get a chance to use it, but I peeked at it). The breakfast was delicious and the location was very conveniently located close to many pubs, shops, and attractions in Dublin.",4,2016,09,19
200,Unjustifiably expensive,"The Merrion has an excellent name for offering 5 Star hospitality in Dublin, and it generally does deliver it. 

However there were a number of aspects of our recent visit which we found very disappointing. 

Firstly - when paying almost €400 for one night in a top hotel, I would expect it to include breakfast. It didn't. 

Secondly - I don't expect to be disturbed (woken) in the morning by a staff member wanting to check a mini-bar especially one  which I have not touched. I then received two further knocks on the door from chamber maids before 12.30, despite have a late check out. This was disconcerting. 

Thirdly - my room was not as modern as other comparable hotels in Dublin, a number of which offer more competitive rates, which would include breakfast. 

In consideration of this, I will consider other hotels in future. 

However it is centrally located, clean, comfortable, and the staff were friendly and professional. ",3,2016,09,18
200,Comfortable few days,"Very nice hotel.  Well equipped room where the 'maid' service was excellent.""Garden Room"" overlooked a narrow street with skips in it.
Basement restaurant lacks character.  Ate out.
Chaotic breakfast arrangements but very good food.
Building work on the periphery at the moment.  Michelin 2* restaurant closed for refurbishment which we didn't pick up on the web site.",4,2016,09,17
200,Quality hotel for that special occasion,"We had an overnight stay at the Merrion recently to mark a special occasion. Check in was smooth, professional & very friendly. The room in the old house faced out on to Merrion Street but the there was absolutely no noise coming through even from the heavy traffic below. The room itself was excellent, spacious, very comfortable & the hotel had kindly noted the special occasion which was a nice touch.

The only issue we had related to the ""cooked breakfast"" & we had a similar issue on our last visit. The cooked breakfast had a buffet type feel to it - uneven cooking and a taste as if it had not been freshly prepared which is something you probably should expect from a hotel of this quality. It just leaves a lingering doubt about the visit - breakfast here used to be a very enjoyable & pleasant experience & my guest was also of the same view.

However, overall we had a very enjoyable experience, albeit a short visit on this occasion and I would certainly recommend it for a special occasion. There are some renovations ongoing in the hotel & adjoining restaurant but it did not intrude on our stay.",4,2016,09,16
200,Lovely hotel with first rate service,"This is a high quality property with the highest quality hospitality and service.  We were staying in a suite which is very large. Not only with a sitting room, but two bathrooms and a room for luggage. Staff is warm and friendly, but done in a professional, not slavish way. The art on the walls of the public rooms are not to be missed. Highly recommended for all visitors. Location is just off Merrion Square near Trinity College, the National Art Gallery, and the National Museum-- Archaeology which has the Viking Gold and the bog bodies.  Encourage visitors to stay here.",4,2016,09,15
200,Merrion Fab,"Super location in the heart of Georgian Dublin. The staff couldn't be more friendly, efficient and interested. Rooms a little small but that's a function of the location. Breakfast fab. highly recommend for business or pleasure.",5,2016,09,14
200,Old School Luxury with a modern twist,"We stayed here as the final night of a long road tour of Ireland. We hoped for and expected a luxurious stay and were not disappointed.
Everything was perfect, from the valet parking on arrival to the room and service.
Ideally located with the bonus of the attached Michelin-starred restaurant where we dined.",5,2016,09,13
200,Afternoon Tea at The Merrion,"Afternoon Tea at The Merrion was a lovely experience. Their tea menu was filled with lots of choices of hot and cold teas, and you are able to enjoy as many as you like.
The cake and sandwich selection was delicious and the waiting staff were very informative. The waiting staff were also very accommodating by making sure that your teacup was always full and ensuring we had the most pleasant experience.
This was a Birthday present from my partner, and one of the main reasons he chose The Merrion is that of course you can enjoy a glass of bubbles with your tea; which at Merrion the champagne of choice is Ruinart. 
Ruinart is the oldest champagne of France so it is well worth a try!
The Merrion also have a special course where they match desserts to match paintings which is very novel and lovely to eat too!
I hope to return soon!",5,2016,09,13
200,Amazing Hotel,"This is by far the best hotel we ever stayed.  Location is superb - convenient to all the major sites.  We walked from the Guinness Distillery back to the hotel.  The rooms are luxurious, spacious, immaculately clean, and leave nothing to be desired.  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, and the people go out of their way to help with directions to sights, restaurant recommendations, transportation, etc...Will definitely stay there again !",5,2016,09,12
200,Lovely,"Beautiful hotel, centrally located, wonderful facilities and tea time, and unexpectedly huge. The rooms are very clean an cozy. The tea time is also something to look forward to, and so well decorated!",5,2016,09,12
200,Everything you would want...,"Delightful room in the Merrion hotel in which everything worked perfectly. Which these days even for a five star hotel can be unusual. The room service breakfasts were delicious and l had mentioned before we arrived that it was a surprise birthday treat for my husband and we found four delightful little cupcakes to welcome us in our room with a congratulatory note, all hand baked. They tasted very nice!  All the staff were so helpful in pointing us in the right direction for things in Dublin and couldn't be more helpful. Once minus however, our request on two occasions for a lot of extra water, which was entered into the computer by the receptionist, went unheeded but small fry indeed! We were very pleased to take advantage of their in house two Michelin star restaurant which was delicious overall. We would love to return. Best hotel I have stayed in I believe.",5,2016,09,12
200,"Most wonderful traditional hotel, great location","Our group of seven had such a pleasant experience at the Merrion. We were travel weary, as we had jet lagged kids, but the hotel staff were super nice to us. Rooms were beautiful - we had a two bedroom suite for our five and another room for the in-laws. The indoor pool was a big hit with the kiddos, who had pint-sized robes in the room. Even though we payed just slightly more here than we did for our end of trip stay at the Dylan Hotel, I would choose this one again hands down.  The hotel is near two major parks, a ton of free museums, a great kids playground in Merrion Square and is right on the hop-on hop-off bus route.",5,2016,09,12
200,Magnificent hotel,"The Merrion Hotel is an absolutely spectacular hotel.  It is a truly beautiful facility and the rooms were wonderful.  The bathrooms were big and marble, the suites beautifully decorated.  The service is outstanding.",5,2016,09,12
200,Big bucks but comfortable and central,"We stayed here for one night recently whilst in town for a wedding. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but that was ok, it was ready by the time we returned at 3pm. The public areas were tasteful and comfortable  - wonderful art, beautiful flowers, cosy sofas - I wish we'd lingered for afternoon tea which on the weekend of the big US college football game included battenburg cake in the colours of the two teams, which I felt was a nice touch that would have been appreciated by the many Americans staying in the hotel.

Rooms were equally comfortable - we had a garden wing room which was small but quiet. The bathroom was marble but far from bling. I loved the tweed curtains and squashy bed. But a few things were lacking from what I'd expect of a truly leading hotel, or at least one at this price point - milk was of the UHT pot variety, the cups didn't fit under the espresso machine, no freebies other than a bottle of mineral water. Generally, when I pay over £300 per night for a hotel, I expect a chocolate, and a handmade one at that, on my pillow! And the walkway from the main building of the hotel to the garden wing was a bit tacky and more in keeping with a Hilton conference/wedding venue, perhaps a temporary solution, despite the art hung there.

Location was great - really close to St Stephen's Green and a few legendary pubs (O'Donoughue's, Doheny & Nesbitt and Toners) and right on the 757 bus route to the airport.

Would we stay again? Yes, we had a comfortable stay here and if it's good enough for Obama and Springsteen, it's definitely good enough for us. But will we? I doubt it. It's a few notches short of being truly a leading hotel of the world and I've stayed in better hotels in other cities for around half the price point. I appreciate that Dublin is an expensive city though all round though so if money is no object, The Merrion is a good shout. Next time, I think we'll go for a a mid-range hotel and save our Euro for the excellent Guinness!",4,2016,09,12
200,Terrific hotel,"On arrival we were welcomed by friendly staff,including Ali,Tom,Patrick.
Room was excellent and they even put some nice cup cakes in our room and gave us an upgrade as I'd told them prior that it was a special occasion.
Didn't eat there other than one night we had room service and the food was very good.
Close to everything.You can go around the corner opposite the famous pub if you want to save 10-20 euros pp. for breakfast.
All in all it was really fantastic and would certainly go back.",3,2016,09,11
200,Nice old lady; bit overpriced,"We knew The Merrion to be considered the best hotel in Dublin, so stayed for a splurge for two nights before going on to England.  We asked for a room close to the elevator because I have a walking problem, and had asked well in advance and then called before arriving.  We got in after 4Pm and the room was still not ready, so they put us in a room that was so VERY far from the main part of the hotel that I had to use my mobility scooter every time I left the room, rather than being able to walk part of the time.  The rooms are OK, quite small, but honestly, the rooms at the Westin in Temple Bar are far, far superior for less money!  I think we paid partly for the upkeep of The Merrion's very good art collection.
Good feature not really about the hotel:  O'Donoghue's pub across the street has great trad music if you can stand up for a long time!
The high tea was good, but it seemed like the personnel would have rather been elsewhere, and we'd have appreciated a more traditional tea with less arty sweets.  Breakfast was always good.
Doormen were the best of personnel, always very friendly and helpful.  Some of staff were snooty, some just cordial, some really nice and helpful.
Pool is a very good one, this was the best feature of the hotel and the only thing it has over the Westin.
Stay here again?  Probably not, given the myriad choices.",4,2016,09,11
200,Great stay ,"Not first stay here but didn't dissapoint. Positives were bar cocktails and food. Negative was despite paying for  an upgraded king room with tub, we were put in a room for people with mobility issues and no tub. After calling to complain however we were switched to the correct room after about a half hour which was good.
It's a pity about the building happening on site but of course no one can be blamed and I'd imagine the hotel will be fantastic when complete.
The valet service and staff were top notch",4,2016,09,11
200,What a gorgeous hotel!,"On our first visit to Ireland we decided to go with the best, and booked 5 nights at the Merrion. We were not disappointed in the slightest! As a matter of fact, the Merrion is perhaps the loveliest hotel which provides the absolute highest standard of service we have ever stayed at! Attention to detail by its superb staff is the Merrion's hallmark.  Every request was handled with the utmost speed, courtesy and friendliness. Our room was perfectly updated, clean and cozy. Breakfasts were served in their Cave restaurant and provided everything you might wish for, in an elegant setting. Thank you for making our visit so lovely!",5,2016,09,10
200,Mr,Best hotel in Dublin. Best rooms. Staff very nice and helpful.  Gave us an upgrade. Close to shopping areas & National Gallery.  Peaceful setting. Luxuriously homely feel to your room. Not cheap but is a 5 star +.  ,5,2016,09,09
200,Excellent Choice,The Merrion is an ideal location in Dublin and the experience of the stay was a highlight of five days in Dublin.  Extraordinary service and I got the feel of being a resident in a Dublin townhouse mansion rather than a usual hotel.  The above average rates (I stayed as lower rate garden wind) is worth it. Service is superior.  I travelled with a small group and all expressed same positives.,5,2016,09,08
200,Recent visit,Overall this is a very good hotel well located to galleries and museums.  There are a number of pubs and restaurants within a block or two of the hotel.  The Cellar bar is friendly but not as lively as others close by.,4,2016,09,08
200,Exceptional,"We spent two nights in Dublin at the Merrion and everything was world class.  The staff was very professional and efficient, while also being very warm and personal.  Beautiful room, great service, excellent food and a great location near St. Steven's Green.",5,2016,09,07
200,Nice Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"Stayed at the Merrion for a visit in July.  It is located within a walking distance to some great restaurants as well as the Temple Bar district.  It also has a Hop-on-Hop-off bus stop outside its door, which made it very convenient on a rainy day (of which we had 2).  Staff was accommodating, from the doormen to the bartender in the Cellar Bar. A little pricey, overall, but a decent value.",4,2016,09,06
200,"WARM, INVITING EXQUISITE","THE Merrion Hotel in Dublin is very comfortable and  a lovely place to stay in Dublin.  We particularly enjoyed the impressionist paintings and original art that highlights both Irish and world class artists that is displayed throughout the hotel.  From the doormen, concierge, front desk and cleaning  people as well as bar tenders and spa staff - they were all very helpful, kind & professional.  Would go back again.",5,2016,09,05
200,Warm and luxurious hotel,Staff were welcoming and friendly from the first moment we arrived to the moment we left.  Breakfast was delicious..  Our deluxe room was warm and indulgent.  The hotel was within walking distance of many downtown spots as well as a nice 20 minute walk to Aviva Stadium.,5,2016,09,05
200,Quality Service Luxury,"I had an impeccable stay. The service was quality and the accommodation was luxury. Everything from the check in, to room service to my drivers everything was fab!  I honestly couldn't of asked for a better experience. I stay in alot of hotels due to work.  Thank you.  I will be back again.",5,2016,09,05
200,Mothers 80th Afternoon Tea,This was booked on recommendation from a afternoon tea expert as the best.  Oh my goodness what treat afternoon tea lasted 3 hours different teas tasted and a feat for both tastebuds and eyes.  Room is beautiful and very elegant.  They deserve the reputation as afternoon tea experts service attention to detail beautiful food and wonderful be averages and best of all knowledgeable staff  ,5,2016,09,05
200,Amazing hotel in the heart of the city,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband at the end of August and I have to say once again this hotel has an amazing standard set it is to a standard that a lot of other 5 star hotels should strive to achieve. The rooms are spacious and the beds are a great size. I would recommend an upgrade on some facilities ie the iron as this leaked onto a chair and the floor. But this is just something small and caused no issue for us. The food is always amazing we only had something small but we have eaten in the Cellar before and it is  beautiful food. As for the swimming pool I wouldn't class the changing rooms as 5 star they are very basic and take away from the rest of the hotel. However I wasn't down there on this visit and I believe they are going to be upgrading the Spa soon so hopefully that will include the changing rooms. Overall this hotel is and has always been for me amazing. You will pay 5 star prices for your stay and your food this is to be expected. Also you need to take into account that you are situation in the city center personally this hotel puts another 5 star hotel that's extremely close to it to shame. Staff are also amazing, highly attentive and look after your every need.",5,2016,09,05
200,Elegant but expensive,"The Merrion is a wonderful place for afternoon tea; it's like a ritual and if the weather is fine you can have it outdoors
in a lovely garden area.  I loved it.   That said I had dinner in the Cellar Restaurant (Merrion Hotel) and while it was good certainly, I did not think it worth the price really - but the surroundings are lovely and it is a five star hotel so it's not a place to go if you're on a budget.   
",5,2016,09,04
200,Wonderful!,My husband and I had a wonderful 10-day visit to Dublin and the center piece of the experience was The Merrion Hotel.  The staff could not be more welcoming.  Our daily arrivals and departures were greeted with friendly and caring words.  The concierge made reservations at great restaurant and we were treated to the best tables. We were treated like special guests. We loved it!,5,2016,09,04
200,An excellent hotel,"We stayed The Merrion for two days at the end of August. The hotel conveys an atmosphere of calm, friendly efficiency. I had corresponded with the concierge desk prior to arrival and they had arranged a guide for a walking tour of Dublin and restaurant reservations. Our room in the original house was extremely spacious and comfortable. The only negative point is that although the double bed was very wide it was also quite short which was not the best for a someone of my height , 1.92 meters.",5,2016,09,04
200,"MERRION HOTEL - DUBLIN, IRELAND","This is an outstanding hotel with highly professional and well trained personnel. We could not have been happier with our stay. The location was perfect for our first experience with Dublin.  The hotel personnel provided excellent advice on local shopping, dining, and tours. The dining within the hotel was excellent and the daily breakfast was first class in every respect.",5,2016,09,02
200,Wonderful stay!,"Beautiful hotel, great location, very helpful staff. We were a large group traveling together - so many rooms.  The accommodations were perfect and lovely and they were very helpful to us all.  First time to Dublin, but the location seemed close or at least walking distance to many things.",5,2016,08,31
200,I adore this hotel. One of my favourite places in the world,"Its not easy to pinpoint why i love this hotel so much. Its helped by fact i love Dublin and they also have one of the great restaurants of Europe located inside the hotel.

Service is perfect.

Rooms are incredibly comfortable and quiet, the beds are insanely comfortable.

The only thing here i dont rate is the breakfast served in the basement breakfast room, its not very good and its stupidly expensive.

I really love this hotel..",5,2016,08,29
200,Central location,"Conveniently located in the city center, friendly staff. Rooms in the Garden wing ok and relatively quiet. Our room was still not avaiable at 4pm... Breakfast buffet style in the basement - not very appealing. Overall ok, but nothing exciting.",3,2016,08,29
200,Great Hotel in the centre of Dudlin,"My wife and I stayed in the ""Garden Wing"" in an extremely comfortable room that came with a wonderfully comfortable King size bed. The staff were all very friendly and anxious to ensure are needs were catered to. This is the place to stay in Dublin - highly recommended.",5,2016,08,28
200,class...pure class,"What a wonderful hotel.
Check in easy.  Room comfortable,  roomy,  beautifully decorated.  Bath 5 star.
common areas elegant.   Great gardens.  Location so convenient for us.  Staff very helpful and down to earth.  Looking forward to next visit!!",5,2016,08,26
200,Not a Wow Factor!!,"Went here with family to celebrate a birthday.  I was all excited as it was my first time visiting the Merrion Hotel and I had heard great things about it particularly about their afternoon tea.  However this was dinner.  I had ham hock terrene for starter with veal for main - both were nice, but nothing exceptional.  My family were all happy with their food but again said it didn't 'wow' them and was very pricy.  The staff were excellent and friendly and couldn't have done enough for us.  The highlight of the evening was the bread, it was to die for!!!",4,2016,08,26
200,A visit to remember !,"A wonderful experience - professional staff - amazing attention to detail - a visit to remember ! As this was a wedding anniversary ""treat"" , we were pleasantly surprised to find a welcome plate of decorated mini muffins in our room with a message from the Manager.",5,2016,08,26
200,Wonderful stay,"I stayed here for a weekend with my mother as a birthday celebration and we just loved our stay at The Merrion. 

Location wise, it is around a 10 minute walk to the city centre and is located on a quiet street just opposite the stunning goverment buildings. There are lovely restaurants and bars nearby which are much more quiet than the buzzling bars of Temple Bar. 

The staff were attentive, proffessional and welcoming. They were very helpful with directions, things to do in the area and were kind enough to provide a welcome gift in the room for my mothers birthday. 

The room was beautiful, located on the ground floor overlooking the gardens. Great amenities in the room. I just wish I could take the scent of the hotel back home with me as it has a wonderful signature scent all around the hotel - bliss. The beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. 

I can't wait to return when the renovations have been completed, though this did not have any affect on the stay as the area of renovation is covered in a very discrete way, it would be lovely to see the finished product. 

The Irish Breakfast is a real treat and well worth the extra. 

The highlight of our stay was certainly the spa. We spent all day making the most of out the facilities and had a couple of spa treatments finished off with processco which was kindly offered to us as it was my mothers birthday. 

Overall, I had a wonderful stay at The Merrion and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2016,08,26
200,Loved it,"A good location , great staff, lovely rooms , we had a lovely treatment in the spa , the service was excellent and we were offered a nice glass of bubbly for my birthday, this hotel is elegant and restful and I want to go back.",5,2016,08,25
200,Absolutely wonderful,"Elegant common and bedrooms. Service is impeccable and lightning fast. The spa is a treasure with expert therapists and a gorgeous pool. Our room is  most comfortable, great bed, and lovely bedding. The best hotel we've stayed at in Europe.",5,2016,08,24
200,What a Five Star Hotel should be!,"We really enjoyed this hotel.  It should really be rated Five Star Plus.  It is what other hotels should aim to be.

When we enter the hotel, we are not only greeted by each doorman and concierge, but we are addressed by our proper names with smiles on their faces.  You really feel as if they are glad to see you. 

The concierges, Tom in particular, are all very helpful no matter what questions you have or help you need.  If they say they will take care of it, they do.

We were booked for an early tee time at Portmarnock.  Our clubs were in bag storage at the hotel. I phoned down to have the clubs ready when we reached the front door.  The gentleman on the phone told me our clubs were already waiting and our driver would be loading them in the car shortly.   We were impressed that they had planned ahead so we would not have to wait.

If we encounter anyone of the staff, they always smile and greet us.  if we go to use an elevator, and a staff person was waiting for the elevator, they greet us, hold the door open for us, and they wait to take the elevator later.

We returned to change for dinner late one afternoon when they  were checking the wetbar service.  They politely excused themselves and said they would return later.

The rooms are lovely, well-maintained and very tastefully decorated.

The only downsides are  there is some construction noise in the morning as they are updating a section of the hotel, and if you open the closet doors, there is not enough room for someone to pass in the entry area.

Such a lovely place!!",5,2016,08,24
200,Merrion Hotel,"As stated already, this hotel is  one of the best hotels  that I have stayed in anywhere in the world, including both the Ritz & savoy in London, The Ritz in Barcelona, the plaza new york, sandy Lane Barbados",5,2016,08,24
200,Elegance and sophistication in the heart of Dublin,"We returned to Dublin from touring for our last night before flying home.   I have to say that the Merrion was an amazing and wonderful find in the heart of Dublin and the perfect place to reside for our last night in Ireland.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcomed and well in hand.  The spa treatments and facilities were top-notch.  The room we had was absolutely gorgeous and tastefully decorated.  Being only a short walk from our favorite places in the city makes it even better (including Doheny & Nesbitt's where you have to go for a pint, fish and chips and shepherd's pie).  Our only regret is that we did not plan to stay for more nights.  I unhesitatingly recommend you stay at the Merrion when in Dublin.",5,2016,08,24
200,Worthy of her status,"The Merrion is noted as one of the top hotels in the world.  She is definitely worthy of her status.  From check in to check out our time at The Merrion was nothing short of exceptional.  Lovely hospitality, complete comfort, fabulous service and a beautiful decor, convenient location and a fabulous art collection to top it off!",5,2016,08,24
200,"Great Hotel , but....",Be sure you ask for a room above the first floor. This hotel is truly 5 star in the service and lobby but our room on the first floor garden view was meh. We had a super view of a bush in front of the window and the room itself lacked polish.,4,2016,08,24
200,A diamond in the city,"The Merrion Hotel offers not only a fantastic location, but staff efficiency and friendliness that are world class. If you ever feel in a bad mood, just pass through the Merrion Hotel, they will lift your mood for the rest of the day.. the facilities are truly amazing, with cleanliness and comfort first. Not to mention the impeccable Art collection and the interior design. Its a pleasure to stay in this hotel. Food in the Cellar Restaurant is fantastic too, portion sizes are good and selection is broad.",5,2016,08,24
200,Over the top,"The Merrion hotel exceeded all our expectations. The staff is very friendly, If you ask about something, they take you to it, rather than telling you how to find it. It is that way with everything.   The rooms are beautiful and very well appointed.  We have stayed there twice, and hope to go back again.",5,2016,08,24
200,Tea for two,"My wife and I enjoyed afternoon Tea at the Merrion which turned out to be a pleasant experience, though I must confess that we were a little underwhelmed, this may be due to the high expectations we had based on the Merrion's reputation compared to other Hotels of equal ranking.
Reception was warm and welcoming and we were quickly shown to our table in the Drawing rooms, tasteful decor and interesting artwork, waiting staff were professional and extremely attentive.
Savouries, Cakes and pastries were beautifully prepared and delicious accompanied by a great selection of Teas, as I said, a very pleasurable experience marred only by the fact that the Drawing rooms appear to be part of the main passage way for guests.
A constant stream of people on their way to or from their rooms had to walk through the Drawing Rooms to reach their destination, in essence, it really was like taking Tea in a corridor.
It is human nature to be aware of ones surroundings so we felt that we were being scrutinized at every opportunity by passing guests, this made us feel quite distracted from being able to enjoy our surroundings in comfort and some degree of privacy.
As Afternoon Tea goes, this experience was good enough to  warrant a very good rating,however, a little under the mark for an excellent experience.
I guess the quote that you can't please all of the people all of the time rings true.",4,2016,08,24
200,Fabulous hotel! Love it!!,"The merrion hotel in the heart of Dublin city is a hidden diamond. A beautiful quaint we'll run hotel. It almost feels like home yet oozes luxury, class and elegance at the same time. Staying st this hotel is a treat I well deserve. I love it! I love the ambiance, the decor, the stately feel and superior feel of this hotel.",5,2016,08,23
200,"Gracious, traditional and unpretentious","Chose the Merrion for first stay in Dublin because it was strongly recommended by travel agent and was top rated hotel in TripAdvisor. All of the advance billing was accurate. We booked a garden wing room with a city view. View was nothing special (rooftops) but did not expect more. Room was quite large by European standards and bathroom was huge, very traditional look in fixtures but all very modern.

Location is excellent, walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street and a hop on/hop off bus stop right nearby for any farther excursions. A concierge (Alicia) was very helpful in recommending when to schedule our various admissions so as to beat the crowds and make use of the hop on bus route and schedule. She also printed the various site admission tickets for us.

Decor is restrained traditional: muted colors, traditional furniture and fixtures, and Impeccably maintained. All very tasteful and tranquil.

Ate at the Cellar restaurant the first night as we knew jet lag would be catching up with us, we ate early and I think there were more restaurant workers than diners at that early hour but the restaurant did fill up at more normal dining times. Food and wine choices were very good and reasonably priced, especially for such a highly rated hotel.

Did the 23 Bar each of the 3 nights before heading to room, wonderfully relaxing. 

Also did the high tea one day and although all the tea sandwiches and pastries are small, it is a lot of food, do not plan on much of a dinner that evening, if any dinner at all.

The various drawing rooms are lovely and relaxing any time of day. The service is wonderful and there is obvious pride among those working for the hotel. 

Spa looked lovely and tranquil but we did not use the facilities, as this was the first time in Dublin and we had only two full and two partial days, there just was not time for everything.

The art collection is an added plus for anyone with an interest. The audio guide was worth doing, especially the interview with the sculptor of the hotel's statue of James Joyce (in the garden) and for those who book the 'art tea' there is a complementary copy of a book about the eclectic art collection.

Wifi connection was easy, always available, and fast.

Realize that we benefitted from strong dollar on this trip, but my impression is that the hotel offers service and ambience very similar to top hotels in higher priced cities (London, Paris) but at a much more reasonable price.",5,2016,08,23
200,Beautiful hotel in a Georgian Terrace,"My mother and I stayed at the Merrion for two nights in August and loved it. We were in a room in the the main building, that faced out onto the street  and it was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is absolutely beautiful, with great art on display. Our room was spacious and the bathroom had great Purple Water toiletries. The hotel is in a great location and many good restaurants and attractions are within walking distance. It was a real treat to stay in such a historical place. 

We also had massages at the spa which were wonderful as well- I highly recommend this as a great way to beat jet lag!",5,2016,08,23
200,Drenched in luxury,"I was sold on this place as soon as a dude in a top hat greeted our car at the front door. From then on it was utter and endless delight. Our room was massive and gorgeous, with a cozy seating area, separate dressing room, and beautiful modern bathroom with a giant tub where I took the most relaxing bath. (There was also a bidet, but I did not take a bath in that.) I was especially tickled by the antique chairs and Chinoiserie drapes and upholstery, which were old-fashioned and feminine without being cloying or frilly. There was some construction happening in the courtyard outside our window, but not enough to ruin the lovely landscaped gardens, and the noise never bothered us. The drapes kept the room so dark we slept until almost noon one day.

Did I mention the complimentary fruit plate and champagne awaiting our arrival? The prompt, attentive room service? The dedicated tea kettle? (I hate making tea in a coffee pot.) The Yeats illustrations on the walls? Oh, and the location: right smack dab in the heart of Dublin, a short walk from anything you'd want to see. 

So yeah, this place. I can see why it's #1 in Dublin. I can't imagine ever wanting to stay anywhere else.",5,2016,08,22
200,Exquisite .. Dublin's finest !!!,"The first thing I would say about this hotel is the staff are simply amazing and will ensure your stay in Dublin is unforgettable .. The hotel has been tastefully restored with an amazing art collection and beautiful tea rooms and relaxation areas. Rooms are modern, wifi excellent, breakfast is a culinary experience and once again .. The staff are attentive without being overbearing at all times. Great location , beautiful pool.. Nice bar at basement level .. The only slight negative is the gum is a little bit poky .. Definitely will stay here again ..",5,2016,08,20
200,Top Class,"I always stay at the Merrion when I visit Dublin on business. The rooms are very comfortable, the staff accommodating without being over familiar, the surroundings are very pleasant and the catering good quality. It's not cheap, but any time I have ventured anywhere else instead enticed by a deal I always wish I had stayed at the Merrion. Definitely the best hotel experience overall in Dublin.",5,2016,08,18
200,Delightful,This hotel was top notch. Excellent service. Professional friendly staff took care of all our needs. Beautiful room with amenities . Very clean and top quality linens . Breakfast in our room was wonderful . Would recommend this hotel for a great stay in Dublin.,5,2016,08,17
200,5 Stars all the way,"One of the finer hotels we have stayed. tremendous customer service and in a great location. Wonderful restaurant. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Elegant, but not stuffy, feel. Did I say how great the staff was?",5,2016,08,17
200,Oasis of calm in a busy city,We have stayed in The Merrion hotel a number of times and have always found it to be very luxurious and relaxing place to stay. The staff are professional and friendly and the facilities are first class. It has a lovely old world feel in modern city.,5,2016,08,17
200,Business Only,"This Hotel is used by Corporate Big Wigs, i.e. CEO’s, Hedge Fund Managers and those on business.  While the rooms and furnishings are of a high quality, the Hotel has a very formal atmosphere and service culture which, in my view, borders on stuffy.  Rather ironically, in some areas the service wasn’t as polished as one would have expected.  For example, for the third night of my stay I asked for my bed linen to be changed (as I was having difficulty sleeping and was uncomfortable) but this did not occur.  In the Drawing Room Bar one evening, the Barman made an elementary mistake by trying to cool a pint glass by placing ice cubes inside it.  I had to intervene and advise him not to do so because this leaves a wet residue which results in a flat pint.

As for the Hotel catering, despite all the promotion, I thought it was mediocre.  The emphasis was on presentation and service rather than the actual food.  Breakfast was insubstantial and expensive at €29 a head.  (Incidentally, breakfast was not included in the Corporate Room rate which was €210 during my stay.)  The one evening meal I had was reasonable but not outstanding.  As for the room service catering after 10pm, the quality of the dish I ordered was poor. 

I did try the swimming pool but while it was heated, I thought it wasn’t as warm as those found at traditional Health Spas.  If one is considering staying here for a romantic weekend, I would recommend asking for a room facing the central garden.  My room faced Fitzwilliam Lane and the vista consisted of an industrial cherry picker!  This said, the room was very quiet.  So to conclude, not a great stay due to the minor niggles.",3,2016,08,16
200,Stunning hotel in prime location,"I can't imagine having a better hotel experience than our stay at The Merrion. Although we were only in Dublin one night, The Merrion exceeded expectations and I'd highly recommend it. It's stunningly beautiful, yet very comfortable, with friendly, efficient service. Food was fantastic, ambience beautiful, and I hope to return again for a longer stay.",5,2016,08,16
200,Stay Here,"The Merrion Hotel is the place to stay in Dublin.  The service and rooms are all top notch.  Each person was well informed, pleasant to deal with and always courteous.  The location is superb which makes it very easy to get to the site of the city.",5,2016,08,16
200,Perfect,"We have stayed many times here over the past 24 months and usually for 2 nights as a little break away from the madding crowd that are our kids! It's simply divine just to roll up your car is taken, then your bags to the room....everything so seamless friendly without over familiarity and ultra professional. You are also in the middle of the city with Grafton St a mere 5 minute walk and everything is at your door step should you wish to leave the hotel....we didn't except to venture out for food on Saturday night and couldn't wait to get back to the sanctuary of the hotel....sanctuary is a good description of The Merrion. ",5,2016,08,15
200,Wonderful stay,"Stayed for a weekend for my husbands 40th birthday and from the moment I booked it I knew it would be a special occasion.  The correspondence with the concierge was efficient and all special requests were dealt with promptly.  Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite, the room was incredible and the bed so comfortable, it was indeed a special treat.  The staff in the hotel are so helpful without being intrusive, it is something to be proud of.  the staff wherever we went seemed to know it was my husbands birthday and we received a number of special treats.  the hotel itself is unique and did not disappoint.  Thank you for a memorable weekend.",5,2016,08,15
200,Quintessential Dublin,Best hotel in town if you are looking for the history of Dublin mixed with great modernity. Wonderful staff and service and the absolutely perfect location. Will continue to return on my next visit. Don't forget the theatra spa or the irish breakfasts!,5,2016,08,14
200,What every hotel should strive to be,"This hotel was amazing in every way. Comfortable rooms, amazing attentive service and all the amenities. The property itself is wonderful but it s truly the staff that make this a world class hotel. From the moment you arrive you just simply worry about nothing. They have a lovely so attached that was easy to get an appointment for and the Cellar restaurant was excellent. ",5,2016,08,14
200,Lovely stay at the Merrion,"Spent two nights at the Merrion.  Room was spacious, bed very comfortable, staff attentive and plentiful.  Location couldn't be better for exploring Dublin.  I would agree with some other reviews that bathroom layout should be better for a hotel of this caliber and 2 sinks is certainly standard across much of the world now in 4 stars.  View from the room was unappealing too so we just kept curtains closed.  Overall it was a good stay but felt a step down due to these issues than similarly priced Mandarin Orientals or such that we've stayed in.  Would still recommend.  ",4,2016,08,14
200,Great location but for the money ?,The Merrion is in a great Location and has all the bells and whistles. However I was annoyed at the fact that they take a credit card deposit of €100 per night and then further to that take what appears to be a random further amount which in our case was a further €50. In our case that was not a problem but imagine if you required these funds for your trip! They would be frozen for about a week.,3,2016,08,11
200,Very poor laundry service,"Traveling with two kids, staying here for 5 nights towards the end of our Ireland trip, and needed to get some laundry done.  This is a 5 star hotel so you would think they'd have something reasonable worked out for the guests.  Using the in house service would have cost over $500 for a single bag of laundry (just freaking irresponsible and ridiculous pricing).  I asked the concierge what options were available and he confirmed that the hotel service was a ridiculous option and recommended a laundry place about 6 blocks away (same place I found on google).  So I'm in a 5 star hotel and having to haul a suitcase of laundry six blocks away?  I've been in other hotels on this trip that had laundry solutions.  Merrion - figure it out.",2,2016,08,11
200,Not quite 5 star,"There are lots of great things about the Merrion..the location, the service, the comfortable bed, the lovely decor of the room, and the updated bathroom.  However, there were some peculiar things...our room looked over an alley way.  We were located on the first floor so there were lots of people walking right by our window in the alley...just a bit odd for a high end hotel.  And, although the bathroom was updated, there was only one sink.  And, there was no counter space.  The only place for toiletries was an odd alcove over the toilet...yuck!!  And, the housekeeping kept rearranging our toiletries...note to housekeeping - please leave my stuff alone!!  Also, the breakfast dining room is like a cave...a room with a view, even just some daylight would be much more enjoyable.",3,2016,08,11
200,Simply the Best,"We have travelled extensively and rarely if ever experienced such fine service and amenities as at The Merrion.  From the porters at the curb to the desk personnel to the housekeepers and waiters, everyone was so nice and attentive.  We can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2016,08,11
200,Classic and recommendable hotel,"Very good hotel with excellent staff. The premises are classic and well decorated and take you back in time. We had a very satisfactory experience. The staff is very proffessional, nice and really helpful. The hotel is well located, close to several highlights in the city",4,2016,08,11
200,The Merrion,"The Merrion offfered blissful relaxation after a long flight, comfortable surroundings, delicious food and fabulous concierge who helped us get around the city.  Staff were friendly and knowledgeable, the room suited all of our needs (love having nespresso in room) and the private art collection and courtyard was gorgeous.",5,2016,08,10
200,Superb in Every way,"The Merrion Hotel was a delight from the moment we stepped out of our car at the doorway until we got into our car to leave. We've travelled all over the world and rarely experienced this level of service we got at the Merrion.  Along with the service come great facilities and all of the extra touches, including the most comfortable slippers ever!",5,2016,08,10
200,Loud Construction Site outside Window of Hotel,Everything at the hotel was lovely apart from the 7am start of construction outside our window which negated the possibility of a lie-in. Food was tasty in the restaurant and cocktails were enjoyable. The check-in and check-out went smoothly and the staff were professional.,4,2016,08,10
200,Lovely hotel but a few niggles!,"The hotel is in a quiet location and walking distance to most of the attractions - we arrived at lunchtime from London - check-in time is 3 so didn't expect to go to our room until then although the majority of hotels we visit can accommodate us earlier. We were told the room would not be ready until 3.30 as the previous occupants had a late check-out but the room was not ready unitl 4.  A bottle of wine was left in our room later as a way of apology but the unopened bottle was removed the next day!

We left our cases on day of departure as we had a late flight but it took 15 minutes to retrieve them which mean a rush to the airport.

These comments maybe sound petty but at nearly 400 euros a night it was not the best service and we have experienced better.  That said, the staff were very friendly.",4,2016,08,09
200,Art and first class service,"The Merrion Hotel surpassed all our expectations. The service was unbelievable. Every staff member we would pass would give us a very friendly greeting.
When we had High Tea, the server described in detail the staggering number of pastries and sandwiches. The coup de grace was when the dessert arrived which was three confections that looked liked three of the works of art hanging on the hotel wall - again described in detail. The hotel actually has an art tour complete with  an audio guide. Even so the concierge still explained to us the highlights of the tour. When going around the hotel perusing the various paintings, the staff would go out of their way to duck under us so as to not disturb our view - even when we were in the middle of the dining lounge! 

We plan to go back to the Merrion Hotel as soon as possible!",5,2016,08,09
200,Absolutely the best hotel in Dublin.,"What a wonderful experience!  The Staff is superb, the rooms exceptional (with the most delightfully comfortable beds and bedding), and the food excellent.  Have a Guinness in the Cellar Bar for a quiet and relaxing moment.",5,2016,08,08
200,Perfect,"The absolute creme de la creme of afternoon tea experiences. Wonderful selection of treats and also herbal teas which often isn't the case when having afternoon tea. The setting is amazing and the service fantastic. We finished off the afternoon with a glass of bubbly and a wander around the hotel to view the art collection, just wonderful.",5,2016,08,08
200,Suffering through renovations!,"Although the Merrion warned us in advance about ongoing construction, and there was little noise during our time there, our overall experience was far less enjoyable than our prior visit there.  

The public rooms are dark, overcrowded and poorly ventilated (apparently lacking air conditioning), rendering them uninviting for a drink after a day of touring.  The only outdoor patio had very few tables and we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated there.  

We had difficulty utilizing the concierge service effectively en route due to spotty cell service in Ireland.....suggest you make arrangements far in advance to avoid disappointment.  And despite advertising that suggests special access to reservations at the Michelin starred restaurant on site (Patrick Guillaud) - the concierge was unable to get us a reservation there anytime during our stay.  The head concierge did go out of his way to get us a table at DAX, a good French restaurant in the neighborhood.

The garden wing rooms were delightful - - air conditioned, with all new bathrooms, furniture and especially well equipped.  When the new wing, across the garden, is complete one can expect even more of the same.    It is very difficult to find your way around the hotel because of the configuration of the levels, covered walkways and wings - but we figured it out.",4,2016,08,08
200,The best in Dublin,"Excellent hotel.  Lovely rooms, great staff and wonderful art collection.  Traditional with a contemporary twist.  Great part of town and close to all the attractions.  Wonderful pint of Guinness in the bar!  so nice to find a hotel with an outside space, especially in the summer.",5,2016,08,08
200,Lovely stay at the merrion,Very enjoyable stay at the merrion. Location was fantastic close to city centre. The room was very nice and extremely comfortable. Always nice to have a nespresso machine in the room not all hotels have this. All in all a very charming Hotel and staff.,5,2016,08,07
200,Five Star for a reason,"From the moment you arrive you are treated as royalty.  I will be honest and say we were not necessarily dressed the part (we dress down for flights) but were treated as though we were the most important guests at the hotel.  Our room was not ready, but we arrived early in the morning.  They kindly stored our bags so that we could have a cup of coffee in the stately drawing room and explore the city a bit.  The rooms are impeccably clean and provide every amenity.  Beds are like sleeping on a cloud.  We did not use the spa but it looked gorgeous. Food is wonderful, coffee is top notch.  I cannot find one single fault with our two night stay.  Even if you are staying in the hotel I highly recommend just having high tea.  An absolutely wonderful choice for our first trip to Dublin. Fantastic.",5,2016,08,07
200,The top hotel in Dublin by far,"Drove here straight from the airport and was impressed from the moment we arrived.
The doorman was quick to take my car and gather luggage and usher us through to the check-in desk.
Staff were fabulous- smiling , engaging and friendly and from the doorman , concierge staff and reception desk as well as the housekeeping staff - could not be faulted.
It is a little out of the main drag in Dublin - but this is too it's advantage. Good local bars and restaurants within walking distance as well as all important amenities.
The room was great and the bedding perfect for a rest after a hectic walling trip around central Dublin.
A great place to start or finish a trip to Ireland",5,2016,08,06
200,Can't improve on perfect.,"Our stay at the Merrion was so enjoyable. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed by every single member of the staff. It was as if our needs were anticipated and everyone seemed to take pleasure in being cheerful, helpful and gracious hosts. The room was well appointed and comfortable. We both slept so well and we had everything we needed. We had a Nespresso machine in our room and the bath products are my new favorite. I'm looking for them to buy in the US. 
Above all was the service from the spa staff to the doormen. All charming. Thank you",5,2016,08,04
200,lovely stay at the Merrion,"Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. The service was excellent, the sheets soft, the bed comfortable, and the hotel itself is very accommodating. I arrived early and was so pleased that I was given a room right away.",5,2016,08,04
200,Very nice hotel with excellent service,Classy hotel with sedate furnishings as well as excellent and discreet service. Spacy and clean rooms with two!! racks for the luggage and adequate wardrobes. If we once come back to Dublin we would stay at The Meerion again.,5,2016,08,04
200,Great Hotel in Dublin,"We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.  With the quality of the facilities and the excellent service from the staff, our time at the hotel was exemplary.  Most impressive was the professionalism, courtesy, friendliness, and helpfulness of the staff.  They truly made our stay memorable!",5,2016,08,04
200,Outstanding,"We started our vacation in july with a three night stay at The Merrion. This was by far one of the best Hotel experiences we ever had. We felt entirely taken care of us as we arrived in front of the Hotel through check-out. Everyone of the staff did the best for making our stay unforgettable. A special wish? No problem at all. Just ask and the staff will fix it. If you travel with children you can smoothly stay at The Merrion. Our children really enjoyed the small gifts and attention they got.
No need to say that the entire property is well kept, nice and clean. This Hotel absolutely merits beeing part of the leading hotels of the world.",5,2016,08,04
200,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights with family.  Very nice hotel & wonderful service.  Layout of the building is a bit confusing.  Had drinks at the bar, which was lovely.  Used the gym, which was small but efficient.  No chance to use spa unfortunately.",4,2016,08,01
200,The Merrion Hotel Dublin,"We throughly enjoyed our stay here in Dublin, location is good as its near to shops and pubs aswell as Museums and public transport. Hotel is amazing and food quality is outstanding, staff are efficient and attentive. If your looking for the perfect stay then you have it all here to experience.",5,2016,08,01
200,Lovely Hotel; Fantastic Hospitality,"You will find The Merrion in Dublin on most lists of fine hotels.  It's a lovely set of Gerogian townhouses, beautifully maintained and decorated, in a great location within walking distance to fine pubs and restaurants as well as many of Dublin's attractions.  It has all of the amenities you would expect in a fine hotel-  large rooms, incredibly comfortable beds, great restaurants and a spa.  There is also a 'hop on/hop off' bus stop on the block that covers most of Dublin's primary tourist attractions.  Their afternoon tea is a lovely experience from another era; and it is worth buying the bed/breakfast package, as breakfast is a gourmet feast that will carry you through dinner.   What really sets The Merrion apart, however, is the incredible level of personalized and attentive service-   defining what the word 'hospitality' used to mean.  Whether it's an accommodation to check in a bit early after arriving on an overnight flight... to the waiter who hunted down a dessert for me when I noted that it was on the room service menu but not the restaurant's... to the turn down service that includes a filled ice bucket every night....everyone gives the impression of a genuine interest in exceeding expectations.  I spent two weeks traveling in Ireland and experienced some other fine hotels-  but none compared to my experience at The Merrion.",5,2016,07,28
200,Hard to fault,"This is a lovely hotel in every respect. Do not hesitate to book here for your stay in Dublin. I was staying with my daughter and her family: the children were also made very welcome. I thought the service was particularly good- matter of fact and kind. Would recommend the afternoon tea and the swimming pool, but not in that order! Scraping the barrel for something to criticise, but I prefer single lever taps. That's all!!",5,2016,07,28
200,The Exceptional Merrion Hotel,"Our stay was wonderful from start to finish in being greeted by such friendliness, we all felt as if we were being greeted by dear friends.  The rooms were calm and peaceful. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance to so many wonderful and historical places: Christ's Church, St. Steven's Green, Jameson Distillery, Guinness Storehouse, Brazen Head Pub, Dublin Castle and St. Patrick's Cathedral. It's the perfect hotel!!",5,2016,07,28
200,Outstanding Dublin hotel,"The Merrion is a fantastic and lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. The staff is warm and friendly, the building itself is wonderful, and the proximity to all the things you want to do is perfect.  This hotel has the look and feel of a Ritz Carlton, with the staff to match. Food options are nice as well, from tea in the drawing room, to a pint in the Cellar Bar, to a nice dinner in the Cellar. Our suite was perfect!",5,2016,07,28
200,First Class Hotel Experience,"Our first visit to Dublin. Helpful Concierge assisted with restaurant reservations and points of interest so we could preplan our visit in advance of our stay. All the front desk, restaurant, valet and concierge staff were pleasant and friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were great, and the bar food was tasty.",5,2016,07,28
200,Second time in this stunning hotel,"I had stayed at the Merrion briefly a couple of years ago and wanted to make a return trip. The hotel is extremely well located and is indeed deserving of it's 5 stars. The rooms and bathrooms are outstanding and the food is very good. We ate at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant for lunch and it was a wonderful meal. Overall,only a couple of minor glitches; the hotel was undergoing some construction and I was unaware of that. However, the noise was not much of a problem. Breakfast in the dining room was a bit tricky. While the waiter was very friendly and helpful, I was forgotten each morning I had breakfast and had to ask repeatedly for my juice, water, tea and toast. The restaurant was very busy, so perhaps this was the reason. Overall, this was a terrific stay and I hope to return. A bonus....the hotel has an incredible artwork collection.",5,2016,07,28
200,"Perfect location, close to everything.","We only spent two nights and ate our dinner out at the wonderful restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Did eat breakfast at the hotel. It was a large delightful start to the day. The hotel staff is professional, very charming and helpful. Our room was comfortable and pleasant. The inner courtyard was a blaze of colour and a sight to behold. If afternoon high tea is your thing this is the place to enjoy the atmosphere and see the beautiful ladies graceful enjoying their tea and cakes. Tried the bar for an after dinner nightcap, it is in keeping with hotels decor, certainly not an Irish Pub.",4,2016,07,27
200,Excellent hotel and service!,"We had the pleasure of spending a night in this lovely hotel recently. What can I say? We had the most wonderful stay, the staff were so friendly and welcoming, (big thank to  Niamh  on reception) Very helpful and mannerly.  Hopefully we will get to stay here again in the not so distance future!",5,2016,07,27
200,Old world charm,Enjoyed the stay. Must have their Irish cofee (a bit costly but worth it for a treat). Bathroom showers very tight and hard to get in and out. Bedroom nice and comfortable. Having snacks and cocktails at the lobby bar is a must when you get home from a night on the town. Get the toasties. They're awesome.,4,2016,07,23
200,Great location and customer service ,"This is our third stay at the Merrion. We love the location, close to St. Stephan's Green, and a short walk to Trinity College.
The breakfast is amazing. There is a pool for children 12 and over.  The door man and front desk were quick to help with taxis, and anything else we needed. We had 2 triple connecting rooms to accommodate  our family of 6. Be aware that the hotel is currently under construction. We had a garden room and it was very noisy during the day from 8am-5pm. Mr. Malik, the customer service manager, offered to move our room as soon as something became available. During our stay 2 years prior, we left our money and passports in the safe. The hotel called us as soon as the cleaning staff discovered the items. The Merrion held our items  until we could return to get them. To this day, we are grateful to the Merrion and staff for their honesty and integrity.  I highly recommend the Merrion.",5,2016,07,23
200,Boutique Luxury and walking distance to restaurants and shops,"2 days in Dublin at the Merrion.  Upon arrival we went to the spa until our room was ready.  The spa staff was very accommodating.  We had dinner at the restaurant - great fish and chips.  The room was nice, but we should have upgraded to the lovely garden view.  We were within a 10 minute walk of the shops and restaurants.",5,2016,07,23
200,Incredible Hotel,"Without the best the best service based hotel I have stayed in.

It seems this hotel has got back to the classic days of people always there ... there wasn't a time when I was in any of the public parts of the hotel and didn't see a member of staff. They were everywhere, always saying good morning, asking how you were.

The hotel itself was elegant, a little old school in it's decor, a little like your grandparents lounge, except with comfortable chairs.

There were some physical improvements going on with parts of the building, but we couldn't hear anything from our room.

The rooms were very spacious, had a bath and enclosed shower and the bed was incredibly comfortable to sleep in. The blackout curtains were great and supported in the great sleeps we had.

The maid service was fantastic. They went above and beyond every day of our 5 nights there.

The location was very convenient to the city centre, to St Stevens Green, to Merrian Park. Walking distance to many places and without a doubt a highlight of the trip.

I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2016,07,23
200,First Class,"This hotel is the finest in Dublin. The building is beautiful and furnished with style. The staff are exceptional and the location perfect for most of Dublin's main attractions. The pool is large, indoors and heated (important in a country with little sunshine even in Summer). The rooms are all very nice, but it is worth stretching to a suite if you can. They are exceptional.",5,2016,07,23
200,Merrion is spectacular,"We visited Dublin in March 2015.  It was a delightful city.  This hotel was wonderful.  The front desk was most friendly, the room was spacious and bigger than expected given our experience with European hotels.  The bed was extremely comfortable, everything was top notch. If we return to Dublin, we will most definitely stay at this excellent facility.  We had dinner downstairs which was wonderful, as well as the amazing art that adorns the walls.  Their collection was virtually another art museum under our own roof.  It is an A+++ hotel.",5,2016,07,21
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed strong, in any city or country. Many 5 star hotels have a great physical plant - great lobby, wonderful rooms, etc and The Merrion is no exception in this regard. What sets this hotel apart is its location and staff. I thought the location was perfect. Close to everything you would want to do yet not in the middle of it. The staff was exceptional, from front desk to housekeeping to the concierge to the restaurants. Special kudos to Patrick who has been there since the hotel opened. He was so helpful in taking care of all of our needs. The Cellar Restaurant was excellent. Outstanding service and great food. If you are looking for the best hotel in Dublin, this is it.",5,2016,07,21
200,Elegance in Dublin,"We have stayed here 3 times now and we have had such a great experence each time.
From the moment you enter you feel at home, The staff are so helpful and the service is impeccable.
The rooms are nicely furnished with the most comfortable beds! I'm glad to see that this year they have improved their wifi and television selections.
The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to Grafton St and on Baggot St there are numerous great pubs and restaurants. Last year we had breakfast downstairs one morning and it's well worth the splurge!",5,2016,07,21
200,"Opulence,  splendor and popping chocolate candy! ","Superb hotel, great Central location and a very nice outside area during the 5 days of sun we were lucky to have experienced in Ireland at the time. Nothing was too much trouble,  even when being a chocoholic took its devil horns out as the bar was closing and they bought us some superb popping candy chocolate!! amazing and always with a smile. The room was clean and tidy and very nice, although I did liken the space to the 'cupboard under the stairs', in Harry Potter. The view was that of grubby back end streets so decided to keep the shades drawn and think of my own dreamy view....Not Mr Clooney, but something along the lines of celtic parks. 
Only thing I would say they really could do with improving is the sausages that resemble rubber and could easily amuse a young child by being bounced off a wall. Don't worry we didn't try it. The rosti.....mmmm not sure I would call it that, more like a hockey puck with ragged edges, and that stuff can seriously kill a duck if you attempted to try, but clearly as tempting as that may be, I would only reserve that pastime for a select few. ",5,2016,07,21
200,Top Class,"The Merrion is within walking distance of pedestrian Grafton st, museums & Trinity College Dublin. It's in a fabulous area of Georgian style Dublin & as a city centre hotel it's the best. It reminds me of Claridges London with the elegance & attention to detail you won't get anywhere else. A class apart. 
We dined at the cellar bar which was casual & good. Good service.
Breakfast in the vaulted ceiling dining room was buffet style &'hot items by order from the kitchen. 
I believe Patrick Guibaud's restaurant at the merrion is excellent but I haven't had the pleasure of dining there. 
All in all it was fabulous, I'd like to go back & experience it again. It's the best , it's the most expensive too but it's an experience. ",5,2016,07,20
200,"Great Location, Wonderful Staff","We loved our stay at the Merrion.  The location is in the upscale government area, so you will feel very safe.  Many of the nearby restaurants and shops close early (6PM) but its not too far of a walk to the more touristy areas.  Also there is a great pub/restaurant in the hotel.  Just walk past where you eat breakfast to get to the quaint pub area.  The prices are much less and we actually enjoyed the ambiance and food more here.

There is an upscale restaurant on site as well 'The Patrick Guilbaud' we ate here and it was a real treat.  Presentation and food all top, top notch!

The rooms themselves were very comfortable, and the hotel has a charming feel about it.  The staff was all great.  I forgot my Ipad at the end of a long trip, and they mailed it back to the USA for me at no cost, with no complaints.  

If we visit Dublin again (which we really enjoyed) we would be quick to stay at the Merrion!",5,2016,07,20
200,The best place to stay in Dublin,"My wife and I had the pleasure to stay for four nights at this wonderful Hotel. The staff is very friendly and cannot do enough to please. The room was very clean and well appointed.The location is walking distance to everything and your every need is fulfilled with warmth and a smile.The management does a wonderful job in hiring the finest employees and stays on top of the smallest details.Thanks for making our stay at The Merrion a memorable experience, this will be our go to place to stay when in Dublin.       P.S Stop by the Cellar bar and meet Eamonn who helped us navigate the city and treated us like royalty.",5,2016,07,18
200,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at the Merrion with other members of my family; it's in a prime location.   The hotel is attractive and our rooms were spacious.  The service is excellent, and employees made me believe they care about the comfort of the guests.   Beds are very comfortable, and pillows are soft.   Our rooms were very quiet at night--and even during the day, for that matter.    We had a suite with an extra bedroom adjoining.   The bedroom was quite warm during our entire stay; we could not adjust it to cool even at night.  The living/dining area of the adjoining suite was cold.   I assume they have issues with the air conditioning system.
Our breakfasts were varied, service was prompt, and everything was fresh and tasty.   We also had one evening meal there which was a delight.    Our afternoon tea was a disappointment.   I've had tea in many places in the world, and this was certainly not a stellar one.  The service was poor (the only poor, or even mediocre service we had at the Merrion) and the food offerings were ordinary.  
The Merrion offers many luxuries, but misses in some areas.",4,2016,07,17
200,Merrion hotel,Had a delightful stay at the merrion hotel! Staff went out of their way to be accommodating.  Room very pleasant clean neat and very comfy bed. I ate mostly at bar in cellar food and drink yummy. I would definitely stay again when going to Dublin!!,5,2016,07,16
200,Not worth the price,"The passageway to room 127 which we were in was certainly not elegant and was reminiscent of an airport. The room itself was on the small side (we did not receive Virtuoso upgrade).  It was nothing special. 

The senior concierge was less knowledgable about Dublin than the taxi drivers we had.

The toilet in the room required several minutes to refill between flushes.  Housekeeping did not replace the burnt out fluorescent bathroom bulb.

The hotel staff were more distant and less friendly than at other Ireland hotels.

Overall, a nice stay, but I think there are better choices in Dublin. ",3,2016,07,16
200,Beautiful,"came here with my daughter in March, to celebrate St. Patricks Day, what a great place to visit, walking distance from the city and scenic places.  Love the stay, you could walk out and have a coffee and enjoy the city.",5,2016,07,16
200,Great art work,"I'm new to trip advisor so the date isn't correct. 
This is an amazing hotel. We booked 2 rooms and were upgraded to to a massive suite at no extra charge. We had 2 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms, and a large living rooms connecting the rooms. Each room was spacious. The decor is a bit old but clean and the beds were comfortable. 
There is beautiful art work through out the hotel. They are known for having one of the largest private collections. 
The is tea served daily at the hotel. I recommend you make reservations for it. 
The service was wonderful and the staff go out of their way to help. ",5,2016,07,15
200,HIGH TEA,"Although we stayed at a different hotel in Dublin, we pre-booked a HIGH TEA here at the Merrion. The hotel caters to those who can afford the best things in life. However, we were treated as guests as we waited for our tea to be served. The food at this tea was AMAZING!! The initial presentation was the 3-tiered service of finger sandwiches, scones and cakes. Our choice of teas was from a long list and they encouraged us to try as many as possible. When we thought we could not eat another bite, they brought out 3 specialty desserts that were a delight to the eye as well as palate!! The Chef's inspiration came from the amazing artwork within the hotel. The service was impeccable........until the end when our 2 attentive servers disappeared. We had to catch the attention of a different server in order to get a final cup of tea. It seems our servers were taking ""a little rest"". It did not dampen our experience. We would HIGHLY recommend this tea service!!!!",5,2016,07,15
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"You're not going to meet people more accommodating and gracious anywhere and it's not just the occasional person here or there, but rather the ENTIRE STAFF.   Location is great--walkable to everything.   The expansion, currently in progress (but we were never even slightly inconvenienced by it), will enhance an already beautiful, historic property.  This is a true 5 star experience.  Would return in a heart beat.",5,2016,07,15
200,Luxurious and friendly,"We stayed in this hotel for about a week.  The room was comfortable and lovely as were the public rooms.  The public rooms were particularly busy at teatime.  There is a cosy bar open round the clock.  The staff which comes from all over the world are very well trained and very friendly.  They are also efficient.  A stained tie came back from dry cleaning in a few hours and looked better than new.  Even though Dublin resembles a construction zone, we felt as though we were in an oasis.  My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel with no reservations.",5,2016,07,14
200,Truly One of the Best Hotels,"Stayed at The Merrion for one night (sadly that's all we booked). I wish I could have taken advantage of all the hotel had to offer. We did take advantage of the following though: the rooms are large and luxurious, full of amenities (robe, slippers), great soaking tub. The bar is cozy and the service is unbeatable. Front desk is fantastic. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay lovely. There is no other place I will stay when I am in Dublin in the future. Unbeatable.",5,2016,07,14
200,Just lovely,A beautiful hotel well located with excellent service. Please ask for a high floor. We were on the first level affording a view of a bush. The location is perfect for sights and walking. The lobby is stunning. Tea looked great though we were too busy to try it.,5,2016,07,14
200,great,"Amazing place! the room are clean and really big. It's a real charming hotel! If you like tea... you have to try the afternoon tea! the staff is very kind,here are many conveniences for business travelers like me",5,2016,07,14
200,The Merrion Exceeded Our Expectations,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion Hotel for two nights before an 11-day ""Vagabond"" tour of Ireland, and one evening before heading home.  It was the most delightful hotel experience we have ever had.  First off, we were upgraded to an AMAZING suite the first two nights (we had superior king third night), and were treated like royalty.  The hotel is impeccably clean; It literally sparkles!  The staff was friendly, courteous, professional and catered to our every need.  The amenities in the rooms are lovely.  The bed linens and comforter were crisp white with monograms. The bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable and cozy.  The bathrooms were equally impressive and immaculate, from the wonderful shower to the Asprey bath products and fluffy white towels and bathrobes (also monogrammed).
We enjoyed a scrumptious, bountiful Irish breakfast each morning in the Cellar Restaurant. It is an elegant hotel with charming ambiance, situated in the heart of Dublin. If you stay here, you will not be disappointed!",5,2016,07,13
200,Our first stop in Ireland. Lovely hotel,Great location. Amazing service. True five star. Very easy to get cabs outside. (Cab drivers in Ireland couldn't the nicer or more informative.) Have tea or snack in drawing room. Breakfast was fantastic. Scrambled eggs were done to perfection. Smoked salmon delicious. Rooms were very nice. Bed was too good..it was hard to get up! Really enjoyed our Dublin stay. ,5,2016,07,12
200,Afternoon Tea!,"Myself and my friends went here for Afternoon tea, the hotel is fab! From the minute we walked in the door the service friendly and helpful and the menu for afternoon tea was amazing! Food was so tasty and so well presented! Very relaxed atmosphere, could have stayed for hours! Will definately return! 😀",5,2016,07,12
200,Fantastic Experience,"Had a great stay at the Merrion - we were here last year for our honeymoon and loved it so much we just had to return for our 1-year anniversary. The rooms are well appointed and cozy, and housekeeping does an excellent job cleaning and tidying up the room. The drawing rooms are a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a small bite or some tea/coffee. We also had a great time with the Art Tea (Afternoon tea). The staff really completes the Merrion experience as they are all very friendly and efficient.",5,2016,07,12
200,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion hotel is by far the best hotel in Dublin for many reasons - location, luxury, comfort, personalized service and extraordinary attention to detail.  From you first step over the threshold, the staff welcome you like an old friend and visiting royalty, tending to your every need and anticipating them even before you know.  As far as my family and I are concerned, The Merrion is the ONLY place to stay in Dublin!",5,2016,07,12
200,Nicest hotel at which I've ever stayed,From the moment you pull up you know this hotel is something special. I felt like a VIP from the moment I stepped out of my cab. We got upgraded to a junior suite (a wonderful surprise) which was THE nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the amenities (your own nespresso machine/coffee) awesome. I can't wait to return. ,5,2016,07,11
200,Excellent with couple monitor drawbacks,"Our room was very well appointed, great bed, linens, etc. was very disappointed not to get the upgrade since I joined leaders club.breakfast was out of this world...delicious, not to be believed. Excellent quality and very fresh. With many choices.  Walked through beautiful gardens to get to room, really enjoyed the walks. Heard others complain about work being done in the gardens, hotel made that clear on their web site, but these people had booked on Expedia!!  Think it's smart to check directly with hotel.
This is a 5 star hotel in every sense with great staff, nice pool and steam room. Drawbacks were we wanted to tour their parliament building across the street, concierge had no information. Walked two blocks to the museum and they knew all about the tours. Also, As we were leaving, we asked about the air link bus, it's a straight shot to the airport for 6 euros, virtually same timing as a taxi.  I had paid 40 euros for the taxi coming into the hotel. The door man gave us completely wrong directions telling us to walk several blocks when it was just a two minut walk down the same street as the hotel.  Needless to say, frustrating. I wondered if he was just being a snob to think their clients would take a bus.",4,2016,07,10
200,Great service and you pay for it,"The Merrion is tops in service, location and quality, there are certainly less expensive hotels that might be close in overall quality but if price isn't a principal concern than you should give The Merrion a try.",5,2016,07,08
200,Old school but thorough,"Had a very fine comfortable experience at the Merrion, Dublin.  Felt very secure and plenty of privacy yet very responsive service.  Rooms are large and finely appointed.  all room details are thorough.  Woould stay here again in my net Dublin visit..",4,2016,07,08
200,An Ideal base to check out the Georgian site of Dublin,A truly beautiful hotel with exceptional service and style. A great location in the centre of the historic district but well positioned away from the hustle and bustle. The art collection is amazing and worthwhile taking the time to view. The spa is a beautiful oasis of calm matched by the quality of the treatments,5,2016,07,07
200,THE  Place to stay in Dublin....!,"Stately ambience, welcoming and professional staff, delightful food and drink....truly a ""home away from home""! Located at the heat of the cultural and entertainent scene... We plan to return on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2016,07,07
200,Excellent Hotel and Location,"The hotel is lovely. The staff are very accommodating and plentiful. Rooms are very clean, beautiful linens, turnover etc. Requested a microwave and small fridge as I am dairy and gluten free and required a fridge for medications again and this was no problem. Highly recommend The Merrion. ",5,2016,07,06
200,Definitely a five star hotel!,"We have stayed in many five star hotels, and the Merrion is one of the best! From the moment you walk in the door, their main goal is to make you feel comfortable and special. We arrived early and were greeted by the receptionist who walked us down to breakfast and told us she would check on our room. When we returned, our room was ready and our suitcases were already in it! She then escorted us to the concierge who helped plan sightseeing and restaurants for our stay.
The room was beautiful and well appointed, and newspapers were delivered each morning. Our only complaint, and it was quickly rectified, was that we wanted to have afternoon tea one day and were told there were no tables available. We explained that upon arrival, the receptionist told us that tea was served every day and never mentioned that you needed a reservation. We asked to see the manager and the guest relations director came over and did find us a table. Afternoon tea was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it! The staff was always friendly and helpful and seemed to anticipate your needs. This hotel definitely deserves its five stars and more!",5,2016,07,05
200,Vacation,First class hotel in the heart of Dublin!  Great great location!  Staff was amazing!  The spa was to die for!!  Breath taking pool!  Everyone was extremely helpful and wonderful !  The cellar bar was very cool!  Will definitely be recommending this to all my friends!  Thanks to an amazing end to an amazing trip!  Memories!!,5,2016,07,04
200,The Best,"Honeymoon: Wow - their rating holds up, indeed. The room was amazing and tasteful. The staff is helpful and pleasant. The food is wonderful and amazing. Even the location is perfect for great local dining and tourist spot planning. You won't be let down with The Merrion Hotel. My wife's favorite stay in Ireland for sure. ",5,2016,07,04
200,Dublin with Class!,Stayed in Dublin many times but typically at another 5 star hotel.  This was our first time at The Merrion.  We really enjoyed it!    The room was ready and very nice.  The amenities were fabulous ... although next time I would prefer to be in the older house... the rooms seem bigger over there.   The pool and steam room were very nice.  Our visit was short although would love to spend more time there and experience some of the pubs around it.  ,5,2016,07,04
200,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location","The Merrion is a gem of a hotel in the centre of Dublin city. The staff are friendly and helpful. We stayed in a junior suite and it was beyond expectations. Gone was the standard hotel room and instead we were shown to what has to be one of the most beautiful hotel rooms I ever saw. The bed was massive and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was luxurious. The noise levels extremely low. As for the rest of the hotel, it keeps inspiring. The communal areas are very comfortable and perfect for drinks or reading or people watching. The gardens were being renovated when we were there but again the look stunning. Breakfast was wonderful, though it is in a basement room and hence no natural light. I believe this is being remedied. Overall, truly exceptional. I cannot commend this hotel enough.",5,2016,07,04
200,Classy hotel in a central location and nice neighborhood in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed three nights at the Merrion hotel. The room was on the third floor and had a nice interior courtyard view. The staff was very professional and helped with maps/directions etc. We enjoyed breakfast on a private floor reserved for hotel guests. Most of the major sites in central Dublin are within walking distance of the hotel. The On/Off red Dublin tour bus stops just outside the hotel front entrance. A great pub with traditional Irish music and a fun, lively vibe, is just around the corner: O'Donoghue's Pub. The Merrion is a top quality property and we enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,07,03
200,Absolutely beautiful,"WOW!!!!  Is the word to describe this Hotel from the attendents to the beautiful flowers everywhere throughout 
They fuss and pamper you answer any questions you might have even going out of their way to help
They have a very pleasant bar right off the quiet Tea rooms they also have a beautiful garden outside to sip on whatever you are having
The pool is amazing the steam room is like no other one of the best the workout room has plenty of space
The Cellar restaurant is very delicious and romantic
Our room was a suite on the second floor it was like home except you don't have to do anything except enjoy. It's quiet the bed is very comfy 
The location is great the on off bus is right out front and it will take you around the city or up to grafton street to eat,shop, or have a pint
If we ever get to Dublin again it is a definite stay",5,2016,07,02
200,Honeymoon Heaven,"The Merrion is an absolute dream hotel. We arrived after driving across the country and were greeted by the outstanding staff. We enjoyed afternoon tea (HIGHLY recommend) and then ventured out into the city. The hotels location is a major plus making it a perfect home base for exploring. Our garden suite was stunning and comfortable. Even the smallest details are done impeccably--- champagne, mini cupcakes, etc",5,2016,06,30
200,Coming Home,"I have stayed at the Merrion many times and it always feels like ""coming home"".  The staff, the ambiance and the service are all exceptional.  There is a quiet grace to the rooms, and there is always a fire burning in the drawing room.  I think it is one of the great hotels of the world.",5,2016,06,30
200,Possibly Best Meal of MY LIFE,"The Merrion Hotel is one fine place that delivers beyond expectations. But its attached restaurant was possibly the best meal my wife and I have ever had! It deserves ""3"" Michelins. The hotel gives so much attention to detail that the slippers were placed on either side of the bed for us to slide in to. Now that is service!",5,2016,06,30
200,excellent visit,"nice place - city convenient - walk to everything

clean, safe, urban, modern and charming, elegant and warm

afternoon tea by the firepace

sunning in the garden

walk to everything

business or family - this place is good!",5,2016,06,29
200,Excellent Stay,"Amazing hotel. Excellent location.. Staff across the hotel where amazing! Staff left 2 bottles of water in our car as part of the valet service - brilliant touch. We ate in the bar for lunch, food was above average. Once again staff where helpful and polite! will be back for sure!",5,2016,06,29
200,Conference Stay,"The Merrion maintained top notch service despite a full house of demanding patrons.   I would stay again, the hotel was beautiful.   The service perfect.   My only regret was not finding time to take a swim in the gorgeous pool!",5,2016,06,28
200,The place to stay in Dublin,"We recently stayed in the Merrion while on vacation with my family. From the moment you walk in, from the door men to the front desk to the bell men, all the staff was amazing. We had adjoining rooms in the more modern garden wing which were extremely comfortable and well appointed. The breakfast which was included in our room rate was delicious  and extensive. We were able to order a la crate or from the buffet or both.  The hotel was conveniently located in Dublin.  We will definitely be returning!",5,2016,06,27
200,Comfortable and relaxed stay,"Booked in here as an after Christmas break.  Valet parking a good start, and Dublin is notoriously difficult to park in.

Friendly check-in and shown to a comfortable room before a theatre visit.

Had room-service on the second night, fast service and excellent food.

Good check out, with the car delivered to the front of the hotel - a relaxing weekend.",5,2016,06,27
200,Mrs & Mrs,"We stayed in May of this year, absolutely loved everything about our stay
Beautiful hotel, lovely, helpful staff. All Resturants & Bars are excellent with friendly, knowledgable staff.
Would stay again, definitely a 5 Star Hotel
If staying for length of time, plenty of storage, laundry service excellent, Concierge service excellent. Shops, all amenities close by, short walk to centre of City, great department store in centre ( Browns) has excellent designer wear etc.
Michelin Star restaurant in same building, we visited and enjoyed immensely. 
Would definitely stay again  ",5,2016,06,27
200,Very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,This was very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin.  It was very convenient to all the things that you want to do in Dublin.  We stayed in a suite and were very satisfied.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The food was just OK so you may be better exploring Dublin for meals.,4,2016,06,25
200,Ah! Under stated luxery!!!,"This hotel has a fabulous location and so lovely. If you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin that is understated yet luxurious the Merrion is the ticket. The staff is top shelf- always a 'can-do' attitude without being intrusive. The pub, restaurant and common rooms are fabulous. Beautiful artwork, plank wood floors, attentive staff...perfect. High tea in the afternoon if lovely. Gorgeous 'infinity' pool in the lower level is warm and inviting. I really enjoyed staying at the Merrion.",5,2016,06,24
200,Merrion Hotel,"An upscale hotel right in the downtown area, close to shopping and restaurants. Very traditional, beautiful rooms, outstanding service from front desk to porters to concierge. Afternoon high tea looked wonderful and seemed very popular. However, breakfast was way overpriced at 24 euros for continental (my wife wanted just a scone and orange juice, but no ala carte was offered). Also, when they offered to convert our bill to USD from euros, the exchange rate they offered was exorbitant, well above the rates offered by other hotels and restaurants.",4,2016,06,24
200,What a Luxury Hotel Should Be,"The Merrion is the epitome of what a luxury hotel should be: understatedly elegant with an incredible staff that will see to your every need. Our Garden Wing room was generous and comfortable - in contrast to another boutique hotel we had stayed at during our visit. Perfectly located, we will definitely return to this oasis of calm in Dublin.",5,2016,06,24
200,Nice hotel - charming,"This is a charming hotel well positioned in Dublin.  The rooms are comfortably laid out.  The air-conditioning isn't really air conditioning, so consider yourself warned.  Unfortunately for us, construction was going on while we stayed there, so our garden view wasn't much of a view.  But the hotel is charming none-the-less.  The gym is decently equipped and the common areas are cozy.  ",4,2016,06,23
200,Superb Stately City Manor !,"The merrion is one of those Hotels where guests feel lucky to stay in an Historical building that has been maintained so well that it almost feels new.  We can't say enough about the staff, the food and the accommodations. PERFECT!",5,2016,06,23
200,Superb Accommodation Experience,"This was a special treat for my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint. Fantastic accommodation, facilities and service. The Patrick Guillbaud restaurant is a gastronomic delight accompanied by first rate service. The art collection is an added bonus. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and it is a stay that will linger long in our minds.",5,2016,06,23
200,"Excellent, best in Dublin","My husband and I are locals - we have a house in Dublin and know all the top rated hotels.   We chose the Merrion to host some very good UK friends who wanted a first rate food experience in Dublin to celebrate a significant birthday over a long weekend.  They were not disappointed, neither were we.  We enjoyed Junior Suites each in the older part of the hotel and they were excellent - the champagne in each suite was a very nice welcome and the handwritten note from the GM - little things make a difference.  Loved the atmosphere, unobtrusive service, artwork and decor.   Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud made for a memorable dining experience.  Overall a wonderful experience to showcase our lovely city with our dear friends.  So much so that they have already booked for later in the year to bring their own children and spouses back.",5,2016,06,21
200,Lovely Hotel,"The Merrion is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. It is quite charming, clean, quiet and comfortable.  People are accommodating and helpful. The restaurant is also very good.  And the location can't be beat. I look forward to a return visit.",5,2016,06,20
200,A Special Place,"You must pay attention to the address - it doesn't look like a hotel from the outside at all, but rather a business or government building. 

Once on the inside, the staff will give you a warm Irish welcome and you will feel right at home.  The halls & corridors are somewhat confusing, like a maze, but once  you get your bearings, it is easy to navigate. 

There is a fireplace in the lobby lounge and the afternoon tea is served there. It's nice & cozy. There is also a nice lobby bar as well. 

The rooms were large and beautiful. The bed and pillows very comfortable.  

Each room has individually controlled air conditioning. ",5,2016,06,19
200,Charming and Luxurious,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel for four nights in May 2016. Great people, service was amazing and a beautiful old history filled Hotel. Great location in the City center and within walking distance to great pubs, restaurants, parks, and or course tourist sights.",5,2016,06,17
200,A very luxurious experience,"Stayed in the Merrion Suite in a party of 3 girls.
Love the way they set up the room - very 'victoria' feel.
The room is huge with a spacious and lovely bathroom.
A bit further away from the main city centre.
All the staff are very polite and friendly.
Definitely worth staying to feel more ' georgian' hahaha",5,2016,06,16
200,"Classy, Comfortable, Crowded!","In the Georgian heart of the city, beautifully positioned and with its elegant frontage, even just arriving outside feels classy! The doorman was welcoming, reception staff also. 
The public spaces in the main house of the hotel are elegant and quiet, furnished with old world charm. You could comfortably tumble into an armchair, order an indulgent tea and read the newspapers, or just watch the world go by. And there is a lot of world going by. (More on that later.)
The large courtyard gardens give a sense of space and air in the city. Our room was in the newer block and was more than large enough to accommodate a third bed for our daughter. The bathroom was vast and luxurious. The bed: large and super-comfortable.
We spent some hours in the basement pool; well appointed and warm, and surprisingly empty. My massage in the spa was good.
There are several places for an early evening drink, all atmospheric and great spots to launch a Dublin evening. The Cellar Restaurant is quite formal, the menu elaborate. But it was very decent; just not cheap. Great wine list. Go there to spoil yourself rather than for a more relaxed evening. 
The let-down was how crazy busy the hotel was. As we arrived, the hotel was overrun with guests transferring from a cruise ship. Literally, we could barely cross the elegant reception hall for the stacks of suitcases. Members of staff were being harangued by travellers recovering their cases. The lounge areas were so full of people, we gave up waiting for somewhere to sit and retreated to the gardens for tea, even on a grey, Dublin day. Breakfast was a bun fight; the staff apparently struggling with the volume of guests, and saying as much. We waited over half an hour for our order. Perhaps we were unlucky on the weekend we picked. 
There is much to enjoy here. Oodles of Irish charm, a great location and a professional staff with a justifiable sense of pride in their hotel. We just wanted a little more space to breathe!",4,2016,06,15
200,Fabulous Hotel,"Great hotel, the room was in the more modern garden area and i had a view of a road and businesses opposite but i was only there for one night so this wasn't an issue. All the staff are friendly and attentive and its in a great location, i just wish I had been able to stay for longer than 1 night !",5,2016,06,15
200,Outstanding Service !,"My wife and I really enjoyed our recent stay at the Merrion. The service was the best we have ever experienced, and we have stayed at a number of upscale hotels (Four Seasons, etc.) in both the U.S. and Europe.  The service and food at the Cellar Restaurant, where we had breakfast each morning and dinner one evening (see separate review) was exceptional.  We had a king room in garden wing.  The room was not overly large or luxurious but was good size (by European standards) and VERY quiet.  We did have few minor room maintenance issues which were addressed efficiently.  The room wi-fi worked well most of the time.",5,2016,06,15
200,An amazing time,"A great hotel. Everyone from the doorman to the Housekeeper greeted us. The service from the bellman, the spa, and lobby room food area was outstanding. The room was cleaned perfect upon arrival and stayed that way throughout our stay. 
The Cellar was a great breakfast restaurant. Service, was great! 
When in Dublin, we highly recommend staying at this 5-star hotel.",5,2016,06,14
200,A taste of old Dublin,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel in May this year to attend Bruce Springsteen concert.
The outside of the hotel is very old Dublin with beautiful architecture leading to lounge bars and reception. We stayed in the new part which you get to by way of an atrium with gardens on each side. Our room overlooked the garden and was very comfortable and clean. The only downside would be that there are building works to the back of the hotel which our room overlooked. Fortunately no noise so all OK. All the staff are friendly and we had an enjoyable couple of days. would certainly return.",4,2016,06,13
200,Beautiful Hotel,"This is not an inexpensive hotel but worth it if you can afford it. When we first drove to the hotel, I thought we had made a mistake as the outside does not look like a hotel.  But inside is very high end and the service was outstanding - very Four Seasons like.  You should first join the Leaders Club which provide free breakfast and room upgrade if avail.  It paid for itself.  We were upgraded to the King room which was a very nice size and really nicely decorated.  The hotel is very well located as it is within walking distance to the main shopping area museums and the Trinity College.  MAKE sure to purchase tickets ahead for the Kells Library which you can purchase at the hotel so you don't wait in line as well as for the Jail as tickets ran out early.",5,2016,06,12
200,The Marvelous Merrion,"My wife and I stayed at the Merrion for a few nights at the end of a long exploration of Ireland. We could not have picked a better hotel. The location is perfect. It's near the park ,Trinity College and all of the museums. We booked our stay through AMEX PTS and were upgraded to a very spacious and super comfortable suite. It's a beautiful hotel inside and out. The gardens are well kept and the art work around the hotel is amazing.
The staff, from the bellmen, to the concierge, to the front desk, was very professional, not stuffy, incredibly friendly and always there to help.
The Merrion is truly a classy classic!",5,2016,06,11
200,Good value for money and a lovely room,"The hotel is very conveniently situated in the centre of Dublin. It's got a very formal feel to it as you walk in - it's a nice place, old / historic and very well presented. The lounge is plush and the service attentive from concierge through to the bar and restaurant. The room was really nice - lots of space, so we decided to have dinner brought up. We both had steak, rare - it was perfectly cooked but the chips gave it a run for its money. It was St. Patrick's Day but you wouldn't have known it - the hotel was quite reserved / neutral; not necessarily a bad thing, if you wanted the party, it was right outside!

Breakfast was ok - good food, although the waitress was a little over the top in attentiveness given the general mood of the room that morning :-)

All in, I'd come back here when next in Dublin - it ticks all the boxes for a night over.",4,2016,06,11
200,Wonderful hotel,I love staying at The Merrion. It is a beautiful hotel and the staff can't do enough for you. It is in an ideal position for visiting Dublin with shops and restaurants and parks nearby.  Always a pleasure.,5,2016,06,10
200,Magnificent is The Merrion Hotel,"Our friends at Haversham and Baker have introduced us to yet another gem. This hotel is well located on The Stephen's Green with close proximity to all points of interest in Dublin. From the warm welcoming greeting at the front door, check-in and tour of the property, everyone was warm, friendly and accommodating.  Our room is very comfortable in size and amenities. Super comfortable bedding was a great reward after a long day of travel. Two great restaurants accompanied by large seating areas for afternoon tea provided a great array of dining choices. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,06,09
200,Love the Merrion in Dublin,"Perfect location, old world charm but with new amenities. Our recent visit to the Merrion was as good as advertised. We received an upgraded room upon check in. ( Not sure why but very nice of them ). The hotel service is outstanding and the people could not have been nicer. Oversized rooms and bathroom. Reasonable rate given what you get. Great value.",5,2016,06,08
200,Nicest hotel I've ever stayed at,"We only stayed here for one night for a layover and were upgraded to a king room bc it was the end of our honeymoon. The staff was so nice during check in and seemed genuinely excited that they were able to upgrade us.

The room was beautiful- so comfortable, clean and overlooking a beautiful garden area. We did not want to leave!!!

The location of this hotel is perfect- it is in a really quaint little area that reminded me of Boston. I guess some would say it's off the beaten path but it's an easy stroll to the Grafton street area. ",5,2016,06,08
200,"Beautiful rooms, no breakfast.","Charming property with the character of the old but amenities of the new.  We had a spacious garden room with a bay window over-looking the garden.  I had requested a garden view when booking, but the check-in person did not note this, so I asked again and he was very accommodating.  Decor is top notch, but there is no breakfast with the rooms at these rather high prices.  The two lounges were always full, so it was hard for us to make any use of them.  Voila around the corner is an excellent spot for breakfast or lunch.",5,2016,06,06
200,Nothing Special,We stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights at the end of our trip to Ireland.  It seemed our rooms were the last and worst in the hotel. So much for any special amenities with Virtuoso. Nothing special about the hotel or rooms to recommend to anyone.  Rooms were small and clean.  Staff was pleasant but much better at the other hotels we stayed at in Ireland. The Merrion seems to host mostly travel companies or local business and government types from Dublin.,3,2016,06,04
200,Understated elegance with fabulous and friendly service,"We just completed 5 nights at the Merrion while staying in Dublin. It was just wonderful!! From the time we arrived, we were treated extremely well. The staff was always friendly and only interested in how they could be helpful. We ate in the Cellar Bar and the Cellar Restaurant 4 out of the 5 nights because the food was outstanding! We took advantage of having tea, which was great, and the No. 23 bar which we completely enjoyed. 
The location couldn't have been better as it was in a relatively quiet neighborhood and within walking distance of everything we wanted to do. 
We look forward to going back to Dublin and will definitely stay at the Merrion again.",5,2016,06,03
200,"Overall good, but expected great for the price/rating","We began our 16 night vacation in Ireland at the Merrion. It is rated the best hotel in Dublin and we thought we'd start our trip off in a great location to get to know a city we've never seen. After a 7.5 hour flight and the waiting through customs and taking the bus to the hotel, we were ready to shower and relax..but that wasn't possible. We got to the hotel at 10:30 am and they would not give us a room. We had requested early check-in on booking, and I know the hotel wasn't even close to full, however they refused to try to find us another room or accommodate us at all. We left our bags and walked around Dublin exhausted until 2:30 pm and then waited for them to take us to our room....not a good start. The location is great, we walked easily to all the restaurants and pubs, parks and anything ""touristy"" you could think of. We booked two nights in a standard Garden Room. The room was very clean and cozy. Our view was the side street next to the hotel, a bit disappointing. After a VERY long day we were ready to go to bed early but at 10:00 pm we get a knock on the door for turn down service!!!! 10:00 PM???? REALLY, now you want to turn down my bed, that was quite unprofessional. A few other issues we had were they didn't have air conditioning on yet which wasn't a problem the first night because we had our windows opened. However, the second night was trash day which goes on all throughout the night and we could not sleep. Also disturbing the second night was a fire alarm that went off twice. I called the concierge the second time to make sure we didn't have any issues and he rudely said ""no"" and hung up abruptly, not the standard of customer service you expect from a 5-star hotel. Finally, upon check out we stated we would like our charges in Euros, not Dollars. This is due to the ridiculously high exchange rate they charge and we have no international fees for our credit card. The man at reception acknowledged my request but after looking at the receipt he charged us in Dollars anyway. So we had to get them to refund and recharge in Euros. Overall, there seemed to be a lack of customer service and concern for guests overall comfort and needs. I would expect so much more for such a highly rated establishment.",4,2016,06,03
200,First Class Hotel,"On arrival we were a little distraught because Air Lingus had lost our luggage. The bellman greeted us warmly and told us where to shop nearby for clothes. Checking in we were escorted to our room by the front desk. The room was spotlessly clean, and most important to me was extremely quiet with one of the most comfortable mattresses we had slept on in Ireland!",5,2016,06,03
200,Thank you for a wonderful stay!,"We enjoyed every minute of staying at The Merrion!  Beautiful hotel, excellent rooms, delicious food, beautiful outside garden and most importantly, engaging and helpful staff.  Thanks to Jonathan, Theresa, and the many others who made our trip a great time.",5,2016,06,03
200,The best in Ireland!,"At the end of a 3 week tour of Ireland I've stayed in quite a few places, from the cesspool called Tipperary House, to this magnificent place. And this is by far the best place to date. The staff seem to genuinely want to help you, and seem to be able to predict your needs without seeming intrusive. I cannot praise the professionalism of the staff enough.

The rooms are excellent, exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel, only they surpassed the normal standards of luxury. 

The spa was divine, and the restaurants were amazing.  I cannot say enough positive things about this place.  

And yes, I admit that $500 a night may seem excessive, but you get what you pay for. And at the Merrion, you get more than what you pay for.",5,2016,06,02
200,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"The Merrion if my most favorite hotel in the world.  I would put it up there with any Four Seasons.  There is nothing pretentious about it, but the level of luxury and caring by the staff is wonderful.  They knew exactly what it is you need and do everything to accommodate it.  We love the food, the Irish Breakfasts are wonderful, as is the morning buffet in the Cellar.  Be sure to check out the wonderful artwork and photos of old Dublin when you are there.  It is the only hotel I would stay at in Dublin.",5,2016,06,02
200,"Impeccable service, Georgian elegance","Spent 3 nights in this elegant hotel. The beautiful decor and fine art work did not give an air of pretense, but rather, ease and comfort. The room was quiet, beautiful and comfortable with views to the garden. Staff was readily available and more than helpful and friendly.  The central location to all the best sites and museums can't be beat.",5,2016,06,02
200,Great Service,"I could not be more impressed with the quality of service we received from this hotel.  From the door to the guest room, dining rooms to the exercise area, the staff was extremely gracious.  Special kudos to the concierges for their assistance in planning our Dublin experience in advance of our arrival and while we were there.",5,2016,06,02
200,The Merrion Dublin,I want to recommend this hotel in Dublin. The continental breakfast was quite regular. I expected a little bit more. The service was very friendly and professional. Overall a very nice and pleasant experience!,5,2016,06,02
200,Merrion - Excellence all round,"5 star hotel in Dublin, that truly hits the 5 star marks. everything from arrival to departure was outstanding. the rooms are great and spacious, the food was delicious.  I would have no hesitation staying here again and again and again.",5,2016,06,01
200,Romantic night away,"Went here to celebrate a special occasion.Booked a deluxe King and it was fit for a King .Had dinner in Patrick Guilbaud which was excellent ,different review .The only let down was breakfast down in the cellar ,but would definitely return again .",5,2016,06,01
200,The Best Hotel in Dublin,The Merrion Hotel in Dublin stands head and shoulders above every other hotel in Dublin. The staff are the best trained and most helpful I have come across. The facilities are second to none. The location is superb. Staying in the Merrion is an experience like no other.,5,2016,06,01
200,10* treatment at the 5* Merrion,A fantastic few days in the lap of luxury.  The staff anticipated our every need without being intrusive. The bar is fantastic and the drawing room area delightful with an open fire.  The garden within the central square is elegant and divine with a beautiful statute of Joyce with the words of his poetry radiating outwards from his feet. The food in the Cellar Restaurant is scrumptious.  And a stroll through the Cellar Bar with it's lovely little nooks is a must.   Highly recommend this fabulous hotel in the heart of our beautiful capital city.   Thank you.,5,2016,06,01
200,Romantic Stay,"My husband and I stayed at The Merrion two weeks ago. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. From accommodating our early arrival, to helping us navigate through the city. I would 100% recommend The Merrion to anyone traveling to Ireland. I wish we could be back there now!",5,2016,06,01
200,You won't be disappointed,Having stayed at The Merrion twice in the last month for business I can honestly say the experience was a total pleasure.  The staff were nothing but attentive and helpful - nothing was too much trouble for them and the service is truly 'old fashioned' in the most positive of ways.  The rooms are spacious and spotless with large bathrooms to luxuriate in.  If you stay here you won't be disappointed.,5,2016,06,01
200,Five Stars of Excellence,"I recently spent 6 nights at the Merrion Hotel and found it to be perfect in every way.
From the moment you step out of your cab to the moment you are escorted to your room, you are made to feel welcome. 
 The double deluxe room was luxurious and  serviced twice a day. 
Room Service was prompt and the breakfasts served hot and delicious with always a friendly word from the server.
We enjoyed all the meals we had in the Cellar Restaurant and the No. 23 Cocktail Bar as well as the special ""Art Tea"" in the Merrion's Drawing Room.
A tour of the art gallery in the hotel was an added bonus.
My friend and I agreed that this was by far the best 5 star hotel we have ever stayed in and we hope to return one day.",5,2016,05,31
200,Treated like royalty,"Beautiful historic hotel within close walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and pubs. Bedroom was clean, had plenty of outlets and we were given an early check-in.  Added touch when we came in for the evening and found a dessert welcome tray.  Robes, heated towels, tub and shower.  Full bar, breakfast.  Nice stay.",5,2016,05,31
200,Very good hotel,"This hotel has consistently been superb over the years and my latest visit did nothing to alter this view. 

The bedroom was fantastic with a large comfortable bed and fantastic bathroom. Lots of space and all to a very high quality. 

Service was excellent with a speedy check in/out. 

One problem:my bedroom seemed to be a little close to someone else's bathroom with all the accompanying noises. ",4,2016,05,31
200,Expensive and dirty coffee cups!,"Our company uses this hotel once a month for a small business meeting. On several occasions now we have had to mention that the coffee cups are not cleaned correctly. Not sure why this keeps happening at all. Very luxurious place well maintained but just lacks the finer details at times.
Hopefully it changes.",3,2016,05,29
200,Dublin Hotel,"Best hotel in Dublin. Hospitality, helpfulness of staff, rooms were very clean and maintained well, free WiFi and great breakfast and room amenities. Walking distance to the shops,restaurants, museum and colleges. Next door is a Michelin star restaurant for a special evening to celebrate.",5,2016,05,28
200,SIMPLY THE BEST,"Excellence in every category:  Great location, excellent staff, professional service, a warm homely luxurious traditional environment with live fires, very comfortable bedrooms, and the option of a first class Silver Service breakfast served to your room.  Dublin's best!   DUBLIN'S BEST!",5,2016,05,28
200,Mixed results on this trip,"I love the Merrion Hotel. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin, but I am starting to think about it. One of the things I love about the Merrion, is sitting in the beautiful lobby rooms having a drink. In the 2 days that I have been here, I have never found a seat in either lobby room in the afternoon or evening. Upon arriving at the hotel at 4 PM today, it appeared that there were 3 tables available. I sat at one and a staff member rushed over to say it was reserved and plopped down a reserved sign in front of me. My husband and I approached the second seating area to be informed that it was also reserved and be asked if we were staying in the hotel. (?) Also the third was reserved but we were informed that the VERY NEXT ONE after that would be available. Since no one sitting at the other tables, some just having drinks, appeared to be moving any time soon, we moved on to our room. The Merrion does have a bar. If I wanted to sit at the bar, I could also stay at a different and less expensive hotel. In general, the Merrion is wonderful and the staff is exceptional. So 5 stars for the hotel and 0 stars for current ability to use the lobby. That's enough to make me go elsewhere next time.",3,2016,05,27
200,Understated excellence,Wonderful hotel. Everything perfect. Discrete and attentive service. Beautifully laid out room. Excellent view. Great location. Food excellent but pricey. Wonderful experience overall. Would highly recommend.,5,2016,05,27
200,Top notch in every way!,"This is such a top notch hotel!  It occupies three beautiful, large Georgian buildings in the heart of the city near shops, restaurants and sights such as St. Stephens Green.  The rooms are large by European standards, lush, and extremely comfortable.  There is an exquisite restaurant on the property, more casual dining in The Tavern in the basement, and a wonderful bar and lounge area.  There are some wonderfully unique cocktails.  They serve a lovely afternoon tea.  The staff is wonderful.  Although we did not try the spa, it looked wonderful as well.  We stayed at the hotel twice on our visit to Dublin - at each end of the trip.  It's worth spending some extra time here!  It's about a $35 cab ride to the airport.",5,2016,05,26
200,Lovely old style hotel,The Merrion is housed in a beautiful Georgian style building in the heart of Dublin a stones throw from St.Stephens Green. The hotel has an understated old world appearance with a modern twist. The Cellar Bar is a lively yet relaxed place to have beer. The only downside is the building works ongoing that let the Garden courtyard down.,5,2016,05,25
200,"The Merrion in Dublin, Ireland","Yes....it's pricey...and worth every euro....fantastic service on all fronts in an especially caring way.  fantastic wining/dining...fantastic location...this property is for those who truly appreciate the finer things in life....my advise is....try, try, try to stay at the Merrion when in Dublin....for remarkable memories...& book it with a Virtuoso Luxury Travel Consultant for added percs!",5,2016,05,25
200,Stellar Property,"What a fantastic hotel! I've been lucky enough in my career to have traveled extensively and have stayed in some pretty fantastic properties. This hotel however, really blew me away. From the moment you arrive to the day you check out the staff and the beauty of the place really impress. Don't forget to pay attention to the art collection that adorns the walls.   With regards to the location, you are in walking distance of 3 of the most famous Pubs in Dublin. I would tell you which pubs specifically, but I will leave it to you to inquire with the bellmen and the doormen so you can get the scoop from real Dubliners!",5,2016,05,25
200,World Class Hotel that does everything right!,"We recently stayed at the Burj al Arab  in Dubai, apparently the worlds only 7 star hotel, If you want world class luxury.... Stay at the Merrion Dublin. Settling the standards in luxury. Beautiful surrounding and the friendliest staff in the whole world.",5,2016,05,25
200,Lovely Hotel - Gorgeous Property,"This was my 2nd stay at the Merrion.  The room was lovely and the bathroom was just gorgeous.  In fact, I'm remodeling my master bath and the bathroom at the Merrion is my inspiration.  The hotel is very centrally located.  There is a hop on hop off bus stop right out front which makes it easy for tourists to get a good start orienting themselves to Dublin.  We didn't dine at the hotel but they have a lovely living room and adjacent bar that appeared to be very welcoming for reading the morning newspaper over coffee or enjoying mid-afternoon tea by the fire.  If I had one opportunity for improvement it would be that the service this time around didn't feel as warm and welcoming as it had in the past.  Maybe we just caught everyone on an off couple of days but the staff seemed stiff and stand-offish which was so diametrically opposite from what I remembered from a few years back.",4,2016,05,24
200,"Lovely, comfortable hotel in the heart of Dublin","I have nothing but good things to say about the Merrion. Our room was incredibly comfortable, spacious, and well appointed. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, giving us excellent dinner recommendations and booking several day tours for us in advance of our visit. The food at the hotel (in-room breakfast and afternoon tea in the Drawing Room) was expensive, but incredibly good and convenient -- I highly recommend treating yourself to tea one day while there! And to top it off, the location is absolutely fantastic for seeing the Dublin sights. On any future trips to Dublin, I will definitely stay at the Merrion again.",5,2016,05,22
200,impeccable hospitality & perfect service,"We had the most pleasant experience staying at the Merrion. Every staff member was extremely professional, courteous and eager to help. They upgraded us to a better room for free. The room was beautifully decorated, gorgeously furnished,  luxuriously spacious, and impeccably clean. Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud served excellent food. When we came back to the hotel too late at night for the restaurant, we had a light meal in the drawing room, but even that meal was delicious. We highly recommend the Merrion to whoever plans to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,05,21
200,Clan Celebration in Ceremonial Surroundings,"My extended family traveled to Ireland to celebrate our lineage. After 7 glorious days in West Ireland, (Glenbeigh), we hopped the train to Dublin. We all, 11 of us, stayed at The Merrion. Here we found a richly preserved history of manners, luxury and comfort. The rooms are beautifully decorated with comfortable, stately furnishings. The linens are the finest as are all the bath products. The HUGE bath tubs were perfect for soaking away many road trip miles! Room windows open out to the fresh air of beautiful Dublin. We had drinks at The Merrions well-appointed bar and shared many stories with the friendly bar keeps. The Cellar Restaurant served gourmet dinners and delectable brunches. The staff is polite, attentive without being overbearing. They are there when you need them; otherwise, you have your privacy. The Merrion was definitely a highlight of our magnificent trip to Ireland. We are all planning a return visit in the near future. The Merrion deserves 5 stars, 10 Points and an A+++++ rating! ENJOY.",5,2016,05,21
200,Family weekend trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel Dublin for a weekend break with our family ('children' in their early 20s).  The Merrion is a fabulous hotel, very well appointed, beautifully furnished and very comfortable bedrooms.  The staff were friendly and attentive, but without being too obtrusive.  We could not have chosen a better hotel and could recommend it to anyone looking for a high standard of accommodation and food.",5,2016,05,21
200,No1 hotel in Dublin,"One of my best stays ever. Well trained personel, polite and helpful. Very-very-very clean rooms. Everything was perfect. Very good location, near all city attractions. Not value for money, but what you pay, you get.  Highly recomented.",5,2016,05,19
200,Centrally located and great hospitality,"The room was well appointed, comfortable and very clean!  The staff were friendly and helpful.  We were with a group of 20 and we were greeted warmly and everything was prepared for us... no waiting!  I'd stay here again.",4,2016,05,18
200,Dream vacation,"The Merrion is exactly as advertised - understated elegance - but with the addition of kindness and friendly hospitality that made us feel immediately welcome. Brain (at the door) especially went out of his way to make us feel welcome, aid with driving directions, and make recommendations for stops on our way. The Irish folks in general are unusually helpful and eager to speak with pride about the country - just LOVED it!",5,2016,05,18
200,Fantastic Stay,Really enjoyed our stay at the Merrion. Such a peaceful spot in the middle of Dublin. Staff were always available and very attentive. Room was very spacious and comfortable. Had lunch and breakfast in the hotel and both were delicious. The spa is a very relaxing spot.,5,2016,05,18
200,Luxury Plus!,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin merits 5 stars! The room we had in the main area of the hotel 
was among the nicest we have ever experienced. Powder blue accents a rich cream and gold trim bedroom with fireplace make a most comfortable and luxurious retreat after a long day of touring. Plus a spacious and gorgeous bathroom. Great service. Lovely location!",5,2016,05,17
200,Outstanding service,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend in April. Every facet of the visit was excellent, but the truly outstanding feature of this hotel, in my opinion, is the quality of its people. Everyone with whom we interacted displayed a very strong desire to deliver excellent service, and they did so, without exception - reception, concierge, wait staff, housekeeping, and not forgetting the maintenance man who came to fix our TV!! It is very noticeable that hotel staff look to make eye contact and smile when they are successful in doing so. Even if they're having a bad day, you'd never know it!!

The Merrion's location is central and it's easy to walk to many of the local attractions. Our room was not huge, but was well equipped and comfortable. As mentioned above, our TV was faulty. Within a few minutes of reporting it, the maintenance guy showed up and when he couldn't fix it, he replaced it!! We ate in the drawing room a couple of times and enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere -  log fires and big comfy chairs. 

All in all an excellent weekend at a first rate hotel. We'll definitely visit again.",5,2016,05,17
200,exquisite,"excellent exquisite a truly 5 star hotel , on par with the ritz madrid, ritz paris, claridges. great location, fantastic staff. cant say enough good things about this property. if in dublin and can stay here there is no better place",5,2016,05,17
200,Luxury on tap,"Super hotel. We stayed in a beautiful suite. Beds are the comfiest ever, so much so I enquired as to the make and ordered a new one the next day! Breakfast Room service portions were not disappointing and staff were very helpful. A truly old school 5 star experience! ",5,2016,05,16
200,Wow!,All I can say is this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at! So accommodating! Great staff! The location was hard for us to find but after the amazing visit there I almost  completely forget that part! After touring most of Ireland it's without a doubt to me that this is by far the best hotel in Ireland!,5,2016,05,16
200,Excellent,"Special anniversary given a suite upgrade it was lovely. Staff could  not have done more to make our stay special. Situated in perfect position for seeing all the sights of the town.
Would certainly return aagain.",5,2016,05,16
200,Perfection!,"We were fortunate to return to the Merrion Hotel recently for a three night stay. A truly memorable experience in every way! Our suite in the Georgian building was superb. The plasterwork of the ceiling is a true work of art and a joy to wake up to each morning! Every possible amenity was available in our room making our stay extremely comfortable. Service was impeccable. Breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant is a treat in itself with cooked choices, as well as, an extensive buffet. We indulged in the afternoon art tea in which several dessert items are designed to reflect some of the art in the impressive collection about the property. We also made use of the spa. Our treatments were heavenly but the spa itself is small and not as well appointed as others we have experienced. There is some construction ongoing at the hotel which limited access to the garden but we were never inconvenienced by noise. The Merrion is a destination in itself but so much more as Dublin lies at your doorstep. Great location, excellent facilities, and superb service make this an extraordinary hotel. Wish I could give six stars! Perfection, indeed!",5,2016,05,13
200,The Service is outstanding!,"Loved this hotel!  It looked great on the website and we booked through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts to get the early check-in, late checkout, meal for two etc. in the deal.  Arrived, looked a bit chintzy and worried we’d booked the wrong place … but quickly realised it was superb!  The service was excellent all the way through the stay, we were upgraded to an excellent room in the original Georgian buildings, the Spa & Pool was great (I was jaded on the Sunday afternoon in the pool so the helpful staff brought me some floats).  The hotel is beautiful, but it’s the excellent service and brilliant attention to detail that makes this a winner for me – they even brought some beautiful little cakes on a plate saying Happy Anniversary to our room whilst we were out.  Perfect place!",5,2016,05,12
200,Truly womdergul,"I'm overly critical of hotels, but there was totally nothing to fault this place on. Service is attentive, yet discreet. The room was beyond comfortable. And Asprey toiletries - what a treat. Yes, it's expensive, but don't you get exactly what you pay for? A huge thanks must go to the portering staff for whizzing our bags off us before hurrying them to our room, and the concierge for keeping an eye for our taxi, allowing us to suffer with our hangovers in the lounge. A real joy, thanks for having us",5,2016,05,11
200,Great food and attention to detail second to none,"Fantastic hotel, friendly efficient service. Attention to detail second to none. Location perfect and lots to see in the surrounding area. Well worth a stay. The Cellar Bar has a lovely atmosphere and offers privacy for customers. Food Menu great value and the best Pinot Grigio in Dublin. It's a short distance to St Stephens Green and the ultimate shopping experience in Grafton Street where you will be entrained by Street Artists galore.",5,2016,05,10
200,Ireland's Finest,"Recently a friend and I were concluding a two week trip around Ireland. We had reservations at a Dublin hotel that was purely awful. So we left there and checked into the Merrion Hotel. Best move ever!!! The hotel is not only beautiful. The amenities are perfect. And the service was top-notch with the Irish twist of being genuine and warm. I have stayed in 5-star hotels the world over, but I rank this one #1, because in addition to the physical qualities of the place, the service was extra special.",5,2016,05,10
200,That's the way to do it!,"We stayed at the Merrion for 3 days with some friends for our first visit to Dublin.  The hotel was excellent - the staff, the service, the food, just the smile and greeting you got from everyone who works there.  It made the trip so enjoyable.",5,2016,05,09
200,Amazing food ,Visited the cellar restaurant for dinner with  friends.. The hotel is perfectly situated within walking distance of the busy shopping areas. Parking is also widely available  nearby. To say the food and service surpassed all my expectations is an understatement.  I had the halibut for mains and it just melted in my mouth.  The Broccoli with walnut butter device. As for the beautifully presented desserts OMG the taste was divine. Staff are extremely friendly.  If your looking for a special type of dining. The cellar is the place to visit. ,5,2016,05,09
200,Elegant understated hotel with impeccable service.,"We spent 3 nights here playing golf in the Dublin area. From the doormen who first greet you and found us taxi's each morning, to the front desk, to the breakfast service downstairs, the staff is perfection. The lobby decor is traditional as are the rooms, which are very comfortable. There is a beautiful pool downstairs in the spa where I enjoyed swimming laps in each day. The breakfast is excellent and there is a very nice bar in the lobby for cocktails. This is a quiet hotel, simple and elegant in its style.  A cabby told me the likes of Springsteen will quietly slip in here, while say Beyoncé stays at the more lively Shelbourne. I'm not sure it's true, but I found this an excellent description of the difference between these two excellent hotels. Looking forward to coming back and it is definitely my number one choice is Dunlin.",5,2016,05,08
200,Our favourite hotel,"We stayed recently at the Merriin for a special occasion and it was just lovely, the staff made us feel really special and there is no-where nicer to relax. The hotel is very central and a short walk away from Grafton Street.",5,2016,05,07
200,"Unforgettable experience, stunning hotel","We stayed at the Merrion recently and from start to finish were in awe of what a beautiful hotel it is and how impeccable the service is. From the beginning there are doormen waiting to take your luggage immediately off you and take straight to your room. The reception lounge areas are impeccable and the staff extremely friendly - beautiful artwork is everywhere and they even have an audioguide guests can collect from the concierge to tour the art of the hotel (which I would thoroughly recommend though you'd need an hour to fully appreciate). The room itself was gorgeous and looked out into Leinster House (though not a peep of noise could be heard from the road). We order room service - a burger and pasta, both of which were delicious and were served on silver and with beautiful presentation. We headed out for a drink or two on Baggot Street (1 minute away with a number of great Irish pubs which are far more authentic than Temple Bar). When we returned a bottle of prosecco we'd only partially finished was sat in a chiller with two coasters sat over the glasses to maintain the freshness of the already poured prosecco - the little things really do make a difference. Quality of sleep was exceptional. All in all, probably the best city centre hotel I've ever stayed in.",5,2016,05,07
200,Elegant luxury in an understated way,"Top notch service and commitment to quality and customization.  The Merrion managed to eke a reservation for high tea for me at the last minute, to accommodate a special occasion (surprise reunion with a childhood friend).  The hotel went above and beyond the call of duty.  I will definitely return when back in Dublin.",5,2016,05,05
200,Fabulous massage in The Tetra Spa,"Luxurious, amazing, words cannot describe the Shiatsu whole body massage I had recently with Yuka (from Japan).  She used finger therapy which  stimulated my 355 points and left me rejuvenated and relaxed.  This was followed by ice cream and fruit overlooking the beautiful pool.

Included in the price, (for those of us not lucky enough to be staying in the best hotel in Dublin) is the use of the pool, gym and amenities managed by expert and friendly staff.  It is an experience not to be missed.",5,2016,05,05
200,The Merrion in October 2015,"The Merrion is an understated  elegant  hotel in Dublin. The location is good and is easily
walkable to attractions and shopping. Our room was on the ground floor with windows that opened to the lovely courtyard with fountains, statues and lots of flowers and greenery.  The room was comfortable and had every imaginable amenity that was replenished frequently. There were cozy lobby rooms with open fires to sit and have coffee and tea with views of the courtroom with fresh flowers everywhere .It is a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it highly. It is rated as the number 1 hotel in 
Dublin and it deserves it. The hotel is so classy that it doesn't have a sign with it's name on it outside, but you will notice the cute doormen with their top hats and know you are there.",5,2016,05,04
200,Genteel Sophistication with Real Warmth and Service,"First visit there, on recommendation from native Dubliner as ""best hotel."" Wish I could have stayed for a month. Staff fantastic and welcoming. Lobby is beautiful and very warm. Arrived early after long flights and sank into one of the very comfortable couches, Has traditional Irish salmon plate, which was perfect. Room was large and wonderfully done. While a classic, room had great work space and room for all mobile gadgets to stay in touch with business. Great location, especially with nearby restaurants and pubs. Will make a point of staying there with family on next trip.",5,2016,05,04
200,Outstanding in Every Way!,"Simply marvelous experience at the Merrion.  Great location, terrific service and attention to detail.  Truly lovely rooms throughout, marvelous breakfast and traditional afternoon tea.  Staff made helpful suggestions about local pubs and sight seeing.  We'll be back!",5,2016,05,04
200,Don't get what all the fuss is about,"I visited in August and greeted by 4 people behind the check-in desk (after wresting with the doorman for my bag). None of of the 4 had time to help me because they were too busy chatting.  When they finally did check me in, I'm not sure if they were annoyed I interrupted them or what, but I booked a room overlooking the courtyard and instead I got a tiny room overlooking an alley way.  The a/c didn't work and you couldn't open the window because someone could have literally stepped in the window from the alley.  The room was tinyl and overcrowded with English country style furniture.  When you pulled out the chair to sit at the desk, the chair was backed up to the bed. And you couldn't open the wardrobe while the chair was out from the desk. The bathroom was less than modern (and not the cleanest) and the water pressure was terrible. I went to the desk and said it wasn't what I had booked and wanted to change but they said they were booked out. The staff were far too numerous in the common areas, with nobody actually doing anything, and all acting judgmental. In the bar area on the main floor, there was a fire burning in the evening ... in August. Don't get me wrong, I adore a peat fire, but it was so unbearably hot that nobody could be in the place - everyone who did come in, left - so much for atmosphere.  Perhaps I had the worst luck and got their closet room, and everyone was having a bad day, but it's to their loss. As some who travels to Dublin on business every couple of weeks, I will not select again or ever recommend the Merrion.  The Westbury is far superior in every way imaginable.",2,2016,05,03
200,Excellent in every way,5 start service and accommodation at its best! The beds are so comfortable and there is so much to explore in this hotel. Pure Elegance! The staff at the hotel will help you in any way they can and its a testimony to this hotel that they have such great people working for them.,5,2016,05,02
200,Great service and lovely fooms ,Had a great stay. Loved the hotel. Staff very friendly. Pool was good. Only slight negative is that the hotel couldn't get us into Patrick Guilbaud - the restaurant attached to the hotel. Most 5 star hotels can get you in to their own restaurant...,5,2016,05,02
200,Always Excellence- Continues to Impress!,"The Merrion is my go to ""home away from home"" while I am in Dublin and having stayed at multiple other properties in the city, it rates above all. 

This trip we stayed in a Queen Garden View room which was immaculate as usual. We received an apology letter due to the construction that was going on during work hours, but, honestly, this was totally unnecessary as we didn't hear any of it. 

We arrived and we're please to find an assortment of fruit and chocolates waiting for us *thank you*, which we ate on all week. 

The service here is just absolutely amazing, from the front desk staff, concierge,  to housekeeping, all wonderful. Do have the Merrion Afternoon Art Tea if you visit. I try to have it every time I am here, even if reservations are limited and I have to have it delivered to my room. This is arguably better sometimes, as it is so much food, I can eat it over time while working. 

Also, a highlight is the fitness space and pool area down in the Spa. For the small space it is, they have most everything you would find in a well appointed gym, from ab mats, kettle bells, bikes, treadmills, full weight rack, etc... Perfect for working off the tea cakes and pastries!

I will be visiting Dublin again this coming month, and will be back to my ""home"" again soon. ",5,2016,04,30
200,The best service at breakfast we've ever had thank to Branko!!!,"This hotel is an excelent choice for people who love Art, old times, nostalgy and luxury :)
We stayed already twice in this property! First time we loved it so much we decided immediatelly to come back in a few weeks.
Both time we stayed in a suit as we always go for bigger rooms.
Hotel is exactly what we had expected to be! True Irish tresure!!! 
I specially enjoyed all the original paintings and sipping Irish coffee by the fireplace is just like from another time and we LOVED it!
Breakfast is amazing!!! And we can't thank enough to Branko, who was taking care of us every morning! What an amazing attentive gentleman he is! We realy want to stress how it is important to have the right people! Hotel can be as great as possible but without right people its just a impersonal place! Thank you dear Branko!!! We will be back.
All staff was very helpful and accomodating, hotel is beautiful, food delicious,  that is why we are deffinitely coming back! 
Thanks Merrion for a wonderful stay!!!",5,2016,04,30
200,Great hotel ,"Located on Merrion Square.
Always of very high standard. Staff are good and attentive. Good choice on the menu. 
It opposite the National Gallery and has fine examples of art on the walls. Best hotel in Dublin and very central.",5,2016,04,27
200,Posh Stay,"Had been to Dublin many times for business, but booked hotel Merrion for the first time. Classic decor especially the common area near reception with live fire place. Rooms were neat and staff was very helpful.",5,2016,04,25
200,Great staff and attention to detail. Room a bit noisy though,"As you'd expect for a hotel with 5 stars, the staff were very attentive and went the extra mile to make us feel comfortable. Our room was noisy though - it was in the garden wing and the delivery lorries all came and went along the small road outside our window (at all hours during the night). The driver left his engine running at 3.15am! We only say typed one night otherwise we would have asked for another room.",4,2016,04,25
200,Upgraded to a very comfortable room,We arrived very late but received a  friendly welcome and were upgraded to a room in the main part of the hotel. The sitting rooms are beautiful and you can admire some magnificent paintings by artists such as Roderic O'Connor. The gardens are lovely and they are currently building a breakfast room in the middle which should be stunning when it's finished. 25 euros for continental breakfast and 29 for cooked.,5,2016,04,25
200,Afternoon Tea,"Fabulous afternoon tea, service was excellent, Ivan was wonderful, he was very attentive and gave great recommendations. Food was delicious -scones, sandwiches, breads, cakes and very special art inspired desserts. Lovely idea to celebrate a special occasion. Very relaxed atmosphere and comfortable surroundings. ",5,2016,04,24
200,Understated elegance,"Perhaps the best hotel in Dublin. Understated and extremely elegant, impressive art collection, refined interiors, excellent restaurant and pubs, convenient location off of St. Stephen's Green, etc.  without a doubt, it is the hotel staff and their gracious service that make this among the best. ",5,2016,04,23
200,Intimate wedding and overnight stay,"A close family member had his wedding reception in the Merrion hotel recently. It was a small affair of approx 40 odd people, but from start to finish the service, atmosphere, food (wow, those deserts!) showed the reason why this hotel is so respected. Decor maintained so well, beautiful, enchanting garden and staff who went above and beyond the call of duty. You made the occasion so special and memorable. Rooms were beautiful, as was tasty breakfast. Thank you to the Merrion Hotel. No1 in Dublin for a reason.",5,2016,04,20
200,Fabulous,"Stayed for one night and had afternoon tea  also. The whole experience was amazing. The ambience was really good in the hotel, room was spotlessly clean, bed comfortable. Afternoon tea was really delicious, not rushed and we had leftovers wrapped to take up to the room. Cannot fault and would love to stay again. ",5,2016,04,20
200,Sanctuary in the middle of Dublin,"Had the pleasure of spending one night in The Merrion last weekend. Fantastic experience from check in to departure - breakfast was a pleasure - no issues with my request for gluten & dairy free - soya milk cappuccino, 3 types of bread - one of which with cinnamon & raisins was amazing - omelette cooked to order. 

We had to leave in the evening to go see a show & returned with guests for a nightcap in the drawing rooms - the big comfy chairs, excellent service and roaring fire was a perfect finish to the evening.

My only regret was that we only stayed one night!!",5,2016,04,20
200,Affordable Luxury,"I just truly love the Ambiance, the Service and the Quality of rooms at the Merrion Hotel. The Art is breath taking and just ads to the uniqueness of the Merrion. The Service is next to none and definately one of the Best I have come across. Efficiencies mixed with a warm friendliness. The Breakfast is an experience of it's own with many Irish Food being showcased and a range of hot meal options. The swimming pool is 18 m, very relaxing and the changing area had more than usual facilities.",5,2016,04,20
200,World class hotel,My wife and spent a week in Ireland  and the last two new guts we stayed in Dublin. We stayed at these luxurious hotel and wished we were staying longer. The rooms were beautiful and the service was gracious and inviting. We highly recommend staying at this hotel. ,5,2016,04,19
200,Top Class,"Stayed twice and was treated fabulously both times. The spa is amazing, the food sublime and if you can get a booking, try the afternoon tea. The staff are very friendly and helped my grandmother enjoy her Christmas present of afternoon tea.",5,2016,04,18
200,Wonderful stay,We stayed here for five nights in February and loved every minute. Rooms were well appointed and staff were friendly and welcoming. Communal areas were light and pleasant and the hotel's art collection added interest. We had the afternoon tea based around three of the paintings in the hotel. Delicious! Great pool and we enjoyed the hotel's restaurant and bar. A very special place indeed and very convenient for most of the sights in Dublin.,5,2016,04,18
200,Beautiful hotel in historic part of Dublin.,"This hotel is a slightly quieter, more intmate version of the Shelbourne (just around the corner) and we loved our stay here. The staff are very professional though not exactly friendly - perfectly capable and accommodating. The hotel itself is beautiful situated, off the more busy road facing St Stephen's green, but across from the Irish Parliament buildings. The clientele are well heeled foreign visitors and what you are imagine politicians and local business people for lunch etc. We loved the marble bathroom and the small period details in the hotel. Amazing collection of Irish art on display. The afternoon tea is a modern take on the Irish classics, which was fun and washed down with a glass (or two) of bubbly - and made for a lovely finish to our stay. Recommended!",4,2016,04,18
200,Best service ever experienced,My sister and I stayed here for four nights having a catch up and an explore of Dublin. We were upgraded to a small suite - a wonderful surprise - which was immaculately presented. The check in and concierge staff are outstanding in their welcome and friendly attentiveness; the room staff courteous and polite; and the hotel itself is brilliant. Very highly recommended. ,5,2016,04,17
200,Excellent city hotel,"We stayed at the Merrion for the end of our honeymoon in Ireland. The staff is very professional, helpful and knowledgeable about the area and made good recommendations. They assisted with mailing items to the US and upgraded our room for our special occasion. We will be back.",5,2016,04,17
200,For Experienced and Discerning Travelers,"We were at the Merrion for about a week- this hotel is extremely well managed and staffed. The service and formality displayed by the staff were too-notch; the art collection is worth the tour by itself. The location on Merrion Square is excellent, and the interior design quite sumptuous  (the rooms are fairly contemporary in style though).

Now this is expensive...up to $500 a night and often more, so it's not for everyone. There are some slight misses...there's no usb ports for charging, the hotel food is fairly ordinary and not worth the prices from our POV...and with a spouse who's a chef I say that with some real logic. Finally there's that bizarre habit to heat every room 10 - 15 degrees hotter than we and other guests can stand...we found this in many Irish and Scottish hotels and impacted our total assessment.

But the service and decor and helpfulness of the staff is of the type that used to be reserved for quasi royalty, and it's worth the 5 star rating they maintain. In Dublin again and we will be back...but it's certainly not for the average or occasional traveler.",5,2016,04,16
200,Classic hotel with style and comfort,"We stayed for 2 nights over a weekend in this classic hotel stretched over a few old buildings close enough to the city center and in walking distance to great Museums, parks, the Trinity College and lots of great pubs frequented by locals just around the corner on Merrion Row. The place is well maintained, staff very attentive and helpful, quite many people took care of us and helped for check-in, luggage and gave advice. We were asked to wait as our room was not ready yet (check in from 3 pm) and took a snack in one of the saloons, which was again classy and good quality. The standard room and bathroom were spacious and clean, beds were comfortable and wifi free. We did not take breakfast in the hotel given many other options nearby. It was a very pleasing experience and we felt pretty much home.",5,2016,04,16
200,Stunning 5 star service ,"Everything about the hotel oozes class from check in to the turn down service. Located on a quiet street close to traditional Irish music bars. The room was stunning, exceptional bathroom and beautiful room. The spa was fab, great pool
And gym. Treatments are a real luxury, a wonderful massage and scrub, they really Make a fuss of you. Royal treatment by exceptional staff.",5,2016,04,15
200,The finishing touch.,"We stayed 12 nights and 13 days in Ireland last Oct. We started our trip at The Powercourt resort and spa and finished at The Marrion Hotel. The only way to start and finish a trip to Ireland. If you like being pampered in a beautiful hotel in the middle of Dublin within walking distance of almost everything and don't mind spending a little (ok maybe more than a little) then this is your place. We started our stay (while waiting for our rooms) by having afternoon tea (a first for all 4 of us) with champagne, finger sandwiches, and deserts that looked like a piece of art. They look  almost to good to eat (but we did anyway). We had dinner at Patrick Guibaud were the service and food where beyond words. The entire staff treated us like rock stars from ck in to ck out. The level of service you receive in Ireland is beyond reproach and The Marrion takes it over the top.",5,2016,04,15
200,Lives up to its reputation.  Possibly the best services I have ever experienced.,"I really loved the Merrion.  Generally I feel hotels don't live up to the hype, but that was not the case here.  I usually stay at the Marker hotel which is also very good, I will do a bit of a comparison below for any debating between the two.

Location - very centrally located, a quick walk from St. Stephen's Green.  Lots of restaurants and shopping etc. within walking distance.  Location was preferable to the Marker unless you are working in the Grand Canal.

Reception/Service - Service was FANTASTIC - anytime I needed something I was helped very quickly and by an extremely polite staff.  The service level was among the best I have ever experienced.  Service at the Marker is also great, the Merrion was just a tab but above though.

Rooms - clean and spacious, classic decor, I really liked it. Rooms are the Marker were a bit bigger and more modern styling.  

Amenities - Cellar bar was a great place to grab a quick bite and a drink, spa/pool was great, there are also a few nice places for a relaxing drink or bite.  Overall I was really impressed with the hotel.

If you get a chance to stay here, you won't regret it.",5,2016,04,14
200,Superb facial in Tethra Spa,"I had heard that there were excellent treatments in the hotel's spa and, having recently booked a facial, can confirm that it was, indeed, absolutely top notch. One of the best facials I've ever had, very relaxing ambience and lovely therapist. Highly recommended!",5,2016,04,14
200,Ms,"A beautiful, classic hotel. With Dublin city on your doorstep. Outstanding service. 
Truly unique. 
With a spa, gym and devine food.
Make sure to stay for a few days, as you will not want to leave to quickly.",5,2016,04,14
200,Wakened Early For No Apparent Reason,Had no problems with to rooms but for some reason we were wakened at 9am by room service to check the mini bar. When we were checking out the mini bar had not been charged to our room so I don't know what the purpose of this check was but it was not appreciated.,1,2016,04,13
200,Luxurious and relaxing,"From the doormen and front desk staff's greetings to the extremely comfortable and perfectly quiet room and the wonderfully warm and welcoming lounges to relax in in between, the Merrion Hotel Dublin is a must stay for anyone visiting the Irish capital.",5,2016,04,12
200,Excellent!!!!,"What to say about The Merrion that hasn't already been said in the countless reviews already posted. From Tommy opening the car doors I smooth check in by Ben the experience started off amazingly. Best club sandwich I have ever had is served here I was looked after so well by Julie in the Drawing rooms she is a credit to the team.  Very quick dinner in the Cellar bar, steak cooked to perfection and served by the delightful Zina. Extremely comfortable bed and a great nights sleep. The only place to stay in Dublin!",5,2016,04,12
200,Exquisitely 5*****,"As we drove down Upper Merrion Street, opposite the National Gallery, there stood back from the road the majestic Merrion hotel, quietly was waiting for us to arrive. It was as if we'd gone home,  everyone pleased to see us, insisting they take our bags, fussing over us. The building is simply splendid, sublime. Bedrooms, beautiful. Everything just so.. elegant. Food, fabulous. The word ""service"" doesn't apply, it's much more than that at the Merrion. It's a cultural experience with the most exquisite private art collection. But not stuffy. The owners and staff have got it perfectly spot on. You simply must visit this hotel.",5,2016,04,12
200,Fantastic Georgian Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This is my second visit to this hotel and have found it to be excellent each time.
Friendly staff (although hardly an Irishman on the staff except for the doorman! - and perhaps the Manager!).  High tea is an experience here - by the cozy fireside. One negative observation: why, in a hotel of this category, do they not provide toilet brushes in the bathrooms of the suits.  With time I have stayed there, I have noticed this omission.",5,2016,04,11
200,Truly a 5* experience. Wonderful,"Our stay here was wonderful. 

Great service, lovely staff and beautiful hotel. And fantastic wifi!

Would recommend the spa- had a lovely treatment. 

Nothing was too much bother for the staff and our room, which was the cheapest rate was lovely.",5,2016,04,10
200,As good as it gets,"We expected a first-class experience when we made our reservations at the Merrion, and they delivered, from the courtesy and friendliness of the staff to the wonderful room and bath to our slippers being laid out by the side of the bed when the room was turned down for the night. The hotel bar was a wonderful haven of serenity with an exceptional variety of drinks from which to choose, most at reasonable prices. We truly felt coddled and spoiled during our stay.",5,2016,04,08
200,Wonderful,"The hotel is beautiful, service is impeccable.  What impressed me the most was the phone call I received upon my arrival home that I had left behind an extremely valuable item.  Thank you to housekeeping for their honesty and integrity and thank you to customer assistance for  insuring the safe return of my items.",5,2016,04,08
200,The nicest hotel,"Not the poshest or even the smartest hotel, but the nicest I've ever stayed in. The staff are lovely and the room (queen in Garden annex) extremely comfortable. From beginning to end the whole experience over 4 nights was a relaxing pleasure.",5,2016,04,07
200,Sunday night couples stay,"We stayed for one night in The Merrion a few nights ago after driving down from Northern Ireland. After doing a few loops of St. Stephens Green we finally spotted extremely modest sign for the hotel. We pulled up and were greeted by very attentive and well mannered staff which was the first sign of the 5* experience instore. 
We were taken to our room by a member of reception who showed the features of the room etc and after a minute alone our luggage arrived. We choose a standard double room which was extremely comfortable to stay in. The minibar was fully stocked with high quality drinks and snacks. The room was lovely and warm but there was an offer of cashmere socks and a hotwater bottle. The room service menu is extensive and available 24-7. You are provided with cotton robes and slippers and in the evenings the rooms are turned down in preparation for sleep which was a nice touch. 
We visited the basement pool which we had to ourselves and took a steam also. The changing rooms are equipped with additional robes, slippers and gorgeously fragrant soaps in the shower.
Breakfast is from 7-10:30am in the basement. The tables are well set with silver teapots and cutlery. In the middle there is a large table with continental breakfast options. My boyfriend ordered the full Irish breakfast which went down well however as a vegan the breakfast definitely lacked for me. There were no dairy-free options of milk or yogurt so I had an option of fruit. From the Irish breakfast I could only have the mushrooms and tomatoes which I asked for but I found it pretty comical when I was then given a large plate with one portobello mushroom and half a tomato in the middle. 
This really was the only disappointing aspect of our stay however when a breakfast is priced at €30 I expect more and was left leaving hungry.
Also something we were not aware when booking was the €28 overnight parking fee!",5,2016,04,06
200,Wonderful - but skip the 35Euro breakfast,"Wonderful in all ways, but if you are paying for breakfast yourself, there are many places a third the price just around the corner!
Location, room size, internet connection and atmosphere are all 100%!",5,2016,04,06
200,A true five star hotel,"Everything about the Merrion was fantastic. The service, the room (we were upgraded to a suite), the food and just the staff in general. It is a terrific hotel in the heart of Dublin. We would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2016,04,03
200,5 star luxury,"This is a proper 5 star hotel with 5 star service.   From the moment of arrival when the staff greet you outside the hotel, take your car, and carry your bags in to final check out I could not find fault with any aspect of the hotel.   Elegant, beautiful rooms, with a comfortable bed and cosy arm chairs beside a fireplace.   The dining experience at both dinner and breakfast were superb and every details was taken care of by the attentive staff.  Well worth the cost.",5,2016,04,03
200,Great Hotel,"This remarkable hotel in the heart of Dublin has it all. A great staff, terrific amenities and a location than cannot be any more central. From the minute we arrived to the second we left, staff were attentive but not intrusive. Our garden suite was amazingly spacious and even included a luggage room. Breakfasts were sumptuous, and the drawing rooms and bar very inviting. The bedroom and baths were extremely well equipped, including a NEspresso. We would gladly stay here again.",5,2016,04,02
200,Outstanding Service,"This hotel was very welcoming - relaxing and offered everything one would need while staying in Dublin.   Loved our experience.  We arrived with no luggage, two nights of travel(and jet lag) - and bumming about arriving on St Patricks day - we had been scheduled to arrive the day before.  In spite of our problems with airlines -this hotel performed perfectly and we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2016,04,01
200,The Best in every way,"We stayed here whilst visiting friends in the city.  It is a beautiful building and hotel in a great location.  The decor is sumptuous, so clean everywhere and the staff are so friendly.

The thing that really sticks out in our mind is their welcoming ways with family - we not only had a cot in the room, we had a gorgeous little bathing robe and slippers along with full size baby toiletries a balloon and colouring book - such a nice touch!

Thank you team Merrion for making our stay in this fabulous city so wonderful!",5,2016,04,01
200,Merrion Hotel Dublin,"An excellent small city Hotel with fine service and a friendly welcome,with a central yet quiet location. The rooms in the old mansion are to be preferred, but all are of a high standard. The lounge and bar areas are great meeting places both for business and pleasure. The Spa is good and the pool is well looked after.",5,2016,04,01
200,"Wow, what a wonderful stay!","So glad I stayed here. The service was top notch.  I have stayed at big chain hotels throughout Asia where service is consistently excellent, so I was taken aback to see even better service levels at The Merrion.

European and North American hotels, IMHO, do not quite match the service levels of their Asian counterparts, so I was very pleased to experience the exceptional service I received during my stay at The Merrion.  

From the staff at the restaurant to the chambermaids;  all of the staff I encountered went beyond being helpful, being friendly, and being professional....the way they demonstrated these behaviours made it seem like it was in all of their blood, and not just a function of training.",5,2016,03,31
200,Easter stay,"Very good hotel with very accommodating staff, clean and a bit above the other hotels in Dublin. Conveniently located and worth the money paid. Lovely spa and pool. Slow service for breakfast on each occasion",4,2016,03,30
200,Easter rememberance weekend 1916-2016,"Stayed with friends for the Easter rising 1916 rememberance weekend. Excellent location close to Stephen's Green. 5 star service, all staff very helpful and friendly. Well presented and documented art collection on the public walls (just prints in the bedroom, same one in each room apparently, as we had three adjoining rooms with a print of Victoria's steamer in each one). Nice cocktail list, well made drinks with nibbles on the side. So called Garden Room (view of back street through window) was small but the bed was good, quite good bedside lighting. Bathroom was a good size with bath and separate shower. Water provided in room. Good free wifi. Did not have breakfast. Very nice friendly place to stay, not cheap but totally worth the price. Go raibh maith agaibh; slán agus beannacht libh. ",4,2016,03,29
200,Best Hotel In The World...In My Oponion,"This hotel is American Irish. Best way to sum it up. I will start with the decor and art and then move to the service; all of which it is recognized for.. Understated, superbly elegant and very warm and relaxed. It's the open fires and super soft sofas that make you want to order tea and biscuits and never leave the reception rooms. It's the country house com town house feel that you know is your house. Unlike other less exclusive Dublin five star hotels people don't waltz in off the streets without purpose. This hotel is reserved for the guests and their guests and that is a key consideration when discretion and privacy are required. I am not stating that the downstairs bar doesn't fill up; quiet the contrary, but at least non staying guests enter through a different entrance and leave the hotel guests free to hog the sofas upstairs. I love everything about this hotel from location to service and bars. In particular I love the upstairs bar. If I could live in a hotel in Dublin - It would be this one. It has an Irish elegance and charm and in my humble opinion is the best Irish hospitality experience in Dublin. It's not a brand per say. It's an experience.Worth the additional spend as it is probably more expensive than the other five star options.",5,2016,03,28
200,Favourite hotel ,Stayed many times at the Merrion and it never disappoints! The check in was really quick and we had a desert and chocolates waiting in our room. The food in both of the hotel restaurants was fantastic and excellent value for money. Almost everything on the menus is locally sourced and the staff were able to tell us about each menu item in great detail.,5,2016,03,26
200,"Great hotel, worth the money for a special occasion","We stayed here for two nights and despite it being a very expensive hotel, it was lovely and worth the money. The location for the main town is fine - it's a tiny way out compared to some other hotels however, less than 10 minutes walk into the heart of Dublin. The staff were very helpful throughout. We opted for breakfast in our room both days and this went without a hitch and the food was very good. On account of pricing and the fact we wanted to sample the town properly, we never ate in the hotels restaurant. We used the pool facility twice and this was lovely and highly recommended. All in all a very nice hotel, great for special occasions. Our only gripe was the shower in our room (1st floor) had really poor pressure - although the showers in the pool changing rooms (basement) had excellent pressure. ",5,2016,03,25
200,"Our 2nd memorable and beautiful stay at The Merrion Hotel in the heart of Dublin, Ireland, highly recommended","The Merrion is located opposite the Government Buildings and on Upper Merrion Street in Dublin.

The hotel has two wings, the Main House and the Garden Wing.

During our previous stay a few years ago we had the entrance category room at the Garden Wing, which was added in the 1990's. The hotel opened in 1997.

For our stay in March 2016 we consciously chose a Deluxe King Room located at the Main House. The Main House comprises the four original Georgian buildings from the 18th century.

Lord Monck leased four plots and built houses on all of them.

He lived in Number 22. It is named after him and has neo-classical Adams style interiors, while Number 21 has rococo plaster work and a heavy staircase.

Number 24 was originally leased to Lord Antrim, but he moved after his own home was ready, and it was instead taken over by Garret Wellesley, the Earl of Mornington. The building is also known as Mornington House. The Earl of Mornington was the father of the 1st Duke of Wellington, who was born in Number 24.

Reception is located at Monck House. The hotel was already buzzing when we arrived. The bell captain welcomed us warmly and  offered to take our luggage and to bring us to the check in desk. We were travelling light, so we didn't need help with our luggage, but accepted to be brought to reception.

We had to wait a bit, because other guests were checking in. When it was our turn the formalities were quickly dealt with and we were accompanied to our room on the second floor. Unfortunately the hotel was very busy and a late checkout at 2 PM couldn't be given, but we were offered until 12.30 hours, which we took. Emma also explained we could use the spa and any other facilities even after checking out.

We were promised a beautiful room. It was true. The Deluxe Room felt newly renovated in light colors, mostly green, white, crème, beige and gold. The two floor to ceiling windows let in the sunshine and overlooked the courtyard and building site for the new garden restaurant.

After a short explanation about the features we were left alone.

The room was large and bright with a seating area, a coffee table, a throne bed with a Chinese themed throw and night stand lamps, a bench at one of the windows, a large flat screen TV, an alarm clock with IPod docking station, a built in wardrobe, luggage rack, writing desk and a credenza, containing the mini bar.

The matching Chinese theme continued on the cushions on the sofa and the upholstery of the bench. We loved the design and the softness of the material used.

The duvet, all towels and bath mats were Merrion branded.

There was a Leading Hotel of World catalogue, where The Merrion is a proud member since opening.
On the coffee table were different magazines including Vanity Fair, Image, Social & Personal, a booklet about the artwork at The Merrion and a coffee table book about artist Roderic O'Conor.

The Merrion's art collection is the largest of any hotel in Ireland and includes a few works by Roderic O'Conor.

Having frequented the hotel many times over the years we recognized most of the artwork and knew where they were located.

The 100 TV channels available were regional and international, including CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC and all Sky Sports channels.

We enjoyed watching golf tournaments from the US and Thailand on Sky Sports.

Bewley's tea and coffee making facilities were hidden in the wardrobe. The china was by Villeroy & Boch.

The mini bar was stocked with the usual soft drinks, a half bottle of Ruinart Champagne, other alcoholic beverages, The Merrion Pantry dark and milk chocolate, other snacks, sweets and some Tethra Spa products by Espa.

The mixers were 3 Euro (ca. 3.35 USD), soft drinks 3.50 Euro (ca. 3.90 USD), the Ruinart 48 Euro (ca. 53.35 USD), gin, vodka, rum and whiskey 7 Euro (ca. 7.80 USD), Hennessy 9.50 Euro (ca. 10.60 USD), Remy Martin VSOP 11 Euro (ca. 12.25 USD) and the chocolates 4 Euro (ca. 4.45 USD) each.

We took both chocolate bars. They were delicious and when mentioning it at checkout we were told The Merrion Pantry chocolate is saltier than usual, which was right. We liked the smooth, creamy texture and full flavor. Now we wished there would be more of those in the mini bar.

Classic mirrors and artwork by J.B. Yeats completed the room.

A complimentary large bottle of still water was waiting on the coffee table. It was replaced during turn down service and another two small bottles were provided additionally.

The maid offered to clean our water glasses, but we were okay.

The marble bathroom was large with a separate bathtub and shower, a sink, toilet and bidet.
It had a window, which flooded the bathroom with daylight. Blinds could be lowered, so that nobody was able to look inside. The amenities were by Asprey Purple Water and were outstanding.

The hotel offers a shoe cleaning service instead of a shoe shine. We used it and ours were clean and looking like new.

During our stay we used the 24 hour room service for Art Afternoon Tea (review to follow), dinner and breakfast.

Our dinner was smaller and we shared, because the afternoon tea had made us quite full.

It consisted of two mixed berries smoothies, McConnell's oak smoked salmon plate with red onion, capers, lemon and brown soda bread, grilled Monaghan chicken breast with champ mashed potatoes and petit pois a la Francais and a green apple parfait, transparent apple, olive oil cake and cinnamon chocolate wafer. It was all high quality, meaning superb restaurant style quality and delicious.

The bill was 84.50 Euro (ca. 95.25 USD).

The alarm clock had a great feature: The digital time display could be dimmed.

Sleeping comfort was great and getting out of bed was an issue. The wakeup call and reminder were delivered punctual and friendly. The staff double checked if we needed the reminder.

Breakfast the next morning was a Continental and Healthy choice and a cholesterol free omelette for both of us with asparagus as an additional item.

The Continental Breakfast included a choice of tea and coffee, orange juice, bakery basket, toast, jam and butter, fresh fruit salad and Glenillen yogurt.

The Healthy Breakfast included choice of tea or coffee, juice of the day, porridge with skimmed milk and mixed berries, rye bread, carrot bran muffins, Glenillen yogurt and fresh fruit salad.

The juice of the day, a multivitamin juice, was easily replaced, due to an allergy to apricot and peach.

There was a slight mistake in the bill - the omelette was charged full price, even though it should have had only a supplemental charge, when ordering a set breakfast. The mistake was easily rectified by the manager.

The correct amount was 69 Euro (ca. 77.80 USD).

After breakfast we explored the hotel a bit further incl. the beautiful manicured courtyard gardens in which one can view the beautiful ""Ripples of Ulysses - James Joyce"" statue/sculpture by Rowan Gillespie and then it was already time to pack and check out.

We enjoyed our one night stay very much and were impressed by the friendly and helpful staff, the detailed, luxurious Main House Deluxe King Room incl. bathroom and the excellent food.

Looking forward we would love to try also the Superior Room in the Garden Wing to experience a different room type.

Would we recommend this beautiful hotel to a friend? YES!
Would we want to stay again at this beautiful hotel in our future? YES!",5,2016,03,24
200,A real treat !!!,I have stayed here on several occasions and love this Dublin hotel. Everything is 5 stars about it but in a very relaxed setting. Love their roaring fires when it's cold and windy outside. The location of this hotel is extremely central which makes it an ideal visit.,5,2016,03,24
200,Always a Great Stay,"Stayed at The Merrion Hotel again for an overnight business trip.  This place is just a very classy, traditional, old school hotel with high end service, grounds and attitude.  It takes you back to an earlier period of time: the staff truly cares about every detail of your stay.  It's centrally located near St Stephen's Green & Dawson St shopping.   A little pricy, but worth it for the product delivered.  Big rooms, pretty courtyard, cool traditional afternoon tea service & quiet surroundings.  Go check them out.",5,2016,03,24
200,"Have been there twice, can't wait to return","This is a true 5 star hotel experience. Very helpful staff, very comfortable room, very good restaurants, spa, swimming pool, etc. The lobby seating area is very pleasant. 
Very centrally located in Dublin City centre . Stephens Green is nearby and the LUAS tram service is just a block or two away.",5,2016,03,23
200,Great stay and really great staff,Enjoyed out star here recently and must say we felt welcomed from day 1. Staff were always on hand to help out regardless of the situation. Would highly recommend staying here and hope to return later this year,5,2016,03,23
200,Merrion Hotel a Favorite Now,"Lovely hotel.  Warm, friendly, nicely appointed.  Good rooms and great service.  Close to whatever you want to do in Dublin, but not in the middle of the noise.  I travel for business - and sometimes for pleasure and stay in about 25 hotels a year.   Always seeking small hotels that have a great ambience and warm friendly and experienced staff.  Hadn't stayed at Merrion before, but plan to make it my hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,03,22
200,A True 5 Star Experience,"My first stay in the Merrion Hotel was on the eve of my wedding in 2012 and it's began a tradition that my husband and I now carry out each year having simply because of this hotel's staff, service and overall 5 star experience.  The staff greet everyone with such warm a welcome that at once you feel at home yet in luxury surroundings. The personal touches  we experienced on this trip was really a level beyond - a congratulations at check in for our anniversary, personalised greeting note and special desserts welcoming us BACK to the hotel....attention to detail is very impressive.  We relaxed with a drink in the Cellar bar with friendly staff happy to engage in chat and then left us quietly to enjoy and before ordering afternoon tea in our room - complete with robes and slippers and bubbles. A treat I'd highly recommend to anyone staying here  It's exquisite.  Turndown service with this hotel is again something to behold - coming back from dinner to seeing everything immaculately laid out is a wonder I still enjoy but the true testament to this hotel is that we had booked our 2017 stay before even completing our 2016 as time after time this hotel outperforms in our expectations.   Just wondering how I can turn this  into a birthday tradition too!",5,2016,03,22
200,Beautiful but stuffy...,"We recently visited Dublin with our two teenagers and stayed at the Merrion Hotel for two nights.  We loved the beautiful rooms, which were comfortable and spotless with upscale amenities.  You can easily walk to most of the main Dublin attractions from the hotel.  The staff went out of their way to make recommendations and be helpful (particularly the concierge and the bell hops) and the breakfast buffet was delicious. I took off one star because the layout of the hotel's lobby is awkward--you have to walk through two elegant lounges to get to the rooms, and it felt like you needed to ""dress"" to walk through.  If you prefer a formal atmosphere, this hotel will be right up your alley, but if you are more informal, you might want to check other options.",4,2016,03,21
200,gorgeous hotel,"First time to stay and it was very brief but very very pleasant.  Beautiful surroundings, great location, large comfy bed, great toiletries etc.  Stand out feature were the amazing staff who were so friendly and helpful and made us feel so welcome.  Definitely recommended.",5,2016,03,21
200,Weekend Break,"Had a fabulous two night stay with my husband at The Merrion Hotel recently. I genuinely cannot rate it high enough! Fantastic location, beautiful rooms, friendly, attentive staff, superb food. Most definitely the finest hotel in Dublin. ",5,2016,03,19
200,The best in Dublin.,A wonderful hotel mixing modern touches with historical charm.  The 5 star rating speaks for itself.  Spend a few minutes in the company of James Joyce (statue) in the lovely courtyard.  You can feel his presence.,5,2016,03,19
200,Perfect for a short stay in Dublin,"We only had one night at this hotel, but it was perfect for a short or longer stay.  Valet parking was available and the staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions on where to eat.

We received an upgrade to our room.  Perfect size with a very comfortable king bed. We also had the chance to check out room service for a lazy dinner in. The pasta, garlic bread, and sticky toffee pudding were all excellent. 

The location of the hotel also cannot be beat. It is right next to a variety of worthwhile museums and other attractions.  Amusingly, when we were walking home from shopping, we overheard a bunch of local kids ask their father what type of building the Merrion was, and he quickly responded ""one of the best hotels in Dublin."" We agree.",5,2016,03,17
200,Fabulous,Stayed here for two nights while visiting Dublin. Pricey but well worth it. 5 minute walk to GRafton St. Beside great restaurants and bars. Staff are great and can't do enough for you. Drinks in the lounge area is a must and they do a great afternoon tea. The hotel is fabulous - highly recommend!,5,2016,03,17
200,Stunning 5* luxury,"We had not realised the status of the Merrion until we got in a taxi at Dublin Airport and announced our destination - the driver's response was 'are you millionaires?' (which we very definitely are not). Our reaction on arriving was that we had walked into Bertrams Hotel (an Agatha Christie reference for those who don't recognise it) - the top-hatted doorman, the sumptuous log/peat-fire lounge with people enjoying enormous teas. 
The room was beautifully decorated and extremely well-appointed with lots of delightful touches - in particular the original art-work, which is a real feature of the hotel to the extent that it provides a magnificent guide; and the taste is exquisite and far from obvious. In the lovely formal garden there is a magnificent James Joyce statue/sun-dial which has to be seen to be believed. 

We did not dine at the attached restaurant which is reputed to be the best in Ireland but instead went to the cellar restaurant which was a gastronomic joy in itself especially as we were lucky enough to sample the St Patrick's week special dishes.

On top of all this however what makes the Merrion outstandingly special is the attitude, efficiency and friendliness of the staff which cannot be commended highly enough.

Yes it is a little pricey but when one compares it to London prices given the quality of the hotel it is a bargain. If you want a really wonderful Dublin hotel the Merrion is very well worth it.",5,2016,03,17
200,Home from home,Amongst the very best city hotels we have stayed in. It's a privately owned hotel and it shows. The location is perfect for walking around central Dublin. The Georgian buildings have been sympathetically renovated. The public rooms on the ground floor are beautifully furnished. It's like sitting in your own sitting room. The bedroom was equally well furnished. It was a good size had with two armchairs a very comfortable bed and a well equipped bathroom. The owners hang their private art collection around the hotel which adds to its charm. The staff were helpful and well trained. The only negative was that the portions for the Merrion breakfast were too small for the price being charged. Overall though an exceptional hotel.,5,2016,03,16
200,5 star,"I was treated to a weekend here by my boyfriend as well as Adele tickets for my birthday. I loved every aspect of this beautifully elegant hotel, it's in a great location and we easily walked to the main tourist spots. Staff were also extremely friendly and attentive, the hotel definitely deserves its 5 star status. We had a delicious Sunday brunch in The Cellar Bar and couldn't resist the impressive breakfast in bed the following day! ",5,2016,03,16
200,Wonderful hotel in fabulous location,We stayed at The Merrion for a night over a busy weekend in Dublin but once we entered the hotel it was a sea of calm.  Staff were polite and helpful without being overbearing and the room was very comfortable.,5,2016,03,16
200,Top-quality service,"5 star service in a lovely central building.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff did everything they could do to to make our stay brilliant.  The hotel is not cheap by any measure, and the standard rooms whilst being well appointed are nothing special.  If you are going to stay here, you should push the boat out and go for one of the better rooms.  Facilities, decor, food and drink were all as you would expect - top-quality, but like any hotel of this standard, the only way to really appreciate it is to take advantage of the service on offer - from concierge advice, to valet parking and spa pampering, this place has it all.  All that said, I wouldn't call it intimate as it is a largish property, but you never feel lost in a sea of people either!",5,2016,03,16
200,A True 5 Star,If you are ever in Dublin then stay here. You will not be disappointed. From the moment you arrive at reception to the moment you leave the staff will ensure that you are content. Excellent service without being obtrusive. A fantastic short break.,5,2016,03,16
200,"Stunning hotel, excellent attention to detail, wonderful service. ","This was our second stay in The Merrion and we had another lovely weekend. The hotel is stylish and elegant with a beautiful collection of Irish art throughout, and the little finishing touches to every service made us feel very special. But what impressed me most was the friendly and very helpful staff - from the welcome we received the moment we pulled up in our car at the front of the hotel. I can't recommend The Merrion highly enough and am looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2016,03,14
200,My Favourite Hotel,"Always a delight to stay in this beautiful hotel.  Consistantly good.  Very polite, helpful staff.  A very worthy five star experience. Accommodation and cleanliness superb.Location is ideal and makes for a refined , relaxing and quiet stay.  Easy walking distance to more lively venues if that is desired.",5,2016,03,13
200,Refined oppulence.,This really is a beautiful hotel in a very understated style.  In terms of location it is only five minutes from Grafton Street and all the hustle and bustle of the capital.  It is very quiet and relaxing.  We visited over Mother's Day and it was filled with mums being treated to afternoon tea which looked lovely.  I would certainly return.,5,2016,03,11
200,The Merrion Hotel Dublin,The Merrion is a lovely hotel full of History. The staff are very nice an friendly. The beds are extremely comfortable . The rooms are very spacious. All is very clean. The food cand drink are excellent. The prices could be more competitive. It is an expensive experience.,5,2016,03,10
200,The Merrion and Adele-What a combination!!,"Our three days in Dublin were spectacular. Great cuisine, a fabulous concert and amazing local attractions. Our comfort and enjoyment enhanced by the fantastic suite at The Merrion, the helpful and charming staff, and the excellent food and drink options at the hotel. 24 hour room service is one thing, but a 24 hour bar with a great snack and food menu is just amazing. This matches the Four Seasons experience in many ways and exceeds that experience with the food and beverage service as well as the spirit and charm of the staff.",5,2016,03,08
200,Always perfect,"This was my fourth time staying at The Merrion. To be honest, I wouldn't ever consider staying anywhere else when in Dublin; the reason being is that you know from the moment you arrive everything is sheer perfection!!! You are just made to feel like royalty!!! This was an anniversary treat and to see Adele in concert, we had a wonderful weekend, we dined early in the cellar restaurant which was beautiful and treated ourselves to breakfast in bed which again was beautiful. Can't wait to plan my next visit and as always to all the staff of the merrion, thank you and keep up the excellent work!!",5,2016,03,07
200,Superb stay in Dublin - nothing beats Adele concert and stay at the Merrion Dublin.,"We have been to Dublin this weekend to go to the Adele concert at 3Arena, and stayed three nights at the Merrion Hotel. The hotel experience was similar to the Adele concert - Superb!

Great staff, very friendly, excellent service and great food both in the Cellar Bar and for breakfast. 

This will for sure be our preferred hotel for future visits to Dublin!

200,Most amazing Hotel in Dublin! ,"I had the most divine stay at the Merrion Hotel for 4 nights last month. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left, everything was not only perfect, but beautiful in every way. From the staff to the decor to the cleanliness, it was superb!! I especially loved the gardens and the high art tea. Can't wait to return. ",5,2016,03,06
200,Beautiful hotel and superb customer service,"Our stay in the merrion hotel surpassed my expectations, the staff were fantastic throughout and couldn't have been more helpful, the room was fantastic with a huge bathroom and everything you require.",5,2016,03,05
200,Home away from home,"Very few hotels truly make you feel like you are at a ""home away from home."" The Merrion, however, pulls it off. The entire staff were superb - genuinely pleasant and always helpful. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer. Already looking forward to our return.",5,2016,03,04
200,Merrion Hotel Dublin,Had a really lovely time at The Merrion Hotel. Would  highly recommend a visit. Very nice food and comfortable beds. Staff were very helpful and polite. Our first visit and won't be our last. The spa was exceptional also.,5,2016,03,04
200,"The Ultimate in Style, Beauty & Excellent","I have never stayed in any hotel that can match up to this one in all and any category!
The architectural aspects of the hotel are truly beautiful.  Our room in the main part
of the hotel was just breathtaking . . . it had a tray ceiling, a fireplace, and a sitting room
that was huge.  My daughter even had a separate bedroom.  Everything was decorated
with such taste and style!  The public rooms were so beautifully appointed.  The restaurants were truly fabulous.  The workout rooms were quite nice as well.  Great
staff, great location, and truly one of the most elegant, refined hotels in which I've ever
stayed.  It's very expensive, but you only live once . . . go 1st class!",5,2016,03,03
200,Fantastic hotel,"I think i probably had the worst room in the hotel - 157. right next to a building site and the air conditioning. 

however, even with those it didn't impact my stay. the room was simple but well appointed with a great bathroom.

i spent most of my time in the main building or the hotel by the fire and it really is just a lovely space to work and eat. i even chose to have breakfast there.

i'd recommend this hotel if you want old world charm. it really delivers big on service.

the only thing i really didn't like was the constant bother from housekeeping - on one day i had 5 visits - the cleaner arrived whilst i was at breakfast so i had to wait 30 minutes to access my room, a supervisor then came to check the cleaning once i had accessed my room. 30 minutes later someone arrived to check the mini bar. that evening i had turn down arrive at 6.30 whilst i was dressing. they then came again at 10 when i was already in bed. seemed over-zealous.",5,2016,03,03
200,Holiday,"Great hotel, great location, great staff, great room, great breakfast. Everything was just great :) We stayed 3 nights.

200,"""Perfect Hotel in good location"" You must go for the afternoon tea.Best in Dublin.","My husband and I had two nights here.It was most enjoyable with good service,friendly staff,perfect decor,excellent food and close to Grafton Street and several theatres.
Certainly it will be on our to do list again.You pay for what you get.
The afternoon tea was so so good with excellent service from Amano.Best in Ireland.",5,2016,03,02
200,Winter Stay in Dublin,"Overall, I could not be more pleased with my stay at the Merrion.  The front desk staff, concierge and doormen went above and beyond.  They were friendly, efficient and helpful.   The room was enormous and so comfortable.  The bed was fluffy and fabulous and the bathroom was luxurious.   We had issues with our wifi access and the desk staff sent somebody up immediately to resolve the issue AND to double check my devices.  Not in a condescending way, but to try to be as helpful as possible.  We were very impressed with the level of service. The only flaw in the stay was the spotty service in the bar area and at breakfast.  We weren't rushed and the atmosphere was lovely, but our hot water wasn't refreshed and when we were ready to leave we had to ask for the check three times.  But these items are almost nitpicking.   The Merrion exceeded my expectations and the next time I'm in Dublin, I will absolutely be staying there.",5,2016,03,02
200,PHENOMENAL,"This was the best hotel we've ever stayed at. And we travel a lot. From the moment we made the reservation to the moment we departed the hotel, everything was perfect -- the customer service, the comfort of the room, the small touches like bottles of water with turn-down, the room service... We cannot wait to return (and already miss the bed and pillows)!",5,2016,03,02
200,Understated Elegance,"My husband and I were very fortunate to spend an entire week at the lovely Merrion Hotel. This thoughtfully renovated hotel was a wonderful home base for us as we explored Dublin and the surrounding communities. From the diverse collection of carefully curated art that adorns the public areas to the lovely walled garden to the peaceful pool and spa area, no detail has gone unattended to. But, what truly sets this hotel apart from other world class hotels that we have stayed in is the personal attention given to each guest. One outstanding amenity is the twice a day housekeeping services, which could seem intrusive but somehow did not at the Merrion. I loved having my slippers put out for me each night and having fresh mineral water and an ice bucket waiting when we returned to our room after a long day of enjoying Dublin. The entire staff were at our service for the length of our stay and made this trip even more memorable for allowing us to have such a classically beautiful home base during our vacation.",5,2016,03,01
200,Twenty four hours with clients,"The Merrion Hotel's location was ideal for the work with my clients. The welcome, breakfast & lunch service and room were excellent. Having stayed in many Dublin centre hotels, The Merrion is my #1 choice when prices are at a 'sensible' level.",5,2016,03,01
200,Amazing 5star treatment,"This is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in.. Every detail is applied with class.. Wonderful attentive staff who are genuine in their interest in our stay. Fabulous room, love having the asprey purple water range which shows what a classy hotel this is. 
Sublime cocktails.. Cannot wait till our next visit!!! Thank you Merrion Hotel xx",5,2016,02,29
200,Five star food and Five star service,My daughter brought me for Afternoon Tea as a birthday/Mothers Day treat. There are other reviews that detail the food on offering.  We had a lovely time. It was my first visit to the Hotel and I was really impressed with the friendliness of the staff and their attention to detail in every regard.  The food was delicious - far too much of it - and we were delighted to leave with our grown up beautiful 'Party Bags'!  You can sample a selection of the different teas/coffees on offer. If you want a special memorable afternoon - do book a table.  Hint - book the last sitting as then you dont feel under any pressure to leave!,5,2016,02,29
200,A little piece of Heaven!,"I couldn’t have been more impressed with my recent stay at this hotel.  From the moment I arrived until the time I left I was greeted by every member of staff I came across.  The hotel is absolute luxury.  The room was immaculate with the finest of furnishings, the bed was extremely comfortable and it was lovely and quiet which made it a beautiful place to relax.  I used the steam room and swimming pool which were both superb.  The lounge and bar are both wonderful with relaxing couches and fantastic cocktails.  I stay in a lot of hotels but there are very few at this level.  I highly recommend staying here, there is no chance that you would be disappointed!",5,2016,02,28
200,Utterly delightful in every way.,"This gorgeous hotel will spoil you forever, just spent two utterly gorgeous nights here and can't imagine any other hotel measuring up to this experience. If you are an art lover and have a fondness for gracious living then this is the place to stay in Dublin. They have the most beguiling art collection and the standard of service and attention to detail is superb.Thank you to all the Merrion staff for a fabulous stay.

200,Luxurious hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and absolutely loved it!  On arrival we were greeted by Patrick who took our bags and brought us through to reception.  He was extremely welcoming and greeted us each time he saw us throughout our stay.  Check in was quick and friendly and we were shown to our room by the receptionist.  

We stayed in a Garden wing room which was beautiful and very comfortable.  The bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower and Asprey toiletries.  The room was cleaned in the morning with turn down service later in the day.  A bucket of ice along with replacement bottles of water were delivered with turn down service.  Housekeeping staff at the hotel do an amazing job and along with the other staff were very friendly and always said hello when passing.

The pool at the Tethra Spa was lovely and peaceful.  The changing rooms had a plentiful supply of towels, slippers and robes.  I never had a treatment so can't comment on that.  The staff were very helpful, showing you around when you first arrived.  One woman in particular who was on reception of the spa - i didn't catch her name - couldn't do enough for you.

In all we had an amazing stay and will definitely be back!",5,2016,02,28
200,Merrion Stay,"The staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel was very clean and well maintained and provided for a very relaxing and enjoyable stay. Food and beverage was pricey, but of very good quality. I will definitely stay there again.",5,2016,02,28

200,luxury stay,"I stayed in the main house in one of the old rooms, it was enormous with high ceilings and a really comfy bed. The hotel was so quiet and peaceful, A great place to relax and recharge the batteries for the night. The valet parking was so handy for Dublin, St Stephen's green is just around the corner and the National gallery is nearby too.",5,2016,02,27
200,Perfect,"My husband and I spent a week here this month and it was absolutely perfect. The hotel is beautiful, we loved The Cellar and No. 23 quiet bar where we had the most delicious cocktails by wonderful bartenders that were masters of their craft. The beds were great and we even returned to find cupcakes in our room for our anniversary. The Merrion is located in the heart of south city centre and we wouldn't ever consider staying anywhere else. Dublin is one of my favorite places I've ever been and The Merrion makes it PERFECT!! Thank you to every single employee,  you guys are the best!",5,2016,02,27
200,Fabulous hotel,"We love staying at the Merrion Hotel, certainly the premier hotel in Dublin.  Everything about our recent stay was fabulous.  We had a beautiful room in the Main house.  The Drawing Rooms, Bar 23, Cellar Restaurant and Bar are very nice to relax, eat, and have a drink. The location is also perfect-close enough to walk into the City Center, yet quiet and far from the noise and crowds of the busy city. We highly recommend staying here-certainly a treat!",5,2016,02,27
200,Delightful,A wonderful hotel. I stayed with my partner for a days in February. First off the staff were beyond attentive and delivered excellent service throughout. The hotel itself was beautiful with a well kept and tidy room. In addition food was lovely. Hope to visit again soon. ,5,2016,02,24
200,Perfect Hotel,"A true 5 star hotel, the warmest welcome, excellent facility, every need catered for. Obviously, on the expensive side, but we felt the costs was well justified. Cant recommend the hotel enough, great area of Dublin also, away from the ""norm"".",5,2016,02,24
200,Fantastic,"This hotel is amazing.
My husband and I went for a short break and we absolutely loved it.
The staff are so friendly, very helpful, couldn't do enough for us.
If you do stay here you have to have the art tea served in the sitting room. You need to book early, trust me well worth it.
The only issue we had was parking our hire car in the hotel car park, we didn't know you had to pay for it. It's €20 a day. 
Otherwise couldn't fault the hotel or staff at all.
Thank you for our wonderful stay.",5,2016,02,24
200,Outstanding Hotel ,"Service that's second to none. An all around great hotel, food, lodging and the staff's great attitude. 

The Cellar Bar, in, of course, the cellar is a must see. 

Located in a very convenient location in Dublin Center. 

One of the best hotel experiences I've encountered.  ",5,2016,02,24
200,Beautiful hotel in an excellent location close to Grafton Street.,"The Merrion is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location close to Grafton Street. We stayed in the basic 'queen room' which was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel staff were very professional and accommodating. 

Breakfast in bed was delicious.The bar has great cocktails and a roaring fire. 

We wouldn't recommend the Cellar restaurant, plenty of great restaurants in the city or Patrick Guilbaud upstairs.",5,2016,02,23
200,Absolutely adorable,"One of my favorite hotels, maybe even trumps my previous fav Claridges!

Stayed here in January 2016 and it was just the epitome of unstated elegance. Merrion please don't change a thing.

The venue speaks for itself, the drawing rooms with the open fires were like a home from home.  The staff were so helpful and attentive and really couldn't do enough for you.

The Patrick Guilbaud restaurant was amazing, again perfect service.  Attentive and they noticed everything that was happening, the waiters were directed by a chap that seemed to be the head waiter and he quietly directed them and he was very professional.  We went for the tasting menu with wine accompaniment and every course was delicious.

We are already checking our diaries for when we can fit in our next visit.

Well done Merrion :)",5,2016,02,23
200,Little bit of luxury for young and old!,"This was, by far, the best hotel I have stayed in. We were celebrating our son's 3rd birthday and he was treated like royalty at every step of our visit; from the concierge, to check in, to the waiting staff to the way the room was set up for him. It was a very memorable stay and I would certainly recommend your hotel to others. It is an expensive hotel but in this instance, you certainly get what you pay for",5,2016,02,22
200,The MARVELLOUS Merrion,"An absolutely wonderful experience. The staff were courteous, welcoming and friendly and so very professional. This will be where I will stay from now on whenever I am in Dublin. If I am not overnighting, I will go there for afternoon tea. I love this hotel and everything about it",5,2016,02,22

Travelled with our 2 teenagers who particularly enjoyed their room service ! Definitely looking forward to our next visit !  Thank you",5,2016,02,20
200,Classy,"My first time staying at a classic hotel (I usually go for boutique or modern hotels).  I have to say these older establishment do pay more attention to details.  Robes, slippers, turn down service, and bottled mineral water.  Staff are courteous and friendly and I enjoyed my stay.",5,2016,02,17
200,World class customer service,There is no doubt that the staff of this hotel which is a mixture of local and European stand tall amongst the best the world  has to offer. This hotel is about customer service  experience with good clean facilities. The quality of fixtures and fittings in the public rooms and guest accomodation while far from world class are ample and attempt to create the illusion of luxury.,4,2016,02,17
200,First rate hotel,"This was my first stay at The Merrion and I was very impressed. The rooms are large, modern and very comfortable. The bathrooms were also large and a real pleasure. The bed was very comfortable. In short, a great room. We had breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant which was pure class and style, with great service and a really excellent breakfast. Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful. This hotel deserves more than its 5 stars and is highly recommended.",5,2016,02,17
200,"Beautiful, lovely art and great food","The Merrion Hotel contains many restaurants and bars, all of which are lovely. The spa is great although there is no hot tub, the steam room is perfect.  We stayed in the Pakenham suite, which was beautiful. Afternoon tea was always a treat. Friendly staff. Overall a brilliant hotel.",5,2016,02,16
200,The only place to stay in Dublin,I am a regular visitor and am treated so well. I love visiting this charming hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin. The staff are warm and welcoming and the hotel is old world luxury.,5,2016,02,15
200,Best afternoon tea in Dublin,"What a lovely hotel! The afternoon tea is served in a beautiful cosy room with comfortable chairs and some of the cakes are inspired by the paintings hanging throughout the hotel so they're beautiful as well as delicious. You also get a souvenir catalogue of the paintings included with your afternoon tea. What really makes this stand out from the other hotel teas in Dublin is the staff, you feel cosseted from the moment you arrive, nothing is too much trouble. Treat yourself!",5,2016,02,14
200,One of the World's Great Hotels,"It would be hard for us to imagine a better hotel experience.  While it is true that we have not visited every city and town in the world, in 70 years, 50 of it in sporadic international travel, we have covered a fair amount of Europe, and some of the Far East, South America, Canada, and the United States.  We almost always stay in good places, because there seems to be no reason to leave home if we cannot be at least AS comfortable, if not MORE comfortable in our hotel than at home.  Certainly the Merrion ranks as EXCELLENT for comfort, friendliness and service of staff, and atmosphere compared to all those places in all those 50 years.

Our room was beautiful, with soft colors, spacious, temp easy to control, bed comfortable, very well appointed as was the bathroom.  Everything worked.  Plenty of closet space.  We could have stayed there a month happily.  The bar is charming and cozy.",5,2016,02,14
200,Lovely stay,"I have visited Merrion a month ago for 2 nights during my business trip. From outside, hotel does not look so luxury, but inside you can see best service staff in Dublin. Starting from reception, lobby bar, cellar restaurant, housekeeping up to concierge. 
The rooms are very nice, I really loved the architecture and colours. They use also very ggod cosmetics, offer daily newspaper delivery, coffe and tee. Breakfast is served in Cellar restaurant, a little bit limited choice of cold buffet ( 2 sorts of cheese and 2 salamis), but you can offer hot breakfast a la carte. The price for the drinks in drawing rooms (lobby bar) are little bit overpriced comparing with other 5 * resorts in Dublin. But the service is very good.",5,2016,02,14
200,Valentine's surprise,"Arrived at 7.30 out of a taxi by a very friendly concierge,so engaged with us lots of friendly chat 
 Must say exceptional service at reception
The receptionist brought us to our room and advised us of the location and what was where in terms of restaurants & bars within the hotel .Gorgeous room,so comfortable with free Wifi and lots of variety in the mini bar.However as advised we went to the 'Cellar Bar' most of the staff had sullen faces & were unfriendly...almost seemed like they just didn't want to be at work....we asked for 2 Bombay Gins with juniper berries...it was liked we asked for gold dust....no juniper berries...waitress brought 2drinks to inform us ""No juniper berries""with a sullen face I might add,such a pity really for such a beautiful place and expensive at that...don't let it put you off,perhaps go outside hotel for a Bombay gin with an accompanied Irish smile!
",4,2016,02,13
200,"Third visit, still fantastic ","Great hotel. Does everything right. Food is excellent, friendly and helpful staff, the doorman, reception, spa and restaurant staff are exceptional. Nice location helps too. Lovely atmosphere and garden. Will definitely recommend this hotel

",5,2016,02,13
200,"Excellent Location, Beautiful Hotel","Lovely warm welcome, speedy checkin.  Hotel is absolutely lovely.  Very up market feel to it.  We stayed in the annex garden section of the hotel. Room was really well decorated and spotlessly clean.  Location is perfect for the centre of Dublin. Staff extremely helpful and polite. Would definitely return.",5,2016,02,13
200,Undisputed best hotel in Dublin,"A fabulous hotel. Beautifully renovated Georgian houses provide a very cosy, slightly ""old world"" environment. 

Try to get a room in the old part of the hotel, where the ceilings are high and things generally seem more gracious. 

The food is excellent. My only gripe would be the requirement for a hotel resident to book afternoon tea. 

Don't go if you're on a tight budget - but it does still represent some value for the standards you can expect. ",5,2016,02,11
200,An engagment present I will never forget,"This has so far been one of those most amazing experiences I have ever had. We received a 1night stay as a present for our engagement. When the staff found this out we received complimentary champagne. The room was comfortable, large and luxurious. The bath and products were lovely. The wine was delicious and the staff good fun. The pool was really relaxing - one missing thing: a Jacuzzi especially as the pool  is a little chilli. I had forgotten my swim suit but was able to buy one on site. My one regret- that we left the hotel at all. Next time we stay there we are not leaving the hotel - room service and bar and room all the way. Lovely touch with the Bluetooth speakers also.",5,2016,02,11
200,Amazing stay at the Merrion,"The Merrion always over delievers, and this stay was no different, great accomdation, great service and food with warm Irish charm...The doormen are the best in Dublin! Lovely rooms, especially in the main house!",5,2016,02,08
200,Need to stay over unexpectedly in Dublin ?,"Your'e tired, have had a long day at work and know there's more to come tomorrow - and your'e just too exhausted to drive home and have to turn around and drive back to the city at 5am? You want  a hassle free stay, some room service with tasty food, a good night's sleep in a comfy bed and friendly efficient and helpful staff - not to mention that all important wake up call to get you out of that comfy bed ?  Well then the Merrion is the place to pick !",5,2016,02,07
200,Birthday Weekend Away,"My partner surprised me with a weekend away to Dublin for my birthday, this hotel was perfect. It had so much character and the staff were lovely. Shame that we had building outside our window but that didn't bother us!

We had breakfast in bed one morning, would definitely recommend. Perfect weekend!",4,2016,02,06
200,Unaccustomed luxury,"My wife and I spent a Friday night at the Merrion courtesy of a Christmas present from our daughter (thanks again, Sorrel). The whole experience was fabulous - superb service from all the staff, excellent room with every facility you could possibly need, attractive surroundings including mature gardens and an impressive art collection and a relaxed, informal atmosphere. We dined at the adjacent Restaurant Patrick Gilbaud which took us to a new, stratospheric culinary experience. A day to remember.",5,2016,02,05
200,Definitely Recommend,"Lovely hotel, the rooms are extremely comfortable and they have thought of everything right down to an umbrella,great location, staff exceptional

We enjoyed our time in Dublin and would definitely stay here again
Would definitely recommend",5,2016,02,03
200,Excellent,"Great hotel, great location.  The staff and accommodation were lovely.  The only criticism was a long wait to be seated in the cellar bar.  After a bit of a wait we decided to leave as we hadn't been acknowledged at all.  The bar did not appear to be that busy.",5,2016,02,03
200,very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin,"absolutely loved the place, the staff is very friendly, the hotel is beautiful, and the rooms very well appointed. both bar and restaurant are first class, the guinness is of course the way it should be and the food in the restaurant was really good, I highly recommend this hotel",5,2016,02,03
200,Special 80th Birthday Celebration,"The Merrion Hotel provided the ideal location for the family to celebrate Mother/Grannys 80th Birthday. There was lots to do with the shops, art galleries, bars and restaurants nearby.  The ambiance of the hotel combined with the wonderful staff made everyone feel very comfortable and Mother was made to feel very special.",5,2016,02,03
200,Merrion Hotel,"Wonderful hotel in the centre of Dublin. Beautiful house combining traditional and modern features. It has a wonderful luxurious feel. The  food is great, gorgeous afternoon tea in the drawing room or bar. The  service is impeccable. It also has a great spa and gym.  Highly recommend this hotel in the centre of Dublin.",5,2016,02,03
200,Excellent ,"From the moment we arrived we were treated impeccably by each member of staff we encountered. We were welcomed at reception and our car valet parked without fuss. We were shown to our beautiful room which unfortunately had no view. The only negative. Everything was spotlessly clean and well appointed. The gym and pool areas were also fantastic. We did not dine in the hotel but did have some drinks and nibbles in the cellar bar, also excellent. All in all a lovely experience which we hope to repeat.",5,2016,02,03
200,So gracious and so homely,"Well, what can you say about this most lovely of places - from the very warm greeting by Patrick and the gentlemen at the door - and the Crack - to the warmth of the fires inside to take any chill away and whisk you to the comfort of those wonderful duvets and beds to slumber away the darker hours.   It is a place to dream in and enjoy the cosy bars and fires  away from the gales of the city !   Always a smile on everyones face and so helpful with every small thing you need.   Just relax and enjoy all the facilities which are all Grand and soothing.",5,2016,02,02
200,A Favourite,"This is my favourite hotel in Dublin and I will always stay there whilst I am visiting the city.That blend of hospitality and friendliness is unique.I did feel on this occasion that the room service food quality had slipped.My wife agreed.Hopefully the merrion can address this problem and I can bring my next review to ""excellent""",4,2016,02,01
200,Great Old School Luxury,"I spent decades touring as a concert performer, and was privileged to be able to stay in many of the world's great hotels. When I found that I would be in Dublin for several days with my wife as tourists, I wanted her to experience the old world charm of a truly great Irish hotel. This is as good as it gets. From the minute one steps in to the minute one leaves, you are enveloped in the classic sophisticated experience of a world class operation. From the luxury of the rooms, to the beautiful gardens, to the classic high tea, nothing is overlooked or in any degree less than fantastic.",5,2016,02,01
200,"Great location, very good indeed","This is a very nice hotel. Beautifully appointed. The staff deliver excellent service.

200,No doubt a Five,"We finished our Ireland trip here in Dublin and one thing I found out was that Irish hospitality is second to none. The Merrion only confirms this. It was our honeymoon and the hotel very kindly upgraded our room. But that wasn't why I gave The Merrion 5 star, the staffs were possibly the nicest people on earth and the hotel itself was very well decorated with all the luxuries one can ask for. When we return to Ireland for our next trip we will surely stay here - even for just a night to keep us smiling all the way home. ",5,2016,01,30
200,5 stars all the way,"The Merrion is everything a 5 star hotel should be, luxurious, great service and a wonderful way to start a trip seeing Ireland.  We especially enjoyed the pub and restaurant on the lower level area and breakfast each morning.",5,2016,01,29

200,Classiest Hotel in Dublin,"I live in Dublin.
I frequent The Merrion Hotel often and whenever my NYC friends come, I tell them to stay here because it's the classiest and coolest spot in Dublin. Here's why:
1. It is most discreet of all its guests in the most polite way
2. It feels like you are in someone's home
3. They have the best concierges and doorman in ALL OF IRELAND
4. The decor, the dining and the drinks are above par every single time I have visited
5. The clientele is supreme and once again there is a mellow, discreet but extremely honourable strict privacy code which many people appreciate who want to stay under the radar.
I literally LOVE The Merrion Hotel.
You should go, stay, eat, drink and I KNOW you will be merry.
Slainte,
OLB",5,2016,01,28
200,56 birthday surprise,"I was taken by my partner for a birthday surprise and boy was it a surprise.

I can't wait till the next  time.",5,2016,01,28
200,5++ Star treatment at The Merrion,"Superb weekend. Faultless service and attention from the time of our arrival, check-in, our room, the Cellar Restaurant right through to our departure.

200,Merrion Hotel Experience,"Both myself and my girlfriend had an amazing experience at the hotel. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out it was pure bliss. The treatments in the Spa were awesome. The steam room and pool were not too shabby either. The room was big, lots of space and clean...likewise the bathroom. We only had the breakfast which was incredible. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,01,27
200,So much better than other recent stays,"We had reason to stay and one of the other ""name"" hotels in Dublin earlier this month.  To say the experience was totally different might suggest there was only a low bar to get over. While that is true, the positives of this stay cannot be spoken of too highly. Everything from the efforts to get the specific room I requested to the extras left in the room were fabulous. If I have reason to stay in a top hotel in Dublin again, a call to the Merrion is the only one I'll be making.",5,2016,01,27
200,Fabulous hotel,"Just spent the weekend in this fabulous hotel, where to start? Hotel is beautiful, we had a room overlooking the garden, lovely room, lovely view from the room, very well equipped, Sky Sports for the husband and free movies for me were a treat, the maid is very attentive.

I mistakenly left my coat behind and after a quick phone call, Tom from the Consierge team phoned me back, located the coat and has arranged  to have it posted to me without charge. I really appreciate this kind gesture.  Many thanks to the whole staff for making our stay such a memorable one. We look forward to a return visit.",5,2016,01,25

200,The most magical Christmas,"Our 5th Christmas at the Merrion and it keeps getting better. They surpassed themselves this year with how magical they made it for our children and ourselves. We were thoroughly spoilt and they made my Dad also staying, who was turning 80, feel like a king and spoilt rotten. Personalised stocking for the children in the room, with a carrot for Rudolf and a cookie for Santa on Christmas eve under the tree, along with a visit from Santa on Christmas Eve calling each child by name whilst the parents drank mulled wine, it was just wonderful. The staff knew us all by name no matter where we went in the hotel and we were made to feel special by everyone, the breakfast staff, the cleaning staff, the door men, the reception staff, the bar staff, everyone. AMAZING hotel. Worth every penny.",5,2016,01,25
200,quick visit to dublin - fantastic hotel - expensive but top notch,"no idea what those moaning minnies who wrote anything bad about this hotel ... what a fantastic situation - right across from prime minister office (sorry cant spell tee shirt or whatever it is).  Fromm walking through front door, the staff are fantastic, the hotel is like a time space continuum challenge - looks small from outside but it is huge inside.  our room was immaculate, clean and well presented.  
Not many if any downsides - would only support staff in efforts to maintain such a high standard and key is attention to detail .. there are little bits like our TV wasn't working and little bits of finishing in bathroom - but nothing to derate this hotel in any way.  wonderful and enjoy it .. its great Dublin has something like this place.

last thing it is easy to get to all of the best pubs from here as well .. as my liver can testify.",5,2016,01,25
200,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,"Don't actually know how anyone could hate it here, staff wait on you hand and foot always there at any time or day or night, the hotel is absolutely beautiful and has and amazing garden to. The breakfast is lovely in fact all of the food is and especially the afternoon tea.
The pool and gym is lovely and very relaxing to use. Definitely not for people on a budget as it is very expensive but worth the money!!! ",5,2016,01,24
200,A most congenial stay,"The Merrion provided a warm and gracious atmosphere for our stay in Dublin. While I was attending two conferences, my wife was able to enjoy a relaxed stay, enjoying the comfortable drawing rooms for tea and reading when not walking around Dublin.

200,Christmas in Dublin at The Merrion,"We traveled from the US to spend the Christmas holiday in Ireland. Over Christmas, for four nights, we stayed at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.  It was superb. We had two beautifully decorated rooms, comfortable beds with sitting areas. Traditional,clean,and warm. Customer Service throughout the hotel and restaurants was excellent; every employee polite and helpful.  Plans were made via email with the Christmas Coordinator months in advance and the attention to detail was excellent. We had Christmas tea (amazing) in the fire- lit drawing room, also drinks and a light meal (cozy and good food) another evening in Bar 23. Service and food was excellent. Christmas late- lunch was served in the Cellar Bar and was superb, though service a bit slow. We had a lovely dinner another night in the warm atmosphere of the Cellar Bar.  The hotel is as it says, ""elegance understated"". It is centrally located in a quiet neighborhood and an easy walk to Grafton Street, along with the Museum of Archaeology and Art, and other sites. Taxis and Ubers available too. We won't forget Christmas in Dublin and our stay at the Merrion; absolutely terrific.",5,2016,01,23

I have nothing but positive things to say about this hotel. If you like 5 star luxury you will enjoy the Merrion!,5,2016,01,13
200,"warm and cozy,  beautiful classy hotel","In a very good location, walking distance from most of the city attractions,  you can enjoy an original warm and classy old style atmosphere. All the staff is extremely  kind and helpful , our room was big and comfortable, we had nice amenities and a very pleasant welcome fruit and chocolate basket. 
The cellar internal restaurant serves good food, but the afternoon tea in the lounge is overpriced with a selection of desert and sandwiches that is quite “modest”.
",5,2016,01,13
200,Service levels are 3 star at best...,"I stayed in the Merrion for 3 nights in Jan/16 for business. Hotel is nice. Clean and well kept, very classic decor and in a great location (2 classic Irish pubs O'donahues (sp?) and Donehy & Nesbits(again, sp?) just stumbling distance away. That said hotel is not much to look at from the outside, but given the reviews looked past the decor (and the price) figuring this would be a can't miss location. Don't get me wrong, this is a lovely hotel, but the service leaves MUCH to be desired. I travel extensively globally for work and in this range you expect top notch service that goes above and beyond. Unfortunately the Merrion falls well short here. I had the displeasure of dealing with the front desk clerk (Laq?) who informed me as I was returning from dinner/drinks that the laundry I had left at 8am that morning had not been ""noticed"" until someone turned down my room at 9pm that evening. It was late so thought nothing of it - until I got to my room and also realized that it appeared no one cleaned my room or restocked my minibar. When I called back downstairs to complain, the same gentleman advised me that this was fairly normal as staff don't turn down the room until around 9pm! After trying 3 times to advise these all should have been resolved well before turn- down service, Laq(?) advised me that this was totally normal and didn’t understand the issue, but if I was still concerned someone would deal with it in the am... Given the hour of the night, and the fact I was checking out in the am it wasn’t worth the further effort required to make him understand how poor this answer was. The residential bar staff were also generally good, however we had a horrible experience with a young girl with a mixture of Irish and South African accent who seemed very upset at the fact that ""too many people"" had shown up in this ""apparent"" all night bar after 10pm, and she had no issue sharing her frustration with everyone in our party. In addition - she was adamant we all show our room cards and id before she would serve us. As you can imagine, she endeared herself to everyone in the bar that night. Overall I believe this is a decent establishment overall, but given the price and the reviews I was extremely surprised by the service levels provided by these two individuals in particular. This is at best a four star hotel, and the service provided by a number of staff were 3 star at best. Have stayed at The Marker as well in last visit and would easily choose it over the Merrion. Sad, wanted to like it more...",3,2016,01,12
200,Minimoon,Had a lovely mini moon break in Dublin in December between Christmas and New year. Lovely hotel and very nice restaurant. Shame the hotel did nothing to make it extra special despite us mentioning we had just got married.,4,2016,01,12
200,A beautiful home away from home.,"The hotel is in a good location.  They have a top notch staff and their concierge staff goes the extra mile for you.  We lost our luggage and they tried all possible to assist us in trying to retrieve it.  They helped us with everything from concert tickets, private tour guides, to a rental car booking.The hotel with beautifully appointed, with a pretty little garden and warm gathering areas.  I would definitely return with my family.",5,2016,01,12
200,Christmas Vacation,"I chose The Merrion because of the amenities, mainly the spa.  I was so impressed with the service, the friendliness of the staff, the presentation of the food. The room was beautiful. Easy access to the spa. The location was perfect. The hotel was gorgeous. A memorable experience I will never forget.  A true recommendation for your ""bucket list""",5,2016,01,12
200,First class service,Exceptional degree of service from staff and a memorable stay at a wonderful hotel in a terrific location. We were super impressed with the room which overlooked Leinster House. The bar and dining facilities were brilliant and the breakfast was to die for.,5,2016,01,12
200,Unforgettable Christmas!,"Our family spent 3 nights at the Merrion for Christmas. Have stayed once before, but never at Christmas. From start to finish it was flawless! The Christmas decorations are amazing throughout the hotel and really add to the five star luxury that the Merrion oozes. Our room was spacious and immaculate. My sister had a suite in the Main House which was stunning!
When we arrived at the hotel and the receptionist gave us a great welcome and then gave us a full breakdown of our reservations for our stay. They had organised everything for us!  Our family were arriving at different times, but we were all able to meet together on Christmas Eve, at the Christmas tree where we were given mulled wine while we listened to Christmas carols. It was really special, and a fantastic start to our Christmas! Shortly after that, Santa arrived with presents for all the kids. My niece was so excited and was just delighted with her gift. The hotel offered great facilities for the kids in a play area with board games, toys, movies and entertainment each day. We were really impressed. 
We had lunch on Christmas Day in the Cellar which was excellent. We moved to the lounge afterwards to relax in front of the fire. It was such a treat to have nothing to worry about all day long, but it really did feel like home away from home.
Breakfast every day was good, but busy. A great buffet selection and the best Eggs Benedict I've had in Dublin!
Christmas at the Merrion did come with a substantial price tag, but worth every penny for a Christmas our family will never forget!",5,2016,01,08
200,A lovely Retreat/Treat,"Our favourite hotel to stay in Dublin, we booked an overnight stay between Christmas & New Year. The Hotel is such a lovely relaxing escape from the busy streets of shoppers. We received a wonderful surprise on check-in as we were upgraded to a Jnr Suite which was delightful. The fireside lounge areas have such a lovely ambience.The entire service from all the staff and overall experience was 5 star all the way from arrival to departure. Looking forward to our next stay already",5,2016,01,07
200,Understated 5Star,"We stayed 2 nights kicking off 2016 in understated style and elegance. We had stayed in August with our children and it was absolutely magnificent and this time around it didn't disappoint and certainly delivered on our expectations, based on our previous experiences. It's fabulous....if you are staying in Dublin this is the only place to stay, plain and simple!! ",5,2016,01,06
200,Remarkable Dublin Stay,"From the moment you arrive in the Merrion, you feel very special indeed, friendly staff, beautifully decorated rooms and great food choices in house. This is my second stay here in three years and I hope to be back in the future.",5,2016,01,06
200,christmas wonderland,"What a lovely place to celebrate Christmas. Hotel is decked out, Santa makes an appearance and carolers. Staff is very eager to please. Great bar too. Food is very good, great breakfast was included with our room. Christmas dinner in hotel dining room was a delight. The lobby is so charming with fireplaces and seating for tea or cocktails.",5,2016,01,06
200,"Excellent location, excellent staff, lovely place","Stayed here several times on business and can’t fault the place.  From check-in to check-out you are treated extremely well.  
Every room I have had to date (5 visits) has been larger than expected.  Rooms are well serviced and extremely clean.
Haven’t had the chance to enjoy the spa yet, but fully intend to on my next visit.  This place is so good my wife will likely come with me next time to enjoy the facilities and Dublin.
Admittedly a little expensive, but understandably so.",4,2016,01,06
200,Definitely the Best Choice in Dublin,"We just returned from our second stay at the Merrion.  Our only mistake was in waiting 5 years between visits!

We had the pleasure of spending Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day at the Merrion.  It was truly a pleasure.

On this stay we booked a Garden Wing 1-Bedroom Suite and all I can say is ""Wow!!""  We had previously stayed in the historic building and we preferred the garden wing.  The room was huge with a separate bedroom, living area (including couch, desk and dining table for 4), a very nice main bath (dual sinks, separate tub and shower), plus a separate powder room.  The room also had this other little hallway/room.  I think it is the connection room if you book this as a two bedroom suite, but we had it as additional space - we used it for our luggage, and such.  The room really was wonderful.  It had THE largest bed (for those who want space).

Because most of the city was closed down during out stay we generally did eat in the hotel, which was a great choice.  We particularly like the Cellar Bar area.  A great place to have a drink and just relax.

We both had massages which were incredible.  I also used the pool and steam room which were very nice.

The hotel staff is amazing coordinating anything you request from pick up at the airport, to all dining and spa reservations.  Anything we requested they brought right away.

The hotel is very well located - an easy walk to just about everything.

The only area for improvement would be the WiFi.  It was included, but in our room it was spotty at times (we were at the far corner).

In short, we thank the Merrion for a great Christmas stay!!  You can't go wrong with this hotel.",5,2016,01,05
200,Georgian View,This is a great spot. I liked how they combined the different mansions to make the hotel. I love history and that fascinated me. Easy walking distance for anyone who enjoys a stroll and the hop on hop off bus stop is right there. I loved the artwork throughout the hotel. My two favorites are the statue of Joyce standing in the courtyard and the odd masked men near the elevator. Just wish they had a guided tour for those staying in the hotel. The infinity pool in the spa was beautiful.,4,2016,01,05
200,5 star stay in Dublin,"My wife and I recently celebrated our anniversary at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. The Merrion is 5 star from top to bottom. We could not fault the place in anyway. The room was spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable and beautifully furnished. The staff are very professional, courteous and a pleasure to deal with. Whatever we requested to the room was delivered very promptly. The Merrion is located right in the centre of Dublin City and in a stunning part of town. We will be back without a shadow of doubt.",5,2016,01,05
200,"Great Hotel, Great Location, One Caveat","The Merrion provides great service, great food, and the rooms and overall quality of the hotel are top notch.  One cautionary note to keep in mind about your room location.  We booked a room in the garden level.  When we checked in, we were told that we were being upgraded to a king room in the main building, which we obviously appreciated.  Turns out, however, that our room was right above the ballroom where there was a wedding reception going on with loud music until 11:30 pm on a Sunday night.  It obviously made sleep much more difficult.  Bottom line: make sure if you book a room in the main building that you know exactly where it is, and ask if there are any major events or receptions going on late into the evening during your stay.",5,2016,01,05
200,Wonderful as always,"Took my children for a little Christmas/New Year's break. The attention to detail, the little extras, the service and the luxury and comfort at every level made for a wonderful experience for us all. The location is also excellent and the concierges, some of whom have been there a long time, are better than I've come across anywhere - if it can be done in Dublin, they'll organise it or provide high quality advice on it.",5,2016,01,05
200,"Light, when all around is Grey","we stayed between Christmas and New Year when Dublin , robbed of its pre Christmas euphoria, is a grey wet city which fades to gloom only yards off the main drag. The Merrion has a wonderfully light, contemporary feel ( no gloomy 19th century oil landscapes of Connemara), whilst retaining the traditional charm and central location of the building. Added to this is smiling service and decent sized rooms and decent , ( safe, not gastronomic) food. the only thing preventing a 5* is price , given we prefer the main building rather than traipse down hallways to get to the more moderately priced more modern extension buildings. a fine Hotel.",4,2016,01,05
200,Remarkable Uncommon Service Experience,"This is my favourite hotel in Europe. It has a wonderful ambience, a special atmosphere, unique décor and spacious luxurious rooms with huge bathrooms. There is so much to love about this hotel. 

What makes it all the more different is the remarkable uncommon feeling that I have found nowhere else in my travels that every single employee WITHOUT EXCEPTION looks after you as though they, individually, are the host and that it is a genuine pleasure for them to look after you (i.e. serving your needs but in a way that you would a guest in your home) while at the same time being 100% professional and aware not to be intrusive. Their eyes meet yours with real warmth and welcome. 

What is even more extraordinary is that this uniqueness to serving crosses the international range of cultures of the staff. This is therefore not just experiencing famous Irish hospitality but also the Merrion's own culture. Super!",5,2016,01,05
200,Best Dublin Hotel,"Top class.  Great location.  Attentive and friendly staff.  Beautiful interior and really cozy.  Michelin restaurant adjoins hotel.  It's premium priced,  but if you can afford to splash out its a great experience.",5,2016,01,04
200,"Fine stay, would not rush back for the price","We spent just one night in the Merrion over New Year.  It was a fine stay, not great, not bad.  The check in staff were busy and distracted.  The room was ok, clean with a good bathroom. There is some renovation work going on which meant there is nothing much to look at inside the courtyard. It is in a good location -  The rest was pretty average for 5 stars.",3,2016,01,04
200,top to toe great,"This was our fourth stay in the Merrion and each time it has been different but always great. Its never perfect but there is nothing that one would lose sleep over unless one was a professional grump. On this occassion we stayed one night and had a package that included brunch in the cellar bar rather than breakfast. We had a basic room but did get an upgrade to a garden view on the third floor so were very happy. Arriving at the Merrion is always one of the best bits as the concierge staff are so welcoming and efficient. The car is whisked away and luggage managed really efficiently. We were there the weekend before christmas so it was full of afternoon tea groups and everyone dressed for the season. I love that you get shown to the room and staff are so warm. Rooms are great and with great space and equipment. For me if you are going to leave a kettle in the room in a hotel like the Merrion then the tea and coffee provided should match. Mini cafetiere might do it. That said the rest cannot be questioned and the beds are unbelievably comfortable. we did get some late night noise from the Baggot St revellers as we had the window slightly ajar, liking fresh air in bedrooms but that was the time of year and also that the planned hotel extension was not in place and that will screen the noise.

Brunch in the cellar bar was great. Breakfast in the hotel is excellent but even they admit that, as happens in big hotels, timing is everything and one can be left queueing if opting to come as late as possible. Having Brunch at 12.30 solves that. Coffee in the room and a dip/sauna sets one up. Its also a menu so one is less inclined to keep popping back to the buffet, which is good. Melon, rocket and parma ham followed by huevos rancheros while my wife ate the ever fabulous merrion fish and chips ( miniest, sweetest peas and fantastic batter). All in all the kind of treat that one should always have and worth 2/3 days in other places. Great for sitting and reading in the lounges, interesting art, fantastic situation in the heart of the city with stephens green and merrion square on the doorstep as well as the national gallery. Se you in 2016",5,2016,01,03
200,End of xmas break,"Wow what a lovely hotel, very friendly staff who could not do enough for us......will defiantly be visiting again! Lots of people around but only guests who are staying in the around but not overrun by ""joe public!"" Beautiful lounge for afternoon teas and bar23 perfect for nightcap ",5,2016,01,03
200,Beautiful hotel,Stayed one night and was upgraded to beautiful suite.  All fab.  Staff very friendly and very professional.  Very Christmassy hotel and the cellar bar is well worth a visit.  Breakfast is definitely worth adding to your bill.,5,2016,01,02
200,Relaxed elegance in the heart of the city,"A gem of a hotel.  Excellent location, wonderful staff, fantastic rooms.  Don't miss the art tea in the afternoons.  The best High Tea in town. The small bar on the ground floor is a great place to spend a rainy afternoon.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,01,02
200,Luxury and relaxation in the heart of the city,"We stay at the Merrion several times a year, the most recent being for two nights on the 28th and 29th of December. We love the ambiance which is relaxed but very luxurious. The building itself is beautiful, the staff are very friendly and always helpful. Rooms in the old part of the building are stunning and give you a real feel for the history of theplace. The newer rooms look out on an internal courtyard and are large and very quiet. My only criticism, which is a small one is that the pool/spa area is a little tired and could do with a face lift but this is a small thing in what is other wise a wonderful establishment.",5,2016,01,01
200,Almost faultless,"From the welcome on our arrival through the excellent food and delightful restaurant staff to the self guided audio tour of the hotel's substantial art collection there was really very little to find fault with at The Merrion. The hotel is conveniently situated for a short walk to central sites; the concierge was very helpful in assisting us with travelling further afield in the city. The rooms are extremely comfortable and very well attended by the hotel staff, for whom nothing seems too much trouble.  If I had to be really nitpicking I would say that the marble bathrooms feel a little dated but that really is scraping the barrel to find a fault. It's the staff who make it excellent, though. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,12,31
200,Recent Stay ,"I stayed in the Merrion Hotel in Dublin last night.
To say it was a fantastic experience is an understatement. The staff were extremely friendly and professional. When I said it was an anniversary room service sent us a bottle of Baileys and a box of chocolates as a gift. 
The rooms were extremely comfortable and the location was ideal for shopping. 
The little gestures of the morning paper and the bottles of complimentary water left in the car for our journey home were appreciated. 
Was it expensive?  Yes. Was it worth it? Most definitely. Will I go again?  Absolutely. 
Well done to all the staff and thank you for your hard work and for making my stay so memorable. 
Ruby Whelan 😆",5,2015,12,31
200,Christmas Magic,"Me and my husband stayed at the Merrion for Christmas. I live in Dublin so it was a big treat as we just wanted to pamper ourselves for few days. The Merrion lived up to its reputation, roaring fire, choir and afternoon tea served in the beautiful lounge. We had dinner on Christmas day and the food was simply excellent. We had breakfast the next morning and enjoyed every little bit of it. Unfortunately our stay was over and we had to return to a very busy Grafton Street. I will put the Merrion on my Christmas wish list for next year.",5,2015,12,30
200,Very disappointing ,"Stayed here over Christmas. Room was fine and spacious but food very poor in cellar restaurant. Some of party had fish and it was completely overcooked,  hard and flaky. Beef was tough. Eggs at breakfast overcooked also. Some starters only arrived as the rest were already finished. For a five star hotel not five star food. In addition, as they have so many bookings for afternoon tea there is a real lack of space for hotel guests to relax other than in hotel room.  Compared to similar stays on the past it definitely was not as good as before. Maybe it was just a one off but it was not what I expected at all.",3,2015,12,29
200,Very fine hotel,"Stayed for Christmas. Staff are friendly and very professional and there is a good ambience. 

The other patrons were very international, self aware, classy  and well turned out. 

It's also  in a nice part of central Dublin. 

Only flaw is breakfast is served in a less than soulful underground room with a vaulted ceiling (like a catacomb) and was pretty expensive even for a 5 star hotel. Would have liked to seen more of a breakfast selection for the price. Some Swiss Muesli would have added to the selection somewhat.

Overall nice hotel. Not stuffy or sniffy, well situated, comfortable, international, Manned by willing and friendly staff. Staff seemed to be selected from all over the world. Recommend.

200,A Five Star with incredible attention to detail,"On a business trip to Dublin and had the pleasure of staying at the Merrion. I had a room in the old house which was only superb, spacious and with a view into the inner courtyards of the hotel. I  did not have dinner in the Hotel on this occasion, but enjoyed a superb breakfast. The staff are so professional, courteous and helpful, I simply could not fault any of them, and the attention to detail showed the quality of management from the top down.   This Hotel along with the Fitzwilliam around the corner in St Stephens Green are the best two Five Star Hotels in Dublin",5,2015,12,29
200,"Elegant, relaxing in perfect location.","An elegant building with efficient but relaxed atmosphere.  Beautiful rooms and very quiet overlooking the beautiful enclosed garden.  Even the Mimosa is blooming in December!
Central location within walking distance of most attractions.  Very pleasant and helpful staff.  Cellar restaurant excellent and moving upstairs to brighter location which will benefit from natural light.  Afternoon tea seems very popular and looked amazing.",5,2015,12,29
200,"Excellent location, and service.",This is a really beautiful hotel and the building has some lovely old Georgian features. The hotel is perfect for afternoon tea. Overall it is expensive but being the top rated hotel in the city you would have to expect this. We spent one night in a nice luxury room with lovely decor. Breakfast was not included in our rate and we went out to get this so we cannot comment. Great location close to city centre shopping area but quite a walk from O Connell Street area.,4,2015,12,28
200,An Indulgent Way To Spend An Afternoon.,"This is a review of the Art Tea' at the Merrion. 

Arriving into the drawing rooms at the Merrion on a cold wet Dublin afternoon you are greeted with a roaring fire. The room are cosy in an old fashioned way and the perfect setting for afternoon tea.

Your hostess explains the 'Art tea' which consists of two courses. The first course is a traditional tea stand with a mixture of sweet and savory sandwiches and cakes. To accompany this you can choose from an extensive list of teas and coffees. 

The second course is a selection of three pastries which draw their inspiration from the art collection of the Merrion hotel. Your tea comes with a glossy magazine which documents the collection and which you can take with you. 

Now all of the food is delicious and don't worry about being unable to eat it all in one sitting; the staff are happy to box any of the cakes you can't eat so you can take them home with you.

The whole experience is relaxing, and a great way to pass a few peaceful hours in the heart of the city.",4,2015,12,22
200,Extremely Comfortable Hotel,"Stayed one night in The Merrion after a Christmas Party in town, and had a very enjoyable visit.  The room was big and spacious and the bed very comfortable.  Check in and out was friendly and efficient and the valet service for my car made the whole experience very easy.  After a long lunch in Patrick Guilbauds, we continued on in the Lounge of the Hotel and it had a very relaxed and enjoyable evening.  The hotel has a great buzz to it at this time of year with people coming and going.  Would highly recommend.",5,2015,12,19
200,Heaven,"Heaven, that is how I would describe our stay in The Merrion.  We have stayed in other five star hotels in our capital city, but was is by far best experience of all.  A significant birthday was the very special reason for our stay and what a lovely treat it was.  Could not find any kind of fault, everything was excellent, beautiful room, most comfortable bed I have ever slept in,the  food and the ambiance.  The staff in this hotel are exceptional, so friendly and warm and they pay so much attention to detail.  A very special mention to David the gentleman who met us at the door, so nice and welcoming.  Thank you to all!",5,2015,12,16
200,A lovely long lunch was just the right start to the Christmas festivities,Christmas lunch with a corporate group was a formal affair with nicely discreet but excellent service. Dessert was the highlight with the marzipan Christmas tree the unlikely but surprising favourite with its luscious fruity centre. The cellar bar had a terrific buzz and was great for mingling and chatting after the formalities were over. Great way to spend a Friday afternoon before Christmas.,4,2015,12,15
200,Beautiful Hotel,Such a beautiful hotel. We stayed here for a pre wedding night away. We were greated with champagne and strawberries.  The beds are so comfortable. The spa is excellent. The star of the show is the breakfast. Definitely the best breakfast I've had in any hotel. Also cannot say enough about the staff. Very professional while being extremely friendly. ,5,2015,12,15
200,excellent hotel,"Stayed one night ahead of meetings in Dublin in December 2015, would highly recommend. Excellent quality, service and location. Would visit again for business or leisure. I ordered breakfast to the room which arrived on time with the morning paper and was delicious.",5,2015,12,11
200,24 Hours in Dublin,"Great hotel, we got there at least 6 hours before we could check in (friends surprise 50th) and they looked after us still taking are bags and moving them into the room once available. The hotel has a nice feel to it with small rooms here and there to relax, get tea/ coffee and so on. Nice bar tucked away so if those who don't want to see such things don't. The room was very smart clean with enough in it to make you feel comfortable. All the staff were helpful and accommodating to our needs. In or near as the centre of Dublin you can get to anywhere from it and no more than 15-20 minutes from the airport. Cost of a taxi 20-30 euros.",5,2015,12,11
200,First class service,"From the moment you walk in the staff are super attentive and make your stay here.
Sadly, we only stayed one night, we dined in the restaurant which was very enjoyable and would definitely stay again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2015,12,11
200,Brilliant Staff - great ambiance -,Superb staff - great service with a smile everywhere. Heart of Dublin great place to stay. Only slight niggle was the quality of the breakfast.  It was  adequate - but it was no better than  a very  average hotels buffet breakfasts and had less choice. It was not 5 star in quality or choice but only a minor hitch in an otherwise lovely weekend.,5,2015,12,09
200,Reluctant to leave,"The hotel has a peace and tranquility about it that makes you forget that you are in the middle of Dublin. What really adds to its excellence is its quietly understated standard of professional service combined with a friendliness and nothing is of any bother attitude. You are their guest! 
The rooms and facilities are as you would expect from a good 5 Star hotel however its the staff that set this hotel apart from others. From previous visits to this hotel I can vouch that on a nice sunny day, and they do occur in Ireland, the outside terraced area is heaven. 
The hotel Cellar restaurant is very good but to really push the boat out Dublin's only 2 star Michelin restaurant, which is with the hotel grounds, is well worth a visit.",5,2015,12,08
200,Great hotel and friendly staff!,"This was where we stayed our first night in Ireland. The staff was incredibly friendly. The food in the pub in the hotel was delicious. The hotel itself was very pretty and the rooms were nice. The bed wasn't the most comfortable in the world, and you are right in town so late night party-goers definitely can wake you up at any hour.",4,2015,12,07
200,The Merrion hotel,What an outstanding and enjoyable experience. Incredible hospitality and service from all of the staff at The Merrion hotel. I would highly recommend The Merrion Hotel and would stay there again tomorrow. Looking forward to returning.,5,2015,12,07
200,Merrion magnificence!,"Ideally located in the heart of Dublin, 5-10 minutes walk to Grafton Street area, the Merrion Hotel is a 5 star Georgian building, with elegant decor. Staff are impeccably dressed, very welcoming and helpful.
Bar No 23 is open 24 hours for residents, cosy ambiance with log fire and great cocktail menu. 
The Cellar Bar on the basement level is a wonderful area I would guess a converted wine cellar! Lots of nooks and crannies to seat your group for dining in the restaurant area there. 
The hotel also boasts a spa which unfortunately, on this trip, I did not get the opportunity to visit. 
Afternoon tea service looked amazing and the gardens were very pretty and well kempt. 
I am quite a fussy tea drinker so seldom order tea. However tea service here was simply outstanding. Silver tea service on heated silver tray with Wedgewood china, I had the Merrion tea blend - sublime!
Rooms are well equipped and spacious; bed was large and comfortable; in-room dining was professional and well presented. 
I will be returning to Dublin and will hopefully be able to return to the Merrion. Would highly recommend. ",5,2015,12,06
200,Serenity in Dublin,"The Merrion is without question one of our favourite hotels in the world. It's easy to overlook it when comparing it to some of the more famous hotels around the globe as it seems almost cheap in comparison to some in London or Paris. Yet this hotel is the one I always look forward to coming back to, never have a bad stay at, discover new things each time we come and always leave looking forward to our next visit. What more could you want?

The basics here are all more than covered; the grand yet homely feel, the beautiful lobby, the cosy cellar bar, the 24 hour lounge bar (why go out?) and the excellent quality of the rooms and everything in them. Beyond that however this hotel starts to get even better; the food quality and well judged room service menu, the fact that breakfast is served until 11.30am, the wine list, the two star restaurant in the hotel and the excellent concierge team. Put all these things together and you have a compelling offer. For me it's Irish hospitality at its best and I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. 

This hotel has an independent family feel rather than that of a chain. It's a home away from home where you can relax in elegant surroundings and leave feeling fantastic. A masterclass in Irish hospitality.

",5,2015,12,05
200,Fabulous and Classy Hotel - must place to stay!,"An all round wonderful hotel.  Rooms spacious and very comfortable, even the slighly smaller garden rooms.
The hotel has a feel of class and sophistication. Lovely G&T in the cosy bar...
Breakfast delicious and service top notch.... I have not stayed anywhere better in Dublin. Enjoy!!",5,2015,12,04
200,Lon Weekend at The Merrion,"As a hospitality industry veteran, I would compliment the entire staff for a first rate experience. From accommodating our early arrival to arranging transport for our activities, the service was great. The well appointed room and the morning coffee infant of the fireplace. We can't wait to come back.",5,2015,12,04
200,...the only place to be in Dublin,Best spot in Dublin.  Understated sophistication and elegance.  Fantastic and attentive staff.  The mark against which I judge all other hotels...and the only place I'll ever stay in Dublin.  Be sure to treat yourself to afternoon tea (and reserve early) as well as sit by the fire in the upper drawing room for morning coffee.,5,2015,12,03
200,Top notch,"Delightful location, overlooking beautiful scenery. Very arty. Nice rooms. Best part being the staff. Enjoyed a drink or two with the bartenders.
Breakfast was included and plenty to choose from. Didn't get a change to try the pool",5,2015,12,02
200,Great hotel in great location,"Located in the City Centre of Dublin the Merrion provides a great experience in a great location.  Dining options are great, accommodations are spectacular, and location is near the main areas of the city.  Will definitely stay there again in future travels to Dublin",5,2015,12,02
200,Great Hotel,"We had a great experience. Hotel is first class. The rooms, the service and the food are all great. When in Dublin this is the place to stay. They have several places to get drinks and food. Very popular place for afternoon tea. Conveniently located close to pubs, restaurants and shopping.  It is probably a higher prices option, but well worth it. If budget is not an issue stay in the main building. ",5,2015,11,30
200,Nice but a few things to look out for!,"I stayed at the Merrion for a week while in Dublin on business. I used to stay at the Merrion but in recent years have opted for other Dublin hotels closer to my meeting venues. This time the Merrion was closer so I opted to stay here based on my previous experiences which have been very good.

Let me start by saying that traditionally the Merrion has been known as a Dublin institution and the best hotel in town. By and large that is still the case.

Upon arrival my room was not ready so I droppped my bags and headed out to my meetings. When I got back to the hotel I was pleasantly surprised to see that my room had been upgraded and my bags were delivered ready for me. Very nice and typical of the service I'd come to expect.

The rooms are very nice and unlike some Dublin hotels are also a good size. The Bathroom was a little tired and it seems that the bathroom door had been replaced with just a plain door at some point that was not in keeping with the rest of the room decor. I think the bathrooms could be updated now to allow the hotel to compete with some of it's newer competitors such as the Marker.

Other than this you cannot fault the Merrion's general decor, it is a lovely hotel.

The Ball was dropped however in regards to the service standards. A couple of points I experienced which are worth noting.

1) My fiance joined me half way through my visit and despite pre-advising the hotel of this she was treated with suspicion when I arrived and the hotel even went as far as wanting to call me during my meetings to confirm her identity despite my fiance having showed them her passport.

2) As a guest of the hotel I have a general expectation that should I want to dine in the hotel in any of the dining areas, this should be accomodated. I had planned on having lunch in the Lounge one day, only to be told that all the empty seating areas were reserved by outside guests for afternoon tea. I can understand that afternoon tea at the Merrion is an important social event, however the better hotels allocate at least a few tables for hotel guests that might wish to utilise the facility. I was told flatly and unhelpfully that I’d have to sit in the bar, and it was only after I complained twice that we were moved into the lounge, where I noted there were still empty tables available throughout the course of my lunch!

3) Heat! I had forgotten how warm the hotel gets. I understand that open fires in the Lounge area are designed to throw out heat, but my bedroom was stifling, and I had to keep the window open all the time as turning down the thermostat didn’t seem to make much difference. Lucky it was November!

I’m not being precious despite how this must look, but when you pay as much for accommodation in the Merrion as you do you expect to be treated with respect, I felt this was sorely lacking at points and this will certainly influence my choice of hotels when visiting Dublin on business in the future, which is a shame.",4,2015,11,30
200,Top Class Hotel,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, the staff could not do enough for us, our room, which was in the old house, was fabulous. The cellar bar has a lovely atmosphere and was warm and cozy on a cold night. The restaurant didn't let us down either. I only wish that our stay had been longer! ",5,2015,11,29
200,Great location and nice spa!,"The Merrion is about a 10-15 minute walk from the main area in Dublin. It's a beautiful hotel, but it is a little stuffy. I felt like there was almost too much staff and it seemed like they were always watching us. It was a beautiful hotel though! Great pool and sauna. ",4,2015,11,29
200,Afternoon tea what a disappointment,Serious consideration needs to be taken on board for what should be a 5star treat. So disappointing.  Shortage of staff serious complaint here.  Sandwiches boarding on bland and serious concern of freshness of bread. Scones hot but tasteless. Art confectionary an absolute joke 3 pieces of tasteless presentation.  Room for afternoon tea a walk through for resident guests plus check in guests too serious to be acceptable for paying afternoon tea guests.   Having experienced a considerable amount of Afternoon Tea hotel experiences in Dublin the Merrion is definitely on the bottom of the list. Merrion take note your Afternoon guests deserve far better service and respect.   Will definitely not be recommending or giving vouchers for what you are offering.,1,2015,11,28
200,"Excellence at The Merrion, Dublin","Stunning hotel, steeped in history. Beautiful room but most of all outstanding customer service and friendly staff. Staff could not have been more helpful, including valet team. The Cellar Restaurant is a wonderful experience - again with wonderful service.",5,2015,11,27
200,First Class,Top Nosh - wouldn't dream of staying in any other hotel. I stayed in this hotel with my Mum this time a little treat for us both. Everything was top class. We had afternoon tea which was a real treat. Our room was really lovely. The staff so so friendly and helpful.,5,2015,11,25
200,another wonderful stay at the Merrion hotel,"This is the place to stay in Dublin. friendly staff, wonderful rooms and ambience and great food. Treat yourself to a memorable dinner or lunch in Patrick Guidbaud's restaurant. the beds are very comfortable and the staff are very helpful.",5,2015,11,25
200,Shane's Birthday,"While attending a birthday party in Dublin, my son and I stayed at the Merrion.  It's a beautiful hotel. Very unpretentious and elegant. Could not be in a better location in the center of the city.  The restaurants and bar were wonderful also. And the gardens in the courtyard are beautiful. A real gem. I would recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends. Excellent value.",5,2015,11,25
200,Perhaps the Best Winter Hotel in the World,"Superb service, nothing was too much trouble. Cannot wait to return again. Situated near the center of Dublin. Very pleasant reception and bar areas. The staff are highly professional and the whole experience is world class",5,2015,11,25
200,"Great hotel, lovely, staff, fabulous food","This hotel is beautiful with tasty food weather it's afternoon tea, breakfast or dinner. it is centrally located and close to all the city centre hotspots.  The staff are fantastic too and very efficient. Lovely hotel bang in the centre of Dublin.",5,2015,11,24
200,Hotel Stay,"Stayed here on 12/11/15.
The hotel is a fantastic hotel and the staff are very polite and helpful from the concierge to the reception to the bar staff.
The rooms are excellent with great facilities and cleanliness. It has a fantastic bar and restaurant situated in the basement which also holds the swimming pool and leisure facilities which are also to a very high standard.
On the ground floor there is another smaller bar and three separate seating areas where most people seem to indulge in the very tempting afternoon tea with so many cakes you'll want to loose a few pounds before your arrival!!
The hotel is well situated for seeing Dublin's shopping and night life and is about 35 minutes from the airport.
The hotel is not cheap, however you get what you pay for and as a treat you will not be disappointed. It's not that much more to do it properly now is it?",5,2015,11,23
200,Wellington was born here,"Set among four impeccably restored Georgian townhouses in Central Dublin (the western most of which claims to be the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington), this charmer of a hotel offers a one-of-a-kind luxe experience while eschewing stuffiness for Irish charm.",5,2015,11,22
200,Leading Hotels of the World,"We stayed at The Marker and The Merrion, part of Leading Hotels of the World, and had a fabulous experience at both. The staff goes out of their way to meet your every need, the accommodations are first class.",5,2015,11,21
200,Exceptionally relaxing Afternoon Tea with top notch service,"If you opt to have afternoon tea at the Merrion Hotel I strongly recommend fasting in advance :)  This is a *large* tea with plenty of variety on offer.   Unusually, it incorporates a ""tea menu"" with several choices and they will make as many different pots of tea as you require during the course of the afternoon and its a good opportunity to sample different teas.  I had 3 different types and my dining partner had 2.    The setting was very pleasant with comfy sofas and armchairs dotted around two drawing rooms replete with not one but two roaring fireplaces on a cold winter's day.    

Service was polished, professional and friendly. The staff were exceptionally quick in replenishing our teacups and indeed taking orders for new pots of tea despite the fact the rooms were full and they were clearly very busy.    One slight drawback in this area was a South African waitress who appeared to also be a supervisor who loudly admonished the other staff for leaving teapot trays on the sideboard and other minor misdemeanours.   It was like a disturbance was taking place at the other end of the room even at a distance and when it was repeated later right beside us was a little too much.  I really think this could have been handled very much more discreetly if indeed it was such a problem in the first place.    Apart from that, this experience was total bliss - they really know how to do Afternoon Tea in style at the Merrion.  Anything we could not manage to eat was offered to be taken home in a box if we liked.     Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,19
200,Class shines through.,"As the title says class shines through and it is from the minute that the doormen welcome you to the Merrion till you leave.
Rooms are gorgeous , lovely bed and the turn down service in the evening is exceptional. I have never experienced anything like it anywhere , not that I can afford luxury hotels all the time.
As my wife and I where celebrating 20 years of marriage , this weekend expense wasn't on the agenda so I booked us into two of Dublin's top hotels and restaurants. The Merrion lived up to all expections and breakfast was good but the Fitzwilliam edged it on the cooked options. 
Thank you Mention I really enjoyed my stay.",5,2015,11,18
200,Beautiful,"Top notch service and a beautiful room
Accommodations were beautiful. I was upgraded upon check in 
Great location in Dublin, walking distance to everything and close to a hop on hop off stop
The staff went above and beyond to take care of me during my visit. 
I would visit Dublin if just to stay here 

",5,2015,11,18
200,Excellent!,"Stayed here with my husband and had a wonderful time , the hotel is amazing and staff are so friendly, polite and efficient.
Breakfast was perfect in such a relaxing atmosphere and staff couldn't do enough for us 
The beds were comfortable and luxurious 
We can't wait to return!",5,2015,11,18
200,Very Special Place - first class,"Stayed here for a weekend in October.  Hotel is beautiful.  Was also lucky enough to be treated to Afternoon Tea.  
Staff were attentive and friendly and you are certainly made to feel special while staying here. Had breakfast here which was nice but to my mind very overpriced and if staying again I would not chose to breakfast here.  
The Merrion is a great place to explore Dublin from and the staff were very helpful.  The cellar bar is lovely with great staff and very cosy.  Did not eat in the restaurant in the evening as it was fully booked but would like to give it a try next time.  I will be back!!",5,2015,11,17
200,A Class Act.,"Enjoyed a few days with my wife at the Merrion whilst exploring Dublin. Located on upper Merrion Street a thirty minute taxi ride from the airport in a classic Georgian terrace this is a top class hotel.

We arrived very early in the morning so checked in, left our bags and headed straight into town. Our return was delayed until late afternoon by traffic disruption in the city but as soon as we arrived our room was ready with bags in place.

We had a garden facing ground floor room which was large, very clean and comfortable. Room comprised a huge bed with a good firm mattress, armchairs with coffee table, desk/table/chair, mini bar and safe. Plentiful storage and hanging space, iron and board, tea and coffee making equipment.

A large bathroom of Italian marble accommodates a bath, walk-in shower and washbasin. Good selection of toiletries by Asprey (London). Room furnishings are completed by large TV, and daily complimentary water and Irish Times. There is an evening turndown service and the standard of housekeeping is excellent.

Hotel has plush public areas with open fires, nice bar areas and the entire hotel environment is quiet and relaxing. The garden area is delightful and would be a pleasure to sit in on a warm summers day. The swimming pool/spa looked good but sadly we did not have time to use the facilities. We had breakfast in the basement restaurant where the food was varied and cooked items provided to order. The staff here are quietly attentive and the food really well presented. It was obvious that the hotel is very popular with the more discerning business clientele.

This is a beautiful hotel but the real badge of excellence is the quality of the staff who without exception based on our experience are superbly professional at all times, extremely friendly and helpful and highly motivated. Clearly very well trained their customer engagement is of the very highest standard making a point of addressing you by name and treating you as a valued individual. Many other hotels around the world could take lessons here.

We liked Dublin which is easy to walk and of course has plenty of pubs shops and restaurants. The ""hop on - hop off"" buses are a good way to get your bearings. As tourists we really enjoyed the Guinness Store house, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St Stephens Green and Temple Bar. The latter is apparently the main tourist hotspot but we were told pricey at night. Shops galore around Grafton Street and along O' Connell Street and Arnotts the department store on Henry Street is one of the best we have seen anywhere.    

We lunched in the town with great Irish Stew at the Guinness Store House and lovely bangers and mash at the Last Stand Public House. As we did not want to walk far in the evenings we dined near the hotel. Marcels on Merrion Row has a great pub atmosphere where we enjoyed a brilliant starter of Butternut Squash Soup with our meal. Excellent fish and chips at Doheny and Nesbitt on Baggot Street. Slightly more sophisticated dining and great service at Bang restaurant on Merrion Row although my wife found the downstairs area near the bar a bit claustrophobic.

Enjoyed a wonderful trip to the friendly city of Dublin staying at the Merrion hotel which ranks as one of our best ever hotel experiences.",5,2015,11,16
200,One night stay but wished it was longer,"My wife and I stayed in this 5 star hotel for a one night break. All staff were attentive warm and extremely pleasant. We got a free upgrade to a suite which was an amazing spacious well equipped room. We had the Michelin magic experience which is Bed and breakfast and dinner at the hotels Patrick Guilbaud restaurant.
Loved every moment and will be back next year.",5,2015,11,15
200,Excellent,"Cannot fault anything, great staff ,lovely hotel we love our room.Our first visit together to Dublin and we are enjoying evey minute of our visit.Lots to do and see such friendly people everywhere you go.We will certainly be returning for a repeat visit and bring our family with us next time.",5,2015,11,14
200,Beautiful Hotel,"The Merrion Hotel is a beautiful hotel nicely situated in Dublin. Nestled among other Georgian houses, it is at once quiet and a spot that you wouldn't know immediately was a hotel. Even though it is in a quiet area it is near everything. Walking distance to many of Dublin's most iconic places; the National History Museum, Grafton Street, Stephen's Green etc.",5,2015,11,14
200,Elegance and Service,"The Merrion is a lovely hotel. The service is excellent and the rooms and common areas, elegant.  Also, wonderful location. Very comfortable bedding.  The one complaint is with the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, a Michelin Star restaurant located in the hotel.  We both got food poisoning after eating there.  When we contacted the hotel about this this they informed us that the restaurant is a private entity, not owned by them.  They did contact the restaurant for us (See recent review of Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud on Trip Advisor). Otherwise, we loved the hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again…JUST DONT EAT AT RESTAURANT PATRICK GUILBAUD!!!!",5,2015,11,13
200,Wonderful 5 Star treatment,"I was giving a talk in one of their lovely rooms last week and en route realised I had forgotten the adaptor needed to connect my macbook to their projector. I rang ahead while in the dart and was delighted with the response. By the time I got there, there were three members of staff waiting to help me. They searched their hotel for the correct piece of equipment which they found within minutes. They were gracious and professional and saved my bacon!!! BTW if they hadn't found the piece I needed they were happy to lend me a hotel laptop as a ""plan B"" so I was covered either way. This is the second talk I've given at the Merrion and I love being there. From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like the most important person in Dublin. Doormen carry your bags, concierges ask if they can help. Everyone makes eye contact and greets you with warmth. I can breath a sigh of relief once I'm there as I know I will be give the utmost care. Pens and paper pads are provided for all guests and there is at least one member of staff on hand at all times in case you need anything. 
It is a lovely venue with wonderful staff and I can't recommend it highly enough. I haven't stayed there but had no reason to expect any less when I do.",5,2015,11,12
200,Excellent staff,"We arrived on a wet and miserable Saturday morning, the porters greeted us with umbrellas, took our car and helped us with luggage. Room was good with everything we required.staff attention to detail was excellent, breakfast had a perfect selection. The hotel is quiet sedate and lacks atmosphere but I couldn't fault it",4,2015,11,11
200,Dublin's Best,"Top in every category - ambiance, service, rooms, staff. I am always very unhappy to be in Dublin when the Merrion is fully reserved and I have to stay elsewhere. This is a true 5 star hotel that never disappoints. Book early.",5,2015,11,11
200,High quality accommodation in Dublin.,The only thing I found wanting in this hotel was the long walk from reception to our room! Otherwise the whole experience of staying in this place was great.  From the outside the hotel does not give much away as to what you will find inside.  We used the swimming pool which was a delight. Staff were so attentive. I loved the real fires in a couple of the public rooms.  We did not eat in the hotel as my partner had a very early start - and for 29 euros per person I would have wanted to take my time over the meal.  The room was exceptional. Furnishings of the highest quality.  And the bathroom with both a bath and a separate two person shower was very spacious.   I am so fortunate to be able to travel with my partner whose job takes him to many countries and hotels of the highest standards.,5,2015,11,11
200,Another marvellous stay,"Yet again the service, rooms, bar and food were superb. The staff are always friendly and courteous. From the moment you hand over your car keys, relax in the Cellar bar and hit the pool - you can finally unwind. The breakfast is quite simply the best in the island.",5,2015,11,10
200,Sublime Dublin Hotel,"The Merrion embodies the highest standards of a five star hotel. Customer focused staff, elegant rooms, classic luxury, situated in a central location. Spend the day touring Dublin, then retreat to the hotel for the calm refuge that it is. It sets a hotel standard that others try to achieve.

Be sure to have a drink in one of the sitting rooms in the Main House. Sit by the fireplace and enjoy the beautiful rooms filled with museum quality artwork. The service is attentive. It's no wonder that locals come for cocktails in such a serene surrounding.

While a grand hotel, the dress is both casual and formal. Jeans and formal attire are both welcome.

The hotel makes a concerted effort to obtain guest feedback. I think it is because they truly care about customer satisfaction. The Merrion is worth the expense and compared to five star hotels in other major cities, it is reasonable.",5,2015,11,10
200,5 star luxury at its best!,I stayed in this hotel last Friday with my sister. From the moment we pulled up at the door everything was perfection. Our car and bags were taken as soon as we stepped out and we were walked into reception by the door man who was really friendly. The staff at reception were very helpful and the guy who walked us to our room was cheery and let us know all about the hotel. The room was beautiful and perfectly presented. The little box of chocolates on arrival was a lovely perk. After a few hours shopping in town we returned to the bar for a drink- I couldn't decide what I wanted so the barman helped me by telling me about lots of their different cocktails. I ordered a flirtini which was delicious! We returned to our room to get ready for dinner and it had been tidied up and the temperature of the room was just right. After our night out the beds couldn't have been any more comfortable. We didn't have breakfast the next morning as we had already made plans but we did have coffee which was served with some delicious little chocolate cakes. Again the staff on the hotel couldn't do enough for us. After another bit of shopping when we got back to collect our car the staff had packed our luggage for us and off we went. I will most definitely be back before Christmas for a night with my husband. Really well done to everyone who helps make the hotel what it is. It's a credit to all the staff.,5,2015,11,10
200,Elegant Retreat in Heart of City,"The Merrion offers just what you'd expect from a five star in-city hotel:  superb service, lovely facilities, all the amenities, and a fabulous location.  We arrived at 6:30am after an overnight flight from the States...were warmly welcomed and installed by the fireplace in one of the public rooms...coffee and tea service appeared right away as we caught our breath and planned our day.  Our room (Garden Wing, facing interior garden courtyard) was spacious, bright, well-appointed, and quiet.   Shout out to the Cellar Bar - we grabbed a light dinner there one night, it has atmosphere and our meal was ample and tasty.  The Merrion is top-notch and the place to stay in Dublin (budget considerations aside).",5,2015,11,08
200,Excellence at it's best....,"Spent a weekend here in May 15... It was our first time staying at The Merrion Hotel .. I had heard fantastic things about this place however it surpassed all of them .. High standards in all areas ..Just brilliant. well done to the staff for making our visit a special time .. Loved , loved and loved this place so very much..  We can't wait to return in the not so distant future ... Thank you ...",5,2015,11,08
200,Luxury,"A little haven of pure luxury in the heart of Dublin. My wife and myself were celebrating a special ocassion and where better to celebrate but staying in the Merrion with dinner at Guibaulds. It lived up to our every expectation from the moment the concierge took our car when we arrived until the moment the wonderful front desk staff checked us out, we felt special and pampered and oh so comfortable.",5,2015,11,08
200,Merrion Hotel,We stayed at the Merrion Hotel for 2 nights during the Dublin Marathon. The check in was very slow we had to wait over an hour and a half for our room to be available to us we eventually got to our room at 4:30 despite the hotel website saying check in was after 3pm.The room was very clean and very quiet just what I requested. Every body at the hotel should be commended for their helpfulness and friendliness  with even the smallest request being no problem. Breakfast was very plentiful and good variety also it was put on early for the Marathon runners which was very good. The pool and spa area is amazing very relaxing. We had dinner that evening in the cellar restaurant and we were waiting 35 mins for our main course. There didnt seem to be enough service staff and as a result we left and didnt have the following two courses. Adjoining diners also ordered their dessert the same time we ordered our main course and were left waiting. As a result they left before their dessert arrived. This coloured our view of the Merrion a little and I wouldnt recommend the service in the restaurant. My friend had the marathon massage and said it was heaven on earth. Check out was very fast. However my bill was wrong but the very helpful receptionist resolved my queries very quickly.We loved our time in the Merrion hotel and would stay in the Merrion again and recommend everyone to stay in the Merrion but maybe on a b&b basis instead.:),5,2015,11,06
200,Another excellent stay,"I have stayed in the Merrion quite a few times on business, as a couple and as a family and the level of service surpassess my expectations each and every time.  The reception and conceirge team made this the perfect break. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the rooms spacious and inviting.  I normally stay in a garden room but on this occasion decided to bring my 10 year along and was upgraded to a beautiful room in the main house.",5,2015,11,06
200,Pure Pleasure,"Our stay in the Merrion Hotel was quite literally FANTASTIC. Being a 5 Star Hotel our expectations were of course 'high' but I can quite honestly say that we were certainly not 'let down'. From the time of our arrival on a busy Saturday afternoon to our departure on the Sunday afternoon, we experienced nothing but complete & utter relaxation and pleasure & this was due in no small way to the extremely attentive staff. Nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely be returning and I cannot wait....",5,2015,11,05
200,Excellent Choice in Dublin,Excellent hotel for a long weekend to explore Dublin. Superb location within walking distance of Grafton Street and the Temple Bar District. Also good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity. This hotel and it's staff will do everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible.,5,2015,11,05
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"We had an incredible stay due to the excellent staff at the Merrion Hotel while celebrating my husband's birthday. We thought the attention to detail was exceptional. We highly recommend the Cellar Restaurant, No. 23 and Patrick Guilbaud as well.",5,2015,11,04
200,Picky Traveler Finds Her Favorite Hotel,"We recently returned from a 10/24/15-10/29/15 stay at The Merrion Hotel for a combination 10th Anniversary/Dublin Marathon celebration.  I admittedly have very high standards where it comes to hotels, both in terms of hotel quality and service, yet The Merrion managed to meet and exceed my expectations at every opportunity.  From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were treated wonderfully, and this experience carried through our entire stay.  It took the door staff one brief meeting to remember and never forget our names and other personal details (they were all wonderful, but Tommy's warmth and sincere interest in us really stood out).  The front desk staff was efficient and helpful.  The concierge was incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond for us numerous times, helping to make all of our plans hassle free.  Room service was without exception accurate, efficient and helpful.  Housekeeping was always timely and very thorough.  The spa staff, restaurant staff, tea room staff... all top notch.  Every employee we encountered was sincerely friendly and took obvious pride in their work.  The location was very central and convenient, the building and grounds were gorgeous and lovingly maintained.  We had a lovely inside courtyard garden wing room and it was beautifully decorated, quiet and very spacious.  We have traveled extensively both domestically and internationally and have had the pleasure of staying at some of the ""best hotels in the world"".  The Merrion, hands down, is the best overall hotel we have experienced to date.  There is nowhere else we will stay the next time we come to Dublin, and nowhere else we will recommend to our friends and family either.  My only disappointment is that we did not find The Merrion sooner.",5,2015,11,04
200,Special treat,"Just had the absolute pleasure of staying at this hotel on Halloween night to celebrate an anniversary. 

Usually when staying in Dublin I go for affordable 3/4 star hotels as it's just somewhere to sleep! I was surprised by my fiancé and can honestly say this was the most beautiful hotel I've stayed in, so elegant! This is certainly not 'just somewhere to sleep'. 

On arrival we were greeted by the very pleasant porters and reception staff. We were a couple of hours early for check in so wanted to drop our bags to store. We were lucky to be told our room was in fact ready so we were so happy to be able to check in and freshen up before heading in to Dublin! We were personally shown to our room with a mini tour on the way which was lovely.

When we arrived at our room, it literally took my breath away. So fresh, clean and bright and the bed was massive! The bedsheets were so crisp and the pillows and duvet sooooo blissfully comfortable! (Would love to know where the pillows are from actually) The mini bar was full and vast - the best I've ever seen!

I can't praise this hotel enough, the staff were amazing and always had a smile and a hello for you when walking past in corridors, the staff really make the place. I'm glad to say that I didn't feel out of place as I thought I may feel staying somewhere so 'fancy'.

I was absolutely spoilt with flowers in the room and champagne arriving, as well as the little halloween treats.

We went out for lunch in Dublin and I couldn't actually wait to get back to our beautiful hotel room! 

We ate at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant and that was a great dining experience (will do a separate review). 

The following day, after a beautiful Irish breakfast with fresh pastries, we then headed to the spa for an all over body massage each. We went a bit early to use the facilities and although it wasn't the biggest or best spa area I have ever been to, Laura gave me one of the best massages I have ever had, I asked for a very firm massage and I definitely got what I asked for! 

That you very much for an excellent and hopefully will have the opportunity to return some day! 

",5,2015,11,04
200,Incomparable,"I have been a lucky gal in my lifetime and have stayed at some very lovely hotels, both for business and pleasure.  I don't think there is one of them that is better than this place - and I'm staying in the lowest category room that they offer!
The service is impeccable.  None of these automated responses but actual interest from everyone I've encountered that seems to wish me to have a lovely time.  The room is lovely, the food is good, the location is perfection.  No doubt the hardest part will be having to leave!",5,2015,11,01
200,Totally 100% fabulous!,"We were at the Merrion for our week in Dublin (end of October, 2015).  It was one of the most amazing hotels ever - fully worthy of 5 stars.  Beautiful, clean, lovely room (290 in the Main House overlooking the city) and the best part was the staff.  Literally everyone we met, from front desk staff to servers to bartenders were wonderfully helpful, friendly, and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was great.  Especially the concierge staff, whom I cannot say enough about.  Their recommendations for tours, restaurants, suggestions, were 100% spot on.  Loved everything about this hotel.  Thank you to all who made this the perfect week!",5,2015,10,31
200,First Class!,"From the location to the art to the delightful international staff, the Merrion is everything that a first-class hotel should be.  The fire-lit public rooms were more like family rooms in an ornate country home, the concierge more like a concerned older brother--the Merrion is far from being some faceless international hotel.  Highly recommended for any occasion!",5,2015,10,31
200,Ireland Trip,We started our treatment at the Merrion and then later joined a tour group from and American College that travelled to Donegal.  This hotel is excellent in all regards and we actually were somewhat saddened to relieve this place.  It is in a prime location  in Dublin Ireland an extremely convenient to the surrounding points of interest.  I will definitely stay here again on my return trips.,5,2015,10,30
200,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel while my husband ran the Dublin Marathon.  Fantastic location with both the start and finish within a few minutes walk of the hotel. We had a room in the Garden Wing which had a really comfy bed.  What makes this hotel so special are the staff who without exception are friendly, happy and helpful.  Hope to be back soon!",5,2015,10,30
200,Best Hotel EVER,Spent a week in Dublin and had the best experiance staying at this hotel. The staff was increadable and the service was the best I have ever had in a hotel.  The bar/drawing room was a great place to have a light meal or an after dinner drink.,5,2015,10,30
200,Elegant hotel!,"We wanted to do some thing special for the new year in fashionable Dublin and stayed at the fantastic The Merrion Hotel. We love every minute of our stay there- afternoon tea is a must and the staff was wonderful, great location for on foot sightseeing parks and landmarks look out for the Oscar Wilde statue at Merrion Square.",5,2015,10,30
200,Best service in dublin,"Have stayed in this hotel a number of times, the experience and  level of service is always excellent, nothing is too much trouble. The decor is beautiful, the rooms and beds are really comfortable. Great location, a couple of minutes walk from the city centre. The afternoon tea is the best in the city.",5,2015,10,30
200,Understated Elegance and Luxury,"We went to the Merrion Hotel to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary.  Upon arrival we were told that in honour of this event we were upgraded from the standard room to a luxury room in the Georgian part of the hotel.  This was a pleasant surprise. We were brought to our room by a concierge who explained all the facilities of the room.  There was also a plate with four cupcakes and Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on a plate.  This was a lovely touch too.  We had dinner in Patrick Guibalds which was really amazing, the service and food.  Breakfast the morning was also fantastic as was the service.  The bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in and the pillows were so great I even had to ask what the make was when we were checking out.  Hopefully will make it back there to stay soon.",5,2015,10,28
200,"Dublin, 3 night stay","Hotel was fantastic, with the only disappointment being the rather pretentious over priced Michelin Star restaurant. Nearby restaurants, recommended by the Hotel were excellent.  Hop on Hop of Bus, a must and then revisit nearby sites on foot to get true feel for Dublin. Also great for shopping, which is in walking distance.",5,2015,10,27
200,Expensive Luxury,"The hotel is beautiful and historic, the rooms are spacious, very comfortable, and lots of amenities are provided.  Elaborate full breakfast is included. Excellent food and service in the Cellar restaurant.  We stayed in the older part of the hotel.  There's a beautiful spa and fitness center in the newer part, which we didn't have time to enjoy.  The hotel houses an amazing collection of fine art. Didn't like the feeling of having to tip a dozen people for every little thing; we asked if we could leave one amount to be added to a fund for the entire staff and were told that we could. I wish Reception had told us this when we checked in.",5,2015,10,27
200,Exceeded expectations.,"I can't say enough about The Merrion. From the staff to the rooms to the spa, it was fantastic. We stayed in twins rooms with a garden view. The rooms are pristine and perfectly comfortable. I can't wait to come back. 
",5,2015,10,26
200,Perfection ,"Stayed here from Fri 23rd Oct for 3nights for my  birthday weekend ,took in Jools Holland and his Orchestra on the Fri night ,was fantastic, we stayed in room 101 on the ground floor looking onto the gardens ,superb view,the service was superb which you come to expect from the 5star rating. Used the spa pool and steam room ,had drinks in the cellar bar listening to jazz music ,it was a perfect weekend and the staff were all very professional, and attended very quickly to any of our needs ,would highly recommend this and will definitely come back .",5,2015,10,24
200,"Excellent, every detail was oerfection","The bad part about starting a trip to Dublin/Ireland at the Merrion is that likely the rest of your stays will be a disappointment! The service here is what sets it apart, I am SO glad we stayed here rather than the Shelbourne! Fluffy towels, comfy beds, outstanding food. But the service, the service is exceptional from the doormen and concierges (which imo are the very best in the city) to the front desk to turn down and room service. It appears that everyone here loves their job, and that makes for an excellent guest experience! I should note that while beautiful, this hotel also provides that experience to children, quite simply they love them! ",5,2015,10,24
200,The Best of the Best in Dublin,"If you are looking for impeccable attention to detail in all aspects of your stay, I would highly recommend The Merrion. The thing I liked most about the Merrion is its first class but unpretentious atmosphere.  Although the purpose of our recent trip was business, we brought our seven year old son and scheduled a few days to see the sights in Dublin.  The staff extended a genuine and warm welcome to our son (including some special surprises). Don't miss the guided audio art tour or the several fine restaurants in the hotel.",5,2015,10,23
200,A Georgian Hotel at its best,You have too much money in your pockets or at least € 600 for a room in The Merrion? Embark on this superb hotel! The quit garden area is as excellent as the drawing rooms inside. Admire the fantastic art collection there if you are an art lover. Staff: just superb.,5,2015,10,23
200,Faultless,"I can't really add much more to what has already been said by other reviewers. If you can afford it or want to treat yourself then simply stay here when you're in Dublin. The service from the moment you step out of the taxi, doorman, bellboy, concierge team and then reception is faultless. We were taken to our room (King suite with balcony overlooking gardens) by friendly, helpful lady on reception. Room was spotless, spacious with one of the largest beds I've seen, with smooth, crisp sheets. Breakfast was a little small but quickly served and tasty. Only downside, if there was one, we opted for the Brunch in the Cellar Bar on the Sunday and the food was OK but not anything special and the service erratic, probably due to the rugby that was on the TV's/large screens everywhere. Overall though, can't fault The Merrion and when next we return to this wonderful city, we'll head back here.",5,2015,10,22
200,Beautiful Hotel for the last two nights of our Honeymoon,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous and in a good location.  We enjoyed our stay here for the last two nights of our honeymoon but I am not sure we would pay the high price on our next trip.  To be fair, we were tired from traveling and didn't get to take full advantage of all the amenities this place offered.  One thing I will say is that it had the best mini bar I have ever seen in any hotel and the room service staff was phenomenal.  I think if we do stay here again, we would pay the extra money to be in the main house! The Garden wing was quite a walk to exit.",4,2015,10,19
200,Extraordinary,"Exemplary service, fine food and located in the cultural hub of Dublin.  One of the finest hotels we have stayed in. A good variety and quality of restaurants are nearby and shopping is only two blocks away.",5,2015,10,19
200,Very Good ... But Could And Should Be Better,"A premium quality and priced hotel, so you would expect the best. Therefore the things that didn't go right are more noticeable. The first is that I was kept waiting for nearly an hour after the earliest check-in time for my room to become available. The bedrooms in the annex were perfectly satisfactory if a little generic, especially at the price. When it came to paying the bill, it took the receptionist three goes to get it right. On the first two attempts, items had been left off the bill, which (if I had been so minded) I could have just paid and left. Each time I had to point out to her what items were missing. When finally she got it right (20 minutes later), I was not offered any thanks or apology. I jokingly asked if I could have a small discount having helped the hotel get its charging right, but all that elicited was a blank stare. As a hospitality professional, I think the Merrion needs to up its game.",4,2015,10,19
200,Fantastic hotel,"The Merrion just oozes class. The staff are professional yet warm and welcoming, always smart and stylish. The room was fantastic, beautifully appointed and with lots of lovely touches. We loved the cellar bar, really authentic setting. We stayed with friends and we all agreed this hotel rates 10 out of 10!",5,2015,10,18
200,Perfect in every way,"Dublin was our first stop on our vacation to Ireland and Scotland.  We could not have been happier.  Great room, great service, excellent concierge, beautiful grounds.  And a wonderful breakfast in a beautiful setting.  Concierge gave us great recommendations for things to do and dinner spots",5,2015,10,17
200,An experience not to be forgotten.,"Magnificent hotel in the heart of Dublin.
Lobby nice, staff absolutely fantastic.  Afternoon tea rooms, Just wonderful.
Downstairs in the Cellar restaurant and bars, just walking down the gardens and into the restaurant is an experience not to be missed.  The gardens are beautiful, its an oasis in the middle of the City. Food was lovely and beautifully served.  Staff could not have been nicer.  Would return everyday if I could afford it.
Will definitely try afternoon tea there.
MUST SEE HOTEL.",5,2015,10,17
200,A Garden View?,"After a lengthy email correspondence with the Booking Manager we agreed that two adjoining  King Bed, Garden View Rooms, would best suit our needs.  On arrival the king bed was actually two single beds joined together and this resulted in a very poor night's sleep.  Also the rooms do not currently have a garden view - rather they look across to a large green hoarding trying to cover up an extensive building site.  This was not mentioned to us at  any time during the booking process.  At least the building work was stopped for the weekend - during the week the noise must be unbearable!  In summary do not pay for a garden view room as there is no garden to see and check on the bed arrangement when booking.",2,2015,10,16
200,Great location and great service,The Merrion is a good hotel with a very friendly staff. The hotel itself was a little underwhelming for the price point. Our Georgian house room was a basic room with a 500+€ a night price tag. The service and location where the high points.,4,2015,10,16
200,Elegant - world class hotel,"The Merrion certainly earns its' rating with beautiful rooms, delicious food and a very cozy area for afternoon tea.  The service could not have been better. Friendly, helpful staff and very clean.  The hotel was very accommodating in giving us directions and making reservations.  The doormen were absolutely delightful.  Don't miss afternoon tea in front of the fire!",5,2015,10,15
200,One of The Most Beautifully Run and Welcoming Hotels in Europe,"I recently returned from Ireland and a tour of country houses. Our Dublin base was The Merrion Hotel. Having stayed there on past occasions I knew of the superlative Irish art collection housed within the hotel and the comfort of the rooms, beautifully decorated with every possible amenity. This most recent stay of six days total was extraordinary because of the polish, charm, cheerfulness, and helpfulness of every staff member I encountered. You could not pass a member of staff in a corridor without a cheerful ""Good Morning"" or ""Good Evening"". The efficient and charming wait staff in the cellar restaurant knew my name day one and by departure I was greeting them as old friends. The porters and concierge team were helpful, perfectly groomed and happy to carry out any request. I can think of few hotels anywhere that offer this level of attentive service and in such a natural and friendly and thoroughly professional manner. Highest marks to the team at the Merrion Hotel and thank you for making my (and our entire group's ) stay such a memorable and happy experience.",5,2015,10,14
200,World class elegance!,"Every time our business brings me to Dublin, I stay in this hotel.  I agree with many of the comments here - elegant, understated but amazing service, and everything just fits and feels right.  I always have the most wonderful stay as well as sleep when I stay in this hotel.  The staff is very friendly, most willing to help, and always with a ready smile. 

There is a two-star michelin restaurant (Patrick Guilbuad) to excite your palate and the hotel is an easy walk to the Business centre.  What more can you ask for?  Will definitely go back.

Visited in Feb 14,Mar 14, Apr 14 and Jul 15.",5,2015,10,13
200,BEST HOTEL IN IRLAND!,I stayed there already in 2014 during paddys day. This time I stayed at the Merrion only for 1 night. Got a nice room with a very big King Size bed. Spa/Bar/Restaurant were amazing. Best Service ever and wide selection. I also enjoyed the highnoontea session. Amazing tea selection. This is absolutely the best hotel in Dublin and Irland! I can very very highly recommend this location.,5,2015,10,13
200,Wonderful staff and inviting surroundings,"We spent two nights at this hotel in a stunning suite and enjoyed the dining room on 3 occasions.  I liked all the surprises tucked away like the garden area or the meditation space.  Our suite was large and accommadating, although the bed was a little too high for me to get into (I am 4 foot 10).  We called and they quickly supplied a step stool with no judgment, just pleasant smiles.  Dinner was fantastic and the staff was exceptional.  Breakfasts are beautifully orchestrated and we enjoyed tea in our room which was delightful.",5,2015,10,12
200,Possibly my favourite hotel in the world!,"They say nothing bad could ever happen in Tiffanys... The same is true of the Merrion. It's simply pure elegance, understated but fantastic service, and comfortably but not ostentatiously furnished. 
I had the most wonderful stay here and I wished I never had to leave. ",5,2015,10,12
200,Simply Amazing!,"I could live here!  Everything you could possibly need or want is in this hotel.  The staff is awesome!  Upon arrival, they walked us to our room - not just the typical directions where I always get lost.  The No 23 Bar is lovely!  No argument this hotel and the staff are 5 stars!!  We can't wait to visit again!",5,2015,10,11
200,What a wonderful Hotel,"On the last leg of a quick tour around the UK and Ireland
So glad we chose The Merrion,
There is nothing they haven't thought of to provide in the rooms,
The Hotel has a warm and welcoming feel,
The Decor in the public rooms and guest rooms is elegant and beautiful and the staff are so courteous and helpful.
I know when I return to Dublin one day I will stay here again.",5,2015,10,10
200,Consistently superb,"Have just returned from my fourth stay at the Merrion and as in previous stays it did not disappoint.  Discrete excellence in every way, from accommodation to staff.  Just cannot fault this hotel, will definitely return.",5,2015,10,10
200,Birthday treat.,Spent 2 nights here last week to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The always wonderful staff made us feel very special throughout our stay. Our room was perfect. The Merrion is our special place in Dublin and it never fails to delight.,5,2015,10,10
200,Initial Thoughts,"We are on a three week tour, England, Scotland & Ireland.  Just completed the first two legs and now in Dublin starting our Irish tour.  Thought we had been at the best when we stayed at the Savoy in London, but The Merrion is even better; much more modern but keeping the historic feeling alive.  Service has been absolutely fantastic.  Everybody is so helpful.  Our tour operator left us a little in the lurch but the hotel has done everything possible to make things right.  Had a late lunch in the Cellar bar and the food was great.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,10,09
200,Business Trip with Sightseeing,"Very interesting and fascianting town. I was extreme positively surprised and will go back for a weekend trip. The Hotel Merrion is a very good place to stay. If you are a beer drinker or not, you have to go to visit Pubs!",5,2015,10,09
200,Worth the money,Considering this is a City centre hotel we had good value (3 nights Euro 840 including breakfast) for a standard queen room. As L GEM members we might have been entitled for an upgrade but no luck on this occasion. The room was spacious but a bit bland and the only slight niggle was that the air conditioning was too noisy.The hotel has valet parking which I think is essential as a first timer to Dublin. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Both the Michelin starred restaurant and the ordinary restaurant are very good.,5,2015,10,08
200,Artist's Tea celebration,Having visited this wonderful hotel previously we finally experience the famous Artists Tea for my wife's birthday. A truly wonderful experience made all the better by the attentive service of Julia and Luca. cannot say enough about this hotel. The standard by which all in Dublin should be judged. We are busy planning our next trip!,5,2015,10,08
200,"Great rooms, common areas need a little updating",The rooms are first class.   The common areas seem somewhat tired.  The chairs needed to be restuffed a decade ago.   What is that about.     Very attentive staff.  The eastern european housekeeping staff in particular is very professional.,5,2015,10,08
200,"Garden rooms, tea lounges, delightful staff","The welcome and introduction was the best of the trip. It had warmth and authenticity.
There are at least two sections of the hotel, the historic wing and the newer garden wing, with differing rooms. The dining room is underground - very pleasant, lovely food - somewhat expensive given current exchange rates.
Every request was attended to promptly, courteously, as though it mattered - concierge, emergencies, travel, general queries.",5,2015,10,07
200,The best Hotel in the world!,I have been staying at the Merrion for over 15 years and it never let's me down. From arrival to departure the experience is first class and the hotel magnificent! The staff is attentive and very pleasant.,5,2015,10,07
200,Luxurious and Extremely Comfortable ,"We stayed over in the King Superior room overlooking the garden and it was divine.   The service was incredible and the rooms were spacious and wonderful!  The cellar bar service and food was wonderful,  add was the breakfast!  ",5,2015,10,06
200,Re Visit with family Thanks for Listening,"I was there Christmas 2014 and complained about the breakfast here on Trip Advisor. After much tooing and frooing  management kindly paid great attention and invited us back for brunch on the house which was excellent.We enjoyed this at the end of August.
We went back again, with no announcement, after all this with 4 guests on Sunday last October 4th and the whole experience was wonderful from start to finish.  We all had something from the cellar brunch menu and it was spectacular.  Merrion you have 4 new admirers -  thanks for paying attention to my complaint and rectifying it.  This is the reason I inform ""Trip Advisor"" because I complained when it was an issue and will compliment accordingly.  Just a tip for the Merrion: do pay attention to what you offer on the normal breakfast and consider offering this level of choice especially include the Eggs Benedict etc and try to incorporate some of this success you have in the brunch menu  into your breakfast on a daily basis.  I'll definately be back and so will all my family and their extensions!!!",5,2015,10,06
200,No better hotel,"The Merrion in my opinion may be the finest hotel overall  I have ever stayed in.    The accomodations are spectacular - terrific living space, amazingly comfortable bed, fantastic bath with superb amenities - everything was perfection.    Dining there was outstanding as well - whether a light lunch in the bar or a lovely dinner in the restaurant - everything was very well done.   And I can't say enough about the staff of the hotel - they epitomize customer service - from the bell man to the staff behind the desk - the room service staff to the dining staff - everyone was clearly focused on making the experience the best for the customer.     Have to give this hotel a perfect 10.",5,2015,10,05
200,Superb!,"This is ranked the best hotel in Dublin and justifiably so. It is hard to fault it.
The service was absolutely charming and efficient at every step, the room was quiet, spacious and comfortable with everything you could need.
A few highlights: the bed was large and luxurious - as was the bathroom; the breakfast was delicious; the pool was lovely (we had the whole pool to ourselves one morning - wonderful!); and when we took tea in the sitting room we were impressed with the tea, the little cakes, and the superb service. One notable detail about the service at tea was that the waitress was knowledgeable about the really distinguished art collection that hangs on the walls there - what a nice added extra!
One tiny thing that could have been clearer - when they swiped my credit card on arrival it would have been nice if they had been clear that they were not taking payment at that stage, just pre-authorising the card. This caused a little confusion.
However, I would definitely recommend the Merrion and would return there without hesitation. Indeed I was sad to leave.",5,2015,10,04
200,Comfortable and friendly,"We stayed at the Merrion for three nights in early August and found it to be a comfortable hotel, large well appointed room, friendly staff and well located in a peaceful part of Dublin. The hotel is a twenty five minute walk from the centre of O'Connell Street and close to several parks and restaurants. We would be happy to return to the Merrion when back in Dublin.",4,2015,10,03
200,"Yes, it's all true.","The Merrion is just a very special place.  The level of comfort and service is as good if not better than anywhere we've ever stayed.

Ok, to be fair, on our first night, we were somehow (luck of the Irish) upgraded from a normal king room to a massive king garden suite, with 1.5 baths, double doors, a living room, a dressing room, etc.  So our very first impression was obviously rose tinted...

But upon staying for our 2nd night 2 weeks later, on the way back home, we found the ""normal"" king garden room just as great as the suite, if a little more intimate.

The beds are amazing.  Pillows fantastic.  The rooms are quiet.  The food is great.  Room service was fit for royalty.

Getting in and out of the hotel with our many bags was made painless and simple by the eager friendly concierge staff.

My only tiny comment was that upon departing for our first night, we had not yet secured a booking for the final night of our trip 2 weeks later, and the hotel was booked solid.  I asked if they wouldn't mind ringing me if a room became available, and I was promised they would.  No one ever called, and it took me to stalk their website every few days until a room finally opened up to get a booking.  I think they're just so used to saying yes to anything you need that they agreed to call me without considering what that might entail.

Regardless, we are still talking about The Merrion 2 weeks after getting home.  Even if you don't stay there, stop by for a tea or a pint by the fire.  It's easily one of the most serene civilized places in Dublin, if not all of Ireland.",5,2015,10,03
200,Enchanting old world elegance,"I have visited Dublin before but my friend recommended I stay at the Merrion this time. I am so glad she recommended this hotel. It is likely one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at for business/pleasure. 

The hotel entrance is rather nondescript into a brownstone and can be a bit misleading. However, once you enter, you realize the hotel consists of several buildings and is quite large. The hotel is beautifully decorated. There are two drawing rooms for your leisure with a fireplace in each. There is a small bar with a sitting area to catch up with friends or just enjoy some time to yourself. There is a beautiful outdoor garden where you may choose to sit al fresco for breakfast or tea. 

The Cellar Restaurant is downstairs witih a regular dining room for breakfast but also a bar and a dining area for dinner (pls see separate review).  Surrounding the hotel are multiple other venues for dining or a cocktail.  The shopping area is also within walking distance.  The location is excellent.  

I had obtained a junior suite.  My room was absolutely beautiful and I didn't want to leave. The room was very relaxing. The bed was extremely comfortable.  The room has been well kept with great attention to detail.  The toiletries are all from Asprey. Though I was on the 2nd floor facing the street, the windows are well insulated and I was able to sleep very well.  

All the staff are incredibly kind, helpful, and pleasant.  This is truly an amazing hotel.  If  you have the opportunity to stay here while in Dublin, I would highly recommend it.",5,2015,10,03
200,First time in dublin,"We spent a few days in Dublin.  Happy people and some nice sights.  Guinness factory, trinity college the castle.  But the hotel was in the perfect location for seeing everything.  An easy walk to the main shopping and a warm and charming spot.  The dining was convent and good.  Just right.  Our room was very nice and well done. The spa is nice and a very friendly staff.  Loved the living room with the fire going and people enjoying some tea and cookies.   Or just a newspaper",5,2015,10,01
200,Perfect Dublin weekend,"The Merrion Hotel is beautiful and well maintained.  We stayed for three nights at the end of Sept.  I stayed in The Merrion suite and the rest of the family stayed in Junior suites all located in the Main house.  We had champagne in our rooms upon arrival and the place was beautiful.  We had breakfast in the mornings and it was a nice meal.  It was expensive but the only hotel available for us during the All Ireland Weekend.  I would go back again easily, really enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,10,01
200,Merrion Magical!,Your stay at the Merrion will be filled with magical moments! From the accomodations to service to food everything is A++. Pricey indeed but worth every penny for the experience. You will not regret your decision,5,2015,10,01
200,Beautiful,This is a wonderful hotel. The staff is very nice and well trained. The indoor pool is beautiful. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are great as well. The location is close to Trinity College and Nassau Street and we could eat all of our meals in the neighborhood and the choices were great.The grounds of this Hotel are special as well. I would stay here again without hesitation.,5,2015,10,01
200,A Luxury Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights.  It's a true luxury hotel.  The service is great.  I arrived late at night and didn't have any Euro with me, and the taxi doesn't take credit card, I went in to ask if they can exchange some USD for Euro for me but they just gave me the cash right away and put it on my account, no hassle.  The room has a king size bed with more than enough room to move around.  The bathroom is all marble and has both the bathtub and shower.  It's conveniently located to many restaurants and to my office.

One thing if I have to really be picky is it's not easy to navigate around in the hotel.  I got lost twice just trying to get to and back from the breakfast area.",5,2015,09,30
200,Fantastic hotel,"This was our 2nd visit and we were as delighted with our experience as the 1st time. Staff are extremely welcoming and friendly.The atmosphere is very relaxing. Food at breakfast was amazing, so all in all , the Merrion remains my favourite hotel.",5,2015,09,29
200,City Centre Luxury.,"The Merrion Hotel is pure city centre luxury. Located next to Merrion Square, the Irish Parliament, Trinity College (home to the Book of Kells) and Grafton Street, one of the city's main shopping thoroughfares. The hotel occupies some of the finest, most beautifully restored, historic Georgian buildings in Dublin and exudes a relaxed traditional elegance. Our room was spacious and elegantly decorated with luxurious beds and a grand bathroom. Unfortunately, the view from our room looked onto the construction that was taking place just outside in the garden and courtyard. The service was attentive without being intrusive and combined the right measure of friendliness and professionalism. I loved the eclectic collection of art that can be found throughout the hotel!",5,2015,09,28
200,Trip to Ireland!,"For our 30 year wedding anniversary, we decided to spend time in Ireland( the mother land). Our fantastic, travel agent - Ann Geskes of Frosch Travel - once again booked the very best hotels for us!  We flew from LAX to Dublin and spent two nights at the The Merrion Hotel to start our trip.  The Merrion Hotel is absolutely delightful!.  The rooms were very well appointed, with marble bathrooms, and lovely bedding - very comfortable.  The hotel staff was gracious and exceedingly helpful.  The breakfast, included with our room, was delicious with several options to choose from, both hot and cold.  Best of all, the location was perfect.  Close to almost everything - either within walking distance, or a quick cab or ""hop on hop off"" bus ride.",5,2015,09,28
200,Very nice but not the 4 seasons,"The best part of Ireland is the people!  I stayed there for a week and took a helicopter to golf courses all over Ireland. We had a great time.
The room was very nice! Breakfast great! Dinner not so great but there are many restaurants within walking distance. The bar is in the cellar!
I will stay there again because it is the best in Dublin.",4,2015,09,28
200,our wedding aniversary stay,"well.. where do I start with this hotel? I was so delighted to have entered such a fine, exquisite and outstanding establishment. I was very impressed with the courtesy, helpfulness and efficiency from all the staff. The hotel was immaculate from the minute you enter the hotel. The rooms were stunning and of a very high standard. The food was supberb. We started the afternoon having a drink or two outside in the garden terrace, it was so relaxing. We went out in the evening just around the corner to a restaurant called Hugo, where food, drink and service was devine. The next morning we had a beautiful breakfast, there was a hot choice menu and also a cold buffet to choose from. The waiter that served us was called Finbar and credit must be given to him for his impeccable service. Nothing was a problem at this hotel. i did not want to leave the beautiful surroundings of this wonderful hotel. I have stayed in many other high rating hotels in Dublin but this one beats them all. It has a very personal feel to it, it was like stepping back in time with lots of history oozing from all the art work on the walls but this hotel also had a modern twist to it making your stay in Dublin feel very refreshing.",5,2015,09,28
200,Thumbs up,Only a one night stay but everything as good as the reviews. Walking convenience into city areas of interest. Great accommodations and staff. Strongly recommend. Indoor pool a plus. Excellent food.  Across from parliament. Morning jog to and through the historic park and by landmarks. ,5,2015,09,28
200,Relaxation,"The Merrion is located perfectly for sightseeing on foot, but out of the hustle and bustle so perfect for relaxing at the end of the day. The food amenities on site and The Spa were great. I stayed in a garden room which was perfect size for one person.",5,2015,09,27
200,Another Excellent stay in Dublin,My kind of Hotel. Very welcoming and very comfortable. A great place to base your selves in Dublin or just to stay in and around the Hotel its self. The staff are always at hand to assist you and help in any way they can. There is a very friendly atmosphere from the moment I arrived.,5,2015,09,25
200,Merrion Hotel Stay,Always a wonderful experience at the Merrion.  I make it my first choice whenever I am traveling to Dublin The location of the hotel and the quality of service provided is second to none.  I fully recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin,5,2015,09,24
200,Merrion comes up trumps,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, for the third time this year, but the good reputation built up out there, means getting a room is becoming more of a challenge, but that cannot be too bad for one of Dublins' finest hotels.",5,2015,09,23
200,Charming staff,"This landmark Dublin hotel has lost nothing of its style - certainly not in the public rooms. However it was the outstanding quality of the staff that set this place apart n my view on this visit. Endlessly polite, attentive and well-informed. ",5,2015,09,23
200,Very very enjoyable,"We stayed 1 night ,as the hotel which we normally stay in was busy. 
Very clean ,class 5 star hotel. Rooms are spacious and spotless. Staff are without some of the best in Ireland. 
Special mention ,must go to Nicola in cellar bar/restaurant,without doubt the best 5star hotel member of staff I have seen anywhere.
I will come back,only downside was an incident with a barmaid,which I wont go into. 
Above all an excellent hotel ,excellent location. And again Nicola from hungry,the best we have seen.
DM",5,2015,09,20
200,"Service, Service, Service and more Service!!","When you stay at a 5 Start hotel you expect service, but the Merrion staff take service to the next level. I am from the US and they treated me like part of the family for 5 nights. There is great tradition in this hotel with beautiful parlors, Furniture and all of the detail you would expect in a hotel with this tradition. The Spa was very nice and the pool was relaxing. The Cellar restaurant is a must! 24 hour room service was great..#23 staff were very professional and overall the rooms, beds and facilty were excellent.",5,2015,09,20
200,World Class Hotel,"We travelled from Australia, meeting up with friends in Dublin.  They had previously stayed at the hotel & booked again for our visit.   

What a beautiful place.the staff are super friendly & very professional.  Having stayed in some of the best hotels in the world, I can honestly say that The Merrion is easily on this list.  

Drinks in the drawing room in front of the roaring fires are not to be missed.  ",5,2015,09,20
200,Golf Trip,"This was my first time to Ireland and the Merrion was the second of three hotels we stayed at during a guys golf trip. What I can say is this was a very classy hotel and one that my wife would be thrilled to stay at when we return. From the main lobby, to the quaint bar, to the afternoon sitting areas for tea or a cocktail, to the outside courtyard, to the well appointed rooms. All first class and elegant. I would highly recommend this place for their service, decor, and comfort.",5,2015,09,19
200,Classic Comforts,"The Merrion was recently refurbished and is the epitome of subtle luxury. It is central, clean, cozy and steeped in culture. The hotel fashions beautiful drawing rooms, open fires, an emerald oak bar, lux bedrooms, stunning art, delectable food, ESpa treatments, an 18 metre pool and excellent customer service. 250 years of history steeps the halls, walls and architecture. It was a real treat to stay in this stunning part of Dublin!",5,2015,09,19
200,Perfect location,"Beautiful, well maintained hotel. Excellent restaurant for both dinner and breakfast. Best coffee anywhere. Easy walking distance to all the sights of Dublin. Enjoyed the complimentary Nespresso service in the room-bought one for home so I could continue the easy preparation in the morning. Very traditional architecture but thoroughly upgraded rooms. Attractive central garden courtyard. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2015,09,17
200,Classic elegance,"It's not your modern 5 star, but a mostly more refined and relaxed version of the same. Interesting facade, and it actually feels more like a country club when you are walking around.

Rooms are classic with a big emphasis on soft furnishings and creams, but showing it's age in some areas. Twin beds seemed smaller than a double and bigger than a single.

Lot's nice little touches however.

Bar service was exceptional.

Escort from checkin to the room was a little OTT and not required even if the layout of the hotel is a little unconventional. Would have preferred to be asked rather than automatically escorted.",4,2015,09,16
200,Beautiful hotel in Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two rooms at the Merrion for 3 nights. We found the rooms to be quiet, clean, well appointed and comfortable. The bed is great...the softest sheets and good pillows. The staff is very accommodating.
The location is prime. We walked everywhere with many sights and restaurants within easy reach. 
The Merrion was a wonderful place to recover from our flights and start our stay in Ireland.",5,2015,09,15
200,great location in dublin,"The Merrion's location in dublin is excellent.  The rooms were not exciting but very comfortable.  The downstairs bar had a nice vibe and good cocktails. We did have a big problem when we checked out, one of the bellman had left one of our bags in the room and it didn't make it into our van to the airport.  Once we were at the airport and realized this I called the hotel immediately.  They had a taxi driver rush the bag out to the airport, we almost missed our flight and it created a very stressful situation.  Other than the bag episode it was a nice hotel in a good location.",4,2015,09,15
200,Excellent hotel in a very good location,"This hotel still feels like a small boutique despite the large modern extension at the back.  Very good five star service, rooms of a decent size and a very nice pool and spa.  It is very close to all the key sights of Dublin such as Trinity College, St Stephen's Green etc.",5,2015,09,15
200,Georgian Dublin,"This is our favorite hotel in Dublin. The rooms are elegant and spacious, the bar is cozy and welcoming, and the tea rooms are wonderful places to relax after a day of sightseeing.  The concierge staff is one of the best in Europe. Friendly and knowledgeable, they arranged a very last minute trip to Johnny Foxes for us, including transportation, and know of every restaurant in Dublin. We had a lovely time in Dublin and at the Merrion. We always come back.",5,2015,09,15
200,A first class hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We were touring Ireland with a Classic car touring group and were staying for two nights at the Merrion. On arriving outside in our E-Type Jaguar, we were immediately greeted by staff who whisked our luggage away and escorted my wife into the hotel to register. Another person joined me in the car to guide me to the underground car park at the rear of the hotel and then on up to my room where my wife and luggage had already arrived. Such service was a great start to our stay. Our room was spacious and nicely decorated with Georgian décor.
On the first night we eat at the Cellar Restaurant and had a delightful meal with excellent service. We also had breakfast both days in this restaurant where the buffet selection was outstanding, whilst in addition we had freshly cooked hot breakfasts.
What also made this hotel exceptional was the quality and friendliness of the staff. The porter who had originally showed us to our room greeted us each day by name which in such a large hotel was remarkable. Overall this hotel takes a lot of beating.",5,2015,09,14
200,Brothers wedding day,We didn't stay at this hotel but many family members did including my brother. We all went as my brother and his now wife wanted to get married in this beautiful hotel where they visit regular. What a beautiful hotel with very welcoming staff. The cellar in this hotel is amazing and was the best part for me (apart from the wedding) so many cosy places to sit alone or in a large group. The wedding party consisted of 30guests and we where never left waiting for anything. The whole experience was fantastic and we cant wait to return to see more of Ireland. ,5,2015,09,14
200,So Classy,"Our family stayed at the Merrion for 2 wonderful nights at the beginning of our tour of Ireland.  It had a great feel to it from the get go. We arrived at 8am from the States(as many tourists do) and knew our rooms would probably not be ready which was true. That was ok as we sat in one of the lovely breakfast areas and had what was one of the best cups of coffee and croissant ever.  The grounds are so peaceful and the servers were very polite and extremely well trained. We went on a horse and carriage ride, walked to a couple pubs and had lunch while waiting for the room which was ready about 2pm.  We had adjoining rooms with a garden view and we were pleased with everything about the room, location, staff and ambiance.  Dinner in the Cellar was excellent also.  This place is a keeper and we'd return in a heartbeat.",5,2015,09,13
200,Thanks a million!,"We've been in the hotel for 5 days, Lovely style! English breakfast was delicious and the staff was really friendly! Everything you expect from a hotel in Dublin! Thanks a million! 

Our room had a beautiful bathroom with a bath. When looking at the price then I must say that everything is ok!",5,2015,09,13
200,Terrific end to our trip,The hotel is lovely and centrally located so that walking and using the tourist buses and convenient. We had room service one night as we arrived late and it was on time and delicious. The room was gorgeous with a wonderful view of the government building.,4,2015,09,10
200,little piece of heaven,"Myself and my husband stayed in the Merrion as a Christmas gift to ourselves. From the minute we arrived we received the best of service, everybody was so helpful, friendly and accommodating! the room was amazing, so clean crisp and comfortable. Will definitely be visiting again.",5,2015,09,09
200,Tranquil Oasis in the Heart of Dublin,"We spent 4 nights at The Merrion in late August.  What a welcome we received and much appreciated after 11 hours of flight travel!   Each staff member, bell staff, reception ,housekeeping, waiters and waitresses throughout our stay provided a sincere welcome and concern for our well-being.   We truly were pampered!   

The location is perfect.  Although Upper Merrion Street is wide, it is really not particularly busy as the park and Parliament building take up most of the area surrounding the hotel.  Thus, minimal commercial traffic.   It is within walking distance to most of Dublin's sights.  The Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stop is just a few steps away from the hotel.

Our lovely room faced the interior gardens, which provided a fabulous view and quiet.  Although I do suggest a garden facing room, I would believe a higher room facing Upper Merrion would be tranquil as well.  The decor, bath amenities and dreamy bed were what I would expect from a five star hotel.  A huge smile crossed my face when we first entered the room!

Our package, booked through American Express Travel, included a continental breakfast each day.    This is a bountiful spread of home-made granola cereals, an abundance of fruit, wide variety of yogurt, juices, yummy breads, cheeses and sliced breakfast meats.  Delicious sweet pastries and sweet breads, such as banana bread and blueberry bread, were the frosting on the breakfast.  Hot porridge, made to order, is also available under the continental plan and was yummy.  We had the option of adding on eggs, and other hot breakfast items, but were completely satisfied with the continental included in our plan. Fabulous coffee!! Of course, tea is also available.

We loved their 24 hour lounge, where we could order light meals, desserts, and drinks after an evening out.  The fireplace and comfy chairs and couches provided a warm and relaxing atmosphere.  For art lovers, you might enjoy the hotel's collection of original paintings!

Our plan also included one dinner, which we had prior to taking in a performance of River Dance at the nearby Gaiety Theater.  An excellent menu and most delicious dinner.  Their pub was fun and, again, provided a variety of choices and the high quality one would expect.

I had thought of staying at the Marriott, but so glad I chose The Merrion!!!  If you can afford the splurge it will be a highlight of your trip to Ireland!",5,2015,09,09
200,First time in Dublin and loved it..........,"We went here over the bank holiday weekend at the end of August for 3 night/2 day stay at the Merrion hotel and what an amazing time we had! Every single member of staff was delightful; they were polite, courteous and bent over backwards to ensure we were happy. The hotel was very clean; housekeepers did a great job in our room. Our rooms were cleaned twice daily and fresh towels left daily. The food was amazing especially the breakfast OMG Wow what a selection especially the homemade pancakes and Irish breakfast are to die for (It is a must)– we were full until 2pm, you are spoilt for choice.
The concierge on the front desk when we arrived aware very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome, throughout my stay I spoke to different members of staff and nothing was too much to do, book or call. They made my stay very comfortable and relaxing. Thank you.
Conor Shaw helped us before we arrived at the hotel  book 2 amazing restaurants one being patrick guilbaud and Casey Ntshangase also helped with afternoon tea. The service was spectacular, I could not ask for anything more, Conor was very generous with his time. Thank you...you made our anniversary very special. Plus I enjoyed the cupcakes you left in our room as a special welcome treat. Thank you, what a great touch.
I wouldn't hesitate to a) recommend this hotel to others and b) return for another visit! I think the value for money is outstanding. I will be coming back next year with my girls again and this time 10 of us will be coming.
This place deserves a yearly visit and when I have children this is the prefect holiday for them.
 
Thank you again to Conor you were very patient, helpful and last of all a great representation of the hotel and company, you helped me a lot throughout my stay and I think if it was not for you I would not have enjoyed it or been very lost in where to go and places to see.............THANK YOU.",5,2015,09,09
200,Beautiful Hotel,We stayed at The Merrion for 1 night for our 10th wedding anniversary and it didn't disappoint! The hotel itself is beautiful and in a nice area of town and the staff are all brilliant. We would definitely stay there again!,5,2015,09,09
200,Beautiful Georgian 5* Hotel,"Beautifully restored historic property. From the lovely drawing rooms furnished so
comfortably, to the peat fireplaces,5 pm sumptuous tea, delicious full breakfasts, the
""cellar bar""...The staff including maid service to front desk: helpful without being
intrusive, professional yet approachable. The doormen in their handsome uniforms
with top hats, unfailingly polite and cheerful. There is a business card provided by the
Merrion that says: ""My residence in Dublin"". We will indeed be returning to our new
residence in Dublin....",5,2015,09,09
200,Genuine Irish hospitality in Dublin,"I travelled alone to Dublin, never having been there before, so wanted to stay in a nice hotel in a safe location. The Merrion is beyond 'nice' and 'safe' and in a perfect location for seeing the major sights. The hotel itself is a discreet property with a beautiful garden terrace in the back. The decor of the rooms include taste Irish wool draperies, seat covers and there is also a bit of Swedish influence in the furniture. Very comfortable. Although using my AMEX Platinum card should have entitled me to an upgrade, my ""garden view"" room faced another building. Very, very disappointing as the hotel was not full.  Also several errors in the bill : Read Carefully. The Cellar Bar and Restaurant serve delicious food in a unique atmosphere befitting its name. Caution: if breakfast included your room rate, go to the restaurant versus room service as there is a 5 Euro room service fee (not disclosed) for all room service. 

While in Dublin, I took the RED hop on - hop off bus to acclimate and it was surprisingly pleasant. I then went on a historical waking tour. The sites, including Trinity College, Dublin Castle and the other highlights was just Ok. I think because the guide was not interested. The majority of the permanent collection of the National Gallery is in storage due to construction. Check before you go. One of the highlights was a tour to Malahide Castle and a visit to the seaside village of Howth.  Three days in Dublin is sufficient. Next time I will focus exclusively on the countryside!  ",4,2015,09,09
200,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location, Superior Service","My family and I recently spent a couple of nights at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.  We loved it!  What a lovely hotel with a great history and location!  We organized a city tour through the hotel, as we frequently do when we travel to a new city as a family, and we felt that it was our best city tour ever!  The hotel staff was excellent - very friendly, polite and helpful.  I would highly recommend a stay there.",5,2015,09,08
200,One of the best,"We stayed in four and five star hotels during our trip and the Merrion was by far the best.

From the front desk to housekeeping the service was top notch.  The room was very comfortable.  Location is almost dead center of all attractions.  Breakfast was superb and the attached restaurant (Paul D) showed the same level of attention while serving some the best dinner affair in Dublin.  We highly recommend the Merrion.",5,2015,09,08
200,great 5-star hotel,"What you expect in a five star hotel.  Impeccable service and great amenities.  Beds where very comfortable.  Location was in the heart of everything. We could walk to the museums and Temple Bar restaurants, but were far enough away from the noise of the hustle and bustle.",5,2015,09,07
200,Nothing could have been better,Our first stop after an overnight flight and we were fortunate enough to be able to check in early.  The beds were incredibly comfortable and the rooms so quiet.  Everything about the room was perfect.  The service was excellent and the location was perfect. We enjoyed the pool ( it would be nice if it was open a little later).  We loved our stay at this hotel,5,2015,09,06
200,Touch of class,"Regal hotel in the party city of Dublin, the Merrion provides relaxing grandeur in the main reception, drawing rooms and bar. The bedrooms, we stayed in the Garden wing, are big enough to avoid claustrophobia sometimes encountered in city hotels though perhaps not as luxurious as might be expected from the initial impressions front of house.

The staff are highly attentive and certainly ensured everything was done to make our visit very enjoyable. The team that worked the main bar are very charismatic and served a fine Hendricks. My own favourite classic measure of the standard of service, enjoyed in fine surroundings, was a real pleasure after busy days strolling around the city.

Can also recommend the Afternoon Tea served in the drawing rooms with eminent pride and knowledge by the staff, encompassing the impressive art housed in the hotel in the form of the selected cakes.... 

The Michelin star French restaurant adjoining the Merrion is also worth an expensive but exquisitely tasty visit.. ",5,2015,09,06
200,Continued and Consistent Excellence in Dublin from the Merrion Hotel,"I stayed for several nights recently, after being away from Ireland for a year.  I used to stay several times a year.  The hotel has maintained it excellence in all categories. I'd be disappointed to stay anywhere else in Dublin -- great service, food, artwork, history and location.  A real treat.  My only advice would be to have a bit more flexibility or availability for the spa -- it always seems fully booked far in advance, and perhaps they could expand the facilities to accommodate the business.",5,2015,09,06
200,wonderful,"We had a wonderful stay here last wednesday night, the room was absolutely beautiful and the staff could not do enough. Really enjoyed our stay, special mention to the breakfast which was yummy, I had the french toast which was lovely andf my dad had th full irish which was also gorgeous. Our only complaint was the patrick guilbauds restaurant which was not up to scratch.",5,2015,09,06
200,Best service!,My husband and I stayed at the Merrion for 5 days in Aug and absolutely loved it.  The service was above and beyond and could not have been more perfect.  Upon arrival we needed an emergency dental appointment and we had one setup within one hour!!  Every request was met with an immediate and full response in the most friendly and courteous manner possible.  On my next visit to Dublin I won't even consider booking any other hotel for my stay.  Thank you Merrion.  My only complaint was the inconsistent wifi.,5,2015,09,05
200,perfect,"Went here recently for Art tea for my Mums Birthday. It was pure perfection from the food, tea and service. It was luxurious in every way and being surrounded by priceless art helped as well. 

Art tea is like no other afternoon tea because desserts take their inspiration from art around the hotel. The service is second to none because you always have someone there to fill up your tea cup without even needing to ask. Time melts away and you don't feel pressured to leave even after three hours of drinking various different teas. 

It is a hidden gem you may not notice but better slightly hidden so it's never over crowded. To add to the whole art experience drop over the road to the National Art gallery and you'll have a heavenly day.",5,2015,09,05
200,Simply grand,"we came from the St Helen's which was very close to UCD where we were settling in our daughter for her studies.   The contrast was night and day.  The Merrion is service personified.  While you pay for it, you can clearly see what you are paying for.  The room was large and beautifully appointed.  The staff, food and beverage service are all top notch.   If you want to feel pampered, this is the place.",5,2015,09,04
200,Excellent service in a chilled out environment,"The service and atmosphere in this hotel were excellent, with the staff on hand at all times to assist with whatever they could. We had afternoon tea which was delicious and when we had a small issue with one of the cakes the manager was immediately on hand and provided 3 free glasses of champagne as a token which totally negated the issue we had with the cake - such a good sign of customer service.",5,2015,09,04
200,"All Show, No Substance","Disappointing hotel. Room is poor... tiny TV, entertainment unit didn't work, bedding not appropriate to summer, bedside tables too big for the bed, wifi is dreadful, no shelving in bathroom for your personal effects and a horrible water saving shower head. 
Concierge staff were mixed...some were friendly were helpful and friendly... others would look right through you as if you weren't standing there.
I think the staff believe in the hype of their brand but overall the hotel fails to deliver. My suggestion would be for the manager to take a trip to Bath and visit the Gainsborough Hotel to learn what a true five star hotel is!",2,2015,09,04
200,"Without doubt, a must visit!!","Precisely the level of service both my girlfriend and I had hoped for; very attentive however not over the top. Whilst the hotel is maginificient both in it's heritage and attention to detail, the staff truly make it an experience to remember. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,09,03
200,Wonderful stay!,Love this hotel the best throughout my entire 23 days Europe trip! It was situated close to the shopping area and lots of eatery round the corner. Service was superb from the moment you stepped out of the taxi as the bellboys greeted you and assist with the luggages. The relaxed atmosphere and tasteful decorations of the old charm hotel with lots of artworks on display simply put the hotel on a higher notch than the other..of course quality doesn't come cheap but is all well worth the money! Room was cosy and bed was heavenly..it has the nicest and best pillow across all the hotels I've stayed neither too hard nor too soft...travelled with two toddlers and they even prepared special toiletries set for the little ones plus not to mention balloons and activities kit that was set in the room for their arrival.. though is nothing big but it simply made the boys beamed with delight seeing the balloons in the room! Will definitely return to Merrion if we ever travel back to Dublin.,5,2015,09,02
200,Just like staying with royalty!,We absolutely loved our stayed at the Merrion.  The biggest disappointment was that we could only stay one night.  They staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly!  Our room was beautiful as well as the rest of the hotel.  You truly felt as though you were staying with royalty.  We cannot wait to go back and stay longer!!!,5,2015,09,01
200,The best city hotel,"This is our second stay here in the last 12 months. It is a fabulous hotel. The staff are perfect. Very attentive. Very friendly. Just wonderful.  We had some problems tonight in their gourmet restaurant, Patrick Guilbaud. I do recommend this restaurant but this is what happened to us. My husband us allergic to onions which we told everyone. His lamb came with onions. They took it all back. We were staying in the hotel but we had the table next to the kitchen. I'm guessing we had 5 waiters every minute oasis our table. Nit good. Not a relaxing experience. All in all, not a good experience. If we had a better table and no onions it would have been better. We left and went to the 23 bar in the hotel which is fabulous!",5,2015,09,01
200,Luxury at its best.,"There is a sense of stepping back in time when you walk from reception through the Drawingrooms where the finest Afternoon Tea is being served in comfortable seating surrounded by old masters and statues. The Art collection is incredible.
Spaces comfortable rooms with everything you need for that luxurious stay.
Friendly helpful staff with a very warm welcome form the Concierge staff on arrival.
A striking hotel which can pride it's self on its immaculate standards.",5,2015,09,01
200,"Elegance, comfort and luxury.","Returned from a wonderful weekend at The Merrion. Stayed on Friday and Saturday night. Arrived just after lunchtime on Friday. Our car and bags were whisked away and we were quickly checked in by the friendly and welcoming reception staff. We decided to have a glass of wine and a coffee at The Cocktail Bar before heading to our room. One of the reception staff came to the bar to escort us to the room #134. Dan ,the concierge, also greeted us and wished us a pleasent stay. Dan proved to be exceptionally helpful throughout the weekend. The room was beautifully laid out with a huge bed, 2 armchairs and all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel. Large bathroom with quality products supplied. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The Silent Garden, at the rear of the main building, is stunning. A great place to sit and relax if you want even more peace and quiet. Smoking is permitted here and staff are very attentive and discreet at the same time. A bowl of fruit and chocolates were left for us. A great and welcome touch. The hotel is stylish, understated elegance with incredible art works adorning the walls. I noticed an art tour while there. Next time!!! A drink at The Cellar Bar is a must. Private, quiet and relaxed. Breakfast is served in The Cellar Restaurant. Weekends can be busy and be prepared to wait to be seated. Otherwise breakfast was wholesome and plentiful. We didn't eat at Guibaulds as we had reservations for Fade  Street Social ( thanks Dan) and we were attending a wedding reception on Sat evening at The Royal Hospital. (reviews to follow ). Overall a wonderful experience and highly recommended.",5,2015,09,01
200,"Quite simply, superb.","A much anticipated return visit to the Merrion and, I'm happy to report, it only gets better! A pretty much flawless performance right across the Board. We enjoy the tasteful, elegant, relaxed atmosphere, and the quiet efficiency in the service, along with the natural warmth that you seem to find so prevalent in Ireland.
With so many pretenders to five-star status and service, rest assured, this is the real deal and a comfortable cut above the rest.
The old adage prevails - quality does not come cheap - but once you have stayed at the Merrion I'm sure you will agree that it's well worth it.",5,2015,09,01
200,A Sheer Delight,"I love this hotel!  It has a great location right by everything you will want to do to sightsee this great city.  We stayed two nights and loved it all.  The service was perfect.  It was so beautiful and walking into the rooms with the yummy slippers made my day.  We loved the older part of the hotel and the art work.  The many places to sit and relax inside and outside was really nice.  We used the pool quite a bit and it was very pretty.
Breakfast was great, our favorite of all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,08,31
200,We will definitely return,"Our first visit to Dublin was all a wonderful experience. We loved everything about the city, but particularly our stay at The Merrion. The service was impeccable throughout. Our bedroom in the Garden Wing was very spacious with a huge comfortable bed. We had an excellent meal in the cellar restaurant one evening and enjoyed a delicious tea in the drawing room. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,29
200,"No where else to stay in Dublin, PERIOD!","Historical building restored to a magical level. Service is impeccable and every aspect of our stay was perfect. World Class service from the moment you arrive until Emily brings you breakfast in the morning... the entire experience was fantastic.  Cellar Bar has a great old school feel and a warm, welcome demeanor.",5,2015,08,27
200,Great hotel for a weekend break,"Excellent hotel, great city, with great bars and restaurants within 5 minutes walk of hotel. no need to venture as far as temple bar for a night out. Merrion Square and the park are on the doorstep, and a walk to the canal/marina area is worth a walk. Dublin Zoo also well worth a trip",5,2015,08,27
200,Family Stay,"Having stayed here on business earlier in the year I said it would be great to take my family back.The Sunday Brunch was a treat for myself my wife and 3 children and was amazing value for what we had. The interconnecting rooms were a dream as it felt like we were in a suite. Everything about our stay was fabulous and we will be back. Sarah Woods in the Drawing Room was the epitome of professionalism, courtesy and what customer centric service should be all about, she'll go far. From the doorman to the porters to front office staff to restaurant staff a big well done from the us, you made a short stay very memorable once again.",5,2015,08,27
200,Great Location,"This was out first trip to Dublin
great central location close to good restaurants.
We had a little rough start as our room was not ready and the upgrade for Leaders Members not applied, had to insist a bit, but after that they gave us a great suite with fantastic amenities and great room service and attention. The cleanliness was impeccable.
We had  a package that included a dinner which was just ""ok"" at the Cellar restaurant...which of course appeared on the bill ( it always does, doesn't it ) and we had to have it remove from the final bill .
Otherwise everything was as expected.
We asked the concierge about an excursion to Wicklow woods and Glendalough and he got us the BEST guide ever for 40 euros an hour to take us to visit Ireland's garden, 1 hour away from Dublin, I wish we had him for the whole trip, he can be booked privately at alaningoldsby@gmail.com and is the best guide ever , you learn more with him in 4 hours that in a encyclopedia, thank you James Concierge at the Merrion",5,2015,08,27
200,Superb!,"A fantastic stay from start to finish. I couldn't fault it, the staff made the whole experience especially lovely. Our room was pure luxury, a wonderful nights sleep. This was followed by a refreshing swim in the morning and an extremely tasty breakfast.",5,2015,08,26
200,It's nice to be pampered.....,"Located just around the corner from St Stephens Green and Merrion Square.  During good weather - it's a nice walk to many of the museums, Grafton St shopping, the Temple Bar area, O'Connell St and stop 6 for the Green Bus Hop-on Hop-off tour.  

Upon arrival, the staff was helpful and apologetic since we arrived early and our room was not ready.  We had lunch outside at the cafe and the salmon was delicious.  Our room overlooked the lovely gardens which did get a good dose of watering on our second day.  We took advantage of the spa and high tea during the rainy weather and enjoyed the sun during our walk around St Stephens Green.  Breakfast is in the Cellar - a very cool location especially at night for drinks at the bar.  Lovely bath, separate tub and shower with nice toiletries.

Lovely restaurants in the neighborhood including a Michelin star connected to the hotel. Also, the art collection is stunning and throughout the entire property.",5,2015,08,26
200,Pleasant hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, in a good location, I booked the lowest price room and it was fine, except all the hotel doors would bank each time someone left there room.  Maybe I would look around at other hotels next time.",4,2015,08,25
200,Service with a smile,"Amazing, super friendly hotel, fantastic location. The staff were so lovely, full of smiles and coudn't do enough for us. The hotel was immaculate in every way. Lots of different areas to relax with family and friends including a courtyard garden.
The only thing that was slightly annoying was that it was too hot in Club 23 cocktail bar as the fire was lit all day! Thank goodness for the gardens!

Would definitely go back. Had an amazing stay for three nights.
Thank you!",5,2015,08,24
200,Wonderful hotel in the perfect location,"We were originally booked to stay in the main house and were very disappointed in having our room in the Garden wing.  WITH THAT SAID we were so very satisfied with our stay there.  They were very apologetic for the mix up and lovely about it.  We ended up with a very spacious room in the garden wing- much bigger than we would have had in the main wing and it was less money.  After our experience I would even recommend staying in the garden wing!  The breakfast every morning was delightful in the cellar.  The experience at the hotel was wonderful.  Lovely all around!  And the staff, especially the front desk and concierge, were so very helpful!",5,2015,08,24
200,What a stunning hotel,"Hubby had a trip with work and we were booked in the Merrion. Upon entering this hotel your first reaction is 'wow'. Its truly an amazing hotel. The room was fantastic with everything you could ask for. The bed they made for my son didn't have any impact on the space and they even left some crayons, book and balloon which was a nice touch.

We had room service, which was fantastic. The food was very good and the service even more so.

If we get the chance to back to Dublin, this hotel is definitely the one to stay at.",5,2015,08,22
200,WHAT A STUNNER,I had a chance to stay over night and was very impressed with the value for money was better than expected for a hotel in this price range... All i could think was when can i book   to come back... I would make it a priority to come back friendly staff and lovely luxe finishes in good taste,4,2015,08,20
200,The best of Dublin,"If you desire classic elegance, this hotel rates 10.  Everything is best in its class:  staff, amenities, location, landscaping, and overall professionalism.  It is within walking distance to center city, but far enough to give you a quiet respite from activity and an absolutely restful night of sleep.",5,2015,08,20
200,Merrion One Night Stay,"Through the door into a different world where you are made feel king. Fabulous genuine staff. Old world feel of the place. Time slows down and you get to relax. What a fantastic place. Found it a little odd going to the basement for breakfast... a fleeting speed wobble, when I sat down for the eggs benedict!",5,2015,08,19
200,Ease and elegance in city centre,"The Merrion Hotel has to be the most elegant of all Dublin's offerings. Within walking distance of shops, galleries, museums and Stephen's Green and yet quiet and unshowy. The rooms (especially in the main building) are comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities (a must in my opinion) and free WiFi.  When the weather is good make use of the garden and when the weather is Irish (changeable) the sitting and drawing rooms are spacious and seriously comfortable.  The staff to a man, and woman, were charming.  The hotel has a large collection of contemporary Irish art...do make sure you take the audio tour on offer. Breakfast, was a little disappointing as expected better Irish bacon and black pudding, while the tea-pots have killer handles as they get so hot. A paper holder is not sufficient, a thicker one is needed",5,2015,08,19
200,Don't stay anywhere else,"Stayed a few days in Dublin while visiting ireland.  My wife chose the Merrion hotel.  GREAT choice!  Well located, within walking distance of everything.  Incomparable service.  Memorable breakfasts. Huge room.  Fireplaces in the sitting areas. Antique furnishings in many areas (comfy).  Very helpful staff.  Best hotel bed ever!!  I want to take it home with me!  Don't miss the Merrion!",4,2015,08,19
200,Top notch in every aspect,"We stayed two nights. The Merrion is in a class by itself. We’ve rarely stayed in a hotel that exudes and delivers such a high level of service and professionalism at every turn. When we next find ourselves headed to Dublin again, we won’t deny ourselves the pleasure of another stay.
A great hotel proves its status and reputation when things go awry. Soon after check-in, we discovered our room had a noise problem. In spite of the hotel being booked full, the front desk staff moved us with aplomb, then dispatched a bellman to help us move our already unpacked belongings. This is what generates loyalty and great word of mouth.",5,2015,08,17
200,Tethra Spa and High Tea at The Merrion Hotel are a must-do!,"I was not staying at The Merrion Hotel, but I was directed there three different times: 1.  Booked a table for 6 for High Tea - it was amazing and marvelous!  2. Book a massage and facial at Tethra Spa - Booked with Agnes for two massages and a facial (all great!) 3. Go see the large art collection (amazing!)   Go!  See!  Enjoy!",5,2015,08,17
200,Not Five Star and that's Not a city view,"NOT AS ADVERTISED.  The first impression at the door is pure class. The doorman adds a touch of class to the luxurious feel you get in the lobby, reception area and tea room.  The garden in the center of the hotel is lovely.  Unfortunately once you get into your room it's a different story.   While the room itself is nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable, the room is not as advertised.  

What's Advertised: The Merrion describes their Garden wing rooms as ""light and airy"" with ""city views"" and ""each room is equipped with free Wi-Fi"".  

WHAT YOUR REALLY GET: Most of the Garden wing rooms view the street and garages and old, run down buildings.  The room is dark and boring although the colors are light.  The Wi-Fi is horrible!! Yes horrible,  It takes several attempts to log in and each day requires several re-attempts to log on for Wi-Fi access.  The speed is not fast or consistent.   

The staff were not accommodating and simply explained it away as ""that IS our city view"".  Bad for Dublin.  Certainly, we would have booked a different category of room had we known there actually is NO View and you have to keep the curtain drawn. We may even have chosen a different hotel.  

The rate for garden wing ""city view"" is not commensurate to what you get.  Way overpriced for no view.  So if you plan on spending any time in your room relaxing, DON'T book at The Merrion, because you won't enjoy your room or your stay.  If the room doesn't matter and the Wi-Fi doesn't matter, then yes, the hotel is classy and elegant and convenient to many shops and pubs and local sights.  Incidentally, someone needs to show management and staff what a real city view is.

It is only fair to add that yes, the hotel does deserve 5 star rating for the front door, lobby and tea room decor, overall service and cleanliness but not for the accommodations.  But oddly enough, we still can't wait to check out! We came to The Merrion to relax for a few days but with a room with no view, it's been like a prison.",3,2015,08,16
200,Brunch at the merrion,"Surprisingly that this is not more well known in Dublin. Perfect brunch and service for only a little more than you would pay in a nearby pub. Pancakes and waffles were excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Best part was the top quality ""Bugle Babes ( I think that's what they were called). ",5,2015,08,16
200,Merrion Hotel Stay,"Had a wonderful stay at The Merrion this summer.  The staff are warm, welcoming  and genuine and make you feel like you are at home. The rooms are beautifully decorated with big comfortable beds, I had a great nights sleep.  The location is perfect for shopping and socializing, with many nice restaurants and bars within walking distance.  We will definitely be back next summer.",5,2015,08,15
200,A wonderful city hotel,"We fully enjoyed our stay at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. A series of interconnected townhouses, the staff is exceptional and very focused on making our stay memorable. The room was bright with windows overlooking the inner courtyard. Very good location within walking distance to Trinity College. 
A first class hotel and experience.  ",5,2015,08,15
200,Blending manor house charm with big-city five-star convenience,"What a great location! Merrion is inside the triangle created by College Park (where Trinity College is), St. Stephen's Greens, and Merrion Square. And it's right beside the National Museum, the Government Buildings,Trinity College,and of course, the shopping of Grafton Street. The only other hotel to rival the location would be Shelbourne.

The facade is unimposing - it's in a Georgian house, actually 3 or 4 Georgian houses taken together to make the hotel but since you enter just one of the houses, it's deceiving. It has its own driveway unlike other Georgian houses in the area, which is convenient when you're coming or leaving. 

The bedroom is decently large, with Georgian modern furniture,and typical off-white walls, ceilings, and floors. The bathroom has only one sink and a combination shower-tub. The breakfast area is a bit removed from the lobby - you sort of go out the back (the walkway is nicely covered in glass walls and roof that gives you the view of the manicured hedges, flower boxes, and planted trees and into the basement room with cute lighted columns. On a good day, you can have high tea al fresco since they have wonderful patio sets outside the lobby. 

Merrion is built and furnished like a manor house, except it's right in the heart of Dublin. There's two large so-tastefully-decorated sitting-drawing-tea rooms for the guests' benefit. 

The staff are very courteous and by the second day were addressing us by our names already. And the wait staff were very ingratiating - again, impressive.",4,2015,08,15
200,Classy,"My husband and I just spent two luxurious nights at The Merrion hotel in Dublin. This was our first visit to Dublin and we found it so easy to walk everywhere. The staff at the Merrion are professional yet friendly and so much more approachable than most five star hotels. They couldn't do enough to assist,  the concierge desk, the doorman, the room cleaners, the gym staff, the reception all were great. The gym is small but has great modern equipment. The lounging areas at the hotel looked very inviting for afternoon tea. The rooms are very generous in size and attention to detail with bathroom amenities, plush robes and slippers, wonderful linen was much appreciated. If it's top notch accommodation you are after then this is the place to stay.",5,2015,08,13
200,Understated Elegance is an understatement,"As Old Blue Eyes would say, top of the heap, A number 1.   At the heart of a city that is all heart.  Beautiful rooms, garden, and service.  What more could anyone want.    Trip Advisor insists on 200 words, but really adding words is just unnecessary.  So I will add: Yes the cost of this hotel are higher than most, but you will not feel you have over paid even if you are Scotish!  Sorry to my Scotish friends I am just trying to get my 200 words in!",5,2015,08,13
200,Polished and professional.,"We have been lucky enough to stay in 3 great hotels in the St Stephen's Green area and the Merrion definitely had the edge.
We were there for a short stay for a wedding.
Every aspect of the service was fantastic, the hotel and rooms were well looked after and we were happy  that our money was well spent.
I loved the old school glamour, there are some beautiful parts of the hotel and the obliging late night bar complete with small food menu was also a bonus.",5,2015,08,13
200,Enjoyable stay,"I brought my partner here in April 2015. Room was beautiful, it was the biggest & softest bed in the world! I can also highly recommend the afternoon tea!! We had a slight issue with room noise which was dealt with promptly and the manager was extremely helpful. Can recommend.",4,2015,08,11
200,Cellar Restaurant,"Spent a lovely evening with some friends for a special celebration last Thurs (30th July) received fantastic service from our waiter ""Mayven""  who had a warm welcome for us on arrival and was extremely attentive and very helpful throughout the evening . The food was delicious and the service was even better.  Highly recommend.",5,2015,08,11
200,Fine hotel in Dublin,"We enjoyed a lovely two day stay at this beautiful and well located hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff.  We would recommend it for those seeking an upscale hotel in downtown Dublin. A delightful introduction to a wonderful city.",5,2015,08,10
200,Beautiful hotel/ beware construction,"On holidays for a few days in Dublin.. Have stayed at this property several times in the last 4-5 years...lovely rooms. Outstanding staff and service. Have stayed both in garden facing rooms as well as main house signature suites...it's a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay again.. 
However this month there's a rather large and busty construction site just next door to the hotel... what phase of construction or completion date I don't know. Being in your room during the day is pretty noisy compounded by the closure of the garden courtyard area. Luckily they don't start all that early.. But, if you plan on an afternoon kip/siesta bring silicone earplugs or noise cancelling headphones..",5,2015,08,10
200,Worth to be #1,"It is an elegant place. Not pretentious, they have the typical Irish, no-nonsense and light footed style. Location of hotel is quite good, nice park around the corner. The eye for service is clearly there, including staff speeding up their strides to open the doors for you. Room service is prompt and queen rooms are very complete in their facilities. Only point of improvement is the inner garden. Some of the hotel walls you see in the garden need fresh paint. Breakfast in the cellar restaurant is great experience beautiful place with arched ceiling. You don't miss the windows at all. Book this hotel when you want to relax in Dublin.",5,2015,08,09
200,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights . On arrival our car and bags were dealt with promptly. At check in we were informed we were being upgraded to a room in the manor house. Room 181 was a large comfortable room with a lovely high bed. The only downside was the lack of a view. It was a very quiet room.
The hotel is in an excellent location within easy walking distance to shops and restaurants.
However the highlight for me was the beautiful indoor swimming pool. 
We dined at both restaurants and enjoyed both meals.
I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2015,08,08
200,Excellent choice in Dublin,"We only spent one night at the Merrion and other than terrible wifi reception in our room, the stay was very good.  Great service from the bellmen and front desk as well as the concierge. Beautiful artwork throughout the hotel so be sure to get the guide and spend some time viewing the collection at the Merrion. ",4,2015,08,06
200,Wish we could've stayed longer!,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on the recommendation of a friend.  We could not have been happier with our experience.  By far our favorite hotel during our visit to Europe.  Location is very close to shopping, landmarks, and quality restaurants.",5,2015,08,06
200,Not a Five Star Experience ,We were very excited to visit this hotel as we had heard a lot of good things. It was also rated as number one on trip advisor. However when we arrived we were quite disappointed. Although the room was large it was drab and uninspiring. We were also unable to open the curtains in our room because they looked out onto the backs of restaurants and apartment buildings.  The hotel was also being painted while we were visiting and the smell of paint was somewhat overwhelming.  The staff was very nice and accommodating and when we needed things they were more than happy to help however the facilities and the location of the hotel are less than exceptional.,3,2015,08,05
200,weekend stay,Arriving on the Friday evening the greeting by the concierge was very welcoming and the escort through the reception to our room made very easy. We have stayed before and the garden facing room was presented extremely well including the layout and . Overall the service from the staff was excellent. The food was superbt and the afternoon tea is a must for any visitor. The position of the Hotel is ideal for sightseeing and access.,5,2015,08,05
200,Attention to Detail,"I went here with my [Irish] mother 3 years ago during the Summer Olympics after our visit to London to watch the events.  Ireland was our calm after the hoopla of London, and this hotel was exceptional.  My mom really loves taking a bath and the bathroom was gorgeous!  From the marble and roominess of the bathroom to the view from the balcony, which looked out to the wild English garden courtyard was just sublimely serene. 
But here's the kicker! The day of our departure, my mother realized she had left her credit card at Brown Thomas the day before and although it was 6:00 am, the concierge was able to contact the department store and notify them that she was coming to pick up her card and sent a taxi for her all within 5 minutes.  And simultaneously there was a parade for the Irish Olympians going on right in front of the hotel, which he diverted before even seeing the predicament it would cause!  
For that reason (I always value customer service above all else) and for the beauty in this gem of a hotel hidden in an otherwise banal city, it's one of those places that I will hold dear to my heart, despite my 2 night stay.  Thank you, Merrion!",5,2015,08,05
200,Perfection,During more than half a century of world wide business and vacation travel I have never stayed in a better hotel where very guest is treated like a guest not a money machine.  The staff and the  public and private rooms combine with the art collection and garden to provide an extraordinary experience.,5,2015,08,05
200,A Gem in Dublin,"None of the previous reviews could have prepared me for the amazing experience I enjoyed at this hotel. The staff were gracious and helpful. The gardens, complete with fountain, were beautiful. The food was outstanding - the best I had in Ireland. From the moment I stepped in until the time I had to leave I truly experienced the essence of ""holiday."" I would strongly recommend this lovely hotel to anyone wanting to enjoy the best Ireland has to offer!",5,2015,08,04
200,Extraordinary,"We extended our stay for a 4th night as we just could not bear having to leave! Truly one of the finest hotel experiences in all of Europe. The staff is exceptionally well trained, and go way beyond being courteous and helpful, they are actually pleasant too! Trust the concierge, never steered us wrong on anything. Stunning pool, outdoor garden and cellar bar. Need I go on?",5,2015,07,31
200,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,Wonderful Hotel & Staff and Great Location! This was the first stop on our Ireland and Scotland trip and we were very happy with our choice.  All of the hotel staff we encountered were very friendly and the rooms were beautiful.  The Cellar restaurant serves a great dinner and the bar serves a drink called the Lemony Duke which was a really nice after dinner drink!  We can't wait to return!,5,2015,07,30
200,Worth all its 5 stars,"A very classy hotel with great rooms, great service and a great location.  Business or pleasure this place has it all.  Would love to return again one day.  It's not cheap but you pay for what you get so actually great value in that sense.  Nothing negative at all except maybe they could update some of the gym equipment. It's also a little small but these really are very minor faults.",5,2015,07,30
200,Fabulous Dublin  Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the lovely, art filled Merrion. What made this place so special was the extremely helpful, friendly and efficient staff.  Everyone from the valet, reception, restaurants(John, waiter ) and concierge staff (James) went the extra mile. The reception area is a bit tired looking but the garden and the rooms were lovely. Great indoor pool just long enough for lap swimming. The Art Tea  and lunch at Cellar Pub were both very good.  Hotel is in a great location.",5,2015,07,30
200,First Class experience in every aspect,"A lovely hotel with great staff who are very helpful and pleasant.  The location is great ... within walking distance of shopping, Trinity, Museums, etc.  Old World charm with new world ammenities. We loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone.  We found it good value for what you got compared to other hotels in the same price range.",5,2015,07,30
200,Perfection,"This was our first stop on our honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect. All of the staff were friendly, courteous, and helpful. The accommodations and drawing rooms were cozy and welcoming; we really felt at home during our stay. We can't wait to return in the near future!",5,2015,07,29
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Great hoel, great location, and a wonderful staff. If you want to stay at a first rate hotel in a central location then stay at the Merrion. esay walks to Trinity college and Grafton Street. Very good restaurants and Pubs right around the corner. Facilities are fantastic. This is the only place we would stay in Dublin",5,2015,07,29
200,Beautiful hotel,"A really beautiful hotel with well maintained fixtures. Everything looked very classic but you could tell they had been updated and maintained regularly. The gym was very small but was nice to at least have something there, and they have a small pool as well. Excellent service throughout the stay.",5,2015,07,29
200,Simply the Best!,"The highest level of service that I have ever experienced at any hotel in the world.  Simply outstanding not to mention beautiful.  Nobody does it better.  Incredible location, consistently exceptional service, beautiful and comfortable accommodations, delicious food an drink, and much more.",5,2015,07,29
200,Touch of class,Bueatiful place to stay where the quality of the hotel was only superceded by the wonderful staff. Quiet personal touch with all the guests and really made the stay.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience all round.  Many thanks to all - really enjoyed it and will be back.,5,2015,07,29
200,Five star - hotel chains could learn a lot from this hotel,"From the moment you arrive at the door until you leave this hotel offers professional friendly service. The greeting by the doorman is warm and welcoming. The porter are attentive, reception staff efficient and friendly. Rooms are lovely and well appointed. Great turn down service, water by the bed. Lovely breakfast, nice bar - food in the bar a little bit of a let down but still good. Centrally located to walk into town and restaurants. Concierge was helpful with travel details and places to visit. Would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel.",4,2015,07,29
200,Memorable Merrion,We had a very enjoyable stay. The food at dinner was fantastic and the breakfast in bed the following morning was sublime. The service and responsiveness of the staff was brilliant. The room was very clean and the bathroom was spotless.,5,2015,07,28
200,Amazing Stay,"Recently, I completed a trip to Dublin, Ireland and chose The Merrion Hotel as my temporary residence. This was my first time staying at a 5-star hotel and I was not disappointed. I booked a superior room with a king bed, in the garden area of the hotel. It was spacious, quiet, and had a lovely view of the hotel’s garden. In fact, the design of the room and the entire hotel made me feel as if I was staying at a friend or family member’s home. In addition, the food that I ordered via room service was exceptionally delicious. 

However, the highlight of the hotel is its fantastic staff. Each staff member that I encountered was genuinely friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  For example, prior to my arrival Sean, Clare, and Conor (from the concierge staff) helped me arrange airport transfers to and from the hotel. Also, Sean and other members of the concierge staff were particularly helpful, in terms of providing information about tours, attractions, and directions. I was given a complimentary fruit basket and box of chocolates, as well as a lovely note from the general manager Peter MacCann. Niamh, Ciara, and Ben (from the front desk) were very accommodating and always willing to be of assistance. Housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping my room spotless and beautiful every day. Finally, the porters always greeted me with smiles and good wishes. 

In closing, if you are ever intend to stay in Dublin, I would highly recommend booking a reservation at The Merrion Hotel.",5,2015,07,28
200,Wedding December 2014,"We had a our wedding at the Merrion in December. Before we were engaged we had a lovely relationship with the hotel and its staff , so when it came to our big day - there was no other option ! Staff in the Merrion are always extremely helpful and courteous and staying a night with them is a complete treat. The spa is a favourite of mine Irene,Hud,Sarah , Anna and Yvonne are just a few to mention . Treatments are always excellent and the therapists are very talented. At our wedding all the staff were pulling out all the stops for our big day. Head chef Ed Cooney was a pleasure to work with and chef Liam delivered a fabulous meal which our guests are still talking about now . Paul Kelly created a gorgeous assortment of Christmas favourites. Private dinning management and staff were superb and added a even more of a wow factor to the meal. This is a very well managed hotel with General Manager Mr. Peter McCann at its head. I would highly recommend this hotel - in fact we have an ongoing joke when we stay anywhere else 'it's not the Merrion' . It is very difficult to beat . Well done and thank you all. 
Ann's ",5,2015,07,27
200,Great staff Dissapointing food,"The  Merrion is like an stately home. But is not at all ""stuffy"" This is because of the excellent staff who make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive.
Our room was perfect very comfortable. 
We had been booked on a dine and dream package so we chose from the house menu in the cellar restaurant. Our starters were fine and my dessert was beautiful unfortunately the main course was dissapointing .
We ordered the Beef which was Ok but the only vegetable accompianment was 4 tiny slices of potato.
The choice for breakfast was fabulous. I am sorry I chose the fry. I always thought a full Irish would include potato bread and soda bread also my sausage was undercooked.
Overall my stay at the Merrion was good but I would recomend it as a bed and breakfast option only.",4,2015,07,27
200,Spa treatments,"I had a wonderful experience at the Merrion Tethra Spa recently. 
I enjoyed an incredibly relaxing massage and facial. I had been working very hard before deciding to treat myself and needed a bit of pampering.
I knew that the Tethra Spa would deliver exactly what I was looking for. The friendly and professional staff look after you from the minute you walk through the doors to the minute you leave.",5,2015,07,26
200,Excellent quiet hotel in a great location,"Our family stayed at the Merrion and I would highly recommend the hotel for its service, location and room size. We were greeted late at night by a friendly porter, a nice front desk person and offered to have a late night snack in the lounge area. It was a welcome relief to have food available at that late hour because we had just arrived much later than expected from overseas and had missed the chance to eat dinner in town. 
We had two rooms- one located in the old part of the hotel and one located in the addition. Our junior suite room located in the older section of the hotel was large, light and airy. It had a nice bathroom, sitting area and the bed and linens were very comfortable. The negatives- we had a terrible view of an alleyway with rubble and debris and the second morning we discovered that the rooms are not very soundproof. We heard a couple checking in, the bags going in and out with the slam of the firedoor throughout the morning. Our children stayed in a large junior suite in the newer section of the hotel. They had a large spacious room and they said it was so quiet they could have slept all day. If given the choice I think I would stay in the newer section if I wanted to sleep in and enjoy the hotel in the morning. 
The hotel is located in the heart of the action and it is easy to get to get around to shops and restaurants. The concierge was very helpful and pointed us in the right direction to all of the sights. The entire staff was friendly and very helpful.",5,2015,07,26
200,Outstanding Hotel Experience,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin sets a new high in providing an outstanding hotel experience .   We have stayed in many five star hotels in UK, Europe and USA most of them with multiple visits over two decades of business and leisure..     There is nowhere else we have beenwhere the standard is as high as the Merrion in Dublin.  There are the the usual tangible aspects such as comfort, cleanliness, room quality and other however, at the Merrion, one experiences the intangible, a welcome, hospitality an ambience and a total stay experience that makes it a special place to visit.   Every aspect of the hotel offering scores as high or above the others.    This is our experience over many visits throughout the lifetime of the hotel, consistently an outstanding hotel experience.",5,2015,07,26
200,Friendly 5 star hotel,"We have just returned home after a 2 night break in Dublin, we thoroughly enjoyed our trip. My wife choose the Merrion Hotel because of good trip advisor reviews, the hotel was perfect in every way.

On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly porter and taken to an equally happy and professional receptionist, first impression was excellent. We were taken to our room 395 which was large with a king sized bed and a good sized bathroom, the room was very quiet and modern with all the necessary additions you would expect in a hotel of this quality.

As it was our first time in Dublin we made our way to the concierge desk and met Sean, he told us the best bus route to go on, recommended the Guinness stop (which we loved) and restaurants to go to prior to our shows we had booked.

The breakfasts in the hotel are very good indeed, we can recommend the Irish breakfast with eggs, Irish sausages, bacon, black pudding, tomatoes and mushrooms, if you have room after that then the fresh berries are amazing.

We were extremely satisfied with our stay at the Merrion and can highly recommend this hotel to people who want a 5 star experience. Congratulations to the manager and all the staff, you are one of the most friendly and happy teams we have ever met.",5,2015,07,25
200,business hotel,"The Merrion  is well situated but the block where most of the accommodation is 1990's built , rather lacks character, bedrooms are spacious enough beds comfy..., Breakfast is average and served in a dark cellar room which is a shame , they also serve lunch in here which is good food but once again why not bring the food into the natural light!!",4,2015,07,24
200,Fantastic Hotel,"Great hotel the staff were very friendly, the rooms were lovely and the hotel is situated in a great location in the city making most things accessible by foot. The tour buses stop right outside the hotel making those attractions further away more accessible.",5,2015,07,24
200,Wonderful hotel!!!,"The Merrion is one of the best hotels we have stayed in! I did not choose this hotel, and by the pictures I was not convinced (it looked a bit dated), however I was positively surprised! The hotel is beautiful, the decoration, although very upscale and not very modern, is beautiful. They have a wonderful art collection as well. The staff is first class - attentive, friendly, helpful. The hotel is generous and offer a lot of small details, such as  infinite bottles of water for free during your stay, bowls of fruit throughout the hotel, etc. Th breakfast buffet is really good. 

Our room was very comfortable and cozy. The bed, wonderful! We slept really well. The bathroom huge! The location could't be better, close to shops, restaurants, attractions. All of the concierge's recommendations were magnificent as well. 

I definitely recommend The Merrion, and hope to come back very soon! We fell in love with Dublin and the hotel!!!",5,2015,07,23
200,Impeccable,"Beautiful hotel in Georgian Dublin with understated elegance and sophistication. We arrived early on a Monday morning just off an international flight. We didn't expect for them to have a room ready, and so the staff escorted us into the parlor for tea and scones while we waited, and yet we were soon after in a room by 8:00 a.m. Our room had a spacious, luxurious bath. This might be a small detail, but there were no cleaning carts clogging hallways, but rather polite cleaning staff with discreet hand-held caddies ... a refreshing change from what you typically encounter in even the finest hotels. We did not use the spa, but it was very nice with an indoor pool. We enjoyed cocktails in the cozy Cellar Bar and also a fabulous full Irish breakfast one morning. A nice touch is Bar 23, where can can get full service - coffee, tea, cocktails and food - 24 hours/day.",5,2015,07,23
200,Excellent,"Have to say this is the best hotel I've stayed in Dublin. Convenient to shops and attractions. Room was spectacular. Food in the cellar bar was excellent. Staff so helpful. Had booked for bed & Sunday brunch which is served until 5pm. We arrived about 4:50 due to surrounding streets being closed for a festival. Reception staff contacted the bar to hold us a table, showed us to our room and directed us to the bar. Staff there made no mention of us arriving after 5 and provide great service. Loved it.",5,2015,07,21
200,Excellent,"First rate experience. The hotel is as attractive in reality as the photographs suggest. The service befits a 5* property - prompt, courteous and helpful. Recommend the afternoon tea - delightful! Great location for business or weekending as it's right in the heart of shopping, theatre and Dublin nightlife. Expensive - but worth it!",5,2015,07,21
200,A great stay,This is a sophisticated and friendly hotel. We were a bit worried about staying here with our 3 boys after seeing the afternoon tea going on. There was no need to be concerned however as we were made to feel welcome and comfortable. The adorable little bed for our 8 yr old and the kid's robe and slippers made his stay! We were also given great local restaurant suggestions that were perfect for our family. A great first visit to Dublin. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2015,07,21
200,Fabulous property and conveniently located.,Fabulous property and conveniently located. The staff was helpful and friendly. Our room was available early in the morning. Nice bars and restaurant. The bar upstairs was open late and thankfully provided great snacks after our pub crawl. Wonderful artwork throughout.,5,2015,07,20
200,Wonderful Merrion,The hotel is a wonderful example of modern and old Dublin. The rooms' decor was well done and provided everything you could want...including air conditioning which is most uncommon in the area. The food and service was outstanding. The bartender in the bar was a master mixologist! The art collection is outstanding. Overall the best of Ireland.,5,2015,07,20
200,Very Good,"Look I have been going to this hotel for over 15 years and it is simply a great city hotel; the best in Ireland in my humble opinion. My only grip I have which has made me submit this review is the wifi. Its outdated, does not connect easily and can be slow.Guys you need to do something about this. Can I also say that the service in the lounge area was a little lacking than usual. Otherwise a great stay as always and looking forward to coming back.",5,2015,07,19
200,just wonderful,"My husband and I spent a night in the Merrion Hotel.  I can't praise it enough, from check in to check out there was no fault to be found.  The staff were wonderful, our room fabulous and so quiet during the night.  Cant wait for an excuse to stay there again............",5,2015,07,19
200,One of the great hidden gems in the world,"Relaxed traditional elegance - understated spacious luxury and service excellence .

A historic building tastefully renovated and extended to provide 5 star mod cons and a n internal garden. Eclectic collection of art sprinkled across the premises. 

Service was attentive and extremely responsive without being intrusive. Could not fault it for anything bar TV reception. 

One has a lot of good choices when visiting Dublin. I am not even going to look at any others on my next visit. 
",5,2015,07,19
200,An Exceptional Delight,"We have never met a more welcoming, sincere and professional staff in all our travels. From pre-arrival assistance and bookings by the exceptional concierge team, to our early arrival assistance by Colm, to our welcoming and introduction by Hannah and Ciera, and to the quite boisterous and memorable evening at the Guilbaud, everyone we met was absolutely delightful. 
Their hard work, dedication to perfection, and love of what they do is evident in every moment. We had a wonderful stay at The Merrion and will certainly return whenever we find ourselves in Dublin.",5,2015,07,18
200,"A Sophisticated, Beautiful Place to Stay.","Staying here you really feel like royalty.  The hotel is gorgeous and the staff is very nice.  Breakfast was excellent and the staff there was probably the best we ever had when it comes to service.  They went out of their way for us to make sure everything was perfect,  OMG-the bed!  It was amazing how comfortable the bed was. I felt like I was melting inside the bed.  The lobby is also gorgeous. When you enter the hotel, you realize immediately why it is ranked number one in Dublin. We stayed in the Garden Wing but that was just fine.  I can only imagine how the main building could be any better.  Unfortunately, we had a view of the construction taking place next door to our room, but that is someone else's property so I'm sure nothing could be done about that.  Still, it is a very lovely place and you can sit outside in the garden and not too many hotels in Dublin have an outside sitting area.  The prices may be high but the hotel is all worth the expense.  They have an amazing spa and pool next to the Cellar Restaurant.  I highly recommend the Merrion.",5,2015,07,17
200,A lovely oasis in the jungle of Dublin!!,"Great location in the center of Dublin, but its very quiet.  Rooms are spacious, beds luxurious, and bathrooms grand with separate shower and soaking tub.  Hotel staff make you feel special, like they are only there to make sure you enjoy your stay.  Hotel grounds are very beautiful, with lovely fountains, and plenty of outdoor seating.  Just an outstanding place to stay while in Dublin!!  Highly recommend.  Food was great, with tea times and excellent room service.",5,2015,07,17
200,Luxurious stay in a great location,We booked the Merrion through American Express platinum leading hotels and the amenity we received was an upgrade if possible in addition to breakfast daily and one meal which can be used for lunch or dinner.  Only one room was upgraded out of the four rooms we booked since the hotel was fully booked. The upgraded room received a welcome package of fresh fruit and sparkling lemonade. The other rooms booked using same method received nothing.  The breakfast is a continental breakfast but if you want anything from the breakfast menu instead of continental they will charge 6 euro regardless of what you order so it's worth it if you don't care for a cold breakfast.  The rooms are clean and luxurious with a lovely tub in the bathroom. I don't usually use hotel tubs but this time I did.  If you book through this American Express program use the free meal towards dinner.  It will cover any appetizer plus your main course and dessert regardless of price on the menu. The cellar restaurant was excellent and we really enjoyed the meal. The service at dinner was impeccable and it was a great culinary experience. I highly recommend this. Our meal for 8 persons was approximately 400 euros and we only had to pay for beverages.   It was one of the best meals we had in Dublin. My husband needed a heavy duty transformer to use his CPAP machine and they had them available. Very few hotels we stayed at on this trip had them   Valet parking for the hotel is free.   The location was a big plus in that it was easy to get to all the major places within walking distance.  There is no minibar refrigerator   For the price you can't go wrong with this hotel.  ,5,2015,07,17
200,Wow,"What a hotel ,Georgian buildings converted ,we don't have this in Spain so it was unique for us.
The food here is also very good with an amazing 2 star Michelin restaurant providing the meal of the trip for us. Breakfast were divine except one thing the breads and pastries could be more fresh,I think they don't make them there.
The concierge is very good with good recommendations except the restaurant called Amuse they are recommending is not good just a money trap.
It is also across form the national library of Ireland which is incredible.",5,2015,07,16
200,City Center Luxury,"The location is among the finest in the city, next to Merrion Square and the Irish Parliament, with Trinity college a short walk away.  The service was impeccable, combining the right measure of friendliness and professionalism.  The food was excellent and the surrounding area has Dublin's best restaurants.",5,2015,07,15
200,Elegant but a little stuffy,"I liked this Hotel and you couldn't fault the service which was on point and by that I mean it was polished and professional. Very central but quiet too. Valet parking on arrival, just as you would expect. Room was very comfortable and great nights sleep. All the mod cons and amenities you would require and quality. Linen, pillows and quilt were to die for .....where did they get these? Hotel is very elegant and great outdoor spaces. Great spa and pool. Drawing room and bar very nice. We had a good lunch and breakfast was very good too. There were couple of points however that jarred. We arrived from Cork and were tired and hungry and for some reason were not given the option of afternoon tea, I wouldn't go as far as to say we were rushed through the drawing room but not far off. As we were arriving it seemed as though someone important was due to arrive, with Police Outriders, Police Cars outside and a security presence, it seemed their arrival was more important than ours. The staff seemed distracted by this. In the Drawing room we were made to feel that we were not adequately dressed but we were smart and later on we noticed a guest which we were told by staff was a regular, dressed in track suit and T shirt....and he was being served in these same areas. Incidentally we had to ask the Bar staff after a great night out to ask this guest to leave us alone as he imposed himself on us and was clearly the worst for drink. The bar staff handled this very well. This is a formal hotel and it does have a dress code so won't be to everyone's liking but one guest should be treated same as any other. This is the reason I have rated service as just average.",4,2015,07,14
200,A perfect stay,"We had a really fabulous 4 night stay at the Merrion.  We chose a deluxe king room which was spacious and very comfortable.  Service was extremely attentive, all our questions were answered easily and quickly, breakfast room service was incredibly prompt and luxurious, and housekeeping was efficient and unobtrusive.  Somehow they managed to get it all right! 

As others have noted, the hotel is old (and historic), so there are some quirks of the building - i.e. we heard noise one evening from a private function down the hall - but the hotel is very attractive and our room was lovely.  The gym is functional, not luxurious (the locker rooms can use an upgrade.) The Merrion is a really wonderful and well run hotel in a superb Dublin location.",5,2015,07,13
200,Beautiful Hotel,The hotel is beautiful with two lovely sitting rooms.  There were fires lit in each of the sitting rooms and very comfortable furniture creating an intimate place to sit and enjoy the hotel outside of the room.  The room was very comfortable and a spacious bathroom.  Service was exceptionally friendly and informative.,5,2015,07,13
200,Great staff and experience,"We had terrible issue with wifi which required IT help. The staff was great and they eventually brought a private router to solve the problem. This hotel has cozy spaces great art, history and is low profile.  It is not a 5 star deluxe property but it is very lively and in a great location.  Highly recommend this propert.",5,2015,07,13
200,"Exceptional service, older physical plant. ","The staff was uniformly great. The rooms are adequate, but not particularly luxurious. Great beds. 

24 hour room service is a great feature for newly arrived travelers from overseas. 

During our stay a wing of the hotel was under construction and there was quite a bit of construction noise. I would hold off booking until construction complete. 

Check in time is 3 pm so if you arrive on an overnight flight you have to pay for an extra day. ",4,2015,07,12
200,Outstanding Afternoon Tea,"My wife and I had afternoon tea at the Merrion recently.

The food was all exquisite - and more than two people with very large appetites could finish. The hotel itself is beautiful; elegant and understated, with a collection of Irish art that would be the envy of any public gallery.

Although we did not stay at the Merrion, we certainly will be when next in Dublin. It is the most high calibre hotel in Dublin and really puts the Shelbourne to shame.",5,2015,07,12
200,Understated Sophistication and Elegance,"We just visited Dublin for the first time and stayed at the Merrion.  The location of the property is central and ideal for walking to most parts of Dublin.  While the building outside is historical and unassuming, the elegance of the entrance and the greeting of staff provides a setting of what is to come; world class sophistication and comfort.  It is a combination of old world charm in decor in the common areas and the rooms itself however, they are up to date and have all the outstanding amenities expected from a hotel of this caliber coupled with an incredible level of service.  If we were to return to Dublin, we would definitely choose the Merrion again.",5,2015,07,12
200,Great location,"Great location for seeing Dublin, doing some shopping and being close to everything. The rooms are very small as expected, but the beds comfortable, bathroom clean and staff very accommodating and provided superb customer service. The staff in the bar seemed to be always rushed, but provided service with a smile each time but then rushed away to be on top of their next order. The drinks were delicious and the closeness of the restaurant Patrick Guildbaud perfect. ",5,2015,07,11
200,At Home at the Merrion,"From the moment you step into the Merrion you feel like they will take care of you.  We came at 7 a.m. and had coffee and Danish in front of a roaring fire.  Our room was ready !  The manager came over and spoke to us offering to do whatever she could to make our stay a great experience. 
We had a lovely room and a free three course dinner in their restaurant which was a special perk through American Express. The pastry chef outdid himself!!!! Also a fabulous breakfast was included every morning with our room price. It was everything you could imagine for breakfast.

Every afternoon the rooms were filled with people having afternoon tea. Downstairs is a famous bar.  Always full of people.  My friends were there the night before they flew out and were upgraded to a huge suite at no additional cost.

Great location. Use hop on hop off green bus. 

I would definitely return. It is very comfortable and elegant. Just loved it!!!",5,2015,07,11
200,Cellar Bar - my city fav.,In Dublin I often find myself in the Cellar Bar enjoying the tranquility and excellent food on offer. I have eaten my way through most of the offerings but have to say you would really struggle to get a better burger anywhere - and yes I know the gravity of that statement. The staff are highly trained and the food is well prepared and carefully put together. I recommend this to anyone.,5,2015,07,11
200,Charming Stay in a Good Location,"One could be very happy relaxing in several of the rooms off the lobby overlooking a beautiful garden.  It is here that guests meet, read, and even have a bite to eat.

We walked through these rooms to get to our lovely superior king garden room which is part of the new section of the hotel.  Our room was quite large, decorated nicely, and was very quiet.  The bathroom had all the amenities needed as well.

We were close to Trinity College where we visited the Book of Kells, and it was a short walk for shopping as well.

Dinner at The Cellar Bar was excellent.  Arriving on a Sunday it was the only place to eat.  It did not disappoint.   With a full array of fish and meat to select, not one of us had a complaint.  Breakfast which was included with our reservation was enjoyable however, we found the buffet to be adequate but not overwhelming.  We were disappointed not to find smoked salmon on the table, like our other stops in this hotel category, but there was plenty of which to choice.

The service was excellent from the front desk, to housekeeping to the wait staff and beyond.  All were well trained.

With only one night to stay before embarking on a cruise, this was a most enjoyable stay.",5,2015,07,10
200,Wonderful Hotel in Heart of Dublin,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is ideally located for walking to the center of Dublin plus sightseeing and getting to the local DART train, which goes north and south on the coast. It is a deluxe hotel so a splurge, but do it if you can. Ask for a room in the main building overlooking the gardens with it's statue of James Joyce. There is also a Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel. The breakfasts are outstanding. There is an indoor pool and spa as well.",5,2015,07,10
200,Art Afternoon Tea in style,Treated some friends and myself to this culinary experience for a special birthday. Was not disappointed.  Presentation of the food and flavours was just amazing.  There was so much food - we were given very stylish doggy bags to take home! Both service and all the fine detail was to die for - china;silverware; linen napkins etc  Wonderful!,5,2015,07,10
200,Outstanding property and staff.,"Super comfortable.  Great location.  Just a lovely place to stay in the heart of Dublin.
Everything is beautifully done. Immaculate down pillows and comforters...lovely Asprey bath accessories....Just wonderful...Love it every time!",5,2015,07,09
200,Elegance personified.,"The best city hotel I've ever stayed in. The ultimate in truly elegant décor, sumptuous rooms with every possible facility, amazing food beautifully presented, and attentive, genuinely friendly service. In the best possible location for those looking for cultural Dublin - close to the National Art Gallery, Trinity College, the Natural History Museum, Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. The Georgian building is superbly appointed and houses a fine art collection. An amazing place, I can't imagine anywhere better in any city in the world.",5,2015,07,09
200,Just perfect,"Perfect location (near hop on, hop off green bus line), attentive and friendly staff. Loved the courtyard and cozy bar. The hotel is being renovated but, at least in May 2015, the work did not impact our stay. The plans to improve will make this a showcase hotel, not that it is not already. I would return in a heartbeat. Food was wonderful including the generous Irish breakfast. 
Out room was very spacious, clean as a whistle and comfortable.",5,2015,07,09
200,Wedding Reception,"My son booked The Merrion for his wedding meal with 16 guests. The quality of the food and friendly service was unsurpassed.  The waiters using their own initiative,.even thought of providing us with gas filled balloons to keep the two young children amused.
We were looked after so well by all staff. The athmosphere in the cavernous dining room was wonderful. 
I would have no hesitation in recommending The Merrion for any function",5,2015,07,09
200,Loved every minute of it.....,"Stayed here for a weekend, it was a busy trip to Dublin so was in and out of the hotel dashing about most of the time but when I did get to have a drink and relax it was fantastic.  Room was nice and extremely comfortable - beds were so soft and luxurious whilst the bathroom was tiled floor to ceiling in white marble and a plentiful supply of toiletries......only issue for us was that the room was a long journey away from the reception/bar and the window in the room faced out onto an alleyway which an alarm was going off in the whole night - nothing the hotel could do about this!  Had a salad in the courtyard which was tasty a few cocktails again very nice only problem being there was a 15 - 20 minute wait on the cocktails - waiter informed us the bar tender was new and a total perfectionist!  Staffs were so friendly and obliging - car parking was €20.00 a day which in my opinion should be complimentary.  It is a top end place to stay so needless to say extremely expensive but if money was not an issue I would definitely stay here again and again and again!!!!",4,2015,07,09
200,Stunning hotel. Shame about breakfast,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the staff are very friendly and attentive. The rooms are lovely and have lots of nice little extras like welcome chocolates and plastic bags so you can get ready for airport security. The only downside was the price of breakfast. When you're paying around €300 a night you don't expect to then be charged almost €30 per person on top for breakfast. I guess we wouldn't have minded so much but the portions were tiny consisting of one small sausage, a rash of bacon and few extra and I had to send my eggs back because they were under cooked and when they came back again they were still raw on the inside. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate but the choice is very limited for a 5* hotel. Also the wifi was very annoying. I had to keep logging into it every time I wanted to access it via my phone.

I would definitely recommend the hotel itself but skip on the breakfast and head to a nice cafe in town.",4,2015,07,09
200,Best hotel in all of Ireland,"Want to be pampered?  STAY HERE!  Our family has stayed in hotels all over the world and all 10 of us agree that this place had top notch service!  You are greeted by the bellhop right from the start and never touch your bags until they arrive up in your room.  

The front desk personnel personally escort you to your room and give you a brief orientation of the hotel and room amenities.  

Nightly turn down service includes slippers at your bedside and curtains drawn close. They even picked up your room during turn down service. We would return from dinner and out shoes would be rearranged and baggage/clothing placed neatly to the side out of the way.  They even replenished used towels.

Literally this was the best service we have EVER received at a hotel, and we've stayed at more than 100 different places!

Only slightly negative I can even think of was the short list of kids options for dinner.  But that was pretty much the norm thorough out all of Ireland.",5,2015,07,08
200,Finest hotel I have ever stayed in.,"The Merrion is gorgeous.  A series of Georgian townhouses adapted to become the reception areas of the hotel.  On arrival, one goes through a series of gorgeous drawing rooms, each with original fireplaces, fine art and lovely-and comfortable-furniture.  The staff is exceptionally pleasant without being obsequious.   Guest rooms are spacious. Bath rooms are very nice. Food in the Cellar Restaurant was very good.  This is where I would like hospice.",5,2015,07,08
200,Excellent accomodations/service with one exception,"Best staff and service of the three 5-stars on our European trip (also stayed Ashford Castle in western Ireland and La Maison Champs Elysees in Paris).  Accomodations / room were also outstanding.  Loved the food and the bars, especially the basement bar which was very quaint.  Only issue was the $1000+ hold they left on our credit card even after we settled our account when departing.  Caused inconvenience later in Paris.",4,2015,07,07
200,Luxurious Yet Down to Earth,"We wished we were staying twice as long as our recent 2-day stop at the Merrion.  The service was lovely, our room was quiet and super comfortable, and in short there was nothing too large or too small for the staff to help with.  From helping me ship a box home, to providing drinks to me & a friend at 2am (!), to serving my son dinner in the lounge and booking a babysitter for me - they handled it all with ease and aplomb.  We'll be back!",5,2015,07,06
200,Great experience,"Accommodations and service were excellent.  Wish the bar was opener a little later but overall great experience.  The massages were awesome, but wish the shower portion of the spa was a little more private.  All service people were friendly and accommodating.",5,2015,07,06
200,Vacation,Beautiful hotel. Staff was amazing. They couldn't do enough for you. The room was stunning. Bed was extremely comfortable. Within walking distance to many sites. This is a luxurious hotel but you get what you pay for. Hop on hop off bus stop literally outside front door. They valet the car and there was no need for it at all.,5,2015,07,06
200,Thoughtful ,"5 star and personal . Excellent service and concierge . All restaurant bookings , baby sitting handled well . Spa clean and first rate . Preferred by me to the shelbourne . Our children were very welcome and really appreciated the small touches for them 
",5,2015,07,05
200,Totally Fabulous,The service at this hotel was exemplary. From check in to turn down service at night. We had six adults and four children staying in three rooms. Each family said the exact same thing...great hotel. My family has traveled all over the world and I did not have one complaint. The breakfast was very nice and we had one dinner in the fine dining room which was terrific. The of the four children fell asleep at dinner and the stuff seeing our jet lag fully exposed hurriedly got us through the fine dining in less than an hour. The children were totally welcomed throughout the hotel. Their rooms had mini robes and milk and cookies and a balloon with crayons. All the wonderful fun little things. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples or families. The pool was warm and very large and adults as well as kids delighted in it. Although the hotel was full it did not seem like it. Staff was patient and never seemed flustered. We had our concierge solve a problem with a restaurant that wanted to charge us for canceling so late and he worked it out with them. Pricy a bit but a real treat for a special family or couple occasion.,5,2015,07,04
200,The Merrion Hotel - truly 5 star!,We recently stayed at The Merrion Hotel and had a wonderful stay. It is so relaxing and the location is superb. The staff are amazing and very helpful. The bedrooms are lovely and comfortable. The garden is a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Merrion Hotel is pure luxury - truly 5 star!,5,2015,07,04
200,oh what a stay,"I was so excited, acdc concert and staying in the best hotel in the world, the concert rocked but the hotel rocked even more. I was very nervous at first having not stayed at a fine hotel before, but i had nothing  to be worried about, everything was perfect, I met two great friends, Sheila, Reservations and Revenue Manager and Clare, in concierge, what great people they are, the hotel is very lucky to have them on board.

Only disappointment was they couldn't find me a good Gnocchi restaurant.

The hotel tried to get me €35 bouquet of flowers for my wonderful wife but in the end i got them for $15 euros at the petrol station, happy days

My mate Richard got me a shout out at Aviva concert to my name Gay-jay, what a good bloke
 
isnt it great to be alive - i am still excited

THANK YOU TO THE MERRION

i cannot wait to return to Dublin for another concert, i hope 1D are there next",5,2015,07,03
200,Elegant old world service,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion June 26 for three days.  This was a beautiful hotel with wonderful friendly service. The garden is beautiful and the outdoor space to enjoy it was very comfortable.  great bed, very calm and quiet room. Good location for walking. Would definitely stay here again.  The breakfast is a bit pricey, but there is a good place for breakfast down the street.",5,2015,07,03
200,Never Disappoints,"My husband and I have been staying at The Merrion for years and we have never been disappointed.  We are always greeted with warm welcomes from the moment we step out of the car all through the hotel.  When friends ask where to stay in Dublin I tell them there is only one hotel.  I love the feel of the public rooms from the elegant entrance to the living rooms with fires burning to all the wonderful art.  It is a treat for the senses.
The garden is lovely and peaceful.  There is the best indoor pool, in a city hotel, that I have ever seen. The only fault I have is that i am not crazy about the basement restaurants but I was told that is changing.  There is nothing wrong with them, the food is good and service is excellent, I just am not fond of basements.  The location can't be beat.",5,2015,07,02
200,Unparalleled stay in all categories!,"What more could anyone ask for?  We stayed for three nights at the end of a month long visit covering Spain, England and Ireland.  We wanted to end our trip on a high note, and the Merrion didn’t disappoint!  It's not cheap, but you'll be glad you spent the money.

Room: We had two connecting, sumptuous, garden wing superior king rooms for my husband and I as well as our 15 year old son.  Both rooms were quite spacious, with plenty of natural light and blissfully quiet: one room was a king bed, and the other was two twins. Both with the most heavenly, comfortable beds we slept in during the entire trip (our son, who usually can’t wait to sight-see, would have been content to stay in bed the entire four days).  They had all modern amenities one would expect to find in a hotel of this caliber: individual air conditioning, toiletries, free wi-fi, and the list goes on  They were immaculate and I loved the little touches they provided, like water in glass bottles.

Bathroom: Large, marble bathroom with deep tub, separate generously-sized shower, only one sink (but ample room on shelf for toiletries), a scale, and heated towel bar.

Service:  Very attentive, professional staff with impeccable service – not pretentious at all.  Everyone offered help and had a quick, heartfelt smile.  The doormen and concierge staff were knowledgeable and accommodating and anticipated several of our needs (arrived in the evening and asked us if we’d like them to locate a place to eat as several places were no longer serving food.)  Had our bags whisked to our room before I even knew what was happening  and then the front desk staff walked us to our rooms telling us all about the Merrion and it’s amazing artwork along the way.  We loved it!  They love what they do, and made us feel as if we were cherished family and dear friends.  Housekeeping didn’t seem fazed by our teenaged son’s smelly soccer cleats (we’d been in England to train with Aston Villa).  

Hotel: Elegant, well-maintained hotel and grounds.  Definitely worth every five star review.  Son enjoyed the pool which was a wonderful plus.  Next time, I’m going to try some of the spa services!

Area: Can’t beat the location! Walking distance to many of Dublin’s sights, museums, and so forth.  Within a block or two, there were several pubs, restaurants for fish and chips or anything else you could desire, plus many shops.  We walked almost everywhere and felt very safe the entire time.  I still believe that you have to exercise caution though, as there are unscrupulous people all over the world.  Took about 20-25 minutes to get to Dublin airport via taxi, which were easy to come by, so it didn’t add any time.

Food:  The Cellar restaurant had a generous, delicious breakfast – if you’re hungry afterwards, it’s your own fault!  We didn’t have a chance to have afternoon tea there, but it’s now on my to-do list for our next stay.  It looked divine!  The morning we departed we had planned to eat in the restaurant before heading to the airport, but there was a mix-up regarding what time they opened and we discovered it hadn’t opened yet.  Without saying anything to anyone, as we were walking back to our room and formulating a plan regarding where we were going to eat and when, a staff member rushed up to us and asked if we needed something to eat.  How did they know??  We explained the situation and they arranged for us to have room service sent to our room right away.

Room service: Faster than a speeding bullet, which was a relief as I was beginning to panic about whether or not we’d be able to make our flight.  It was delivered and set up with all of the pomp and circumstance that you’d from a hotel of this caliber and the food was exceptionally delicious.  We were able to eat relatively leisurely, and still made it to the airport with some time to spare. 

We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2015,07,01
200,Simply the best!,"Everything about this hotel is superlative.  The staff is friendly, helpful and professional. The rooms are lovely, the beds comfortable and the amenities plentiful.  We celebrated our 48 th wedding anniversary here and room service provided us with a beautifully set trolley with cheeses and breads to go with a bottle of French rose.  The hotel is well situated within walking distance of good restaurants and a park.",5,2015,07,01
200,Still has it :),"We returned again this year (hope we can make it an annual thing going forward!!).
We were not let down. We had such a lovely stay last year and dined in Guilbauds and hoped we hadn't built it up too much to be a disappointment this time and indeed it lived up to our expectations.
We used the pool area this time and we hadn't last time, so that was another bonus.
On the whole a beautiful hotel with excellent staff and wonderful facilities in the best location you could ask for ... what more could one want!",5,2015,07,01
200,Great hotel smack dab in the middle of everyyhing,"The Merrion has it all...large rooms in a historic hotel but with all modern amenities, along with an incredibly attentive staff.  It also has the biggie: location location location.
Within a block there was every pub and fish and chips restaurant you could ever want, plus every other ethnic spot along with a huge shopping area.
We'll be back.",5,2015,06,30
200,A lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The Merrion was a beautifully kept, well-priced hotel conveniently located in the heart of Dublin. The room was light, well-furnished with king sized bed, and marble bath. The Cellar restaurant was a great dining option, as well as where a generous breakfast was served. And the indoor pool looked lovely, although we didn't use it. The service was top notch, with everyone always offering help and a smile. Highly recommended!",5,2015,06,30
200,'Something very special',June 27th 2015. I'm from Dublin but I stayed here overnight with my husband because we went to a show in the Olympia and decided to make a night of it. This hotel is just pure luxury and special. The staff are extremely professional and care about the service they are giving you. We have stayed on a couple of occasions before and each time it just gets better. You just check-out feeling like you have had the lovliest of times! I wish I could live here!,5,2015,06,30
200,First Class Experience,The Merrion lives up to all of its reviews. The rooms are luxurious and immaculate. The staff goes out of their way to anticipate your needs. The two bars are great. Impeccable service with a smile. The doormen and concierge staff are knowledgeable and accommodating. Center city location makes almost everything within walking distance. The only problem is availability. It is sometimes difficult to book as it fills up fast.,5,2015,06,29
200,Definitely not 5 star rooms.,Although the dining room for afternoon tea is lively the room we stayed in was average. We got a room at the end of a long corridor with no view. The bathroom was large and the bed was comfortable but the room seems dated and in need of sprucing up. The staff were lovely. I was appalled to be charged for parking I thought it should be free. The breakfast was average. I was surprised about this as I'd heard so many people rave about it. It's a nice hotel but the room we got was overpriced for what we got.,3,2015,06,28
200,Great staff.,"The staff were welcoming and helpful at every turn. The facilities here are the issue. In our room, we could have used a cabinet of some sort in the bathroom. There was nowhere to store items like makeup and toiletrees that was convenient. The pedestel sink had no bars for hanging towels. I did love the towel warmer in the tub. But the half wall in the tub made it inconvenient to draw a bath and did not fully protect from shower spray. Also, my husband had a massage in the spa and it was excellent. The locker room however was like a high school locker room with no shower privacy.",4,2015,06,26
200,An oasis of calm,Luxury and relaxation exudes the Merrion. Excellent staff with 5 star treatment minus pretence. Room comfort is second to none. A must are cocktails in the bar and a drawing room. We went in summer and am excite to hopefully return in winter. Love this hotel.,5,2015,06,26
200,Merrion at its Best!,We celebrated our daughter's graduation and my aunt's 70th birthday at the Merrion.  It was amazing!  The staff was incredible.  We all had fabulous rooms.  The Merrion is always top on our list when we are in Dublin.,5,2015,06,26
200,Elegant hotel with impeccable service!,My family stayed at the Merrion for four nights. The rooms were spacious and gorgeous with fireplaces and chandeliers. Very nicely appointed and comfortable. The meals we had in the restaurant downstairs and the room service we ordered was delicious. The staff is accommodating and gracious. Our kids loved the indoor pool after a day of sight seeing. The hotel is in a great location to walk to many sites and restaurants. And we found the hotel to be very child friendly. This was our second stay at the Merrion. We will definitely stay there again the next time we are in Dublin.,5,2015,06,24
200,Overpriced.,"Why this hotel is so highly regarded is beyond me.

This was our second visit to Ireland and we came this time to stay in a city and celebrate our anniversary. We stayed in Dublin. We were there 6/11 - 6/16, 2015.

Nice location as we could walk to the museums and Trinity College etc. I found the hotel itself dated, dowdy and smug. I think we were too ""young"" for this place. Best part? The Doormen who were delightful!  Second favorite? The Spa Pool.

If you want to spend a very high $$$$ to stay here fine, but others - please take to heart what I said and we couldn't care less for High Tea etc.

Probably great for traveling businessmen etc. as it is very quiet.

We ate at one of their restaurants the first night and then went to other restaurants the rest of our visit and OH, IT DIDN'T RAIN!

I am glad I was able to leave much deserved feedback!

200,Best breakfast in ireland,"I recently went on an 11 day trip to Ireland and switched hotels every one or two days. The merrion served the best breakfast out of all the hotels I stayed at (ashford, dromoland, hayfield, etc), in my opinion. The rooms were lovely and the service was great. The hotel was a quick walking distance from many major historical sites. If you get a chance eat the resaurant called Bang. It is about a 5 min walk from the hotel and was delicious!",5,2015,06,22
200,Lovely,"Just returned from 5 night stay, what a lovely hotel. The everyone is smiling and helpful. The front desk clerk walks each person at check-in to their room. The rooms are quiet, the bed is heavenly, the sheets & towels are soft, and bathroom is large with a separate shower & tub. We had a partial view of the gardens and of construction next door. The construction was not  being done during sleeping times and not on week-ends. So the construction was not a problem. We had breakfast at the Cellar Restaurant, their French toast was the best I ever had, great coffee as well. Service was excellent!  Had room service breakfast on the week-end, that was a treat with best room service I have ever had. We would stay again if in town. Hotel is in good location, a short walk to St.Stephens Green and Grafton St. There is a Spar store around the corner, where we got our daily Magnum ice cream bar and a Café Sol down the street for coffee.",5,2015,06,22
200,A Dublin oasis,"It's amazing to walk off a busy Dublin street into a lovely oasis.  The hotel is so enjoyable to just be in.  I think one of my favourite things about it was the smell (as strange as that sounds).  There was just a fresh smell to it, even in the elevator. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms large, everything new and clean.  They have a great art collection.  The service we received from start to finish was excellent.  I would love to stay here again.",5,2015,06,21
200,Excellence,"The Merrion surpasses 5 star hotels.  From the traditional furnishings  to the spectacular art work the Merrion is a very special place to stay.  The staff is very well trained, courteous and resourceful.  The Spa pool, The Cellar and the breakfast restaurant  all provided timely service and Irish courtesy.  The location is very central.",5,2015,06,21
200,Great stay for businesses or holiday!,"Merrion is supposed to be the nicest hotel in Dublin and it certainly lived up to its expectation! Its centrally located - Grafton Street, Merrion Square, National Museum are all walking distance from the hotel. It has an old world charm with loads elegance and character! The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The hotel also a has a very good infinity pool, gym and lovely gardens. It also has Ireland's only 2 star Michelin restaurant; I did not get to try it though. The service was generally excellent; however, the breakfast service at the restaurant was very slow (Took over 30 minutes to get me some scrambled eggs -  which is not done) so I ended up ordering breakfast in room for the rest of my stay. Would have rated it excellent if not for this slip up.",4,2015,06,19
200,Drinks in the Hotel Bar,"Oh goodness, what a martini!  Ivan dazzled is with his execution of a perfect American style Gin Martini.  Candlelight and intimate spaces, this bar is worth a visit before dinner anywhere in town.  And the interior courtyard is beautiful and a perfect spot for brunch.  The Merrion Hotel is rated one or two in Dublin, but who's counting when you can get a chilled Martini perfectly prepared.  For those needing a Bourbon and branch water, they have a lovely selection of Bourbons which is rare indeed in Dublin.  ",5,2015,06,19
200,"Comfortable ""Old world"" 5 star Hotel - great location","Good hotel, with spacious, comfortable rooms. All the facilities you would expect in a 5 star property such as this. Common rooms beautifully decorated with antiques and a fabulous, eclectic art collection. Service by Front Office Staff and Concierge was mostly good. Can recommend The Cellar (with in the hotel) for lunch. It had a extensive menu, great food and very good service. The hotel location was central and quiet - 10 minutes walk to Grafton Street, excellent restaurants such as ""Matt The Thresher"", FX Buckley Steakhouse and Hugo's all within a few minutes walk. Highly recommend this property for location and comfort.",4,2015,06,18
200,A Truly Special Place,"Do yourself a favor and book a stay here! We have stayed at The Merrion on a few occasions--the last time for a week with my wife and children--and it is truly one of the finest hotels in the world.  The grounds and drawing rooms are the epitome of casual elegance; the rooms are large and comfortable with every amenity; and the dining and bar options feature terrific offerings.  The staff is amazingly courteous and helpful, and have always been extremely kind and welcoming to our young (and active!) children.  The concierge services are knowledgeable and ready (and able) to solve any problem.  The reservations staff are helpful, informative, and accommodating in every way.  This is everything a hotel should be: inviting, comfortable, unpretentious, relaxing, and just a bit indulgent.",5,2015,06,17
200,Saved the day with class and elegence - love this place,"I now always stay in the merrion when in Dublin but tried to book late for a stay last week and they were unfortunately sold out so booked the Ballsbridge hotel instead, to cut a long story short it was absolutely terrible so I got a refund and left almost straight away. In desperation I rang The Merrion and asked if they could help, they had a cancellation and were able to accommodate us and even include free breakfast and parking.

We had room 219 which looks out over the lovely quiet gardens, room was a nice size, lovely bathroom, great bed...all great as usual

NEVER STAYING ANYWHERE ELSE IN DUBLIN AGAIN : ) My favorite hotel in the world so far with the best staff of any hotel I have stayed at !!!!",5,2015,06,17
200,Weekend Stay at The Merrion,"Fabulous Hotel in the heart of Dublin, adjacent to every amenity - Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Merrion where the Staff are second to none and the amenities offered by the Hotel are extensive. Great Eateries and Pool & Spa Facilities",5,2015,06,17
200,"""Excellent Service""",We just returned from our 3 week trip to the UK and Ireland. Our first stop in Ireland was the Merrion. We booked this hotel through our tour guide.  When we arrived they did not have our booking.  After speaking with the guide a mistake had been made on his part.  The hotel customer service stepped right in and made us feel welcomed and were able to secure rooms for us.  The rooms were lovely and well appointed. We enjoyed the hotel bar and restaurant as well as the recommendations for other restaurants in town.  We will recommend The Merrion to all our friends.  Thank you for a lovely stay!,5,2015,06,15
200,Gorgeous Hotel,"One of the nicest hotels Ive ever stayed at.  All the staff were fantastic. Nice rooms, beautiful artwork collection throughout hotel. Book afternoon tea (amazing), enjoy the relaxed atmosphere having a drink in the lounge, and enjoy the pub downstairs. Location for visiting Dublin ideal.",5,2015,06,15
200,Excellent hotel in a great location,"This is an excellent hotel in the prime area for many attractions. We arrived early and the staff kept our bags until the room was available. The staff were very helpful and offered to help with directions, etc. The room was spacious and very clean. The drawing rooms are very elegant and an excellent place for tea. You need to make a reservation, however, to get tea in the drawing rooms.",5,2015,06,14
200,A very special place ,"I just want to say thank you. I stayed here in April for two nights for my anniversary with my partner.The room was beautiful and over looked the gardens. Cute Mini cup cakes were left in the room on arrival.The beds are so comfy. It 
was a shame to get up.Breakfast really was fabulous all you can eat.The pancakes are to die for.The pool was great to help relax and escape the hectic capital city which is a short walk from the hotel.Again thank you all for making my time here magical and a a memory I will cherish forever.",5,2015,06,14
200,"First Class Hotel in the Finest, Old World Sense of the Term","Spent two nights with my partner and in-laws.  Restaurant options plus superb concierge service gave us great flexibility.  My in-laws are in their 80's, and during the daytime they could make their own arrangements with concierge to see sights at their own pace.  My partner and i preferred to hoof it on our own about the city - location is central and makes for easy walks to Trinity College, St. Stephens, Temple Bar area, and even the Guinness Factory.  

After long days around town, we met up with the parents to dine in the hotel.  The first evening we ate informally at the downstairs pub and the second evening at the excellent Patrick Guilbaud (Michelin 2 Star).    

Service was polite, discreet, efficient.  Wonderful.",5,2015,06,14
200,A Treat for our last 2 nights in Ireland,"We spent our final 2 nights of our 8 night trip in Ireland in this fantastic hotel, this was our treat and we really enjoyed it. The B&Bs were brilliant with the exception of the one in Wicklow and excellent value but if you want the little bit of TLC and be a bit exuberant I highly recommend this Hotel & location its just south of Dublin and we were able to get the bus into Dublin for our last full day . Rooms were large and well appointed dinner in the evening was lovely great choices and well cooked and served, breakfast was buffet style which disappointed us a little as we had become accustomed to been served by the ladies in the B&Bs, otherwise it was a great stay and we would stay again if we visit Dublin. A great week in Ireland ended by our visit to Dublin and after a shaky start at a Wicklow B&B it has been superb.",5,2015,06,14
200,"Classy, elegant, comfortable","After traveling throughout Ireland for nearly 2 weeks, the Merrion was my favorite hotel. Their attention to details designed to make your stay comfortable are exceptional.  Some of these were a night light to see to the bathroom in the dart, a lighted make up mirror, and a reading light over each night stand.  My husband had a sore knee after traveling so a hot water bottle was provided!  Receiving an e-mail before our trip welcoming us and afterwards thanking us are just two other small ways this hotel stands out.",5,2015,06,12
200,Great treat,"Stayed here as part of our honeymoon, this is a top class hotel right in the heart of the city. We stayed in the old part of the original house. Our room was great, breakfast had everything you could possibly want. We also used the spa while we were here. I thought the spa area left the overall experience down, the staff in the spa and the treatments were great.",5,2015,06,11
200,The best with a price tag,"I stayed at the Merrion twice over the past 3 months when The Marker was fully booked. This is truly a phenomenal hotel and is an absolute classic. From the moment the doormen greet you, through to the front desk and the staff throughout the hotel, the service is really impeccable. 

If I were coming to Dublin for a family holiday or were a couple 40/50 and over, this is where I would stay. The Merrion has a phenomenal location and is really special. But for those looking for a slightly hipper version of Dublin, I would choose The Marker, which was nice and much more affordable. 

As an LHW Club member, I was upgraded once to the Georgian townhouse rooms, which are very nice. Overall, the rooms need a bit of a face lift as the carpets are worn and some furniture is showing wear and tear. 

The breakfasts are well worth it. Wifi works very well. ",5,2015,06,11
200,First stop Dublin,"25 minute taxi ride from the Dublin Airport, great location to see all Dublin has to offer. Beautiful hotel with wonderful service, comfortable beds. Hotel restaurants are wonderful as well with breakfast in the drawing rooms and tea in the afternoons. Gives you a wonderful taste of the Irish culture.",5,2015,06,10
200,Top rated for good reason,"This was the first of four highly rated hotels we had booked for our trip to Ireland and first of two in Dublin (Easily the superior of the two).  The location was convenient to Grafton Street, but more importantly, the accommodations and service were first rate.  We were treated as valued guests from the time of arrival to departure.  Highly recommended!",5,2015,06,09
200,Perfection,"Our stay was four four nights in the first week of June. I don't think we've ever stayed at a nicer hotel. Our room in the main house looked out on the garden. It had about 14' ceiling and huge, 12', windows that actually opened. Luxurious blue and white toile fabric was used on the lovely curtains and bed. As for the bed, it was absolutely perfect, the mattress and pillows just right and the sheets luxurious. The gorgeous marble bathroom was bright and beautiful with the same huge window. Everything about the hotel is impeccable. 
The public rooms make you fell as though you're in an elegant private home. The service friendly and excellent.. Every small detail was seen to. On the day we left we found small plastic bags placed in the bathroom for the items we had to have screened at the airport. I forgot to mention the food was excellent and the location couldn't be better.  I could go on and on but let me sum up our stay as exquisite.",5,2015,06,09
200,Perfect Stay,"We traveled for two weeks around Southern Ireland, staying in B&B's, cottages, a lodge and a farmhouse.  We ended the trip in Dublin, where we stayed for 2 nights.  Our very good decision was choosing the Merrion in Dublin, to end our already great trip on an even higher note.  From the welcoming doormen, to the beautiful artwork and gracious comfort and elegance of this hotel, we were delighted that this was our choice.  Perfectly situated for walking just about everywhere, it was a welcome place to come after sightseeing in this busy bustling city.  Our room was very large and beautiful, as was the wonderful marble bathroom.  All was spotlessly clean, and it was very easy to relax and feel peaceful here...the room was so great it was hard to leave it.  VERY comfy bed. Every comfort has been thought of, here.  All employees were friendly and helpful. Loved the dining options offered, as well. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin...it was a wonderful treat to stay here.",5,2015,06,05
200,Beautiful relaxing visit,"This is my 5th time in The Merrion, and that speaks for itself. Staff are very very polite ,helpfull and nothing is a problem .
For location its the best in Dublin . Rooms are very very tastefully decorated . 
Food is excellent in all parts of hotel. And an amazing thing for a hotel is that breakfast in room arrives piping hot. 
Probably the best hotel in Dublin and again staff are the gems. ",5,2015,06,05
200,Had a wonderful time...,"We started our Ireland experience in Killarney then headed to Dublin for the last three days of our trip. Being a native New Yorker you will never see the Atlantic Ocean so beautiful.  The hotel was much more than I expected.  The Rooms are beautiful and well kept..  The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable of the area and site that are a must see in and around Dublin...",5,2015,06,04
200,Beautiful,We stayed in August 2014 for a couple of days after driving up from The South of Ireland.  Immediately upon arrival you want to stay for longer.  We were travelling with our 3 kids and had interconnecting rooms.  When we were shown to the rooms they had fruit kebabs and juice already waiting for the children!  The location is great.  The bus tours all stop outside the hotel and you are far enough away from the centre of town to avoid the noise and chaos of a city but a quick walk away to enjoy it.  We had a drink the bar at night and the staff were very friendly.  Breakfast was a lovely experience and plentiful.  Rooms were plush and  we had to make a hard choice between just staying in and enjoying the room and going out to visit the city!,5,2015,06,04
200,The best afternoon tea ,"I was treated to the afternoon art tea. Being a lover of this style of dining I was very impressed by the menu, the attention to detail and the three works of art in pastry that followed. 

We were allowed to sample as much tea, coffee and hot chocolate as we desired from the menu and I would suggest the green tea mock tail . 

The gardens and buildings are stunning and the staff could not have been more helpful. Without a doubt worth a visit. ",5,2015,06,03
200,Great Hotel,"Everything about the hotel was excellent from the desk staff,to room size and amenities, to the restaurants, to the location, to the architecture and to all the service personnel. Next time we are in Dublin we will definitely stay there again. ",5,2015,06,02
200,Outstanding experience,"We loved the hotel and service but were disappointed with the view from our room. We would have preferred to look out onto the hotel grounds or the garden. Restaurant staff were particularly wonderful and polite. The breakfast was also memorable. We loved the lobbies, all with real wood burning fireplaces and extemely cozy",5,2015,06,02
200,We will return soon,"The Merrion in Dublin was recommended to us by two different people who have visited there. The location is the best in Dublin on a quiet street close to parks, shopping, and pubs. But the best part of the Merrion are the people who work at the hotel. Everyone is helpful and so very nice. The rooms are gorgeous and the hotel has original artwork from famous artists on every wall. We ordered room service for breakfast and they came with a feast at a very early time to catch our flight. I would fly to Dublin just to stay at this hotel. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world and this is easily one of my favorites.",5,2015,06,02
200,Dublin charm,"I had to stay in Dublin at short notice over a weekend for a family funeral, from arrival to departure my family was attended to in a sensitive and sympathetic manner beyond what one might expect. I am so grateful to the employees of the Merrion, thank you.",5,2015,05,31
200,Justified Reputation for Luxury and Service,"The Merrion is heralded as the top hotel in Dublin, and our stay confirmed its reputation.  It is a treat to stay in an architecturally significant set of buildings, and the massive art collection (complete with complimentary bound guidebook) is an additional attraction.  From the moment we arrived at the curb, the superb service began with the doormen and porters.  It continued with the front desk staff, housekeeping, room service and restaurant staff.  Everyone was warm, friendly and professional.  Our package included an arrival lunch in the pub.  We arrived on a sunny day and asked if we could have lunch delivered to a table in the courtyard.  No problem!  A great start to our stay.  Our room was a junior suite, and truly was deluxe, with a large living room area with plush sofas and easy chairs, complete with fireplace.  The bed was tops in comforts, dressed in luxury sheets, blanket cover and coverlet.  The bathroom was large, and had a separate tub and shower stall.  Room service breakfast was a ceremony, with two servers setting up breakfast on the table between the two sofas, and the breakfast food was copious and delicious.   We had a great view of the government buildings across the street.  The double-glazed windows kept the room silent.  As close to a perfect stay as one can get.",5,2015,05,31
200,Family weekend,my family travelled from all over Europe to meet here for the weekend.  The Property is comfortable and well kept and the staff charming and accommodating.  But don't expect everything to be as you ordered !!  If you're happy to accept near enough at a very high price this is the place for you.,3,2015,05,28
200,Dublin City Stay,"Excellent hotel in centre of Dublin. Both bedroom and in particular, the lounge areas were excellent with a great feel and atmosphere. Fantastic local art on the walls to. Staff attentive and helpful, but not in any way overbearing.  Hotel easy walking to all the main city centre areas.",5,2015,05,28
200,"The pool, the fireplaces, and the tea...","Best hotel in town and very convenient. pool is perfect for a morning swim and afternoon tea at the fireplaces, even in May, but a raining day in May is a must. Would love to go back again, and hope it won't get too expensive for business budget.",5,2015,05,27
200,Best hotel ever!,"We traveled to three different countries and the Merrion hotel in Dublin was by far the best!  Great location, professional and extremely polite and helpful staff, beautiful rooms and delicious food!  Highly recommend!",5,2015,05,27
200,Charming and comfortable,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here and enjoyed the wonderful location, atmosphere and comfortable ambience. We loved the cosy sitting rooms, the Art and the bar. On the downside, the breakfast room in the basement is a bit depressing so better to have Continental breakfast in the lounge and so many people come in for Afternoon tea that unless you book there may well be no room for you as a hotel guest. The rooms are adequate but perhaps on the small side. Prices vary widely so watch out for the good deals. We would definitely return",4,2015,05,27
200,Fabulous Hotel!!,"This is a truly elegant hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Service is excellent, rooms are beautifully decorated and the hotel bar is top notch.  The Merrion is centrally located to many of the top attractions that Dublin has to offer. Trinity College, Temple Bar District,  and Grafton street are all few blocks away.  The Merrion is one of the finest hotels in all of Europe, you will not be disappointed,",5,2015,05,26
200,Very Nice and Central,"Loved the hotel! The lobby lounge is amazing with two large fireplaces - very cosy.
The Lobby lounge overlooks the garden courtyard also very nice.
We used the pool - its a bit on the small side but very nice.
My main issue was the rooms were rather bland and could use updating considering the cost per night.
We also did the Art High Tea in the Lobby Lounge - it was very good.",5,2015,05,26
200,Excellent Spa,"The Tetra Spa in the Merrion Hotel is a gem with its wonderful staff very ably led by the manager Bernadette and kept spotlessly clean.  The staff is exceptional, friendly; know you by name and always willing to help. .  Recently my wife and I had a full body massage in this wonderful relaxing retreat and it is certainly world class…a perfect place to unwind.  The Spa has state of the art equipment.  The personal trainer Noeleen is great at her job, encouraging and delivers a great personal service.  The18m swimming pool is the ultimate in calm and tranquility and decorated with a beautiful mural and surrounded by some chaise longues on which to relax. The fantastic range of massage and beauty treatments is delivered by award winning staff.  Lots of great fruit, herbal teas, fresh orange juice and infused waters are available to revive you after a good work out. We did not stay in the hotel so cannot report on it.",5,2015,05,26
200,Excellent in all respects,"Wonderful room, service, ambience, food, location.  Highly recommend.  
The staff is extremely professional, friendly and helpful. We received a room upgrade--spacious, well-appointed and lovely view.  Consider it #1 in Dublin.",5,2015,05,26
200,Merrion Long-Weekend Break,"Very pleasant Hotel, well located for getting around Dublin. Some areas of the Hotel look a little tired and the concierge, bellboys and doormen could all do with a pep talk. Receptionist were friendly. Paul the Duty Manager was very helpful in changing our room due to an ugly view of building works (had booked a garden view) and we were gratefully upgraded. Had a bad experience at the Spa unfortunately as the Spa receptionist booked me in for the wrong treatment and I did not enjoy it. I did leave feedback with Shahad the Duty Manager that night. Stayed for three nights with my husband. Would stay again as I liked the general layout of the rooms and the location. However, it is looking a bit tired and drab in places and not all the staff are friendly and happy. One particular member of staff in the bar was pretty miserable. The Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud was good and worth a visit. We had dinner there on the Friday. The dining room is a bit dated, but the food was really good and some of the waiters were charming, particularly the chap who looked like a young John Travolta.. Some of the waiters were not so good, especially the young man with bad body odour. Patrick himself came and spoke to all the diners which was a lovely touch and he can be proud of the tasty dishes sent out by the kitchen that night (22 May 2015) The Housekeeping Staff are excellent, the rooms are clean and neat and the turn down service was excellent. Will be back one day we hope.",4,2015,05,26
200,"Amazing Service, Great Location, Old World Irish Charm","Just returned from staying at the Merrion and the service is beyond amazing. The location is wonderful and easily accessible to all the major sites in Dublin etc. Great peaceful placed with amazing interior garden, balconies, wonderful food, exceptional wine(tried the selection from the owner's vineyard and spectacular).  The Merrion provides a unique experience with incredible service.",5,2015,05,26
200,No. 1 in Dublin for a reason!,"The hotel clearly values and nurtures (and probably hires for) great service.  From the moment we arrived after a tiring overnight flight, we were warmly greeted and treated like returning family, even thought this was our first time.  A lovely upgraded room and a welcoming remembrance for our anniversary added to our enjoyment of our stay, but it was the staff who made the visit so remarkable.  Special kudos to Fiona at the front desk, bellmen Stefan, Patrick, Tom, food servers Marko and Maria, and another bellman whose name unfortunately escapes me who assisted with departure travel plans.  We have stayed in some awfully nice places, but the service here was second-to-none!  In addition, the grounds are beautiful, and the location is perfect.  Couldn't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin.  Expensive, but worth it.",5,2015,05,24
200,"Average room, but excellent service made the difference","Waffling between 3 and 4 stars, but decided that the staff deserved the extra star. Our ground floor room faced out to the alley, and the bathroom was outfitted for seniors or persons with disability. The rails and pull-down support reminded me of nursing homes, and the generally bland décor reinforced the impression as well. But if the room was kind of blah, the rest of the hotel was much more interesting. All the artwork are originals, and the garden with the statue and snippets of stories (James Joyce?) an engaging installation. The wifi connection was a bit goofy, and needed to be reconnected every time the device was closed or idle. The staff were numerous and ever vigilant. Breakfast was good, but repetitive after a few days. There are comfy couches in rooms with real fireplaces to relax, chat and have a bite to eat. The location was quite central as well, close to Grafton Street and many attractions, restaurants and bars. The Cellar had excellent food, both in the restaurant and at the bar. The fish&chips with mushy peas (not as mushy as imagined) served at the bar was huge, tasty and not greasy at all. Wish we had the time to try the other restaurant beside the hotel. Maybe next time.",4,2015,05,23
200,The Merrion Dublin,"Absolutely the finest hotel we have ever stayed in.  The hotel was beautiful, comfortable centrally located to many of the most popular and know sites in Dublin.  The staff was fabulous.  Professional, helpful, friendly and attentive to the guests every need.  Clearly are proud and enjoy working at the Merrion.  The guest rooms,  grounds, tea rooms, bar and restaurant provide many temptations to not ever leave the hotel. Beautiful !!!",5,2015,05,23
200,Sublime,"There is a huge focus in The Merrion on attentive and discrete Customer service. Everything from the booking to check in and the ungodly hour of the check out was flawless. Room 333 was perfectly appointed and despite the view of a busy construction site from the window, I had a great nights sleep. Amenities were good and the room was spotless. Minisucle areas of improvement include moving the ice making machine from outside the door of the room and improving the quality of the TV reception and screens. The staff are brilliant and polished in their performance being knowledgable, polite and proactive. I'll be back and thats for sure.",5,2015,05,22
200,Quality of values from yesteryear,"A quality hotel with a passion for service and classic style throughout. A silver service breakfast was expensive but felt luxurious. The rooms were excellent - proper 4-5 star. A massive and comfortable bed with beautiful bathroom. The restaurant attached is the best in Ireland. I got a great deal on the weekend but it is expensive - but it is luxury of the traditional variety. The afternoon teas in the drawing room looked great, though i did not sample.",4,2015,05,21
200,"Central location, courteous staff","My family & I stayed here last December for a few days leading up to New Year's Eve. It is a beautiful hotel with elegant décor and is very central; within walking distance of some of Dublin's main streets. The staff were courteous and attentive, in particular the concierges and the staff on the front desk.

Unfortunately the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant was closed during the week we were there so we ate at the hotel's Cellar Bar. We enjoyed a New Year's Eve meal here with nice wine and dinner including a seafood platter. It was overpriced and they was sand in the razor clams which was off-putting. However, my family completed a survey after the visit and the hotel was quick to reply and apologise for the incident.

Breakfast on the other hand was lovely and is served in the Cellar Restaurant. There is a buffet as well as having the option of cooked food from the menu such as a fry-up or pancakes. The staff are flexible and willing to cook according to your preferences.

A nice enough stay but very expensive so be prepared.",3,2015,05,21
200,Unparalleled Service,"We stayed the first two nights of our holiday to Ireland at the Merrion.   I wanted a place to relax and recharge before renting a car and seeing the rest of the Emerald Isle.   The Merrion Hotel fit the bill perfectly.   One would expect great service from a hotel at this price point, but they far exceeded my expectations.  After arriving in Dublin at 5 am after a flight from the US, my wife was not feeling well.  I knew that our reservation did not allow us to check in until late afternoon, but we were greeted by a friendly doorman who took us immediately to reception.   Although no room was available at 7:30, the reception staff said they would get a room for us as soon as one was available.  Most hotels would then state that there would be an extra day charge, or simply state check in is 3 pm and suggest a 6 hour walk in the City.  We waited approximately one hour, and while wondering the hotel grounds, the receptionist came and found me and escorted us to our room.    

Many hotels have polite, professional staff but you sense it is just training and part of the job.   The feeling I got at the Merrion was of arriving at a distance relative's home, and genuinely made to feel that you were part of the family.

The hotel website is accurate.   The location is in the heart of Dublin.   Just a couple of blocks away are Merrion Square and St. Stephens Green, both great urban oases.  Check out the cellar bar below street level.   The hotel surprisingly has a wonderful pool and spa located in the lower level.

The only issue of note is that we stayed in room 112, which was warm even with the thermostat off and the window open (on a 0 degree night).   There also was a mechanical hum so perhaps this room sits over their heating system.   

I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin.",5,2015,05,21
200,Another Great Stay,"Yet another outstanding stay at the Merrion. Expensive but the experience is worth it. My wife's favourite hotel. The staff are excellent making a good hotel great. Rooms are well prepared and all the staff from doorman to reception are welcoming and seemed to have ""kissed the Blarney Stone""",5,2015,05,20
200,Simply the best hotel in Dublin,Beautiful location; tastefully and stylishly decorated; wonderful collection of Irish art; amazing afternoon tea; great swimming pool; excellent restaurant and bar; fabulous staff; expertly run. What's not to love?,5,2015,05,20
200,A Welcome Hideaway,"From the moment you arrive at their doorstep, The Merrion Hotel wows like no other. Attention to detail and great service with a smile. My room, a Superior King in the Garden Wing, was a simple but elegant spacious ""Kodak Moment"" in my first two days in Dublin. The neighborhood is full of eclectic dining options, but a visit to the Merrion's ""cellar Bar"" is well worth the stop. Good food and friendly staff, combined with an underground cellar atmosphere. I wish I could stay longer, just to try out the spa services and pool. .",5,2015,05,19
200,7 out of 5!,"Its well known that the Merrion Hotel is fabulous, but after staying there last November, I can confirm that its 7 stars out of 5!

Located in the centre of the city, it has everything an upmarket hotel offers and the spa is one of the best I have ever been in.",5,2015,05,19
200,Understated elegant service in sumptuous rooms,This is the hotel to stay at in Dublin. I've stayed at most of the five star hotels in Ireland but this is the most elegant and authentic in my view. The Patrick Guilbaud restaurant is the best in the country and the only with 2 Michelin stars but the cellar restaurant is also a great choice for a power lunch rubbing shoulders with the MPs based over the road. On a sunny day the specially blended teas served in beautiful silver service in the garden is a joy.,5,2015,05,19
200,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel, staff and location.  Beautiful rooms and perfect place for mid afternoon tea.  (Don't forget to make reservations ahead of time because they fill up quickly).  Since this was an anniversary trip they upgraded our room and they had beautifully decorated mini sweets on a tray for us with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it.  In all a wonderful experience.",5,2015,05,19
200,Understated Elegance,"We were at the Merrion for 5 nights in May.  Wonderful small hotel with great, friendly service. Stayed in the garden wing. Our room was very comfortable, with lovely updated bathroom (although room tended to get a little warm at night).  Hard to imagine a better hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,05,18
200,Incredible ending to our Irish Holiday,The Merrion Hotel lives up to it's 5 star reputation but the service takes it to 6 stars.  The hotel is unstated elegance at its finest and the hotel staff is quietly there for your every need.  We were traveling with a party of eleven and shared four rooms this past weekend.  We were all treated to an extremely luxurious and fabulous stay.  The rooms are beautiful with the most crisp and comfortable bedding and the bathroom is spectacular.  We spent time in the cellar bar and again the service was exemplary and the food and drink was great.  The breakfast that was included in our stay was over the top and delicious.  Cannot recommend this hotel enough.,5,2015,05,18
200,"Understated elegance, lives up to its reputation","A friend of ours highly recommended the Merrion to us, as a place to start our 2 week holiday in Ireland.  My husband and I spent 3 nights there upon arrival in Ireland.  Excellent choice!  I love the fact that the hotel facade looks like a row of elegant townhouses, not an in-your-face entrance flanked with flags and taxis.  We were warmly welcomed, and found that the staff were very professional, unobtrusive, but incredibly attentive.  Our room was small, but cozy and well appointed.  There was everything we needed in the room, including wine glasses (even champagne glasses!). An great hotel, and a great start to our holiday.",5,2015,05,18
200,Understated excellence,"From the moment we arrived at the entrance to The Merrion hotel in Dublin, we felt comfortable. No huge flashy entrance way, just a uniformed door man who gave a friendly welcome and helped us inside. The reception was efficient, professional, and very helpful. The hotel is a beautiful old building, well restored in some sections. Our room was wonderful though small, airy, and comfortable. We felt very fortunate to spend 3 days with them while we explored Dublin and met our friends. The service there was outstanding.
It is centrally located, just a short walk to Grafton street, Trinity college, and too close to shopping, from the credit card view but my wife loved that part too..",5,2015,05,18
200,Excellent location and service,Stayed recently for vacation. Was upgraded at arrival to a large suite (part of our booking plan). The facilities were immaculate and service was fantastic. Wonderful location for seeing the city and jumping on the city tour buses. The hotel has a nice art collection and art tea is a great way to spend the afternoon.,5,2015,05,16
200,Beautiful facility and very good food.,"Recommended by our British travel Agent.  As usual, it did not disappoint.  A couple of things keep it from a level five rating.  The rooms were guaranteed ""superior with a garden view.  We were put in rooms with an up-close and personal view of major construction.  After a discussion we were moved to a higher floor with the same view. There were indeed garden view rooms available, just not for us.  People were nice and beyond this one issue I found the hotel comfortable, well-appointed and well-run.  When I return to Dublin, I will stay here.",4,2015,05,14
200,Gorgeous city hotel,This is an outstanding hotel in the old Georgian area of the city. It has a lovely interior garden plus one of the best art collections in all of Ireland . Rooms are beautiful. The Cellar bar and restaurant are great choices . The hotel is well situated in a great area to enjoy some historical places right out the front door. It has a very gracious feel to it and the service is excellent. For discerning people who want and appreciate a 5 star experience you will love this hotel.,5,2015,05,14
200,Amazing hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday and it was amazing. The hotel itself was beautiful and the customer service was spot on. So lovely, all the little details were thought of, and everything was perfect!",5,2015,05,14
200,Where I want to stay...,"This is it really. Staying in a city can be pricy and it is in this case but worth it. The spa, the restaurant, the rooms are luxurious and allow you to shed the outside world so you are ready to explore it again. We stayed twice in one week at the beginning and at the end of our drive through Ireland. The hotel also organised the rental car for us. The car was delivered to us at the hotel and we just left it there for the rental company to pick it up. Breakfast was not so much to our taste since we just prefer a smaller breakfast and an espresso. It's not included so the hotel eaves you the choice. Plus we saw and heard people rave about it. So that's a affaire de goût. There are a couple of nice restaurants just around the corner as well and the city center is a five min walk. Nice walk along the park as well. All in all if I ever go back this is where I stay!",5,2015,05,13
200,THE Best Place to Stay in Comfort and History,"On our first trip to Ireland and for our first night in Dublin, we couldn’t have picked a more perfect hotel. From the bellmen to the front desk staff to every room amenity, it was apparent that exemplary service was the No. 1 priority. The hotel itself is centrally located to most everything in Dublin but we found our room, which opened onto the garden, to be quiet and private when we needed to sleep. It was such a pleasure to have complimentary water, fruit and chocolates provided in the room. A perfect touch after a long night’s flight. The room itself was comfortable in every way – the bed, pillows, warming towel rack, robes – and especially the sitting couch. Being from Charleston, it was nice to stay in a hotel that had been restored/renovated with history in mind. The artwork throughout the hotel was also amazing. The only negatives were found in the bathroom where the shower was a little tight and another regular electrical outlet (besides the special one for shavers) could have been handy near the sink. Other than that, the staff at The Merrion Hotel will ensure that you don’t want for anything else.",5,2015,05,12
200,Had the wedding of my dreams at The Merrion,"We had stayed in the Merrion a number of times before we decided to have our wedding there.  When I say this is an outstanding hotel, it really is outstanding. We had the most wonderful wedding and stayed two nights there in April 2015.  To say the hotel staff could not do enough for us would be an understatement.  They went out of their way to make our guests welcome, to attend to our every need on the day of the wedding and delivered a true five star service at every possible moment. From Jana the Events Manager to Frankie who looked after us on the day, to all the guys who served us during our dinner as well as the breakfast staff and room service staff, we felt truly spoiled.  

A massive thank you from us, we cannot wait to return and to anyone considering this hotel during their stay in Dublin, book it!!!  You will not be disappointed!  None of the other five star hotels in Ireland could even compare with The Merrion and we have stayed in quite a few.",5,2015,05,11
200,Bradley/Sharkey/Gleason trip,"Everyone was so helpful and the hotel is just beautiful!
I'd like to be like Eloise in the Plaza in much, and live at the Merrion!
Our room was very comfortable, the common rooms were lovely and inviting, the art was wonderful and most of all, the staff was the best. Even the rain didn't dampen our spirits.",5,2015,05,11
200,Superb Experience,"I stayed twice at this property on a recent vacation with my mother.  This hotel is amazing.  Understated in elegance from the street - you wouldn't even know it is a hotel.  Inside, pure sophistication and class.  I stayed in a suite on both occasions thanks to an Amex Platinum Upgrade.   There are few hotels in the world I've stayed at that exude this level of charm and quality.  Old world elegance at its finest.  The staff were amazing - all sincere and helpful at every interaction.  There is a renovation right now, but it did not detract in the slightest.  The renovation will vastly improve the restaurant, which is currently located in the basement.",5,2015,05,09
200,Outstanding in EVERY way,"The service and staff in this hotel is the best I've every seen.  Friendly, fast helpful.  Room is clean, fresh etc.  Outstanding experience.  Food is very good and the hotel is very accommodating.  They even shine shoes and unpack if you need that service.",5,2015,05,09
200,Great weekend stay at the Merrion!,"We stayed two nights in a garden room. The staff couldn't have been more welcoming, the hotel is in a great location, very close to the Coca cola bikes that we used to cycle around phoenix park. The pool and associated facilities were a great addition. The room was spacious, clean and had an exceptionally comfortable mattress. We couldn't fault the hotel or staff on anything and would happily return on another occasion.  An extra recommendation is to visit The Pig's Ear just around the corner",5,2015,05,09
200,Continued Excellence,"Currently Undergoing Construction, but still a Great Experience. They are renovating the dining facilities, but it was not a major issue.  Also  Try the small Pub located along the back alley.   The atmosphere and chat with the locals was something you will not experience in an upscale environment.",5,2015,05,07
200,Merrion - a class above,"This was my first time at The Merrion; a fortuitous event only caused by the vagaries of my company's online hotel recommendation system. I didn't even check the hotel website when booking.  As soon as I arrived, the hotel felt special from the attentiveness of the staff to the luxurious ambience of the period rooms. The bedrooms were exceptional and the service throughout my stay was genuinely of five star standard.  I'd recommend The Merrion without hesitation.",5,2015,05,07
200,Still as good as it gets !,This is my second review of The Merrion Hotel and was a little nervous that it was not going to be as good on my return . Well let me tell you there was no need for any concerns of a drop in standards . From the minute we walked in the door till our departure the staff could not have done more . They are a credit to the hotel . Hotel ticks all the boxes twice . Can not wait for our next trip to Dublin and of course The Merrion .,5,2015,05,05
200,The best of the best in Dublin city,"From arrival to departure, The Merion Hotel offers high quality & superb surroundings, amazing attentiveness and luxury at its finest for Dublin.  Upon reception, Cassandra personally and warmly greeted us, as tired as we were from our overnight 7 hr. flight and showed us directly to the Tetra spa so we could relax prior to standard check-in time. The Spa services were very accommodating and actually quite relaxing after a long flight. Our room didn't offer a great view, but was very comfortable nonetheless.  We really enjoyed their high-tea associated with connecting Irish art, which was a one-time special treat for my daughter, who as an artist herself really appreciated the experience.  Is unfortunate the Cellar pub and restaurant closes so early by American standards (by 10 pm on a Friday night), so we didn't get a chance to partake of their Michelin rating, which we wish we could have enjoyed. The doormen always greeted us warmly and quickly arranged for taxis as needed, especially when we needed to quickly leave to catch a flight the very next morning to Scotland.  Their lovely reception desk staff never failed to provide excellent service and was very attentive and gave us good advice for planning our timely departure without hindrance. Having stayed at other high rated Ireland hotels, I would venture to advise others who truly value receiving 5 star service and who want to sample Dublin at its best, to stay at The Merion where you'll not be disappointed.",5,2015,05,05
200,Great Hotel - Terrible view,"One of the nicest hotels I've ever experienced.  Room was great and other than a terrible ""city view""(looked down onto dumpsters), it was large and luxurious - we had requested room with garden view. Service was exceptional.  Bathroom fabulous and lots of storage/closet space.  Wish every city had a similar hotel, but not possible.",5,2015,05,04
200,The Merrion Dublin,"Elegant hotel with excellent service levels. The atmosphere is extremely calming, you start to relax the minute you cross the threshold. Service is polite, quick and efficient, no request to small. We have stayed in many Dublin hotels but would only consider staying at the Merrion now.",5,2015,05,04
200,Amazing Building,"I could not fault a single thing from this wonderful hotel, rooms are spacious, light, clean and comfortable.
Food service is really nice.
Also use the spa area, nice swimming pool.
Close to Night life area but you can't hear a single thing from the rooms.
Staff were really friendly and courteous",5,2015,05,02
200,A perfect five star end to a perfect trip,"By the time we got to Dublin at the end of our two week trip to Ireland we were ready for the five star treated The Merrion was supposed to provide. It did not disappoint. Our room was a little small but still very comfortable. The public places were so inviting especially the living room off of  number 23, the bar. The spa needs some work but that has already been addressed with a major remodel in the works. The pool was awesome. The food delicious. Location very central",5,2015,05,02
200,fantastic!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this fantastic hotel. All staff were extremely friendly and yet very professional. Food was superb. Nothing was too much trouble. location was perfect. We also very much appreciated the amazing upgrade. Definitely will be returning to this wonderful hotel. thean

200,Beautiful Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the Merrion.  The rooms are large and nicely furnished, modern bathrooms, lovely staff, gorgeous garden, and terrific location.  The best part of the hotel was the ""pub"" restaurant in the basement.  We had great waiters, good food, and the atmosphere is fabulous.  Highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin",5,2015,04,30
200,Merrion Hotel Dublin,Merrion Hotel Dublin  as usual very enjoyable stay excellent food and service in  very comfortable relaxing environment close to the hub of Dublin. Interesting Art Collection  Looking forward to my next trip!,5,2015,04,30
200,Simply the best in Dublin,"I am even now enjoying the understated elegance of this hotel.  The staff is by far the most gracious I've ever encountered.  There seem to be more of them than guests and each one more efficient and cheerful than the next.  The art work, charm, central location, and
comfortable rooms are hard to beat anywhere.  Cheers to the Merrion.  I travel to Dublin
and around europe often, and I can't wait to return to the Merrion.  Truly an outstanding
bargain for the price, and nothing compares to the impeccable service.",5,2015,04,29
200,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here last summer and it was lovely, the room was copy, the staff pleasant and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and the location was great, walking distance to everything.",4,2015,04,28
200,Great city centre hotel,"We recently spent four nights at The Merrion on the recommendation of a colleague and were so pleased with the choice. We loved the understated Georgian street frontage of the property, the beautiful artwork within and the airy courtyard garden.

We found our queen room in the garden wing very well appointed and beautifully serviced. We had initially been a bit concerned that we could not upgrade to a larger room prior to our arrival as the hotel was full, but when we saw the room we were happy with our original booking.

As we arrived from New York very early in the morning our room was not available so after breakfast we checked into the spa where they made us very welcome and after a bit of a snooze, a refreshing swim and a massage one of the friendly receptionists called in to take us to our room. Great service- in fact the service throughout our stay was impeccable. All the staff were friendly and attentive.

We also really liked the Cellar Bar which we found very warm and welcoming- a great spot for a nightcap or two! A refreshing change from the often impersonal standard hotel offerings.

We have family in Dublin and The Merrion will definitely be our top pick from now one. 

Great location, beautiful surroundings and fantastic attention to detail. Oh yes and a Michelin duo- starred restaurant! Review on that treat to follow!",5,2015,04,28
200,Understated Elegance,"I honestly can't think of a single tiny detail to complain about regarding the Merrion Hotel.  From the moment we crossed the threshold we felt a sincere welcome. The staff anticipated our every need and the rooms were beautiful.  We had booked the least expensive garden wing option and were upgraded to a superior garden room on arrival which was lovely, looking out onto a beautiful courtyard.  We left Dublin for the week and returned for an additional night where we were upgraded to the main house, which was amazing.  The location was an easy walk from all sights.  I can't imagine a nicer place to stay while in Dublin.",5,2015,04,28
200,A little gem,"From the moment I walked through the door until I departed the following morning I was cosseted in luxury. Professional, courteous, attentive and friendly without out over familiarity is how I would describe the staff, they are well schooled in customer service. The room was as you would expect from a good 5 star and the location was perfect. A little gem in the heart of dublin I will be back. ",5,2015,04,28
200,wonderful hotel,Wonderful hotel for our family with young adults (not suitable for young children) as we were able to have 2 connecting rooms.  Quiet and lovely. The hotel is nicely located for walking to many parts of the city.,5,2015,04,28
200,"Fantastic city centre hotel, excellent staff. ","I stayed here with my wife for a family wedding. We bought noticed a very high standard of service, the attention to detail was impressive. Breakfast was was excellent, location ideal for the city center, rooms luxurious and nice swimming pool too. ",5,2015,04,27
200,Cellar Bar is fantastic!,"I live in Dublin and frequently pop into the Cellar Bar for a casual bite to eat or a glass of wine with my girlfriend. Food is always top notch, fish and chips are a favourite. The staff are always friendly and attentive, and atmosphere is laid back - love to sit on the high stools at the bar and share a bottle of wine over dinner. I highly recommend!",5,2015,04,27
200,Elegant Hotel with Gracious Service,"We had the good fortune of staying at The Merrion for 5 nights and would recommend that anyone who enjoys a convenient location, impeccable service and beautiful and unique surroundings do the same.  

We loved everything about this hotel.  Excellence is often the result of great attention to detail and anticipating the needs and wants of guests.  We found that The Merrion accomplished this with aplomb. When we arrived on Easter Sunday we found a card welcoming us as well as a very sweet plate of Easter treats in our rooms.  Everyday we had bottled water left for us after housekeeping visited and then again at turndown.  When passing the staff in the hall we were always warmly acknowledged and on the day before our check out the housekeeping staff left a clear plastic bag so we could easily pack our liquids for our flight home.  Just a few things that were simple and greatly appreciated. 

If our travels ever take us back to Dublin I will most certainly stay at The Merrion.",5,2015,04,25
200,Almost perfect,"Clean room, comfortable bed, well appointed bathroom, great food, lovely friendly staff.  Just one problem:  the television was incredibly annoying as it shut down or froze multiple times while I was watching.  How hard could it be to get a proper working television in a hotel room? That's just a basic ""must have"".  It totally ruined my stay.  

",3,2015,04,25
200,Fantastic !,"Great hotel for a stay in Dublin.  It is in the perfect location for walking to the important sites and parks, the service was perfect, and our room was spectacular.  We booked the Town and Country package which included 3 nights at the Merrion including massages, a tour of the hotel's art collection, afternoon tea, private chauffeured airport pickup, welcome champagne, and a picnic lunch for the included chauffeured transfer to Ashford Castle for the second half of the Town and Country package.  Everything was just as we had hoped.  Highly recommend this hotel.   The breakfast was very good and the bar and restaurant in the cellar was excellent.  The package included a Deluxe room, but they upgraded us to a two room suite with fireplace (not a working one) and huge bathroom.  The art collection tour was fabulous !!!  Who knew a hotel would have such an amazing and large collection of important art.  Would definitely stay here again !",5,2015,04,25
200,Special treat,"Loved every minute, intend to go back. From the valet parking to the helpfulness and friendliness (so well trained) of the staff. The afternoon tea looked delicious, but we didn't partake, as we were booked for an early bird elsewhere. Breakfast was excellent. We were unprepared for the amount of staff attending us so hadn't enough tips ready. We wanted to rectify this on checkout and were told we could contribute to their social club (a lovely idea).",5,2015,04,25
200,A memorable experience of elegance and style,"We stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights over the weekend in a Garden Wing room. The room was spacious, nicely decorated and a great place to relax after long walks through Dublin. As the Merrion is centrally located all attractions are an easy walk or short ride away. The front-desk staff and housekeeping were highly attentive and very friendly. Breakfast was delicious and offered plenty of options.

The hotel has character and we particularly enjoyed with how much attention to detail is has been restored. Across the hotel, paintings and sculptures are displayed and the afternoon tea refers to the paintings in a very special way. We highly recommend to try the „Art Tea“ in the lounge area but also dinner at the 2-star restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.",5,2015,04,25
200,Friendly staff,"I have stayed at the Merrion hotel 4 times thus far  and the consistent friendly welcome is the reason I return. The rooms are small but perfectly furnished ( be sure to request a room away from the housekeeping staff closet which can get noisy in the morning). While breakfast is expensive (if not included in your rate) the service offered is second to none and the food is delicious. I have always felt incredibly welcome at this hotel and as a solo traveller that is the reason I will always return. To get 5 stars on furnishings and décor is easy, to achieve this from the professionalism of staff is much more difficult, The Merrion has achieved this",5,2015,04,24
200,10/10,"Everything was excellent! We stayed at the Merrion a few years back and didn't like it but this time, I have to say it was amazing. So much so we rebooked for a second evening. Our room on both nights was beautiful, the staff were superb and our meals (dinner and breakfast) were excellent. We use to constantly stay at the Shelbourne when in Dublin but not anymore! Well done the Merrion!",5,2015,04,24
200,Luxury in Dublin,"This is a small but elegant hotel with service that rivals any Ritz or Four Seasons Hotel anywhere I've been.  The staff are impeccably trained and the hotel has a lot of charm, especially the Cellar Bar.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",5,2015,04,22
200,Best Hotel In Dublin and Ireland,"We have stayed at the Merrion for many years and always look forward to the warm welcome from the staff, the amazing Cellar Restaurant for breakfast or dinner, night caps at Bar 23, afternoon tea. By far it's on the top of our list as a favorite hotel we've stayed at around the world and is defintely the best in Ireland........Love love love The Merrion!",5,2015,04,22
200,weekend stay,"fab hotel great location, room was out of this world , great service and staff were great, every expectation was filled would recommend this hotel to anyone. look forward to calling again. was offered an upgrade on arrival. breakfast was a lovely experience, fab garden could not fault anything.",5,2015,04,22
200,"Fabulous 4 day stay, birthday treat","We booked The Merrion for my 60th birthday holiday to Dublin.     From check in to departure it was all a delight, including the little birthday cakes in our room on arrival.    Our room (a king in the garden wing) was light, airy, spacious, well equipped and beautifully serviced by housekeeping.    Bathroom was excellent, lot of lovely toiletries, and very clean.

The public areas are enhanced by the art works which are displayed all around, including the delightful James Joyce statue in the garden just outside our window.

The breakfast was delicious, lots of choice and very well cooked, as was the one dinner we had in the Cellar Restaurant in the hotel.    We would have spent more time the hotel as it was such a lovely place, but we were blessed with fab weather so spent a lot of time out and about.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful.

The location is just perfect, easy to walk most places, but there's also a bus stop  down the street for the excellent hop on hop off tour bus.

We would very much like to return, and next time I'm going to make sure we take Afternoon Tea in the Lounge because it looked spectacular!",5,2015,04,21
200,Wonderful stay,A lovely hotel with very accommodating and friendly staff.  Clean room.  The Spa was a let down...just a pool and one steam room and I would expect at least a jacuzzi and a sauna to call it a spa. Treatments were available but we didn't have any so can't comment on that.  Pricey but then you get what you pay for!,5,2015,04,20
200,Wedding at The Merrion,"We had our wedding at The Merrion last Saturday. The staff were so nice lots of guests commented on how polite they were. The food was so  yummy. We had a gorgeous suite which looked  onto Government buildings . The hotel gave us a champagne breakfast the next morning. We then had a complimentary afternoon tea delivered to our room. The room had blackout curtains. Guests who were staying with babies commented that the cribs in their rooms had baby bathrobes, slippers and even Johnsons baby products laid out for the little ones!
My friends have told me this week that they literally floated out of the hotel last weekend  after having a lovely time and that they felt so well looked after. Thank you to the wonderful staff at The Merrion for making my dreams come true!",5,2015,04,19
200,Great weekend experience.,"Very attentive, friendly staff in beautiful surroundings. Breakfast was good and prefectly prepared. Rooms were well stocked with essentials and replenished twice a day during our stay. Afternoon tea was a special experience, especially the second course of art inspired treats. We ate in the cellar restaurant and were very impressed with both the service and the quality of the food. Definitely an experience to be repeated.",5,2015,04,19
200,Pampered in Dublin,"We were treated to a wonderful 4 days in Dublin at the Hotel Merrion. Within a 10-15 minute walk to Grafton St., Trinity College and St. Stephens Sq., the hotel staff couldn't do enough for us during our stay. Even with our early 6 AM arrival the first day, we were treated royally and every accommodation was met. Breakfast was excellent as was the 1 dinner at the hotel. Being central we had our pick of pubs and other restaurants, many good ones right around the corner. Housekeeping was impeccable, including pick up and folding of loose clothing, and turn down service at night.",5,2015,04,16
200,Wonderful Overnight Stay,My husband booked this as a surprise treat for my 40th birthday - he really picked well!  The hotel was fabulous with friendly staff and top notch service.  We were upgraded from a superior king to a suite overlooking the interior gardens. The room was fabulous.  We will be back soon!,5,2015,04,15
200,Out of this world!!!,"stayed here with my husband ,words can not explain my experience... Absolutely amazing staff so friendly, helpful and attentive receptionists on arrival were excellent and over helpful. . Food delicious and whisky menu equally delicious... Bedrooms have all you need so much attention to detail ... Can't wait to head back",5,2015,04,14
200,Afternoon Tea At the Merrion - Class and Style,"Received voucher for afternoon tea at The Merrion Hotel as a gift and had the opportunity to use it last week.   What a treat, amazing staff, so well trained with impeccable manners and presentation.   Special call out to our waiter Ivan who was just fantastic.   Presentation of tea service and theme of the pastries linked to the artwork of the hotel is special and novel.   We were presented with a lovely book on the artwork of the hotel as a memento and even the packaging of our goody bags was 1st class.   What a lovely way to spend an afternoon in Dublin.   Its not only a beautiful hotel, but 1st class in every way.  Looking forward to returning again.",5,2015,04,14
200,Overnight stay,"Stayed here for one night- staff attentive, rooms beautiful with all amenities as standard. Fantastic breakfast the following morning. Door staff especially good natured, even indulging in some light hearted banter with passing celebrities- only in Dublin.",5,2015,04,14
200,Regular Escapes to Dublin,"We love nothing more than packing the car for a regular trip to Dublin and the only place to stay is The Merrion (trips this year, late Feb 15 and early Apr 15).

I discovered this wonderful hotel about 5 years ago and have been hooked ever since.  The staff at The Merrion are the most amazing team I have ever seen, each and every person that I come into contact with, exudes warmth, kindness and professionalism.  Staff are long serving, which says a lot about the hotel.  Well done to The Merrion staff.

All the rooms are fabulous and have been recently updated.  We have been lucky to stay in a variety of rooms both in the Garden Wing and Main House (experience in Georgian living).  The beds are so comfortable, just heavenly.

The buffet breakfast is not to be missed and is my favourite place to have breakfast. From my experience of other 5 star hotels, the Merrion serves the best breakfast in Europe.

The Tetra Spa is just perfect for chilling out, swimming (very slowly), steam room and then relaxing with a herbal tea and a book.

The Merrion is a very special hotel, with brilliant staff, who reduce stress levels and create wonderful memories for myself and my husband – priceless.",5,2015,04,14
200,Wonderful Post Wedding City Break in a Top Class Hotel,"My new wife and I enjoyed a fantastic 4 nights in the Merrion following our wedding in Ireland.
We had never been before both advice from friends persuaded us over slightly cheaper options.
We received a wonderful welcome with congratulatory cupcakes in our room! We were on a B&B package and I must recommend it for value as the breakfast is one of the best in Dublin.
Our room was facing the beautiful garden courtyard and despite nearby construction sites it was sheltered and peaceful.

Bar and dining prices in the hotel can be expensive compared to nearby alternatives but the service throughout the hotel was of the highest standard.",5,2015,04,14
200,A memorable stay in a stunning hotel,We stayed here to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary and had a fabulous time. A big thank you to the hotel for upgrading our room. Our room was spacious and elegant with a wonderfully comfortable bed. Afternoon tea set a very high standard which was matched fully by dinner and breakfast. We can not wait to return!,5,2015,04,12
200,"Fantastic one night stay, a real treat","I stayed at the Merrion on Good Friday for one night with my 7 year old daughter. We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the service and attention to detail were impeccable. Children are treated extremely well and she is still talking about the cookies and milk which were brought to our room shortly after we arrived! Breakfast was also excellent, no hot buffet but a choice of cooked breakfasts which are especially made for you. My daughter also loved her boiled egg and soldiers which again were cooked specifically for her. We used the pool and there was also a small park nearby so all in all, there was plenty to keep a child amused. The hotel location was quiet and there was a stop just outside the hotel for the Dublin hop on hop off buses which meant we could jump on the Dublin tour really easily. We had a lovely room overlooking the garden. All in all, I can't imagine staying anywhere other than the Merrion  next time I'm in Dublin. Highly recommended!",5,2015,04,12
200,Impeccable service,Beautiful room with three huge windows overlooking the Irish parliament building. Great service. Just happens to be next door to the only 2 Michelin star restaurant in all of ireland. Really a perfect location. We walked to everything.  Book ofKells ,5,2015,04,12
200,Truly a Five Star,"Truly a five star hotel.  Everything at the Merrion was outstanding and made our trip a delight. With the wonderful restaurants, art and spa you don't even have to leave the hotel.  Its location makes walking to museums, etc easy.",5,2015,04,09
200,"Delightful hotel, outstanding service, great location","We arrived from the airport and a red eye flight out ofWashington, DC just before noon. The Merrion staff worked to get us in a perfectly appointed, comfortable and very clean room.  Afternoon tea was served while we waited. It was the the perfect lunch after a long flight. I would highly recommend the Merion to any traveler.  It is in the five star category. The friendliness of the staff and the quality of the hotel itself put it there. We only struggled a little with cooling the room.",5,2015,04,09
200,Business Trip,outstanding service and great room - beautiful decor and lovely bed linen - they clearly are very proud of their attention to detail. The bathroom was lovely - would have preferred a walk-in shower but that really is not a criticism.,5,2015,04,09
200,Relaxing break in Dublin's Fair City,Stayed here over Easter and it was wonderful. The staff were lovely and friendly. We got upgraded to a King Suite overlooking the gardens. The pool and spa are gorgeous and relaxing. We were greeted with cute (and delicious) Easter treats in our room.,5,2015,04,09
200,Art Tea - delicious!,"Visited on my birthday during a trip to Dublin and had their Art Tea. Service was fantastic! The tea itself was really tasty. It's served in two courses, the first is the traditional afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and cakes. It was all delicious with a good selection but save room for the main event! The second course is the Art bit, with three delicious pastries based on works of art owned by the hotel. It was around 70euros for two people, which is cheaper than similar afternoon tea I've had in London. The setting, service and food were all 5 star. Thanks, Merrion! Highly recommended.",5,2015,04,07
200,"Exquisite hotel, amazing art","I recently spent a week here with my two daughters (ages 10 & 13).  What a WONDERFUL hotel.  It's a lot like The Milestone Hotel in London (which I also love), but bigger.  I was in a suite (thanks to AMEX upgrade) in the older, main part of the hotel.  It was gorgeous--my girls and I felt like princesses.  It was also very, very comfortable:  Lovely textiles, comfy sofas & chairs, big beautiful marble bathroom.  We actually spent more time in the room than we usually do when we travel, because it was just so warm & inviting.  There was a bookcase with brand new books on Ireland, so I ended up reading Dublin by Edward Rutherford.  They also had a decanter with very special whiskey that you could help yourself to if you wanted.  Loved the fresh flowers they put in the room and also the way the cleaning staff would arrange the belongings we left on the tables--they always made them look like a tablescape from a magazine.  The public areas of the hotel are wonderful too.  We usually skipped the big buffet in the Breakfast Room and just had tea & toast by the fire in the main public area.  It was so cozy!  Before dinner I enjoyed having a drink and reading by the fire in the patron's bar area.  The staff was incredible and made my girls and me feel welcome and comfortable wherever we went.  My only regret about my stay was that I did not take advantage of the tour of the hotel's art collection that is offered.  Apparently they arrange for someone from the National Gallery (down the street) to lead it.  And the art at this hotel is mind-boggling.  I mean, they have two incredible Jack Yeats' as you walk in the door!!  My jaw kept dropping as I walked around the place.  It was like living in a museum.  This hotel is very close to the National Archeology Museum (amazing), the Natural History Museum (quaint & weird), and the National Gallery (great but currently under renovation).  If you just want to shop and enjoy nightlife, you might want to stay closer to the Liffey.  For us, however, this hotel was perfect.  I will definitely return.",5,2015,04,07
200,beautiful surroundings with great staff,"The staff appeared to go out of their way to be helpful. From the daily greetings to assisting us with arranging a rental car (and subsequent return) they anticipated our needs and questions and made sure we had what we needed. With a warm décor, the room was comfortable and spacious. The location was perfect for walking to shopping, pubs and restaurants, and sight seeing. Prices for food were a bit on the high side, but the quality was excellent. We would stay in this hotel again.",5,2015,04,07
200,5 Star Service & Attention to detail!,"From the moment we got out of the Taxi,the service begun,the concierge were on hand with a smile to take our luggage,the check in was great,the receptionists were very informative.
We then went to our rooms which were on the Garden Wing with an inter connecting room for our girls,the rooms were immaculate,even a bottle of champagne (complimentary)awaiting us.
The spa facilities were wonderful with added extras in the dressing areas that I haven't encountered in other 5 star hotels,breakfast choice very good & the food fantastic quality.
On Easter Sunday an Easter hunt for the children no expense spared with good quality chocolate,overall an amazing stay & will be back,",5,2015,04,07
200,Regular visits over seven years,"We are planning our next trip to Dublin in the near future and for some reason with a little time on my hands I decided to read some of the wonderful comments that Merrion clients have left on Trip Advisor.

I then looked at those in the “terrible” reviews section. Frankly I am astounded  at what these people had to say.

Having stayed at the Merrion Hotel at least once every year during the last seven years I can only recognise one of the comments. This was the gradual change of the nationality of the staff from Irish to International.  They are still extra courteous and friendly but  I can only speak for myself when I say that when I visit Ireland I love to speak to Irish people – however whenever I visit Dublin I would always stay at the Merrion because it is a near perfect as you will find. 

The staff are absolutely brilliant and the rooms are beautiful.

John and Chris Hyde",5,2015,04,06
200,Treat Yourself!,"We were traveling through Ireland and finished our stay in Dublin at the Merrion.  From the moment we were greeted at the front door by a hotel staff member who was wearing a top hat and cape, we knew we were into something good!
Friendly, professional service.  Everyone attended to every detail of comfort and convenience.  
The room was exquisite.  Top quality and comfort.
The breakfast restaurant and other food services (tea area, etc.) were first class.  And the adjoining Michelin rated ""Patrick Guilbaud"" is nothing short of amazing.
Great location, too.
I want to emphasize that you will feel so comfortable dealing with every staff person.  We felt like friends!  They seemed so interested and were supportive and patient with regard to questions and recommendations.
It is not an inexpensive hotel, but it is worth the price....a good value.  A luxury hotel in every respect.
An outstanding hotel experience.  HIGHLY recommended.",5,2015,04,06
200,Dublin Stay,"We stayed at the Merrion for the first two days and the last day of our seven day Ireland vacation.  This was by far the best customer service experience I've had at any hotel we've stayed at in the US or abroad.  Every staff member was focused on making our stay the best, which it was.",5,2015,04,06
200,Lives up to its reputation,"Had a very nice weekend stay here and the hotel was everything it should be for a relaxing  'home' after exploring the city. 

The rooms are very well maintained with lovely details and furnishing. Bed linen particularly sumptuous. The lounge was a nice place to have tea or pre-evening drinks. The health club was excellent too. 

Service seemed a bit slow at times however and I wasn't that fussed about dinner in The Cellar, where we had a complementary dinner as part of the weekend package: Pudding aside, the food was a bit basic, service haphazard and it lacked a bit of atmosphere too. 

Still - I've based my overall feedback on the hotel itself for the stay - not the restaurant.",5,2015,04,06
200,A really good hotel,"This is a really good hotel. It's in a great location, and is clean, quiet, and luxurious. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable. And while it's ""fancy"" and ""traditional,"" it's not stuffy. The in-hotel dining, which is good (we recommend the Cellar Bat gastropub), ranges from pricey to something more than that, but there are numerous options nearby. Wifi (included) speed was good. Beds very comfortable. As good a hotel as I've ever stayed at.",5,2015,04,05
200,A wonderful hotel,"It is years since we last stayed at the Merrion but it won't be years before we return. It's absolutely great - friendly, refined, luxurious, relaxing - it's got the lot. It's not a large hotel  but it's a wonderful hotel. Indeed,we think it is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in,anywhere.",5,2015,04,05
200,Luxury,"I'm posting this a bit late but I stayed at the Merrion weekend 6th March 2015. This is a great hotel. It had to me the feel of a boutique hotel though it had lots of rooms,staff and facilities it had an intimate feel, can't really explain it. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The receptionist showed us to our room which was a nice touch rather than just being handed our keys and pointed in the direction of the lifts. We were upgraded to a suite so the room was mega luxurious, bath and separate raindrop shower, fab toiletries. The bed was like sinking into a huge well supported crisp clean pillow, it was more comfortable than my bed at home! The room had everything you needed and all things had a air of quality. Decor was relaxing and stylish, quality teas and coffees in the room, big flatscreen TV. Location is great, just beside St Stephen's Green. Breakfast was very Good. Only criticism was the continental choice wasn't extensive. Only one type of cheese no cold meats but great cooked selection and their homemade granola was delish. You can't go wrong with this hotel, it is expensive but you won't feel like you have overpaid as the quality is obvious.",5,2015,04,04
200,Tethra Spa at The Merrion,"Had an enjoyable, relaxing and rejuvenating massage and spa experience at this Dublin gem! Great way to close a busy sales cycle and avoid extreme fatigue ahead of the Easter break. Friendly, but tranquil environment. Good value too.",5,2015,04,03
200,Merrion Hotel,"The Merrion hotel exceeded my expectations by far. Excellent hotel, great location, superior quality and service. Very good value for the price. I will definitely come back during my next trip to Dublin.",5,2015,04,02
200,A wonderful hotel,"We chose this hotel from its web site, what a choice ! Its the best hotel we have ever stayed in, quality of everything, fittings ,rooms , food , cleanliness and most of all the staff helpful friendly smartly dressed, nothing is too much trouble and all done with a genuine good spirit.
A wonderful choice of food in the bars and restaurants, ok all of this outstanding quality comes at a price but unlike many other hotels this one is worth it.",5,2015,04,01
200,Can't wait to return,"I absolutely loved this five star hotel right in the heart of Dublin.  I stayed only for one night with my husband and I have now booked to stay again in May and August.  The Merrion has a really warm and charming feel to it, a five star look but without the pretentious vibe that you sometimes get from hotels on this level.  I think this is down to the staff, who were all so helpful and friendly.  We were actually upgraded to a garden suite which was stunning, so light airy and huge. I loved the decor and wished we were staying another night !!  This upgrade was a fantastic surprise and we only found out when we reached the suite.  We had breakfast brought to our room the next morning which was delicious.  I didn't get a chance to try out the spa but I had a quick look and I'm looking forward to booking some treatments on my return.  I also booked a table at Patrick Guilbaud their two star Michelin restaurant, which I have heard great things about.  Thank you for making our stay so memorable!!!",5,2015,04,01
200,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter treated me to Afternoon Tea today 31/3/2015 (a Mothers day gift) and what an experience,  cakes were  all delicious,  and presentation was exquisite,  we were looked  after by Ivan and he explained  all about the Art in the hotel & the relevance  to the cakes, any cakes we could not eat were given to us in a beautiful ""Merrion Pantry"" bag to take home, I would 100% recommend  Merrion Hotel for Afternoon Tea, very relaxing & truly a delightful  experience.  Nothing was too much bother for all the staff.",5,2015,03,31
200,A lovely Afternoon Tea experience,"I reserved a table for Afternoon Tea for my birthday, and the staff were very attentive to some small requests. We had the nicest table by the window and in front of the fire and the staff were very good at telling us about the experience. 

Regarding the food - the cucumber sandwich was very tasty, but the beef and chicken and pesto were quite bland. There was a little too much batten-burg cake, and it is a bit of a difficult one as a lot of people don't like marzipan. I would go for another option here if I could. The porter cake was also a bit hard and chewy, and not very enjoyable. The scones were lovely, as was the lemon curd. 

The options of teas and coffees was very nice and I really enjoyed the art themed desserts which were quite beautiful but also delicious. 

Such a lovely classy hotel with very tasteful furnishings and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel! 

Also I thought the value was very good, considering other 5 star hotels are charging more for a lot less quality and style.",4,2015,03,31
200,Fab,Absolutely the best hotel i have ever stayed in. Attention to detail was special. Service and politness..everyone so keen to help and go that extra mile. Thank you Caroline for checking is in early and for allowing us to check out late too. My wife was well looked after and my son was so happy. The 3 of us were made to feel really special. Claudia at breakfast was great. Shecwas so attentive and friendly. My son was so looked after by her. I never felt so happy at a hotel. What a fine fine fine establishment. We had room service and goodness me the food was Michelin and the service commendable. The Spa is fabulous and the location of ths hotel is fantastic. Nothing is too much. Great customer service right from my first phone call to make the booking and follow up calls and emails....golly this is too much...10 out of 10. Thank you so much for making our stay so good...even my lovely son had his own slippers and dressing gown...what a beautiful touch. Balloons..newspapers...quality products and dpotlessly clean and warm...i could write a 10000 word essay. WILL RETURN....xxxxx,5,2015,03,30
200,Just the very best,"My wife and I have just spent four fantastic days in the Merrion hotel in Dublin, from the moment we got out the taxi and were greeted by the very smart uniformed doorman, we expected to be looked after but not on the scale we were.
We were upgraded to a suite ( WOW INDEED).
The whole staff were very professional and helpful with places to visit and restaraunts etc.
We shall of course go back there at some time as nothing less will do now we have had the best Dublin has to offer.
Thank you to all the staff for looking after us and especially to Patrick and Bernie. Tony D",5,2015,03,30
200,First Class in Dublin,"There is no doubt that this is one of the finest hotels in Dublin.  The old world charm is palpable and the staff well trained and courteous.  It's understated and not as stuffy as it might be.  There are definitely businessmen in the sitting rooms and lounges dressed in business suits but there are also others who seem to be there, like us, on holiday.  Our room was large and lovely.  We were in the ""garden section"" but had a view of a wall out our window.  This, we were told, was an upgrade?  Perhaps the room was bigger than what we may have otherwise had.  
One afternoon we had tea and pastry in the bar and watched others indulging in ""high tea"" which we would loved had we more time.  
My only complaint was that the breakfast buffet was 29 euro per person and clearly nothing special.  Obviously they are used to serving people where price is no object.  The morning of our departure we had coffee and a scone in one of the sitting rooms for about $30 US.  This seemed exploitive.  They could have at least given us a pot of coffee!  I understand that one pays for ambiance but really!  
Dublin is a noisy and intense City and this hotel is a quiet refuge amidst the chaos.  It's right next to the very lovely Merrion Square.",5,2015,03,29
200,Amazing experience,"My girlfriend (now fiancé :)) and I stayed at The Merrion for 3 nights. There were 3 reasons for the trip: firstly for my 30th Birthday, secondly as the place that I would plan to propose, and lastly because we had never visited Ireland before.

From the off, the Hotel Merrion lived up to its expectations. The staff were absolutely fantastic from start to finish and we were really made to feel like royalty.

Even before our stay I had been in contact with the hotel customer service team, who were very helpful with the arrangements to carry out the proposal (although I was not entirely pleased with the recommended horse and carriage as the man with whom I was in contact over the months to come was not reliable.

Our first impression upon arrival was of the Concierge team who immediately came out to help carry our bags and park the hire car. They also provided us with information regarding the city and places to see.

This initial impression carried on throughout our stay, with the reception team, the restaurant staff, the spa team and generally all people we interacted with being extremely helpful and polite.

Upon arriving in our bedroom there was a dessert with “Happy Birthday” written in chocolate, which was a very nice touch!

Our bedroom had an issue in the first night of the stay as there was a rather annoying noise coming from the heating / air conditioning system, but as soon as it was reported we were immediately moved and upgraded to a different room.

After the proposal we were treated to champagne on several occasions, and a lovely message on our desserts from the Cellar Bar that read “To a lifetime of happiness” (see picture). The staff were also very eager to know how everything had gone and all seemed genuinely delighted that we were now engaged. 

I believe this hotel’s greatest asset is its staff, as I’ve never experienced such customer service anywhere I had previously stayed.

Special thanks to Emma for arranging all of the pre-stay information and coordination. To  Jaume and Magda from reception, to Rachel, Mark and John from the Cellar Bar for their fantastic service and ideas on what to do, to Brian (the manager) for the tour of the hotel as well as congratulations and champagne after the proposal, and last but not least to Patrick the concierge who was also extremely helpful. There are others I am sure we have forgotten but thanks to the whole hotel staff.

A few points for improvement: The internet connection from our rooms (remember – room change after first night) was intermittent. The Spa facilities could do with updating. The changing rooms and shower facilities are dated and the spa lacks a Jacuzzi. 

In summary, thank you to all who made our stay amazing. We will without doubt be coming back! Hopefully in the not too distant future ☺",5,2015,03,29
200,Fabulous Break,An outstanding hotel with excellent service set in the heart of Dublin. Great rooms only negative was the building work going on in the gardens they were not supposed to start work until 10am but on our stay the builders could be heard from 7.30am onwards.,5,2015,03,28
200,Lovely Hotel!,"Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-March and fell in love this hotel. It definitely has a stuffy vibe to it but everything else about the hotel more then made up for that. The street its located on is absolutely perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and clean. The rooms are so spacious, clean and decorated just lovely. My room had a California king size bed that was so comfortable. I absolutely loved the turn down service every night too. If I ever return to Dublin this is the only hotel I will stay in there. Highly recommend The Merrion Hotel",5,2015,03,27
200,Birthday Treat,"Just home having spent one night in the Merrion. We had an absolutely brilliant time from the minute we put our foot through the door until we left. The staff couldn't have been nicer. My only regret is that we didn't have dinner there too.  We had a cocktail in the bar before we went out. Easily one of the best cocktails I've ever had. The room was great too, very comfy bed. Breakfast next morning was lovely and when we went for a swim we had the pool to ourselves. I can't wait to go back and am thinking of making it my annual birthday treat!!",5,2015,03,27
200,Perfection again at the finest hotel in the world,"This was our third visit to the Merrion and as always it was unfaultable. From the minute you enter the building being greeted in name by the doormen to the minute you check out there is nothing more that any of the staff could have done for us. Reception is faultless. The room we were allocated was beyond our expectations and all the staff are highly efficient and courteous. The main bar serves wonderful cocktails and the breakfast was superb with everything home made. Our bedroom was very spacious, beautifully furnished and contained everything we needed and more. It was certainly more than adequate in size for the 3 of us with a separate bedroom for our daughter.
The pool area is very clean and relaxing and there are drinks and fruit provided at the entrance.
Thank you to all the staff and a special mention to the wonderful Caroline.
We will be back!!",5,2015,03,26
200,Absolutely wonderful!  Stay here when visiting Dublin!!,"My husband, two year-old son, and I stayed at The Merrion for two nights on a recent trip to Dublin and found it to be fantastic--the service, staff, location, special touches in the room, excellent breakfast, indoor pool, really everything--I could go on and on!  Although we were clearly not typical guests of the hotel (young family, kids, etc.), we were never made to feel otherwise, which we really appreciated.  Special thanks to Mhairi, Patrick, Ivan, and Magna--thank you for helping us and making us feel special!  Also, if you get a chance, definitely get reservations and go eat at the restaurant next door, Patrick Guilbaud--it's excellent as well!!",5,2015,03,26
200,"Great Service, a Little Stuffy","Staff couldn't have been nicer, service was awesome. We stayed there for a week, and every staff member I came in contact with appeared to be genuinely happy to help and go out of their way to serve. Great concierge!  Rooms were beautiful, housekeeping terrific. My only small comment is that this hotel appears to cater to business travelers, ie a tad overstuffed if you get my meaning. If you are a young traveler or have a family with you, you may want to look at another place, maybe the Shelbourne which has a bigger, hipper bar.  Everytime we walked through the sitting rooms it seemed that business meetings were going on. Not tremendously inviting if you just want to hang with a few friends. Lastly, just want to mention that although the Americano coffee in the AM was delicious, at six Euro a cup they should really leave a pot or at least refill you.  ps: amazing original art collection hangs throughout the common areas.",4,2015,03,26
200,"Fantastic property, relaxing stay","The Merrion lives up to all of its 5 stars.  It is in an excellent location in Dublin within walking distance to the main shopping areas, restaurants and nightlife.  We had lunch in The Cellar restaurant which was delicious.  The room was extremely large and very comfortable.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable.  The amenities in the bathroom were lovely and included a separate shampoo and conditioner which is useful if you've hair like mine.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Wonderful stay.",5,2015,03,26
200,Just the best in Dublin,I have stayed in a few Dublin Hotels and this is the best. My wife and I picked the hotel to celebrate our 25TH Wedding anniversary and they could not do any more to make us feel special and comfortable.I feel that anybody selecting this hotel will not be disappointed it is worth every penny!!!,5,2015,03,26
200,Ultimate sublime luxury,"My wife and I spent four days in this hotel. The experience was so fantastic that we want to come back next year for sure. The staff were all very attentive and personal, especially Sean, the head concierge.",5,2015,03,25
200,Up there with the best of the best,"I really really enjoyed staying here. It was only a few days but made our stay in Dublin memorable. Service is 5++ star. They started our stay by upgrading us to a bigger room which was beautifully decorated.  Then the front desk attendant walked us to our room. I had a problem with my computer charger which was tragic due to a deadline. They had every kind of cord, converter, etc and bent over backwards to help me. They arranged an amazing personal tour guide for us to the Cliffs of Moher. and let us take the hotel pillows to sleep with then gave us a boxed breakfast to take with us too! When I thought I left my glasses that day they went looking in my room and called me back. They brought an amazing dessert to our room every day! Really quite amazing. What's the down side? One thing: the
Spa/gym needs upgrading and the access hours need to be longer. I have heard this is happening so good for them. Last shout out to the doorman who was constantly helpful and pleasant even in the cold weather. ",5,2015,03,23
200,EXCELLENT!,"We only stayed one night here but found it excellent at all levels. Service quality, room quality and housekeeping were all first class, as was breakfast. So many hotels these days seem to look for ways of saving money by skimping on the offering but the owners and management here seem to make positive pro-customer choices to enhance the experience and it shows. Would not look past it if you need accomodation in Dublin.",5,2015,03,23
200,BEAUTIFUL BRUNCH!!!,I spent the afternoon in style with a gal pal of mine in the Cellar Bar. All i can say is that it was fabulous start to finish. The staff really offer a five star service and go above and beyond what is expected.  They are so attentive and friendly. The brunch menu is absolutely delicious and if I physically could I would have eaten everything on the menu it all looked amazing ! I had the croque madame which literally melts in your mouth followed by the churos which in a nutshell are divine. Neither myself nor my friend left a morsel of food on the plate it was all so tasty. The ambience of the hotel is amazing and really if you haven't been before you should make it a priority to visit as I know you wont be disappointed! They had music today from a girl group called the Bugle Babes. The three girls sang so softly which is just what you want when you are meeting friends for a catch up! I have to say they are one of the best music groups I have heard in a long time. Beautiful swing music which added to the atmosphere beautifully. They have a great selection of cocktails and 'mocktails' and all types of teas and coffees.  Overall I cant rate The Merrion Hotel highly enough. I love everything about The Merrion and I would recommend a visit to anyone.,5,2015,03,22
200,UNBEATABLE,"This hotel is probably the best I've ever been in Europe. The staff went the extra mile to make us feel like home. 
The afternoon tea is to die for. The rooms are classy and big. The breakfast is lovely. The cellar is worth a visit and the bar prices are excellent. 
My wife and I will be back with our baby anytime soon. 
Special thanks to Hanna in the front desk who was superb during our stay. 

",5,2015,03,20
200,excellent service,"My opinion about the hotel overall is: they have an outsatnding service,the location is good-only 5 mins walk from grafton street, the food at the cellar restaurant is quite good, better fish taht meat, the deserts are delicius, theay have a very good selection of wines, the rooms are cozy and comfortable",5,2015,03,20
200,Understated elegance ,"We had an absolutely incredible time at The Merrion. Could not say any bad things about it. The rooms are wonderful, all employees are kind and helpful, and it is in a wonderful location. The room service staff were especially kind. 5 stars! We can't wait to return. ",5,2015,03,20
200,"Great location, great rooms","Truly a beautiful hotel. Super friendly staff, great location, and the room's are really well-equipped in terms of comfort and size (both in terms of room and bathroom). The lobby was great to have friends come by for a drink or tea.",4,2015,03,20
200,Afternoon tea," We had a drink in the Bar before Afternoon champagne  'Art 'tea .It was delicious. Room was lovely and cosy , Staff were very nice . No complaints at all. We ended up with a 'doggy bag ' because we couldn't finish it all. It was all wrapped up in a lovely bag to take home .",5,2015,03,19
200,Surprise Weekend Away,"This was a surprise weekend which my boyfriend organised for my birthday and it was definitely made that extra bit special by staying here. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The hotel is beautiful itself, the room was clean and had everything we needed. It's quite central to most areas also.

The only downside was the work they was doing to the outside garden at the time of our stay, we kept the curtains shut!",5,2015,03,19
200,what else ?,"this is the most perfect hotel in Dublin. All people who work there is 5 stars !
The room service is perfect the staff is perfect everything is really clean and beautiful !
its the 3th time I go there and , again, it was perfect. just 1 little thing : 
- they really miss a place to smoke because outside its freezing (the weather in ireland in March is really freezing.. )  our room was just perfect the bathroom is perfect and I definitely want the same pillow in my bed ^^ some swiss hotel must have a look a this hotel to take some ideas about how to be with customers with a cheaper price. Everything was just perfect !!!! and close to the main street and shops",5,2015,03,19
200,Great visit,Excellent service. Comfortable room. Will definitely stay again.   Concierge very helpful. Front desk friendly. Late night lounge wait staff were wonderful.   Spa lady not very friendly or accommodating. This was my second stay. Will definitely go back.,4,2015,03,18
200,Old World Elegance,"I have stayed at the Merrion for business and pleasure.  I don't think there is a better hotel in  Dublin.  The staff are marvelous - from the doorman, to the check-in staff and the bartenders!  The afternoon high tea by the fireplace is a must; as is eating in the cellar restaurant.  A truly splendid place!",5,2015,03,18
200,Not impressed,"I thought the Merrion Hotel would be the ideal place to stay for a St Patrick's Day three night visit to Dublin. Sadly I was wrong. There are many things right with this hotel but also a lot that need fixing. 

When my wife and I booked the room we were impressed by the photos of the courtyard. Sadly the view from our room was a brick wall and the bins below. The room was lovely but we thought it needed some updating. For example the TV is not very modern, it's quite a small TV, the remote control was slow, and three of the channels weren't working. I left a note asking for the channels to be fixed, which they were by the maintenance guy, but 24 hours later they were gone again! The bathroom is white marble and felt a little cold and in need of modernising, and the shower water pressure was very very poor. However the bed and bedroom were very comfy. The pillows were amazing! 

A couple of high points...the staff are wonderful. Everybody went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. I can't speak highly enough about the receptionists, bar staff, bellboys etc. Also the location is ideal, very easy to get around. 

A couple of low points...we left a do-not-disturb sign on our door on St Patrick's Day because we wanted to sleep late so we could stay out late that night. However we were woken by a phone call at 130pm by Housekeeping asking us if we wanted the room cleaned. My wife told them we would be up and out by 3pm, but it made us feel like we were being hurried out as it got closer to 3. Also on one of the nights I got a take-away food stain on my robe and my wife got a coffee stain on hers the following morning. We left both robes in the bathtub but only mine was changed by the cleaners. My wife was very upset about this. One other annoyance...we hated having to walk through the high-tea dining area every evening. Naturally we dressed up quite fancy in the afternoons/evenings, but we got a lot of stares from the high-tea diners. This was the only way we were shown to exit the building from the room. It made us feel very uncomfortable.

All in all I would say The Merrion is great for some people, but not for us. We always stay at 5 or 4 star hotels, but next time we're in Dublin we will choose another hotel.",2,2015,03,18
200,Excellent Service and location,"My family and I stayed at The Merrion for 3 nights, including NYE December 2014. We were there to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday. We booked 3 rooms because we were a group of 5 adults.  The rooms were all of a good size, though my husband and I had a Deluxe room which was slightly larger. Service was superb and there are extremely good restaurants for breakfast and dinner nearby. The hotel is in a really nice, quiet location with St Stephens Green just a few minutes walk away. It is also within walking distance of the main shopping area ( Grafton Street and its environs), Trinity College, Temple Bar and the main tourist areas.  We had dinner at the hotel on NYE and we all thought the food and service were excellent. A visit to the Guinness Store is a must, though this may require a taxi ride if you are not that mobile. I strongly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2015,03,18
200,Beyond Wonderful,"First of all let me be clear, this review is of a suite in the main house, and boy, it was amazing.

First of all the sitting room was comfortable, there was a separate area to work, and a separate dining area, so when one wanted to eat, the desk could be left with the laptop\ipod etc out, and there was a separate table to eat at, a lovely comfortable four place table.

Secondly,  the bathroom was luxurious, separate bath and shower. 

Thirdly, the beds are extremely comfortable and supportive, great clean crisp linen

And Lastly but not least, the decor is well my title said it ""Beyond Wonderful"" The room was great to spend time in.",5,2015,03,18
200,Christmas at the Merrion,"My fiancé, my father and I had planned a special trip to Ireland, and this hotel was one we were looking forward to staying at. Let me start by saying we were here for christmas eve and christmas day. One of the highlights was walking into the lobby and having carolers sing on the steps. The hotel itself is very beautiful and traditional. However we were a little disappointed overall for the price we paid and what we had heard of the hotel we were expecting a little more. We were given incorrect information about what time the pool/spa closed it closed so early one night that I was extremely frustrated for the amount of money we were paying and we were told by the front desk the wrong time. The rooms were pretty nice, but for me it was missing that something extra or special that is worth paying for. The staff servicing in the main room was not very friendly which was also a disappointment and very unlike the rest of our trip through Ireland. The room service staff however was very friendly and helpful, and the tea service was delicious. Overall it left something to be desired and was a bit of a disappointment for what we were expecting (especially during Christmas).",4,2015,03,17
200,Elegant and inviting hotel in Dublin in a terrific location.,"The Merrion Hotel is on a lovely street in Dublin, close to St Stephens Park and Merrion Park which are both lovely to walk around. It is also a stone's throw from Oscar Wilde's home which is a terrific landmark, the National Art Gallery, The Natural History Museum,the Archeological Museum (excellent!!) and Fulton Street (excellent shopping.) The hotel has the largest private collection of art in Ireland, and you can enjoy the paintings all over the property. They have wood burning fireplaces in two lounges where afternoon tea is served (the pastries are inspired by different works of art each day which is completely unique and absolutely delicious.) (You need reservations for the High Tea-plan ahead-expensive but LOVELY-arrive hungry.) The hotel room was elegant, had gorgeous linens and duvet/pillows, a beautiful bathroom and looked out onto the courtyard. The most formal restaurant is a very big deal-the only two star Michelin restaurant in all of Ireland-but we did not eat there. We ate one dinner and all breakfasts in a charming, basement level restaurant (arches, soft lighting) called Cellars which was very nice. Continental breakfast, often included with your package, was superb-not to be missed. There is also a basement level pub which is charming, has little cave like alcoves as well as open spaces and bar height tables-very nice casual food and wine/drinks. The bartender at the lounge level bar fixed a drink I had never had before which was out of this world. Basil smash. It is served from a silver teapot into a teacup and he told us told us how to make the drink-you have to try it! 
I highly recommend this hotel. The staff were so lovely and friendly-many from other countries-and did everything to enhance our stay, from the formal doorman to concierge, to front desk to wait staff and housekeeping. I will return if I can.
In addition, the indoor pool in the basement is gorgeous. Be sure to look at photos on the website. I had a massage one afternoon which was lovely and not outrageously priced as they usually are in luxury hotels. If you choose this hotel, you will not be sorry.",5,2015,03,16
200,"I just clicked ""Excellent""","I don't often rate anything as ""Excellent"". This was one of my favorite hotel experiences of all times. The people were so pleasant and service exceptional. The room was spacious and elegant. All for a reasonable rate.",5,2015,03,15
200,Very nice hotel,"Lovely hotel, very helpful staff.  We didn't spend much time in the hotel, so we didn't get to use all of the amenities that it has to offer.  The beds were by far the most comfortable we slept in in our week in Ireland.  We got approx half off the regular rate by using a separate booking website, so our stay was pricey for our standards, but a good value.",5,2015,03,15
200,Great pool,"Stayed the night for a birthday elsewhere in Dublin, the hotel is very nice and service great from the doormen to the reception and pool staff. The pool is huge and nice and warm with a nice steam room to. We had some drinks in the cocktail bar which was nice and loads of people having afternoon teas. Overall great quality and bed was super comfy. Breakfast was pretty expensive for what it was but I was very hungover lol. Good work Merrion",4,2015,03,15
200,Afternoon tea at the Merrion Hotel Dublin,"Not cheap but still good value! Beautiful surroundings, lovely take on the cakes being themed with the artworks around the hotel. Wonderful service and an inexhaustible supply of tea! (Don't Lways get that!)",5,2015,03,12
200,Cellar Bar - Sunday Brunch!,"I had brunch here with my family and absolutely loved it. The food is beautiful and I would definitely go back. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the environment is sophisticated. Its also perfect for any age group.We ordered the eggs benedict and french toast from the brunch menu. Presentation was absolutely beautiful. The background music was to our liking - three lovely ladies called Bugle Babes are there for a reason. Could not be better! 
Attention to details and the best customer care that I have ever experienced!!! TRULY 5*
I would highly reccomend it! 
I will definitely be returning.",5,2015,03,10
200,Warm welcome,"Love the Merrion. An air of tranquility pervades all, all staff are very helpful and the rooms and facilities are excellent. Always my choice in Dublin. Rates are good if you book in advance. Recommend the cellar bar both for a drink and for food.",5,2015,03,10
200,Saturday Night Stay in Dublin,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay here in the Merrion Hotel. From arrival the staff treat you like a VIP - all other hotels could learn from their customer care! We also got upgraded to a suite which made the stay even better.
The down side was I was only there for one night and didn't really get to use all the facilities but the Spa was super and I had a great relaxing massage.
The location is also perfect being city centre but away from the craziness of Dublin nightlife.
If you haven't been then go now!",5,2015,03,09
200,Pure opulence,"I recently stayed in the Merrion for the 2nd time recently and decided the fairest way to review was to review the hotel and the restaurant separately. 
The hotel is beautiful, elegant and luxurious with some of the most amazing staff I have come across who could not do more for you. 
Rooms are large and beds extremely comfortable with the highest standards of amenities that you could need. Our bathroom was huge for a hotel bathroom and offers both a large shower and seperate bathtub. Upon arriving you are greeted by the most obliging concierge who are super efficient at taking your car and luggage and showing you to check in. Check in was quick and easy and you are then personally shown to your room by the staff. 
The public areas in the hotel are beautiful are showcase some amazing artwork amongst open fires and people enjoying afternoon tea. The hotel offers 2 bars, one on ground level and 1 in the basement as well as 2 restaurants. We ate in the cellar restaurant fr dinner and breakfast which I will review separately. The cellar bar is a great place for informal pre or post dinner drinks. 
The pool is within the spa area which was spotlessly clean. I was a little disappointed to find that there was no sauna or jacuzzi however I believe that the spa is part of the Merrion's redevelopment plan so hopefully these will be added. 
Overall, I would highly recommend a stay in the Merrion with its 5* luxury and perfect location. Only piece of advise I would offer is that if breakfast is not I couder in your rate, I wouldn't recommend paying the extra for it as there are so many places in the vicinity that would offer better value for money.",5,2015,03,08
200,Superb slice of luxury,"Outstanding hotel on every level, from the attentive and welcoming concierge and reception staff to the room service and bar staff. The rooms were apparently standard but there was nothing standard about the very high quality decor and furniture - and an exceptionally comfortable super kingsize bed. Nothing had been forgotten, including the well-stocked mini bar and the bathroom full of little treats. The hotel is conveniently located near St Stephen's Green/opposite the Irish Parliament and just on the route for the hop-on, hop-off buses which are an excellent way of seeing the whole of the city. I would definitely recommend the Merrion and would definitely stay there again. First class...",5,2015,03,08
200,Special and luxurious! ,"This is my second stay at the Merrion Hotel. After my first visit a year ago I thought this hotel was perfect in every way, upon my 2nd visit I can confirm it is! This is a beautiful luxurious hotel with friendly and courteous staff. It's old world without being stuffy. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. I love sitting in the drawing room by the fire place. The High Tea is popular with hotel guests and visitors a like. It's conveniently located. I look forward to my next visit! ",5,2015,03,05
200,Wonderful start to our Ireland trip!,"After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, we chose The Merrion for our stay in Dublin.  What an amazing start to our trip.  We arrived from the US very early in the morning and decided to go ahead and head straight to the hotel.  They immediately took us to the spa area to freshen-up while they checked on our room.  Within an hour, they had us in our room, which was about 6 hours early.  Beautiful room and common areas.  It was perfect.  We hope to visit again soon.",5,2015,03,05
200,Amazing Luxury,"This hotel was a recommendation through our American Express FHR and we booked a weekend here over the Christmas holidays.  I cannot say enough about this hotel, it is comprised of old Georgian mansions and it is amazing, the center of Dublin city and the gardens are beautiful.  Food in the cellar restaurant was great, we ate dinner one evening and breakfast every morning.  Rooms were immaculate and the staff were the best we have experienced.  I would highly recommend  staying here if you get the chance, take tea in the lounge and enjoy the ambiance and surroundings.  The art collection is also worth investigating, ask front desk for information and they will provide details of the art and its location in the hotel.  Cant wait to stay here again the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2015,02,27
200,Excellent Hotel,"I regularly stay here for business.  The hotel is gorgeous; I love walking to my room through the garden corridor.  The staff are exceptionally helpful and the breakfast is amazing. I have regularly eaten dinner in their private rooms and the service and ambiance is a mix of contemporary and old world Dublin.  While the Shelbourne is its own institution, I prefer staying here.",5,2015,02,25
200,great hotel,"My partner and I stayed at the hotel for a few days. The Merrion clearly lives up to its reputation. The rooms were spacious and well lit, the furniture was beautifully assembled, the staff could not be more friendly and the food was great. We will definitely come back!",5,2015,02,25
200,"The best weekend break for some time , up with best of them !!","My Wife and I booked for the weekend of the 21st 22nd of Feb. Right from the start we had a fantastic experience at the Merrion. Every single member of staff at the Hotel were super friendly and nothing was a problem or too much for them.
We enjoyed an exquisite afternoon tea and breakfasts which really appealed to the tastebuds!!
Highly recommended and it is certainly worth the 5 Star rating. Would happily return again .",5,2015,02,24
200,Delicious Sunday brunch in the Cellar Bar!,"My boyfriend and I visited the Cellar Bar this afternoon to try out the Merrion Hotel's well-renowned Sunday Brunch...it didn't disappoint! From the moment we entered the bar, the service was impeccable. The staff were very welcoming and did everything possible to ensure we had a lovely relaxing afternoon. We ordered the eggs benedict and belgian waffles from the brunch menu. These were both very reasonably priced, presented well and absolutely delicious. :) We also ordered coffees and cocktails while we listened to the wonderful musical entertainment....The Bugle Babes! The manager, Rachel was very helpful and friendly and whilst chatting to her about the lovely musical entertainment, she informed us that the Bugle Babes are a new addition to the Cellar Bar Sunday brunch sessions. The mix of 60's style classics added a stylish and elegant touch to a truly relaxing Sunday afternoon. We will definitely be back soon!",5,2015,02,22
200,Afternoon Tea at the Merrion,"Most likely the best afternoon tea in all Ireland in a wonderful elegant relaxed setting with charming and efficient service. Wonderful selection of dainty, tasty sandwiches, cakes, scones, jams, clotted cream,teas and coffees and , if you like, Champagne or a wonderful selection of wines. More than enough for everyone, in fact we took away two 'doggy' bags of what we couldn't eat in the two hours we had to enjoy this almost forgotten delight.  I recommend to all, but make sure you book, especially at weekends, as the word has got out already.",5,2015,02,22
200,No1 in Dublin for a reason,"We picked The Merrion hotel on the basis of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor, we were not disappointed. The hotel is very understated from the roadside. Check in was nice and easy and we were shown to our room, one which was ready early. We picked an upgrade to a superior room and plumped for a ""leading weekends"" package which included dinner at the cellar restaurant and breakfast. The room was delightful, nice and bright and airy with a wonderful bathroom. Turn down service at night was a nice touch. The hotel has a lovely warm and friendly feel and we felt very welcomed. We have stayed at many of the worlds leading hotels and would rate the as one of the best stays we have had. They really know what they are doing.",5,2015,02,22
200,Silver wedding anniversary,My wife and I had fantastic experience at the Merrion hotel. The staff could not be more helpfull and were always happy to assist. I can thoroughly recommend Dublin as a place to visit and the Merrion as an excellent place to stay.,5,2015,02,21
200,Truly 5*,"Myself and my mother stayed here for a night to avail of the shopping in Dublin.  We felt special the minute we arrived as our bags were taken from us a we approached the hotel.  We were greeted by Lisa at the desk, she was warm and couldn't do enough for us.  We stayed in a suite and it was outstanding, very luxurious and so clean (a little bit too hot at night).  We had a beautiful dinner and breakfast, the service and food was first class.  The open fires and art work made it so relaxing and only a 10 minute walk from the main shops.  We also saw a few familiar faces which also made our trip :)  Fantastic time!",5,2015,02,20
200,Love calling to The Cellar Bar,We were staying in The Croke Park Hotel and as it was my other half's birthday called into The Cellar Bar for cocktails. We were delighted to see Phil the manager who always makes us feel very welcome. I told Peter to make me a cocktail and said surprise me. It was fantastic. Peter is a very talented cocktail maker. When he is making them you can see that he is really trying to ensure its 100%. Thank you Peter. John and Issac were also serving and I enjoyed meeting them always. Stayed in The Merrion once before and hope to return again to stay. ,5,2015,02,17
200,Sanctuary in the city,"I celebrated a milestone birthday here in June 2014. We chose it for its understated luxury and high standards. From arrival on day 1 to departure after lunch the following day, this was a wonderful experience in Dublin. Being upgraded to a suite was a lovely gesture, much appreciated. Aside from one overly enthusiastic, macho swimmer literally creating waves as he belted up and down the tranquil infinity pool, the Tethra spa and treatments were very relaxing.
The feeling throughout this hotel is welcoming, informal and not remotely stuffy; it's a delight to sit in the Drawing Room, by the fire, with a drink and the paper.
When I requested a particular tea at breakfast, the lovely French waitress even recommended another one to me and gave me some a small selection to try at home. After breakfast, a few minutes walk took us to the National Gallery, where we viewed the Irish Art collection. The Merrion itself has lots of interesting art too. We had lunch in Bar 23, whilst outside ravers and revellers regaled the city for Pride festival.  The Merrion is in a stunning Georgian building, within walking distance of anywhere we wanted to go and an absolute treat to stay there.",5,2015,02,16
200,Merrion is that special something that you gift to yourself,What a magnificent stay my 80 year old mother and I had at the Merrion.... delightful from your very first steps into the hotel. The staff at the concerierge and front desk were delightful. In particular PATRICK made our stay very special. He was absolutely dlovely and very helpful. The rooms and facilities were beautiful and we both felt very blessed to be staying there. Dublin itself is a wonderful city and its people make your heart sing!!! Loved it!,5,2015,02,15
200,Brunch and Bugle Babes!,"Brunch on a sunday in the Cellar Bar is a total switch off from the real world - beautiful food, early afternoon cocktails(!) and music by a really chic band called the Bugle Babes - we felt like we had been away for days. Lovely choice on the menu - both in variety of tastes and price range and friendly service that reminds you its a 5 star hotel but doesn't intimidate whatsoever. We read the newspapers cover to cover. I will definitely be returning...and will also be tempted by the evening cocktail menu we had a peek at too :)",5,2015,02,15
200,"Sunday Brunch at the Cellar Bar, The Merrion Hotel, Dublin, Ireland, Feb. 2015, Highly recommended","In early February my fiancé and I went to the Sunday Brunch at the Cellar Bar, located at the Merrion Hotel. We had planned it for about two months and reserved a table.

We arrived on time and were warmly greeted by the Maître d'. 

Our table was held back for us and just opposite the one we had around one and a half months ago during our lunch. The ""Reserved"" sign was discreetly removed before we took our seats. The difference between our two tables was the size and shape. Our most recent table was squared and larger, while the other had been round. It was a bit wobbly, though. When we mentioned it, a solution was found immediately. The member of staff was grateful we told her. It shows it's better to communicate when something isn't working before leaving dissatisfied. 

The Sunday Brunch is well branded with a sign (proclaiming it's the most stylish) at the top of the stairs leading down to the Cellar Bar & Restaurant and branded ""Brunch"" coasters, especially created for it.

The brunch menu is published online, so we already knew what we would order and the estimated costs. 

There were special brunch cocktails and mocktails available. He had an Orange Crush and myself enjoyed the Brunch Refresher. My better half likes coffee liquor, so he was pleasantly surprised, when the waitress confirmed they offered both Tia Maria and Kahlua. He had a Tia Maria. The measure was generous. My cocktail was refreshing and less sweet than his mocktail. The combination of cucumber and gin worked well.

As starter he had the Charentais Melon with Parma ham and mandarin mustard, while I had the Super Salad with pomegranate, baby spinach, feve and feta cheese. Both were delicious and light. A good beginning to our meal.

Our main courses were Brioche French Toast with berries and scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, bagel and butter. 

The French Toast came without maple syrup, but it didn't hurt the dish. It allowed to focus on the berries and the eggy bread. The dish was very light and enjoyable.

The eggs were creamy and hidden under the smoked salmon. The bagel was the best I've ever had so far. 

Our desserts were a Banana Caramel Sundae and Choux Buns filled with vanilla ice cream. Both looked stylish and were scrumptious, but light. We chose cafe latte and a cappuccino to accompany our desserts. They came in specifically made glasses. They were well designed, unusual shaped and prevented burning our hands by being made with two layers of glass. They are maybe better suitable for larger hands. I had to hold mine with two to get a better grip. The content was creamy and strong, just as we like it.

Our overall impressions are excellent. The food was delicious and healthy, the staff very attentive and always there when we needed them. They managed the right balance between being warm and professional.
 
The background music was to our liking - mostly jazz. The volume was right and didn't disturb conversations.

Other guests were a family and couples. The older children were very well behaved and the atmosphere was good, but it wasn't loud. 

Having had two good experiences we can only recommend a visit to the Merrion Hotel's Cellar Restaurant and Bar, now we're looking forward to experience this venue again in our future.

Would we recommend this venue to a friend? YES!
Would we frequent this venue again in our future? YES!",5,2015,02,13
200,almost perfect,"The staff, the ambience and the restaurant are without doubt wonderful. I would just ask....Please..... The aircon goes off at night and the rooms are just too hot. I asked for it to be fixed after night one, but it was exactly the same. Our room overlooked the back yards which did not worry me as I am not about to spend hours looking out of the window, but it was very noisy first thing with windows open and that was essential!
Please, please reduce room temperatures at night, the expense must be minmal!",5,2015,02,12
200,Best Hotel In Dublin,"The picture for the hotel is actually pretty terrible. I debated even staying here, but it kept coming up in all sort of searches. So I booked the hotel with CC points. 

Wow! I was so wrong about this hotel. We arrived via cab from hotel. As we started to get close the bell hop practically ran to the car.

We checked in and the receptions walked us to our room. Open the door and made sure everything we needed was there. I've never had the person check us in actually open the door into the room. She showed us everything. We mention we were tired and would nap for the afternoon.

She setup a wakeup call and schedule teatime for us. Service was amazing, but almost a little creepy it was always on top. Not used to be pamper that much, great, but it will get some getting used too (keep that in mine).

Room service was great. The menu is amazing and always running. I recommend getting room service at least once.

Tea time, best in town. You're also going to be surprised that all the art work is real and one of the biggest collection in the country for a hotel. The did a tea time treat with artwork paring. So you can walk around the hotel and check things out.

23 Cocktail Bar. Key tip!! The bar is open 24 hours a day. Yup, once you're filled up with beer. No better place to relax by a fire and have craft cocktails. The bartenders are some the best in the world. My wife (former bartender, yes, I married the bartender... be jealous) was impressed.

Cellar Bar
They'll pretty much get you any food you want. You'll also run into some pretty amazing people at this place. We did.",5,2015,02,12
200,Number one in Dublin for a reason,"This is a super hotel and the epitome of good service. The staff cannot be faulted. The queen room was of a good size, the room facilities of a high quality and the overall experience was as relaxing as you could ever want. It is not the cheapest but it is good value. My one criticism is that the airconditioning unit in the room was a little noisy at times and the room a little stuffy.
I've stayed in all the top hotels in Dublin, though, and this tops them all.",5,2015,02,12
200,Very comfortable hotel,"We have just had a three day stay in this hotel. It is very well situated for seeing Dublin, but despite being very central is nevertheless very peaceful (despite the current external renovations). We had a very comfortable and well appointed room in the Garden Wing and enjoyed using the lounge and bar areas at the front of the hotel. These offer a very pleasant environment and the service is excellent. Rooms are not cheap and do not include breakfast, which suited us because we found the Cellar restaurant, where breakfast is served, to be average quality for a high price. It's so easy to wander out of the hotel and have a good breakfast for much less cost at a number of places just around the corner.",4,2015,02,11
200,Fantastic hotel,"Just returned from a night at this amazing hotel. Easy to describe this hotel - elegant.
A true 5 star hotel. 
The style, service and decor are wonderful, lovely bedrooms and great facilities. And the Irish breakfast is not to be missed. ",5,2015,02,09
200,Afternoon Tea Delight!,"Treated to Afternoon Tea with the girls for my 30th Birthday…absolute heaven! 

Staff are second to none – Katie served our table and couldn’t have been more helpful or friendly. 

Food and drinks were delicious – the attention to detail was just fabulous and everything was so tasty too. 

Definitely the best Afternoon Tea in Dublin City…by far! 

Thanks to Aoife Morrin for reserving us a lovely table in front of the cosy fireplace… the best seat in the house by far! 

We’ll be back very soon!",5,2015,02,09
200,Remarkable hotel,"We came to dublin as a family for a short weekend visit. We stayed in the Kirk suite which is beautiful and spacious. The entire hotel is beautiful - cozy and warm with lots of inviting rooms with fireplaces, perfect for the chilly February weather.  Loved the location. Service is attentive, especially room service, (particularly Sarah).  We would absolutely come back here for our next stay in dublin!",5,2015,02,08
200,Lacking nothing,"I have stayed here for business and pleasure and it has never failed. 

It is beautiful on the inside and out. The rooms in the main house are my favourite.

Its perfectly located within minutes of Stephen's green and great restaurants.

The pool is a must see.

I would t stay anywhere else!",5,2015,02,08
200,Fantastic stay,"Stayed here December 2014 as my birthday present!  
Beautiful room and bathroom (see pics), very luxurious
Had a lovely meal in the cellar restaurant, great food and service.
It was great to sit in front of the fire with a drink, very comfy.
Pool is small but very enjoyable.
Had a wonderful time and would highly recommend.  Top end stuff and lovely staff.",5,2015,02,08
200,Old world elegance...,"Stayed here last night with my wife to celebrate her birthday. From the minute we arrived when we were upgraded to a junior suite, to the handmade cupcakes and champagne in the room, to the knowledgeable concierge staff who knew the perfect pub to watch the rugby in, nothing was too much trouble! I have never experienced such pleasant  welcoming staff, everyone of whom we met was friendly and chatty without being obtrusive. 

Dinner in the Cellar restaurant was delicious and again the staff were awesome!

I have to make special mention of the beds which made getting up for breakfast particularly difficult. However once we had our fill of perfect eggs, bacon and potato bread it was beautiful to collapse back into bed for another doze!

I would highly, highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a luxurious place to stay right in the centre of Dublin...which by the way is a great city! If you're in the Merrion though you might not see too much of the city as you won't leave the hotel!",5,2015,02,07
200,A must,"I recently had the pleasure of Afternoon Tea at The Merrion and it was all that it promised a truly relaxing afternoon.

The service was friendly and efficient, the surroundings extremely comfortable . 

The afternoon tea was excellent with two exceptions the scones were not to the standard you would expect they did not appear to be fresh as was the Madera Cake.  We were particularly impressed by the  skill in theming of  the pastries to the paintings hanging in the Lounge and apart from being visually appealing they also tasted delicious.  Our waitress was extremely obliging throughout and even boxed up  for us to take away what we could not consume, to our bitter disappointed we left them behind .

I will certainly be returning as it is a perfect venue for catching up with friends in the City.",5,2015,02,07
200,"Old style hotel, not cheap, luxury","Memorable stay at the hotel, classy style, good service, nice rooms with all facilities youd need for a short stay. Great swimming pool and gym. You pay a lot but get a lot. Recommended. Nice garden for summer days",5,2015,02,05
200,Wondeful Hotel,"We stayed in the merrion many times for weekend and occasions. It's a fabulous hotel.The spa is not great but it's ok. The food is good and the ambiance is sublime. We stayed also during Christmas , it was so much fun for us and for our daughter",5,2015,02,05
200,Afternoon Tea - Simply Amazing,"As a January Treat, 3 of us took afternoon team here recently on a Saturday. The whole experience was perfect, Katie looked after our every need. The sandwiches, scones, lemon curd, jam were all superb along with fruit cakes and battenburg cake. We were also served Choux Buns, Biscuits and macaroons inspired by the hotel art collection. There is an extensive tea menu along with coffees, hot chocolate. We honestly could not find any fault perfect way to catch up with some friends, cannot wait to go back.",5,2015,02,04
200,Excelent,"Perfect, everything was amazing. Place, location, room comfort and cleaning, decoration, staff, food, room service. 
In my opinion the best place to stay in Dublin. Tradicional and fancy. I want to go back.",5,2015,02,04
200,A wonderful stay,We'd a great time. From bar food to Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud - was super. The tasting menu was a delight and superb value for the experience. Staff were top notch right across the hotel. The room was a touch dated but was still very nice. We'll be back.,4,2015,02,04
200,Didn't live up to expectations,"Stayed here for 2 nights in January. After the reviews I'd read I was expecting a lot more if I'm honest.

- Service was good, but not brilliant (e.g., I went to the bar for a snack on arrival and there were nuts/crisps on the floor)
- Food was good (didn't eat in the 2 star Michelin restaurant; bar snack and breakfast only)
- Room was a bit dated - comfy bed, clean, but not amazing
- Location - good

All in all, nothing really spectacular given the reviews. A nice hotel, but was really expecting more.",3,2015,02,03
200,Superb hotel,"A return visit for us. Since our last visit the highest praise we could give any hotel was that it was a little like the Merrion! Lovely public spaces full of excellent 20th century art works; comfortable rooms and impeccable service. The staff are courteous, professional and welcoming. A great base for a Dublin holiday.",5,2015,02,03
200,Best place to stay in Dublin,"Keep forgetting to put any review up on the Merrion! I stay here a few times a year on business trips.  This is an excellent hotel with the best customer service approach I've encountered in Dublin (and farther afield).  All very understated, efficient and professional.  Obviously good location, usual facilities for a hotel of this level, with plenty of wining and dining options both inside and close by, are helpful.  But it's the pleasant staff and professional approach that is hard to match anywhere else. Would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. ",5,2015,02,02
200,The template for pristine 5 star perfection,"Booked an overnight stay for my husband' s birthday. As we were staying 1 night only we arrived on time for check in to maximise our time there. Unfortunately our room was not ready. We were led to the residents only ultra cosy bar with real fire & given a complimentary drink. When our room was ready we were escorted there by a fabulous staff member who explained the history of the hotel en route. Because of the inconvenience of waiting for our room we were upgraded to one of their best suites... Fabulous & stunning...

Breakfast the next day was completely flawless, great buffet selection & great options to order from menu. 

Cosy cellar bar is great. 

2 star Michelin restaurant attached to hotel. 

Highly recommend at Christmas time. 

Attention to detail is outstanding, from staff training to food, to upkeep of hotel...

Cannot say anything negative about the Merrion - all the great reviews are well deserved. 

If you want a great city centre location, fabulous 5 star service with a slightly hip, happening atmosphere, stay at the Shelbourne. If you want the same great 5 star service & city centre location but a more 'get away from it all' more intimate setting choose the Merrion...",5,2015,02,02
200,One of the best,"The Merrion is a luxury hotel but it doesn't shout it purrs.  Everything is understated quality.  The staff are professional and friendly, obviously well trained and also numerous. They certainly enhanced the experience and made it truly five star.

Our room (a deluxe king in the main house) was large, beautiful and well equipped with an equally large bathroom and all amenities.  The bed was extremely comfortable with lovely linen and pillows. The lounging area with sofa etc made the room feel so much more than just somewhere to sleep.  Everything was spotlessly clean.

In the public areas the Georgian character has been sympathetically maintained and makes the atmosphere the antithesis of the slick modern style of many city hotels. Excellent art collection on the walls. The lounges, with warming fires, feel homely and make a nice area to relax after being out and about. The pool is lovely, warm and was quiet when we were there.  Breakfast was really good, a continental selection and then freshly cooked options which are so much nicer than never quite perfect, warm buffet food.  Didn't have to wait long for these to be prepared either.

I could go on ... I loved the hotel.",5,2015,02,01
200,Wow,"Fabulous experience from start to finish. We will be back....I hope!
We were greeted on arrival by door staff, check in was a breeze and we were walked to our room. 
We were given a complimentary upgrade to a superior room which was beautiful. 
Though we didn't dine there our breakfast was delicious. 
Beautiful pool.",5,2015,01,31
200,wonderful hotel,"Stayed one night last weekend and this was our first stay in the Merrion Hotel .The bedroom are comfy and restful . The staff are wonderful and The food was very delicious also, we would definitely back again.",5,2015,01,28
200,"Lovely experience,  great staff, location and service","We stayed for one night here in August and as it was short notice we had to take quite a small room but it was still beautiful and tastefully decorated.  I especially loved the bathroom, very regal! We were escorted in under an umbrella by a lovely man who then took our car to the carpark. The concierge then took our bags and we were checked in and showed to our room by a girl from Tyrone I think who was very pleasent and helpful. As it was quite late we checked to see if we could order room service which we could so we did. I have to sat we were unimpressed with the food. I ordered risotto and caprice salad and a pizza. The risotto was very very bland and just made with long grain rice and some arborio rice. It seemed as if someone boiled some rice to stick in with the risotto and make it go farther but it was just so so bland. The pizza we got had full slices of rasher on it, when we had asked for parma ham and the caprice salad was fine, not that you could go wrong with it. First world problems I know!  Although the food was not great the service was fantastic and we still enjoyed our stay. The breakfast the next morning was enjoyable but I would have liked more! We also left two pairs of shoes and a phone charger behind which  we phoned about and they were never returned. We filled out a feedback form with our phone numbers on as they asked when would be a good time to call us and they never did. Overall I'm rating this 4/5 as I feel there could be some places they need to improve on to keep the 5 stars.",4,2015,01,28
200,Understated Luxury,"When we booked the Merrion for a first time in Dublin 2 night stay we saw it's reputation as the best hotel there of course. What we weren't prepared for was the warm and welcoming nature and how very comfortable we would be. It is situated brilliantly for accessing all the areas that tourists want to see which means you don't have to rely on public transport or taxis all the time.
The Merrion has a downplayed elegance with a relaxed atmosphere and very helpful and friendly staff.  It smacks of old-world charm whilst having all the modern amenities expected in a Hotel of this standard. This isn't cheap but the Dine and Dream package worked well with excellent food and restaurant service.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, particularly in the far east and middle east and this stands up to any of them. We will be back.",5,2015,01,28
200,A Truly Five Star Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for five days in January, I booked two rooms one for my wife and myself and one for my Sister-in-Law and her Partner. Both rooms were in the Garden Wing with a view over the Garden which in spite of having contractors on site were still very attractive, the Mimosa was in full bloom and was superb.
We were collected from the airport by the Hotel transport, the driver was excellent, courteous and helpful.  On arrival at the hotel, which was before the check in time, we were shown to the Reception where the staff were very courteous and looked after us in an excellent manner.  The next time we saw our luggage was in our respective bedrooms.
While waiting for the rooms to be made ready we went to the Cellar Bar for Lunch, it was fully booked but this did not stop the staff finding us a very comfortable table and service of the food and drink was very good, not too rushed nor was it too slow.  The food we chose was also well prepared and served in a very professional manner and was very adequate in quantity.
Our rooms were excellent, clean and well appointed with a flat screen TV, a working radio, toiletries, plenty of towels and one of the best non-slip shower mats I have ever seen or used.
I cannot fault this hotel in any way and my guests agreed with me.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a unique hotel experience and if we go to Dublin again this will be my first choice of hotel.
The Merrion is close to St. Stephens Green and all shops and unlike many purpose built hotels this is converted from four Georgian Town Houses which gives it a unique feeling and it has one of the best art collections in any hotel which I have ever been in.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,01,27
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"Having stayed in many hotels in Dublin over the years finally stayed last year and was really impressed with all aspects of this hotel.
Stayed over two weekends in November & was equally impressed this time with the level of service & attention to detail. Stayed in a suite which is not cheap but on a par to any 5 star hotel in Europe . Bathroom & bedrooms spotless. Turndown service every evening with a fresh ice bucket left in the room. 
Breakfast despite the hotel being fully booked very efficient with little or no queuing , service first class & all produces & juices etc replenished speedily. Although being in the city centre the rooms are quiet with wonderful beds & duvets & views over government buildings. 
unlike some other hotels there a quieter atmosphere in the bar",5,2015,01,25
200,Loved it!,"This was a special trip for me, a real get-away from my own hotel, Casa de la Noche, in San Miguel de Allende. I found the service fabulous at the Merrion, and rooms and bathrooms very clean. The rooms were standard for such an expensive spot, but the common rooms were lovely, especially the area set aside for afternoon tea. Location was excellent, and the concierge service friendly and helpful.  I tried the Irish breakfast, but prefer a simpler fare, and there were nice options for this at the ample continental buffet. 
All in all this was a lovely experience.",5,2015,01,25
200,Excellent,"You can stay in a hotel in Dublin or you can stay in one of the best hotels in the world, in Dublin. It doesn't get better than this in Ireland, from arrival to departure it is in a league of it's own. We stayed here last year for two nights (don't stay any less as you won't want to leave) and the memory of that visit is as clear today. Our check in was personal, genuine, relaxed and charming, thank you Caroline! The marble foyer leads to the most wonderfully appointed Drawing Rooms with open peat fires where guests were enjoying afternoon tea in an oasis of calm from the bustling city. And what a room! This was a special occasion surprise which I mentioned on reservation and they really delivered, thank you nice man on the other end of the phone. Lovely treats awaited on the table in the room and a note from the manager was a lovely touch. We dined out but couldn't wait to get back to the cosy cellar bar for a few drinks, we even had a cheese board on the recommendation of the waiter to accompany our delicious red wine. Breakfast next morning was late as we didn't want to leave those beds and just made it in time, seated in seconds, superbly looked after by Charles and had a breakfast we will always remember. Our room was serviced by the time we returned and I really would love to live in a house that had this housekeeper, I can't explain how brilliant the room looked, especially after the state we had left it in, we were much more respectful on departure I'd like to mention. We had a dinner included and dined in the Cellar that evening, really lovely, delicious menu, beautiful local Irish food, friendly attentive service and well chosen wine list. Our German host was most courteous and couldn't do enough for us, really top class service, sorry, forgot the name. Room service breakfast was next morning and the Eggs Benedict are the thing of dreams, sitting in your robe, sipping tea and looking over the gardens. The stand out thing about staying in the Merrion is the way everyone addresses you, it's so friendly, so formal yet so warm, so brilliantly right. There must be hotels all over the world wondering how to get it this right, well done Merrion.",5,2015,01,21
200,WHAT A TREAT TO STAY HERE,"I took my best friend here last sat. night as a special birthday present as its her favourite hotel and what a treat it was.  A delicious dish  of chocolates and a card were delivered to the room, a gesture which was much appreciated.   We told everybody we were 'going posh'  for the weekend, but we also felt comfortable, nicely treated and enjoyed the lovely warm ambiance of this hotel,  and in this world,  that's nice to experience for a day or two !!  We will be back.

200,Stunning Hotel,"We had to wait to check in as the hotel was very busy. We went for lunch and wandered about Dublin a bit as we were early arriving at midday.  

We requested to be in the old part of the hotel and were upgraded to a suite. The room was superb, on par with Le Bristol in Paris with gorgeous linen, carpet, furniture and amenities. A true five star hotel (5 star seems to used loosely in Ireland). There was a lovely art exhibition taking place in the foyer too of modern Irish art which was fortuitous.

Luckily we had a late checkout guaranteed as part of our booking as when we tried to book a second night a we were due at a function at The Shelbourne across the road at 4:30 we were unable to as it was fully booked. When we said that we would then avail ourselves of the 4pm late check out the manager said no but as his co-worker pointed out, this late check out was guaranteed. Luckily we were able to get ready for the function then leave- there was an army of cleaning staff waiting at the door when we did!

The bed, linen and size of the suite meant we completely utilised our late check out, swimming in the pool, using the gym and taking our breakfast and complimentary lunch there. The Merrion was my favourite hotel in Ireland, a true five star experience. It is only a shame that breakfast is served underground and not out in the beautiful courtyard as the summer weather was beautiful.",5,2015,01,17
200,Wonderful and memorable experience.,"This is a very belated review to acknowledge the wonderful experience of our stay in the Merrion to mark a significant wedding anniversary.  On our arrival we were delighted to have been upgraded to a junior suite.  The staff were exceptional, friendly but very discreet.  We have spread the word amongst our family and friends and hope to return again.",5,2015,01,17
200,Best Hotel Stay Ever!,"I neither write nor read reviews but I owe it to this hotel to comment.

In short, it's wonderful... The best of Old World charm and 21st century luxury. The best hotel stay ever and I can be very critical!",5,2015,01,17
200,Excellent stay,"This is truly a five star hotel. The staff are  wonderful from the  greeting  as we stepped out of the taxi, the reception staff .  I could go on.  A member of staff showed us to our room and ensured we were comfortable.  The attention to detail was fantastic. Lighting in the room was perfect.  Too often this is a problem in hotel rooms.  In addition to bedside lights there were special reading lights.  I cannot think of anything else that we could possibly have required.  Lovely swimming pool and again everything you could possibly need with lovely staff.  Our only disappointment was breakfast.  Below standard for this hotel.  The bacon was overlooked and the toast was not toasted.  It was still white and one or two pieces were toasted on one side only.  It is surprising that a manager who oversees this otherwise magnificent  place missed this one.  Would return but not for breakfast.",5,2015,01,15
200,Totally enchanting,"My husband and eleven year old daughter  and I spent a wonderful week at the Merrion. My husband is Irish but we live in Sydney. As we were jet lagged it was great to be able to come down to the beautiful lounge area in the middle of the night and have a snack and read the paper by the open fire. I really recommend upgrading to a room in the main house as they have beautiful Georgian proportions and windows and are quite a bit larger. The service,  from housekeeping beautifully tidying our things to Bernie on the front desk who was incredibly knowledgable and helpful was exceptional. Brian Murphy who I think is the Manager exceeded all our expectations in locating our daughter's lost iPad ( found in a rental car) and forwarding it on to us. The Merrion combines the charm; fabulous Irish art collection, beautiful Georgian buildings of boutique hotels with the facilities - stunning pool and steam room, lots of staff etc of the larger more anonymous luxury chain hotels. The Merrion provided us with one of the best hotel experiences we have had as a family. The breakfasts were lovely in the cellar restaurants with an emphasis on Irish produce; the butter, yogurt and salmon were a delight. The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and always recognised us. In short we cannot fault it and look forward to going back.",5,2015,01,15
200,Simply amazing!,"We stayed at The Merrion for my partner's birthday last Saturday, as a little surprise for him during our stay in Dublin. Well it was a surprise for me too, such a delight! From the minute we came in -very early, but we still were able to have our room, upgraded room!- to the minute we left, lingering in the Drawing Room as we really didn't want to leave this little paradise, we just had an amazing time.
The hotel, garden, rooms are beautiful, very elegant, the swimming pool was very clean (and the water so warm, we were lucky enough to be alone in the spa to swim!), and every single member of staff that we have met was extremely polite and helpful. 
We were upgraded to a Superior King room, to our delight, were welcome with some lovely little cupcakes and a personalised letter from the manager, delicate attention. 
The bed was extremely comfortable, we slept so well! There is absolutely no fault we could find, this was simply perfect.
The best hotel we could have found to make this weekend in Dublin an unforgettable trip!",5,2015,01,12
200,Anniversary,"pretty good but a few things slightly lacking. We were told when we booked that we might get an upgrade depending on what was available when we checked in as it was our anniversary. We checked in and were told no not possible then two minutes later we were asked did we want to upgrade at extra cost. Explained what we were told but basically it was a shrug of the shoulders. First room was terrible right above bins and no outlook. Second room nicer. Although French window would not close properly so very noisy and drafty. Phoned down man came up in 5 mins. Said it was broken and back tomorrow to fix. As we leave two days later not fixed. We jammed it closed with shoes ect. 
Building work being done which we were advised about. Some noise in the morning. Carpets being re-laid.

200,Beautiful First Class Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with welcoming employees! Perfect location and with-in walking distance to most sights and shopping. Hop on Hop off bus stop is right by the hotel and very convenient. Rooms are luxurious, comfortable bed and wonderful bathrooms with separate shower and tub.  First class hotel and can't wait to return!",5,2015,01,09
200,Luxurious hotel but not sure about the restaurant,"The hotel itself was handsome - the tea rooms were especially tasteful and lovely. Our room was comfortable and beautiful; service was impeccable. We are particularly appreciative of the fact that they kindly offered us the shower facilities (complete with toiletries and amenities) at the spa/pool area to freshen up before our late night flight (because we have checked out earlier in the day) - the hotel deserves its five stars. The reason we gave it a 3 out of 5 stars was the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant where we had dinner. Given that it was 400 Euros dinner in a Michelin star restaurant, we were shocked when my husband threw up straight after the dinner when we got back to the room. I myself didn't feel too good as well. Not sure what was wrong but we were taken aback. On hindsight we should have raised the issue directly with the restaurant, but our itinerary was too packed the day after and we flew off. ",3,2015,01,09
200,Sort of Kind Of OK BUT!!,"So we headed off with great excitement to The Merrion on Xmas Day and checked in.  To our delight we were upgraded to a beautiful room and a lovely hamper compliments of the hotel awaited us.  Overall the experience of the Xmas dinner ambience walk in the garden and drink at the fire was wonderful.  We felt we were in ""Downtown Abbey""!  Unfortunately the breakfast was a disappointment.  I ordered Eggs Benedict which was OK at least it was sort of fresh.  My friend ordered the cooked Irish which was seemingly a reheat  and was NOT good.  The continental table lacked lustre there were no meats on it just 2 cheeses and the Orange Juice had been ""preped"" the night before not fresh, the bits were thick and it tasted sour.  We complained but got the standard response.  Seriously not good enough for the cost involved so we will await the management response other than the standard pre written auto response.  Cost in excess of €700 for the 1 night B&B and dinner - one would hope the breakfast would be more of a feature and more enjoyable. We have stayed in many hotels who did not boast of being 5 star and the breakfast was better than ""The Merrion"".  Overall a sour ending to a beautiful start. We will review again.",3,2015,01,06
200,Beautiful Historical Hotel,My husband and I just completed our stay at The Merrion Hotel and it was fantastic. The service was excellent - from the wonderful doormen and front desk staff to the housekeeping staff. We greatly enjoyed sitting by the wood-burning fireplace for daily tea and a pint. The hotel is located central to so many Dublin sites that almost everything is walkable. My only comment for improvement is the wifi. It is complimentary but it can be a bit challenging to maintain a consistent robust connection. Definitely put this on your hotel bucket list.,4,2015,01,06
200,Superb attention to detail and quiet efficiency.,We had an exceptional visit to the Merrion this month. The hotel is wonderfully central and lives up to its 5 star rating through its service and attention to the smallest details. we will not hesitate to return the next time we are in Ireland. ,5,2015,01,06
200,Great place to spend the New year in luxury,"Yes it is a tad expensive and yes its a bit stuffy in the main areas too  but the wonderful welcome, the awesome food and the incredibly friendly staff who are pleasant, well informed and so accommodating - the Merrion is pearl when it comes to customer service!",4,2015,01,05
200,Value for money,"This was our first stay at the Merrion on the 28th December 2014, escaping for a night from a young family, and we will definitely be back!!! The hotel is expensive, there is no escaping that, but I genuinely believe that this represents real value for money. My wife and I are self-confessed fussy customers, and we were blown away by the level and quality of the service and accommodation. All staff were extremely friendly but discreet and unobtrusive, nothing was too much trouble for anyone. 
The spa facilities, for a city-centre hotel, were fantastic and we both enjoyed a one-hour massage as part of the post-Christmas pamper package that I can strongly recommend.
If there is one slight niggle it is that the fine-dining restaurant was closed after Christmas (as were many of the alternatives in Dublin). The result is that we chose to eat in the cellar restaurant instead. The atmosphere and service were great, and the food was good. The slight drawback was that my main course was a little luke-warm (though certainly not cold). I mentioned it to the waiter after the meal, and he dealt with it brilliantly, offering us complementary drinks from the bar as compensation (which was very good of him).
Overall this truly was a five-star experience all round.",5,2015,01,05
200,Perfect end to Christmas,"Every year my husband and I try a different hotel in Dublin, there is no comparison to the Merrion and I can see why it is number 1.  Every little details is covered including putting bottles of water in our car for the Journey!! I cannot remember the porters name but I can honestly say we have stayed at number of hotels and I have never met anyone with his amazing skills which I hope he is recognised for, if the Merrion could help with their names I would appreciate it
thanks",5,2015,01,04
200,Afternoon Tea,"I had tea in the Merrion just before Christmas, there were four of us.  The drawing rooms are lovely, the ambience was very nice and the service very attentive. We were offered fresh tea/coffee as required. However the ""tea"" itself was disappointing. The sweet things very much outnumbered the savoury. The sandwiches were made with processed bread and the fillings were fairly meagre.  The sweet things would not exactly be described as fine patisserie, which one would expect in such a hotel.  There were scones and pieces of cake such as fruit and maderia, not very interesting.  Some were dyed the colour of Sean Scully paintings, but who wants to eat food colourings in their cake !!!  The setting is lovely, the ""tea"" could be a lot better.",5,2015,01,03
200,Brilliant New Year's break,"We had a wonderful stay at The Merrion over the New Year period, to both mark my dad's 60th birthday and to see in 2015. The hotel is in a great location, a little away from the hustle and bustle around Grafton Street, but still central and within easy walking distance of all the main sights and shops, etc. The decor of the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spotlessly clean, as are the bathrooms, which are also large (at least in those rooms in the garden wing, where we stayed), with separate bath and walk-in shower. Service is excellent and we only experienced one small hiccup, when there seems to have been some miscommunication between guest relations on the front desk and staff in the ground floor bar, which meant that our booking for a table in the bar for a cup of tea and some tea breads was not placed, which was slightly awkward when we arrived and there was no table available. This was quickly rectified, however, so wasn't a major issue. We also had a long wait (more than 10 minutes) for a table for 5 at 10.30am for breakfast on the one morning we had breakfast at the hotel, but it was New Year's Day, so I expect that was the reason, with more people having breakfast at the hotel and later than usual as well.

Breakfast on the whole was good, although one of our party found the Irish breakfast lacking in flavour. Dinner in the Cellar Restaurant on New Year's Eve, however, was fantastic, the highlight for me being the dessert with which I ended 2014; a sublime mango and passionfruit soufflé.

Overall, we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay, and I would highly recommend The Merrion for a Dublin break.",5,2015,01,03
200,As I expected,"Excellent, as expected. My first stay here and really enjoyed it. Top notch service, as you'd expect in a 5 star hotel, but a few staff members went the extra mile which makes it stand out compared to other establishments we've been to. We will definitely stay again.",5,2015,01,03
200,Best in Dublin!,"Have to stay that after my second stay at the Merrion it is my favourite place to stay.
Everything on this recent visit was perfect - I find the Merrion to be a very welcoming place to stay and the staff and all excellent. We ate lunch in the Cellar bar which was good. I was looking forward to breakfast which did not disappoint!
Rooms are excellent, ver y comfortable with everything there that you would need.
Can't wait until my next visit.",5,2015,01,03
200,You should stay stay here!,One of the best experiences that we've had in our travels.  The property is gorgeous and service is impeccable.  Rooms are very comfortable and clean. We couldn't ask for anything more.  The fitness facilities with a beautiful pool are an icing on the cake.,5,2015,01,02
200,without equal in Dublin.,"This is the only place to stay for business or pleasure. 

The staff are amazing, kind and considerate. The food is exactly what you would expect. 

I have held events/conferences and we were well looked after for the whole day. 

It is a warm comforting environment where you are well looked after and can take on the city at your door step.",5,2015,01,02
200,Wonderful base in Dublin for New Year,We spent 3 nights at The Merrion including New Years Eve and enjoyed every minute. The staff are amazing and the hotel has a wonderful ambience. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.,5,2014,12,31
200,Clean hotel but expected a lot more,"Stayed here for my wife's 50th birthday.sorry I didn't pick the shelbourne was as dead as a Funeral home .room was tiny. Breakfast in room was superb .from the moment we arrived we literally could not get a seat to have a drink every seat in hotel had a reserved sign very frustrating to say the least.though we may have been upgraded but our tiny room was overlooking a dingy street above airconditioning units.not an ounce of entertainment  in hotel , not even a harp or piano guy very poor for a five star hotel in a major city on a Saturday night .
",4,2014,12,31
200,Christmas Wedding at the Merrion,"We stayed here for for a few nights over Christmas for a wedding. What a fantastic hotel. It was so homely and relaxed with a nice mix of families, couples and all ages, The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The cellar bar is a great spot to have a quiet pint with friends and family. Highly recommended!",5,2014,12,30
200,perfect cusomer service,"Spent one night here after Christmas hoping to feel pampered and we certainly did.  Check in was quick and professional.  As we were early room wasn't ready but car was parked for us and when we returned from a late lunch shown up to our room.  Staff were all very friendly and courteous.  Beautiful surroundings, lovely room.  Good meal in Cellar restaurant.  Only proviso, as in lots of restaurants, there was only one veggie option.  Breakfast was delicious and check out, again, very quick and professional.  Will be back.",5,2014,12,30
200,Merrion Magic,"Have just spent three nights at the Merrion Hotel.  What a lovely hotel - four Georgian homes now a luxury hotel.  The history surrounding this part of Dublin and this particular hotel is amazing.  The gardens are beautiful, drawing rooms very welcoming with their open fireplaces, a fabulous heated pool and spacious rooms.  From the monogrammed towels to the luxury amenities this hotel delivers.  The staff were most helpful.  In the basement is the Cellar Restaurant, where we ate one night and it was very good.  Another night we ventured around to Hugo's Restaurant, and although my husband was happy, I was underwhelmed with their food so we were back at the Cellar the last night, this time eating in the bar and I would thoroughly recommend this dining experience.  Especially during this time of the year when it is chilly out, it's nice to have a great alternative on your doorstep.  The only small criticism I have of the whole experience is that I felt the grouting in the shower was overdue for a good scrub and there wasn't one time that I wandered through the guest halls when there wasn't plates left at doors and cleaning products (vacuums etc) in the hallways.  But would I recommend - absolutely!  And the tour buses pick up right outside.",5,2014,12,30
200,Understated and comfortable,"Merrion aims to deliver comfort, style and service in relaxed and unpretentious surroundings. It succeeds on all counts. On my second Christmas stay with family and was once again delighted. No matter how hard a hotel tries, if it hasn't got the staff then nothing else matters. Merrion staff, from start to finish, were unfailingly excellent. Nothing too much trouble. Always a smile and a greeting. Helpful without being pushy. Resident's bar very cosy and comfortable. Not mad about the Cellar Bar - found it a bit noisy. Cellar Restaurant was very good for lunch and dinner. Cooked breakfast wasn't all it could have been. Only other minor moan is the whiff of fish one often gets between the lift and the entrance to the restaurant. Can be off-putting. Otherwise, very satisfied and hope to return soon.",5,2014,12,30
200,Perfection away from the Christmas Madness.,"We decided to get away for the night to escape the madness that is Christmas and we were not disappointed...The Merrion is the perfect example of Irish Hospitality and charm. 
I arrived early as I was heading off to meet friends for lunch and the reception staff were a delight, I was checked in and my bags were taken care of within minutes. On my return my key was ready and my bags already in my room. The room was classically furnished with lots of Merrion touches for that extra attention to detail that make the stay such a delight. The beds were so comfortable and you literally sunk into the matress with its super soft topper. I used both the pool and gym which were lovely....
Breakfast was a real treat and one of the main reasons for staying in a hotel in my opinion. Locally sourced produce, delightful staff and lovely setting...
All in all the perfect way to recharge my batteries before Christmas proper kicked in.... ",5,2014,12,29
200,Nothing was too much trouble ,"Well situated 10 minute blue to Grafton Street.  Excellent restaurant in house although the Michelin 2 star was closed during our stay.

Large comfortable rooms and excellent concierge.

Staff were all helpful.

The afternoon tea needs to be booked and is more than enough.  They did squeeze us in as we were residents.",5,2014,12,29
200,Christmas in Dublin,"The family agreed to meet in Dublin for this Christmas. After reviewing all option we settled on the Merrion.

We wanted something luxurious that also had a strong Christmas theme. The Merrion delivered in every respect.

We have never stayed in a hotel with better service over a significant holiday period. All 9 of us kept commenting on how nothing was ever a problem for the staff.

The Christmas decorations, carollers, Christmas lunch and all of the other ""stuff"" was elegant and well thought through.

The hotel cleverly assigned a special Christmas coordinator to look after everybody for the period and make sure every whim was catered to. During our time Ben looked after us (and I think everybody else) like a personal coordinator. Well done Ben, you did yourself proud, thank you!

The rooms were lovely, the food food was always good, the public spaces were just so and the service was stellar - what more can you ask for from a luxury hotel?",5,2014,12,29
200,One of the best hotels in Dublin,Have stayed here many times when visiting family in Dublin and it never disappoints. Staff are excellent and very helpful. We stayed here the day after our wedding and they had our room in the main house available an hour early which was great as we were both knackered. Rooms in the man house are far better than in the newer wing which I have stayed in previously. Only downside is that breakfast should be included in the eur450 per night rate. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin on business or pleasure ,4,2014,12,28
200,A Special Place to Stay in Dublin,"This was our second year to spend Christmas in the Merrion and we love the place.The hotel has everything - a historic building in the heart of the best area of Dublin and walking distance of the main attractions and shopping. Apart from the fabulous rooms, the comfortable open areas with real fireplaces, great breakfasts, the big plus here is the staff.The welcome is generously Irish yet the staff is a combination of Irish and international. It's like there is a culture of its own here where you feel that the staff absolutely love what they do. The service is 5 Star and excellent but with heart. Fully recommended!",5,2014,12,26
200,Grand and Imposing,"Stayed here on a two night one dinner package.

Hotel is very stylish and opulent. Had dinner one night in The Cellar Restaurant, lovely food, very attentive and unobtrusive service also. 

The breakfasts were as good as we had ever experienced. Location is very central for Grafton Street shopping.

Highly recommended and must visit again soon.",5,2014,12,24
200,Perfect for a wedding anniversary,"Everything in this place was marvelous, from the service to the place itself. The Spa, the breakfast , the afternoon tea and the bar were all with great and very nice service.
To say, the afternoon tea in this Hotel is really something to do. I will not say more so that people could have the surprise as we did.
We have been totally charmed by all of the aspects of this hotel, including food and drinks. We rented a Standard Queen room which was a perfect fit for us.
I would gladly recommend this place for a special time as we did.",5,2014,12,22
200,Breakfast experience poor,Have stayed here approximately 10 times over past 10 years.  The hotel always been my favourite place to stay. My most recent visit will be my last.  For the considerable cost involved the dinner wasn't that nice and breakfast which I would have previously rated as marvellous was just terrible ; the food wasn't up to the standard of previous vists and the service was dreadful! Complained to the manager who apologised and said he would get back to me. I never heard a thing!,3,2014,12,21
200,A 5-Star hotel with 5-star service,"My husband & I stayed 2 nights in Merrion Hotel, we were very impressed with the service, from the doormen, front desk to the staff in the restaurant, all were very friendly, made us feel very welcome, nothing was too much to ask.  Good size bedroom with spacious bathroom, the room was very well kept daily with turn down service each evening, also complimentary water daily.  We had breakfast & dinner in the Cellar Restaurant, the choice of breakfast was plentiful, nice selections of fresh food & pastries etc.  Good choice of dinner menu, very beautifully presented & tasted delicious, too.  
The hotel is located very close to the Grafton Street & St. Stephen shopping centre, Trinity College, National Gallery & Government Building are all nearby. 
We had a lovely stay in the Merrion Hotel and definitely would go back to stay again should we have the opportunity.",5,2014,12,21
200,Festive Afternoon Tea,Booked well in advance and it was a nice treat. The hotel is stunning and the service excellent. It was sold as Festive Afternoon Tea though and there wasn't so much as a hymn playing subtly in the background - just silence - so there really wasn't a festive atmosphere unfortunately. Obviously the sound of silence has been deemed more festive than some nice Christmas Hymns. I would personally prefer more savoury offerings and the rare beef wasn't rare.,4,2014,12,20
200,Georgian Perfection!,"My wife and I spent four nights at The Merrion after four nights at the spectacular Dromoland Castle in County Clare. We would have expected a Dublin hotel to pale a bit in comparison, but we weren't disappointed with The Merrion in the least. The Merrion is every bit a five star property, and it surely deserves its fantastic reputation. Beautiful drawing rooms, tasteful and spacious bedrooms, friendly staff, wonderful restaurant and interesting art all make for a delightful stay. (It's also in a convenient, yet quiet location.) We're planning on many return trips to Ireland, and The Merrion will continue to be our preferred destination in Dublin!",5,2014,12,19
200,Another great stay,"My wife and i stayed there on friday 12/12/14 and we had a fantastic experience,the hotel has such a warm and homely feeling,all the staff we so nice and helpful .I cant wait for our next trip.
Many thanks to everyone there 10 out of 10",5,2014,12,17
200,Georgian perfection in the heart of Dublin,"We recently spent four nights at The Merrion during a quick trip to explore the city and could not have been happier with the hotel.  Our room was spacious with all of the comforts you would expect from a top notch hotel.  Upon our early arrival we were able to refresh in the spa / gym area that contains a nice marble steam room and large pool.  The gym itself is a bit small and cramped, but Dublin is a walkable city and you can skip the treadmill and opt for walking or hiking in the nearby hills.  A pleasant perk of the hotel in the colder months is ones ability to take advantage of one of Dublin's best restaurants, Patrick Guilbaud, as well the comfortable drawing rooms on the first floor without needing a coat.

The location is convenient for all of the major tourist attractions, as well as a short five minute walk to the Pearse DART station that provides easy access (<45 minutes door-to-door) to great spots north and south of the city to get outside and see the beautiful coast.

We'll be returning to Dublin and will definitely choose The Merrion for our next stay.",5,2014,12,11
200,Perfect stay!,"Stayed here on a flying visit to meet up with very special friends. The hotel, staff, food, spa, atmosphere all deserve 10 out of 10. The Merrion deserves it's continued spot as No. 1 Hotel in Dublin. Thank you!",5,2014,12,08
200,I wish I could have stayed longer,"This hotel brings old world charm to the busy Dublin streets. The rooms are beautifully appointed, if sometimes a bit small. The pool in the spa is large enough to have a proper swim, and the reception areas are cosy and relaxing. Yes it is a bit expensive, but as it is a stones throw away from St Stephens Green you are in walking distance of some of the best restaurants Dublin has to offer. ",5,2014,12,08
200,Even more beautiful at Christmas!,"The hospitality, comfort and attention to detail, the central location, casual and fine dining ideal. But even more beautiful when dressed for the season!  Yes, it's a little expensive (over my business travel cap) but worth every penny.  If you need to be 'at home' in Dublin, you can't do better. The only problem is, now that I'm home again, I miss being served my coffee in sterling carafe and fine porcelain!",5,2014,12,06
200,Fabulous luxury,We stayed for 3 nights for our 25th anniversary treat. The hotel was just fab and everything we had hoped it would be. We ate in the restaurant Patrick Gilbaud downstairs which was totally outstanding and highly recommended.,5,2014,12,06
200,Classic Dublin.  First class hotel in center of everything.,"Spent 3 nights here.  Very established and classy establishment.  Service was very professional.  Expensive as you'd expect for hotel of this caliber.  Rooms in Main House had super high ceilings and were well appointed.   Breakfast was tasty.  Fireplace were lit w/ wood and peat and added nice charm to the place.   Lovely art.   No major issues at all (one night was loud, one suite had one light to bathroom that harshly lit entire bedroom, rented movie one night ...poor quality picture).  Was recommended by close friend that travels regularly to Dublin as the classic Dublin hotel,  would happily stay there again if returning to city.",4,2014,12,05
200,Simply the Best!,"This hotel is simply the best in Dublin. It delivers 5 star hospitality with a genuine homely feel. Our room was very spacious with a luxurious feel to it. We overlooked the garden which is beautifully decorated for Christmas. The hotel is in a gorgeous Georgian building close to Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and all the major museums and attractions Dublin has to offer. The service is top class. We were brought to our room which is a very nice touch and it seemed that all the staff knew us even though we only stayed one night. Thanks in particular to the doorman who looked after our car and filled it with water! I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Dublin city but the Merrion is without doubt the best!",5,2014,12,04
200,jim's Dublin trip,excellent spot in the heart of Dublin - grand hotel with great amenities.  Spa/pool/mudbaths are a must!  Very nice Irish Breakfast. It was a work/play visit & that mornig toddy in the bar was always helpful.,5,2014,12,03
200,The place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed here for three nights during a recent vacation in Ireland. The staff was very friendly and willing to help in any way. The rooms are well-appointed and very comfortable, though one night in a room near the elevator wasn't exactly world class. Breakfast is not to be missed and so is tea. Hard to imagine a better hotel anywhere.",5,2014,12,03
200,Old World Class,"My wife surprised me with a quick trip to Dublin for Thanksgiving this year. She did all of the research, planning and purchasing. She came in one night to tell me that we were going away for the holiday. When I asked if I should bring a swimsuit, she said a heavy coat and an umbrella would be better. Ireland wasn't even on the radar for me so to say that I was surprised is a huge understatement! 

We arrived too early to check into the hotel but the doorman grabbed our luggage and whisked them away before we even realised that they were gone. The front desk seemed a bit stiff at first because of how early we were. We took off for some touring and when we returned our room was ready. The room itself was great! It had one of the most comfortable beds that we have found in a hotel with a couple of different types of pillows to choose from. Housekeeping came into the room a couple of times per day to make sure that it was all perfect. The turndown service was very nice too. This is rated as one of the nicest hotels in Dublin and it shows too. 

We enjoyed dinner at the adjoining restaurant, Patrick Guilbaud, which was over the top! (Look for the review elsewhere on this site.)

If you are looking for a great hotel while you are in Dublin, this one is not to be missed.",5,2014,12,02
200,Best spa,I've just come from the 'body bliss' experience in the tethra Spa. I highly recommend it. HUD was my therapist. He was amazing. Really incredible. I feel like I'm floating. He was knowledgeable about products but not pushy. Still I bought 3 products! ,5,2014,12,02
200,Best in Dublin,"We had only one night with you but it was truly excellent. From first arrival with valet parking, an upgrade in the room and perfect attention up until we left there was nothing left to chance.  I had forgotten a pair of cuff-links and although I had another shirt the fact that you had a pair behind reception (nice gold pair too) just said so much about the ethos of the hotel. We will definitely stay there every time even if it is slightly more expensive, it is worth it.  Well done and thanks.",5,2014,12,01
200,The Best in Dublin - It's Like a Private Club,"I have stayed at the Merrion Hotel a few times.  The last time earlier this year.  No matter when I stay or how long I stay I find the experience to be one of the best in Dublin.  Granted it is a 5 star hotel and it should be the best.  But there are 5 star experiences and FIVE STAR experiences.  I arrived at the hotel by taxi.  You're in the heart of Georgian Dublin with nearby Merrion Square bringing thoughts of centuries past - tall terraced buildings four stories tall with large windows on the lower floors and the trademark half-circle Georgian window over the main door.  The uniformed top-hatted - doorman greeted me with a smile and a very sincere, Good Morning.  He told me to go straight in to Reception and that he would handle my luggage.  The entry foyer has a fireplace, marble floors and high ceilings with intricate plaster work.  Relax is what is says and I did.  The Reception area elicits a warm, welcoming feeling with comfortable furnishings of carpeting, paintings, period cozy furniture, should you need to wait however the Reception staff were ready and very professional with my reservation details ready.  The young lady had a warm smile was very professional. With room card in hand I walked thought he public rooms.  Fireplaces, furniture groupings for cozy conversations and attentive staff to bring you refreshments.  This felt like a private club.  It looked like hotel guests were enjoying relaxing conversation with friends but you could tell resident guests were a priority.  There were no crowds of public visitors that I have experienced in other Dublin hotels.  This hotel intentionally keeps it pretty much for guests and their friends. It is a very secure feeling. Large windows opened up the garden views and filled the room with natural light.  The hotel has two bedroom areas - the Main House which faces Upper Merrion Street and Government Buildings and is very elegant and the Garden Wing which is a newer section also very elegant but architecturally more contemporary.  My room was in the Garden Wing which is accessed via a glassed-in breezeway to that building wing, all the time looking out over the beautifully kept gardens.  My room was on the third floor and overlooked the gardens.  A large room with a king-size bed, two comfortable armchairs, small table, floor-to-ceiling wardrobe next to a desk/vanity with chair and the flat-screen TV.  Plenty of room to spread out.  Very comfortable indeed.  Large well-appointed bathroom with bathrobes and all the necessaries.  I guess if one wanted to add a roll-away bed for a child or third person it would fit with lots of floor space left over.  A large room.  I met a business colleague in the cocktail bar in the Main House which is a very comfortable lounge here again with comfortable furniture grouping for cozy conversations.  High ceilings and beautiful artwork added to the relaxation and the good conversation.  Attentive staff brought drinks in short order.  Our conversation carried into lunchtime and it was suggested that I enjoy the Cellar Restaurant which is located in the basement of the Main house.  It has a separate entrance from the street but also the elevator took us down to it.  To the right after alighting from the elevator I saw the leisure center with a swimming pool and spa.  I took a quick peak and was very impressed - more elegance!  The Cellar restaurant takes in the vaulted ceiling created by the vertical pillar and makes for cozy dining areas without the need for dividers.  The food was superb and service to match.  Being part of a 5 star hotel the price was surprisingly affordable.  I felt unrushed and that I could stay as long as I wished to finish my meal.  The included Irish breakfast is served in the Cellar Restaurant.  I exited the restaurant via the public entrance and up tot he street.  The Dublin 2 area encompasses St. Stephen’s Green, Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square.  A great place to take a stroll while viewing the famous ‘Door of Dublin’ in their many colors.  You get a very safe feeling here as you stroll.  Upon my return from my walk I was greeted by name!  Now that is what I call FIVE STAR!  My night's sleep was very restful with no street noise nor corridor noise.  I chose to have breakfast in my room - a few euros extra but very elegant! Note: I stayed here one other time and in the Main House.  A great stay both times and aside from the room price difference you always feel like you are a member of a private club.",5,2014,11,30
200,Lovely location and fabulous service,"Second time I've stayed in this hotel.  The service is always fantastic, very friendly and nice fire places in some of the common areas.  The location is great and Dublin is a great walking city anyhow.  Will stay again next time I'm there.",5,2014,11,30
200,Best hotel stay EVER!!!!,I have never experienced such great service. Everyone is efficient and smiling and drops everything to help. Neat. Professional. Attentive. Affable. Rooms are luxurious. Clean. Awesome minibar! No future hotel stay anywhere else will be the same. Merrion sets the bar!,5,2014,11,29
200,If a hotel could be  a six star...,"We stayed here recently for the first time. We live in Ireland and had not stayed in the Merrion before. So we decided to treat ourselves, it was a good decision. This is hands down the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It's in a different category to other five stars in Ireland. We had afternoon tea, ate in bar 23, the cellar bar, had room service and ate in Guildbauds. All option were fantastic. Great quality food, served with a smile. We hadn't planned on eating so much in the hotel but it was so good that we didn't want to go somewhere else.

The staff are just class here, I have never seen such good service across all parts of a hotel. 

We had a beautiful room with a huge bathroom. Apart from the amazing service what really made the Merrion stand out for us is that the hotel is there to serve it's guests. We have stayed in other 5 stars in Dublin where their bars etc are constantly packed and you have to compete with non guests for a drink or a seat etc. in the Merrion this doesn't happen, it's quiet and relaxed. We came away relaxed and renewed and cannot wait to come back very soon.",5,2014,11,29
200,What a surprise !!!!! Great hotel,"Usually when I travel to Dublin I stay at the Shelbourne, which is a very good hotel, and very conveniently located. This time, I had to attend an event, gave very short notice to my Assistant and ended up at the Merrion because the Shelbourne was full.......and what a positive surprise.  Super clean, great room, spacious, fully equipped, great staff, fantastic service, amazing atmosphere.....not much more to say.....from now on, the place where I will stay in Dublin in my future trips.",5,2014,11,28
200,Total Luxury - Amazing Service,"Myself and my wife thoroughly enjoyed a mid-week stay at The Merrion recently. The hotel certainly lives up to its reputation and 5-star rating. From the moment we arrived, we found the staff extremely polite and friendly. We stayed in a suite overlooking Government Buildings and the room was beautiful - surprisingly quiet for a city location too. We enjoyed lunch and breakfast in the hotel and the service was first class. The staff were polite and attentive but not over-bearing. Given that the hotel is an old Georgian building, upon arrival I was surprised to see that it has a Spa and pool. Needless to say I was disappointed that I hadn't done my research and we arrived without our swimwear! Highly recommended whether you are on business or pleasure. The hotel oozes class and is great for a special occasion.",5,2014,11,26
200,Dublin Style,"My infrequent trips to Dublin are made even more enjoyable by staying at The Merrion.  A classy classic hotel in the heart of the city, opposite Leinster House, close to St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street etc.  Deceptively large, wooden floors, comfortable lounge areas with comfy chairs and sofas where one can enjoy some quiet time, afternoon tea or something a little stronger from the (24 hour) bar.  The open fire gives that added bit of warm and comfort - especially when enjoying a cocktail - test the barman's knowledge - its extensive!  Good size bedrooms with all the expected features, clean and comfortable.  Breakfast in the basement restaurant has the full range available with polite attentive staff...although I was surprised, after being asked if I would like brown toast, to be served white!  Small matter.  Concierge and doormen are very helpful and will always find a taxi for you.  Final vote of thanks to the IT gentleman who came to my room and connected me to the wifi when my laptop was doing its best to tell me it didn't exist - well done that man!!  To quote Mr. Schwarzenegger - I'll be back.",4,2014,11,26
200,Good but not as great as many write,"I may have been expecting too much but I wasn't as overly impressed as many previous reviewers seemed to have been. On a very positive note, service was extremely polite and helpful. That is a truly top-notch feature of this hotel. I found the rooms though and hotel nice but not spectacular. Location is also quite convenient but also not perfect.....this obviously depends on what you are there for and where you're headed. One things which I found quite weak and probably the only reason for four instead of five stars is breakfast. I was very unimpressed with the breakfast and quality of what one receives for the price. It was standard fare and not in any way representative of what I would have expected in this place. Again, I had a great stay and enjoyed my time here but it didn't knock my socks off. Would I come back? Sure, if I'm in the area and want something where I may take my wife. If on business and not spending much time in the room, I would probably go somewhere else. If you are privately travelling as a couple I would recommend it though and the area around the hotel is enjoyable. Nice to be able to get around on foot. Finally, as most hotels have crappy gyms, I won't ding this one on theirs but it's very small, not very modern and has seen better days. Adding space and modernising would be something I'd greatly appreciate but most people going to this type of hotel probably don't care about.",4,2014,11,25
200,Mrs Ann marie cunning,Just returned from a great stay in the merrion hotel one that I will never forget  staff where great they made my 50th birthday a remerable one will go back  thanks merrion hotel loved the door men they where great and thanks to the breakfast staff they made me feel so relaxed great location near bars and restaurants and shops not one to miss,5,2014,11,23
200,Gem in Dublin,"Just returned from a 4 day stay in the Merrion Dublin and we had an amazing experience. We were celebrating a 50th birthday and the hotel kindly upgraded us to an amazing suite and provided complimnetary champagne on arrival. The service here is second to none, from breakfast to the superb afternoon tea the staff were impressive throughout. The Merrion is well within walking distance to graften street shopping and numerous excellent bars and restaraunts and you will do well to find a better hotel in dublin. A particular mention must go to the lovely staff: anna on reception, agnes in the spa and patrick and david as friendly faces on arrival who ensured we were treated like family thoroughout. A fantastic hotel which i will certainly visit again in the near future.",5,2014,11,21
200,Good location,"The hotel is very nice but a bit tired. It's nice if you like old fashioned. We had room 207 which was nice and large but the pillows were very soft. Toiletries and towels were lovely and we had a lovely garden view. The bar was great and the breakfasts were lovely. The staff were very helpful, there was a slip up with someone else's bags ending up in our room, but all sorted out quite quickly.",4,2014,11,21
200,In a class by itself.,"From our initial greeting at 5am until our departure two days later the Merrion set the bar for excellence.  The staff, service and accomadations were impeccable.  Whatever our needs, we were met with a warm smile and a ""can do"" attitude.  ",5,2014,11,20
200,Afternoon tea -an experience!,"As my daughter is getting married this weekend I decided to treat her to afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel. We had a wonderful experience, top class food in amazing surroundings with the elegance of times past. The theme of the afternoon tea was art in all it's glory which surrounded us on the walls of these beautiful rooms. Our waitress describe the pastries and cakes in which the chef had recreated the works of art to perfection! Great selection of food with lots of different teas to choose from too. Although on the pricey side at €36 per person it certainly was an afternoon to remember and cherish together! Highly recommended as a treat!",5,2014,11,18
200,Gem,"What an Irish gem loved this hotel 
Great location and an amazing room was so happy felt so comfortable and the staff are amazing her will be returning soon even the 
food in the bar was top notch
And reasonable by priced",5,2014,11,17
200,Perfect Hotel,"Stayed  for two nights at the end of a tour of Ireland,.  Perfect in every way .  From the bellmen wisking our luggage away safe and sound to a fllawless check- in , our stay started perfectly.  The room was not large but perfectly adequate, squeaky clean and the bathroom was large and beautiful.  We were a group of six , had a mix up with a dinner reservation and needed the services of the front desk in a hurry.  No problem, we called and they found us another restaurant with confirmed reservations within minutes and that is how our stay at the hotel went.  The Formal Tea was worth every minute of our time (it is at least an hour) and  worth every penny.  It was very, very special with tea,and 3-4 courses of special sandwiches and special desserts even with one copied each day from a piece of art work from the hotels's million dollar art collection. Breakfast was lovely, cocktails both in the warm and cozy lobby in front of a roaring fire or in a tavern down below that felt like you were in newly a renovated king's castle were both  wonderful.  There is a beautiful garden in season with walking paths and sittiing areas.  The staff was crisp, professional and spot on.  Did I mention the perfect location,  accross the street from the US equivilent of the capital, and the museum of fine arts a block away.  A nice french restaurant next door, the oldest pub in Ireland around the corner and walking distance to  all the sites to see in Dublin.  Service was stella, wonderful room, perfect location and no worries.  A perfect stay..Will be back..",5,2014,11,16
200,Luxe in Dublin,"Nothing much to say other than this is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin. 
Great place to grab drinks, the specialty drinks are point on, great fireplaces. 

A lovely stay all around, will stay again.",5,2014,11,16
200,"No Wifi at all, despite complaints. No compensation, fees for early checkout","The good things written about this hotel are true. 
Still, I was not impressed with the small gym and the loud banging of doors starting at 6:45 AM. 

In any case, it is unacceptable that in a hotel of this standing I could NOT manage to get functioning Wifi. I couldn't even use my phone which got no signal. 
I called, then complained again the next morning, upon return to my room I had a note claiming the ""signal was very strong"". You DO expect they thoroughly checked and there will be no more problems. 

Guess what : I only managed to log on once (disconnecting continuously) and even Google Maps wouldn't load. Speedtest indicated 0.12Mb the one time it got a ping signal. 

In 2014 this is a major no-no for me and not only for business travelers. It’s a lot of time wasted, very frustrating and I ended up in a coffee shop to be able to do my work. I don't like to complain for such a basic amenities in a LHW (5* Luxury) and decided to check-out early. 

All I got was a sincere apology from their IT manager, which is nice ; but not only did they offer NO compensation, I was charged an extra 80€ for the early check-out which I asked as early as possible. 
He assured me ""all was fixed"" AFTER I left, but they had a whole day to make sure it would be.   

Then, as a welcome surprise a few days later, I notice an unexpected ""mini bar"" charge amounting to .. a 1 night's stay! I don't know if this is some mistake or a business guest emptied the bar, but a call to discuss a 180€ mini bar bill over 2 nights where I basically just slept would have been appreciated given the circumstances. Room service set me up for 70€ for a starter and main course, a lot more than at the Marker (see below). 

That prompted me to post this review as a strong warning, as I would not risk again being stranded when you're exhausted on business. 

The Marker, a modern design hotel, does not have the same ""traditional"" charm but my room was twice the size, very quiet and bright and everything worked perfect. Great gym and pool. Location is central too and cabs are plentiful and cheap.",1,2014,11,15
200,Wonderful hotel with great staff,Treat yourself to a wonderful experience by staying at The Merrion.   From the time you arrive all the staff strive to make you feel at home.  They are very friendly and seek to make your stay a memorable one.  The hotel is well located near St Stephen's Green and the public rooms are warm and inviting.   The bedroom was very spacious and comfortable and I would definitely stay again next time I am in Dublin.,5,2014,11,15
200,The Merrion Hotel .. a very special place,"Having researched The Merrion Hotel for a few nights' stay whilst in Dublin, I was expecting something special, but on arrival - and throughout the few days we were there - my wife and I were both struck by the excellent service from everyone. All the staff are so friendly and polite, and work well as a team. From the moment we were welcomed at the front door, to the excellent service from the Reception and the walk to our room - everything was amazing - and that was just within the first 30 minutes!  We are both celebrating 'special' birthdays this year and I wanted this trip to be both memorable and magical. Our stay at The Merrion Hotel was perfect, and so was the excellent evening in the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. It was also such a pleasure to meet Patrick himself, as he went to every single table to speak with his diners. We certainly felt very special during every moment of our stay, and we will be returning to both the hotel and the restaurant in 2015.",5,2014,11,13
200,Highly recommend - wonderful!,"Recently nine of us traveled throughout Ireland and Dublin was our final stop.  We wanted our best accommodations to be at our final stop, and The Merrion definitely fit the bill.  The hotel was conveniently located with shopping, restaurants/pubs and sites within easy walking distance.  The hotel staff was superb!  Always friendly and extremely helpful - everyone we came in contact with was pleasant.  Special thanks to the concierge desk - arrange cabs, dinner reservations, etc.  Loved taking to these gentlemen - extremely knowledgeable and interesting.  The hotel room was larger by European standards and very nicely equipped.  I would highly recommend The Merrion.",5,2014,11,13
200,You'll feel lucky to experience it,"This was the last hotel on our journey around south Ireland.  We stayed at 4 Five-Star hotels and this was by far our favorite. The location was perfect, so close to everything. We had a room overlooking the beautiful courtyard. The staff was quite helpful in finding dinner plans and it helped to know Dublin a little better at that point.   Our breakfast was included and Irish breakfast tends to be huge everywhere, we learned by this point room service was only 5 euros extra. A small tip was appreciated and they wouldn't take as much as I offered.  This was by far the best breakfast we had, maybe ever.  They brought an entire hot cart, that transformed to a table and plated the food. So much fresh fruit, the finest ingredients prepared and presented superbly. You are right across from Irish Parliament so you can't help but feel a little 'Presidential' here. This despite the fact that overall the people seemed a little less stodgy compared to other five-star hotels in general.  Except for one snooty English barraster that bumped me at happy hour and gave us the cut-eye in the basement pub, I enjoyed everything about the experience.  This seemed an exception rather than the norm.Based on how the locals reacted and how proud they where of the accomodations when we mentioned the hotel, we felt lucky to experience such a fine establishment first-hand.",5,2014,11,10
200,Wonderful art collection best kept secret - garden,"This is the place where you bring someone you truly love even if you are so shy you cannot tell them exactly how you feel. The smiling friendly courteous staff  and in particular a rather tall gent just shy of seven feet. We arrived to see some art work on display during a break in lectures. I am still in shock and marveling in the little jewel of garden at the rear lovingly tucked in between the three town houses that make up the Merrion. We were shown the way by the tall gent. I thought how my class would love afternoon tea (mature class) We would appreciate the house as our Diploma was in Fine and Decorative Arts. We will organize a tour of the art  work with a guide and relax and chat over tea, all 16 of us. Needless to say the surroundings are understated elegance.The concierge presented us with a booklet on their art works and we were bowled over at all their generosity time and interest. It will pay dividends in the long run as you never know just who you are being courteous to.
I haven't stopped talking about the place since",5,2014,11,10
200,Nice place to stay,Lovely Hotel. A short walk to the center of the cities’ best restaurants and shopping.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were large and clean. Very nice  gardens with reflecting pool.  I would definitely stay there again,5,2014,11,09
200,Nice Stay,My wife and I spent a couple of nights at The Merrion at the beginning of November. The building was definitely older but had been refurbished well. The service was impeccable and the location was central. It wasn't cheap but we definitely didn't leave disappointed. ,5,2014,11,09
200,Friendly & helpful staff,I stayed here for four nights in this well positioned hotel and it was a very enjoyable experience. The room was comfortable and well furnished and the public areas very welcoming as were the staff. Will definitely stay there again.,5,2014,11,09
200,Superb accomodation and service,"The title says it all. The Merrion offers friendly and helpful service at the highest level. Rooms and service are just great and the hotel location is superb just walking distance from the city center, restaurants, pubs and more.",5,2014,11,09
200,"Happy as many clams at The Cellar Bar in The Merrion Hotel, Dublin","I am not usually to be found on a school night hanging out in the Cellar Bar of the Merrion Hotel, more’s the pity.  
A couple of weeks ago we were en route into town trying to figure out a low key but fabulous eaterie and somewhere without the ubiquitous pulled pork (or pulled anything) sandwich on the menu.  Passing Government buildings, the sight of the liveried Merrion Hotel doorman put the Cellar Bar idea into our heads.  My sister is rarely in Dublin these days so there was a sense of occasion about our date, but not so much as to require starched linens and domed serving platters.
The bar was as ever, a welcoming warren of open brickwork nooks and crannies, perfect for romantic hook ups and girlie catch ups alike.  
The place was (almost full) of locals and tourists winding down on a Tuesday evening.  Creatures of habit that we are, we chose to share the always reliable seafood tower, and very reasonable at €30 for sharing.
I always find something particularly relaxing about a below ground level spot, the lighting usually glows along with one’s complexion.  Here at the Cellar Bar, the absence of a streetscape adds to the ‘whisked away’ feeling I always get when I’m there.  
The tower arrived, packed to bursting with the freshest of Galway oysters (oddly just three), clams, Dublin Bay prawns, Seabass ceviche, McConnell’s smoked salmon, Liscannor crab mayonnaise and more clams.  
The American businessmen (and woman) at the table next to us were so awed by the sight, they came over for a closer look and couldn’t resist changing their food order! 
The fish was tasty and fresh.  I wasn’t as enthusiastic as my sister about the Seabass ceviche but we both adored the crab mayonnaise on warmed baguettes.  If I had any criticism, four oysters rather than three would have been preferable for two people sharing and we could have done with a lot less clams.
The staff were pleasant and attentive, the atmosphere was relaxing with the proper silverware and monogrammed china adding the 5 star hotel touch, even for a casual supper on a Tuesday evening.
I love the Cellar Bar, discreet, reliable and cosy with a touch of grown up luxury.",5,2014,11,07
200,Great Product,"Stayed one night. Staff were great, not too over the top but provided appropriate help. Food options were varied from comfort to fine dining. Bar had a good buzz. Service without in your face intervention. Would definitely return.",5,2014,11,06
200,Mega prices for mediocre food,"A friend treated me to breakfast at The Merrion recently.  It was a tremendous letdown.  Their cooked breakfast was 29 euros.  For this I got a pot of wishywashy tea (teabag, not loose leaf); the buffet had a nice selection of fruits for a fruit compote but all of the fruit was tinned; the cooked breakfast was tasteless, to be honest, and there wasn't much of it - one rasher of bacon, one sausage, a few tasteless mushrooms, a couple of tasteless poached eggs, a bit of tomato and a small quantity of potato cake/black pudding which I didn't attempt to eat.  The toast was OK but I think the marmalade was tinned.  The surroundings are very nice and the staff are delightful and attentive, but 29 euros for this sort of food is daylight robbery in my opinion.  Thank God I wasn't paying!",3,2014,11,05
200,Excellence personified,"I've stayed in several 5* hotels in Dublin but this one wins hands down. I always stay here now, and wouldn't dream of staying elsewhere in Dublin. The beauty and class of the interior is something to behold. Located in historic Merrion Square, this Georgian edifice is the place to relax and soak up the sumptuous luxury on offer. 

The rooms are comfortable, spacious and well equipped but my favourite thing is to get back to the hotel after a night out and lounge in one of the opulent drawing rooms with an Irish coffee, in front of one of the blazing peat fires. The staff are first rate, efficient and attentive, and I just wish all hotel staff could take a leaf out of their book. Those in the know, such as Tom Cruise, choose this hotel above some of the other 5* hotels in Dublin that trade on their history and past reputation.",5,2014,11,05
200,Just Fabulous,"We have stayed at The Merrion on several occasions - it is always our first port of call. The management, the staff and the service are just beyond compare. Over the years we have stayed at nearly all of the 5* hotels in Dublin but not one of them can compare to The Merrion for service, comfort and a real sense of welcome and home from home. We just love it there!",5,2014,11,04
200,"I Don't Know Much About Art, But...","An unassuming row of town houses, looking pretty much like any other elegant Dublin street, hides a very pleasant hotel. I'm not sure that it entirely merits its 'five-star' billing (we've stayed in a fair few) but it's certainly low-key in its comfy traditional style. Perhaps the most notable thing about it is the fine collection of (mainly Irish) art which is distributed liberally around its walls. A 1950s Aubusson tapestry rubs shoulders with eclectic paintings from the 17th century onwards. Especially do not miss Rowan Gillespie's sculpture of James Joyce in the garden, surrounded by a pool of words chosen by him from 'Ulysses'. There should be a copy of the catalogue to all this in your room. Ask the desk nicely and they may have a copy for you to take home too.
There's some fine Rococo plasterwork lurking in the end house, tantalizingly depicted on your key card and elsewhere, but I gather you won't get to see it unless you're a conference delegate!
We spent a pleasant and comfortable few days here, after a shaky start when I had to contact the hotel five times the week before we arrived to obtain confirmation that they'd changed our celebration dinner booking from Friday to Sunday! 
There's no 'central tipping' here, to our surprise.
Oh, yes, and the doorman has a nice sense of humour!",4,2014,11,04
200,Staff are not 5 Star - disappointed,"Last weekend my husband and I stayed at The Merrion. Passing the hotel on our way to work everyday and regularly frequenting for business we were looking forward to a night away at the five star hotel. The Merrion in my eyes was always the number one. How wrong I was. I drove to the hotel, parked right outside and sat in the rain, amazed as each member of consierge jumped out, umbrellas in hand and attended to cars behind me - clearly more interested in tipping American guests then someone driving an Irish reg car. I was alone and pulled my suitcase out in front of them and I was left feeling annoyed, disappointed and embarrassed. Years of watching guests fussed at by the doors of The Merrion, maybe my car was not spectacular enough. The receptionist was cold. A lovely lady walked us to our room. Our room although big was not 5 star. The arm chairs were absolutely in rag order, items from the minibar were missing and the TV was old and of poor quality. Bed and toil interiors were nice. The staff are not at all what I expected. The have practically no personality and we only met one Irish member of staff. The breakfast experience was a shambles. Most people received something wrong. The staff were absolutely awful. I asked for gluten free bread and received an entire gluten free breakfast. The fry looked awful but tasted okay. The granola was the one thing which was 5 star. I think The Merrion needs to rethink their customer service charter. Location is fab, art is impressive but the heart seems to be gone. We're sorry we didn't go to The Shelbourne.",3,2014,11,03
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"My wife, two kids (age 13 and 11) and I stayed at the Merrion for three nights during our visit to Dublin in August. We stayed in the Garden wing with a King sized room connecting to a room with two twin beds.  This was perfect for my family of four. Large comfortable beds with a sitting area in both rooms. The bathrooms were large and new with plenty of towels and accessories. You are not wanting for anything in the rooms.  The staff and concierge were great. The sitting areas in the main part of the hotel were charming with beautiful furniture and art work before peat fireplaces.  We had breakfast everyday at the hotel as part of our rate. There was an abundance of food served by a gracious staff.  This is truly a tremendous five star hotel. It is not that large so it retains its Georgian charm. With its convenient location near the museums and Trinity College, it is a fantastic place to stay in Dublin.  This was my family's second trip to Ireland and our favorite hotel in all of Ireland.",5,2014,11,03
200,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, and great guest services","We arrived early morning in Dublin after an overnight flight.  The Merrion was very accommodating and allowed us to use their Spa to shower, as well as held our luggage so we could enjoy Dublin until our check-in time.  The Merrion was totally booked so we could not get an early check-in, but because of their great service we had the day to explore and experience the city refreshed and without our luggage in tow.  In the evening, my husband and I enjoyed walking around in the light rain showers under the Merrion’s magnificent umbrellas for two.  The hotel is beautiful and we will stay here again during our next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,11,02
200,Looked after wonderfully,"I stayed for a well anticipated special birthday celebration in July 2013. No one minded I was scruffy, my credit card unaccountably did not work until the following day and my expected companion detained on a long journey to Bruges. Hotel service and facilities were perfect at all times in what I believe to be the very best hotel I have experienced for many a year. I went again this year in the same season. Same lovely iconic door staff. The Merrion was just as impeccable. A fire was still burning (a tad too hot for me in August, however, but what a minor problem). A memorable venue.",5,2014,11,02
200,Dined in cellar bar,"Dined here with my partner. We love the fish and chips for 20 euros each. Its expensive but we really enjoy it. Home cooked and very delicious. Excellent service from Phil, he is always very friendly and makes us very welcome. Peter and Chris also give us excellent service. We will def return",5,2014,11,01
200,Irish Luck-ury,"Headed straight to The Merrion Hotel after arriving in Dublin and was overwhelmed by the warm and welcoming staff.  The drawing rooms with fireplaces lead to the hotel rooms in a way that makes you feel as though you are entering a Georgian home.  Classy, comfortable and spacious.  Enjoyed breakfast each morning.  Thank you for introducing me to toasted brown soda bread with butter and jam!  Enjoyed my four night stay immensely.  I hope to come back to visit.",5,2014,11,01
200,Perfection - through the early morning hours,"When deciding where to stay in Dublin, this should be the first choice.
As the majority of reviews shows, this is clearly a fantastic place to stay when in Dublin. We were here with a lot of friends, many of who stayed in the hotel. We are a widely travelled group and everyone agreed that at every level the Merrion deserves its 5 Stars, and so do The Cellar Bar and also the Restaurant.
And the bar staff who served our group until the early morning hours ...
",5,2014,11,01
200,Amazing service,"Just spent the most relaxing weekend at The Merrion.  The staff were so attentive,  courteous and friendly, we felt like we were being welcomed home.  Our room was quiet, spacious and comfortable (we were given an upgrade without asking) and the breakfast, delivered on a heated trolley, was perfectly cooked and presented. A really memorable hotel experience.",5,2014,10,30
200,"The Merrion Dublin, a great Dublin Hotel.","After spending 4 days at The Merrion on my third visit to Dublin this was by far the best Hotel I have stayed at in Ireland. Located next to Merrion Square it is a classic style hotel with great service and amenities. The welcome is quite warm and check-in was made trouble free. The Junior Suite we stayed was superb. Very spacious bathroom with bathtub and great toiletries.
Choose a breakfast inclusive rate since both the continental and the a la carte were of great quality. The living rooms and the bar are very welcoming and the tea time at the fireplace is a must. Next time in Dublin I know where to go!",5,2014,10,29
200,Now THAT'S Luxury!,"This may possibly be my first 5-Star rating on a luxury hotel.  Sheer opulence.  From the moment we were met at the front door by name and our bags were taken the service was amazing.  The hotel is so interesting.  The gardens, the art collections, the drawing rooms where tea and tasty sweet treats are served.  The old styled bar where your drinks are served by a well clad gentleman.  The room was perfect!  Clean, well designed and the bathroom was really nice.  I could not imagine staying anywhere else (but it doesn't mean I won't, so keep up the great service Merrion!). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ",5,2014,10,28
200,Wow!!!!!,Was treated like royalty from the moment we arrived- was given an upgrade by the grace of the hotel and the receptionist walked us to the dungannon suite and made polite conversation and asked about the reason for our stay. When we told her it was our anniversary she also organised a bottle of champagne to be dilevered to the room. The suite was top class and the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The view may not have been the best in the hotel but the service and quality of everything made up for this fact ten times over. They have a good size pool and a great feel to the lounge areas. The hotel isn't cheap but was worth every penny and we will definitely be going back for another visit. Thank you to all the staff for making our anniversary so special!,5,2014,10,27
200,Magnificent 5 xxxxx Hotel,"without a doubt probably the BEST Hotel I have ever stayed in . 5 star premises, 5 Star Staff, The restaurant is SUPER class . From the minute we walked in it felt Super !! We just wish all Hotel's could take a Leaf out of their Book.",5,2014,10,26
200,Short break,"Pretty hotel in an up market area of Dublin, accessible transport links and short walking distance from main attractions. 

The hotel room (standard, garden area) was clean and comfortable. A proper king size bed - very comfortable, proper quilt and soft sheets and pillows.

Daily cleaning was up to expected standard and bed turning service had nice touches like leaving a bottle of water at bedside.

Our preference is not to use the air conditioning so it was useful to be able to open the windows in the room. Only downside was our room overlooked the side street and being a city hotel you get the expected early bird noises of delivery vans and cleaning trucks. 

Everything worked in the bathroom which had a shower cubicle (a bit small) and bath tub (didn't use). Hot water available all the time. 

Within the hotel, there is a nice bar which is attended into late hours. The bar at the Shelbourne nearby. appears busier. 

There are two lounge areas, very welcoming, informal with open fireplaces constantly attended to. 

The Spa is adequate with a large swimming pool and steam room. Changing rooms are clean and have plentiful towels, robes and slippers. Did not use the treatment services but full range available. 

There are numerous restaurants in the hotel from casual dining in the cellar bar to more formal cellar restaurant. We tried the cellar bar one evening. The food was OK, nothing spectacular. I would go as far as saying probably the only disappointing element of the hotel in our experience. 

All in all a pleasant stay, we were sightseeing most of the time but nice to come back to a relaxing and comfortable hotel with polite yet discrete staff who were always on hand if you needed anything. 

",4,2014,10,26
200,A class of its own,"Loved this hotel which is in a class of its own. Fantastic location and just five minutes walk to Grafton street. My husband and I stayed for 5 nights and was actually sad to leave. From the moment you arrive to leaving the staff are very attentive catering to your every need. My husband and I had an amazing experience in the spa which was heavenly bliss. Irene was my therapist, certainly one of the best experiences of spas I have had. I will definitely be returning to the amazing hotel. Highly recommended with top class restaurants.",5,2014,10,25
200,Not snooty - just real attention to detail,"This is classic 5 star with lovely attention to detail. To our relief, the staff didn't look down their noses at us in the way we have seen at other 5 star hotels. They were warm and friendly. Our receptionist walked us to our rooms after check in. Our children found lovely fruit plates and smoothies waiting for them, colouring sets and even smaller sized bathrobes! There was an abundance of friendly and helpful staff, which unfortunately you do not always find in other 5 star hotels due to cutbacks. And it's so centrally located but without any major city centre noise.",5,2014,10,25
200,Perfect,"We LOVED this hotel. We arrived very early (about 9am) after flying all night to get to Dublin for the first part of our honeymoon. Despite our early arrival we were immediately let into our upgraded room, where we were able to take a nap before heading out for the day. 
The hotel manages to be traditional and historic feeling, while at the same time being modern and having everything you could possibly hope for. The room was beautiful, the bathroom was amazing, the bed was so comfortable. 
We were welcomed back to the hotel every evening by the lovely staff when we returned to the hotel. 
We tried the hotel restaurants, and ordered room service one night. The food was all delicious. 
Perfect location...right in the middle of everything, but still very quiet and peaceful at night. 
Would definitely love to stay here again, and we hope we are able to come back someday soon!",5,2014,10,22
200,Elegant,Just a great hotel that has fantasic attention to detail and a great personal touch.  Qualities sadly missing in some other 5 star hotels.  Staff are very attentive. It is also in a great location in the heart of Dublin.,5,2014,10,22
200,A class apart,"The Merrion is in a different league to its Dublin competitors and this in my view is due to the quality and training of its staff. It runs like clockwork and all staff members exude a calm confidence that they impart from the moment you walk through its front door. I have stayed at different times in The Shelbourne and in The Four Seasons, but for me The Merrion tops them both by a distance. The location of the hotel is excellent and makes a perefect base for exploring Dublin city centre. I highly recommend The Merrion.",5,2014,10,22
200,superb hotel,"Stayed here for one night and wish it had been longer. From arrival to departure everything was wonderful. Highly recommend this hotel. The food was excellent as was the service. As my husband and I were celebrating birthdays we were delighted to find in our room, cupcakes beautifully decorated with birthday greetings .",5,2014,10,21
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"I visit Dublin twice a year, and this time I decided to change the hotel, not by my own choice but due to the fact that my usual hotel was fully booked. So I decided to opt for The Merrion. Excellence all the way, the rooms are spacious, the staff are very very very helpful. I gained 2kg as the food was delicious and the spa is a must. The gardens are so peaceful you would not think that you are in the middle of Dublin City Centre, before I left I was lucky enough to enjoy a glass of wine on the courtyard. Although the hotel is slightly further to Grafton Street the walk is around 10mins who cares this hotel is perfect and you can always stop off for a glass of wine or coffee on the way. This is officially my favourite hotel in Dublin.",5,2014,10,21
200,Quiet Elegance,"We spent three luxurious nights in the Merrion Hotel.  We arrived early, tired and in need of freshening up.  The staff did everything possible to accommodate  us and make us feel comfortable while they readied our rooms as quickly as possible.  I have nothing but praise for every aspect of this hotel.  We can't wait for a return trip!",5,2014,10,20
200,Only one word 'SUPERB',"Simply one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in!  Food, service, rooms all to an exceptionally high standard.  The position of the Hotel is ideal with a short walk to Dublin centre and the Shops. The staff are of a very high standard, very friendly and there wasn't anything that was too much trouble.  If you want an EXCEPTIONAL meal the restaurant Patrick Gilbaud (spelling perhaps??) is well worth a visit. The room was very clean and with all the usual extras included in a hotel of this quality.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel!",5,2014,10,20
200,a wonderful stay in Dublin,"We stayed at the Merrion twice during our recent trip to Ireland, once at the beginning and once at the end of our travels.  Both of our experiences were wonderful.

After a long flight from the US, we arrived in Dublin around mid-day, before check-in time.  While we could not check in for a few hours, the staff made arrangements for us to shower and freshen up in the spa.  It was things like this that made the stays so enjoyable and relaxing.  The staff was always very pleasant and helpful.

The hotel is located only a few blocks away from Trinity, Grafton Street (shopping), a couple of nice parks, and many good restaurants, all within walking distance.  One could not ask for a better location.

In both cases, we had rooms facing the garden courtyard.  The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed.  WiFi is free and quite fast.

The hotel has an excellent spa and workout facility for guests.  There is plenty of exercise equipment, weights, and a very well-maintained pool.

We would definitely return here on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2014,10,19
200,Pure class,"This is a really nice hotel, nice relaxing areas for sitting reading newspaper and having a quiet drink. Bedroom was large and nicely decorated, really nice towels and robes. They even put a little towel on the floor each side of the bed with slippers on them. Bed was really comfy and room was quiet. The only thing was I am not a fan of aircon been on at night but the room heated up quickly so had to put it back on ( minor complaint). Nice size bathroom with that rarest of rare... A good sized bath...so rare these days. The staff are all so polite and helpful. That's it I am not staying anywhere else when in Dublin!!!!!!! Enjoy it !!!!!",5,2014,10,19
200,One of the best hotels in which I've ever stayed,"This hotel is terrific. We can say that since the moment we arrived well before normal check-in coming in early from the airport, until we left 4 days later.

When we checked in the hotel stowed our luggage and gave us ample space to pull some things from it for touring Dublin in the morning before our room was ready. We then had immediate access to the spa to freshen up from the long flight across the pond. We headed to the drawing room for a bite to eat; scones, tea, jams, etc. which hit the spot. By the time we were done, we were able to get into our room.

It's a terrific room, very comfortable. We have a good sized desk with chair, and easy chair with coffee table, tons of storage, a very comfortable king bed with two night tables, and a large bathroom with both a shower and tub. The room was spotless. The curtains can block out the strongest sunlight if you want to sleep in. The thermostat is easy to control. The Internet is included with the room, as is breakfast. The internet speed is good. I've been able to stream movies and TV from the US to my iPad with no trouble, from my media server. The rooms are quiet and if other guests get noisy then all you have to do is up the fan speed on the HVAC to drown them out. You hear no street noise a all from the rooms not facing the garden.

The housekeeping service is first rate. They are excellent and efficient. We get free bottled water each day and ice when desired. The gardens in the back of the hotel are beautiful and a great place to sit and read.

The hotel is centrally located amid many of the main sights of Dublin.

I can't recommend the Merrion more highly than I do.",5,2014,10,19
200,Beyond Fabulous,"This was the best hotel we stayed at, during our recent tour of Scotland and Ireland.  Beautiful rooms, gorgeous garden, wonderful pool, lovely staff and a great breakfast.  The location is also wonderful.  You can walk to two different parks within a couple of blocks--Merrion Square and St. Stephens Park.  You can also walk to any number of restaurants as well as the main shopping mecca.  Upscale, 5 star hotel--worth every penny.",5,2014,10,19
200,Fantastic hotel & location,"The Merrion was super fancy. Very clean, attentive staff, high quality service, fabulous food, gorgeous rooms. The location is perfect- easy walk to St Stephens Green, Grafton St, Trinity, Merrion Sq. Not far from O'Connell St. Nice local pubs nearby.",5,2014,10,19
200,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location.","Stayed here with friends at beginning of October and our stay was wonderful from the minute will pulled up at the door until they waved us off again! Check in was smooth and the staff we very polite and accommodating, we were shown up to our rooms by the manager.  We had arrived early and were able to check in because one of our rooms were ready.  Our bags were brought up by a pleasant young man and the room over looked the beautiful gardens.  Quiet and tranquil in the centre of Dublin.  Room was smallish but very clean. Bathroom was a good size and again, incredibly clean. The beds were so comfortable and I loved the little touches like the iPhone docking station on the clock radio. We went out for the afternoon and when we returned, our room had been turned down for the night. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the food was good.  Not great, but good.  Menu was very limited.  Starters and deserts were excellent but the choice and even the quality of the meat in the main course was somewhat disappointing.  The ambience in the hotel is lovely; open turf fires, comfortable lounges and friendly, efficient staff. The next morning we had breakfast in the hotel. Because there was 7 of us, we had to wait for them to prepare a table for us but when we did finally get into the restaurant, there was Plenty of fresh fruit and breakfast pastries but the cooked breakfast was a massive disappointment.  My friend ordered pancakes and they looked fabulous, I ordered the Irish breakfast and it was pitiful. There are some things I don't eat, I told waiter not to serve them but instead replace with other items.  He must not have heard the 'replace' bit.. But 1 sausage, one mushroom and one slice of bacon looks pretty miserable for a €26 breakfast!! So unless you eat everything served, just skip the breakfast and go out to one of the many cafés/restaurants! Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay; it was walking distance to grad ton street, easy to get to and had a beautiful atmosphere. I just think that next time I stay, I'll eat elsewhere.",5,2014,10,19
200,"They don't need my review/promotion, but it is, indeed, lovely!","The Merrion Hotel is well-known, amongst celebrities, politicians, and the elite. Given this, they don't need my review to promote others to stay there. However, when looking for a hotel to luxuriate, experience a local spot, and celebrate our last night of our 10-day journey through Ireland, I wanted to make sure that we were spending our time in a place well-worth the splurge, and the Merrion Hotel completely fit the bill. (FYI: we also considered the Marker, Shelbourne, Cliff Town House.)

From the moment we were greeted at the front steps by a traditionally clad bellman, upgraded to a suite by the receptionist (one of the great advantages of planning travel during shoulder season!), and entered our room to a plate of cupcakes decorated with ""congratulations"" (this trip is a celebration of some significant things in our life), the service exceeded our expectations. We had a first-floor garden-facing room, which was a warm space of understated opulence, including a turn-down service with slippers laid at both sides of the bed and a super comfy bed. I was initially reluctant to book at the Merrion based on TripAdvisor reviewer photos of the bathroom spaces (knowing that it's a historic hotel and given my personal standards of cleanliness), as the marble doesn't photograph well, and I was worried that it would be dated. Rest assured, the full marble tiled bathrooms are lovely, meticulously clean, and luxurious.

Between dining at the Michelin star restaurant L'Ecrivain (just a 10 min walk away from the Merrion), this was the perfect way to splurge (though it's not as much of a splurge price-wise as I had anticipated) and spend our last night in Ireland!",5,2014,10,18
200,Anniversary Treat,"From the time we arrived until the time we left everything was perfect,the welcoming staff at the door and reception to the housekeeping staff everyone was pleasant and nothing to much trouble.Well done The Merrion ",5,2014,10,18
200,Great option,"A Row of Town Houses converted into a modern hotel with comfortable rooms,a good restaurant and plenty more close by.Rooms are of a reasonable size.Not particularly luxurious but certainly good enough.",4,2014,10,16
200,Afternoon tea as a birthday treat!,"The Merrion 5star Hotel has been voted the top venue for Afternoon tea in Dublin city. I booked this as a treat for my  daughter and I to celebrate her birthday last Tuesday having not visited this hotel before I went on the recommendation  of their website and looked up other hotels in the area before going ahead and booking it. Tea is served in the drawing room full of old furniture  and paintings all a bit on top of each other and yes I know its what the place is known for, and while we were shown to a very small low table we were a bit surprised that not only was it within arms reach of two young men sitting in front of the open fire  it certainly was not satisfactory for a cosy mother and daughter chat so I requested to be moved to a better location in the room not realising that the adjacent room was much bigger and far more comfortable I have to say the waitress that attended to us was very helpful and no issues there. However  as our foodie treats began to arrive so did guests passing through in Spa dressing gowns, guests booking in and out with suitcases trundling past not to mention the staring looks we got from various people passing through was a bit of a distraction also as we were there to experience a once off! the other issue I would have is the toilets not very accessible  unless there is a lift for people who cannot manage the stairs....!!?
Now to the food while we were give a detailed description of everything to come including the Art Tea of which I was looking forward to the waitress omitted to say at the beginning that if we were unable to finish the dainties she would ""Box ""the remainder and we could bring them home. 
As like many other Tea timers we were on sugar overload by the time Art Tea arrived so we ended up actually bringing them home which was a real pity whilst we were given as much tea and coffee to drink it was not value for money in my opinion although the Art goodies were nice the next day with a cup of tea at home it spoiled the whole outing for us.",4,2014,10,16
200,Wonderful Hotel,"I was in Dublin for work so my wife came along as neither of us had been to Dublin before.
Arriving by cab from airport, the doorman greeted my wife by name as he opened the door of the cab. We spent the rest of the day wondering how he knew? This was the start of exemplary service throughout 3 days. Lunch in the central gardens was a joy, and when it looked as though it may rain we were moved to tables inside which the staff had already arranged. Altogether one of the best hotels I have stayed at, from the restaurant in the basement (which I preferred to the 2 star restaurant attached) to the relaxing bar upstairs, my wife recommends the cocktail ""Basil Crush""
served in a silver teapot and china cup. Worth every penny.",5,2014,10,16
200,No other place to stay in Dublin!,"The Merrion Hotel is a five star hotel which deserves ten stars!  We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived to the morning of our departure.  The hotel is beautifully decorated.  The staff is attentive and professional.  Daniel, the concierge, is the epitome of a hotel concierge who recommended great restaurants for us.  The location is fantastic, too, but out of the noise and bustle of the city.  I cannot recommend The Merrion enough.  Spend the extra money--it is truly worth it!",5,2014,10,15
200,Perfecto!,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel September 2014.  We were midway through our 4 country trip.  We had taken a bus (for the adventure of it all) from the Dublin Airport and walked from the busstop to the hotel.  We had on our backpacks and jeans, tired and hot.  We walked in and other customers were dressed very nicely and we felt out of place.  Though very proper, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We felt comfortable.  It turns out that the hotel is right across the street from the PM's office and other major government offices.  So that gives you an idea on the usual clientele.  (By the way, you can tour the govt bldgs by either invitation only or they do offer tours on the Saturday we were there.  Very interesting tour if you have a chance to do it).  

We walked into our room and let's say we were dazzled.  We've been in plush hotels before and though the room was not huge, this hotel deserves 6 stars.  It deserves it for the service, the detailed touches within the room, the turn down service in the evening. Everything. I felt so pampered after our trek from the bus stop.  Throughout our 5 day stay, every one of the staff we encountered were polite, friendly and professional.  I could feel the sense of pride they had about the hotel and that they wanted to make sure we got great service.  

Nice big tub, nice big separate shower.  They have instructions about controlling the temperature and if you feel you need extra warmth, please contact housekeeping for extra blankets or cashmere socks.  Cashmere socks, people.  It is a lovely, lovely hotel.  As we passed through the lobby to get to our room, patrons were having tea with tiered plates of cakes and sandwiches.  I definitely wanted to try that because it all looked so good, but we just didn't have time.  We were too busy with the Pub Crawls.  It is a little bit of a walk to Temple Bar, but that was okay.  It is close to St. Stephens Park with lots of activities such as bands and people watching galore.  

Another nice thing is the courtyard.  We discovered another way to our room through the courtyard instead of the halls and it is a beautiful setting with a unique sun dial in the midst.

This hotel is well worth the 5 stars rating.  The price is not outrageous and we feel it is well worth what we paid.",5,2014,10,14
200,Fabulous City Hotel,"We arrive at The Marrion at the end of a two week Ireland (South and North) golf vacation.  What a fabulous way to end our travels!  The staff is professional, warm, and courteous and we were welcomed warmly upon arrival.  The common areas of this hotel are comfortably elegant, like being invited into a friend or family member's beautifully decorated home.  The interior garden was unexpected and lovely.  We could just relax and refresh from the hustle of the city.  Our room was upgraded to a jr suite and was spacious, beautifully decorated, with lovely fresh flowers and fine art.  The marble bathroom was a very nice size, but no separate W.C. I cannot say enough good things about this wonderful hotel and will most certainly stay here again!",5,2014,10,14
200,Perfection,"Quality abounds, from the moment you arrive till you leave you feel warmly kept.
Beautiful older portion as well as newer garden area and rooms. Lovely sitting rooms with wood burning fireplace add to the ambiance.  Staff couldn't be more helpful, and terrific restaurants.
Five stars for a reason.",5,2014,10,14
200,for when it's time to push the boat out...This is the one,"As number one on Trip there was little doubt. The moment we arrived and the friendly men in top hats took our car and our bags there was a comforting certainty that this would be an experience to savour and remember. Our promised 'welcome amenity' arrived minutes after we did (we checked in early) meaning that we could take in the fabulous room with champagne in hand and toast our belated anniversary treat with a cupcake in the other hand. Most good things have already been said about this beautiful hotel and we can endorse them all. Most important for me is the staff's attitude. Always friendly, with genuine smiles and happiness to help. Goes a very long way. And the bed! Massive, with high quality threads and the best pillows we've ever slept on. Only thing missing for Mrs M was a jacuzzi so she didn't join me at the gorgeous pool. But had she seen the lovely relaxation area (loungers, fruit, papers, teas and flavoured waters) she'd have been there. Top marks for little touches which were everywhere and set this hotel apart from our other 5 star excursions. From sunny gardens to the 'family silver' on the breakfast table. This is well worth that little extra. Posh but not pretentious. We will visit Dublin less often now, since we will not be able to stay anywhere else!",5,2014,10,14
200,Getting tired,"A really nice location.  Charming hotel with very courteous service, good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately now getting very tired.  Rooms are in need of updating, bathrooms in particular.  The spa and pool are now in dire need of a refurb. Wifi is patchy. That said, a great breakfast and the restaurant is top notch.",4,2014,10,14
200,Enjoyable stay!,"Beautiful art, furniture and ambiance. The staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful and made our stay very enjoyable.  The spa is reputably top-notch as well. We enjoyed our holiday in here. We absolutely  got what we paid for.",5,2014,10,14
200,Not enough stars to give the Merrion!,"This is clearly one of the best hotels my husband and I have ever experienced, including a couple of Langhams, the Shelbourne in Dublin, and the Claridge in London.  Beautiful and spacious room, elegantly furnished.  So fresh-looking.  Huge bathroom.  VIew of courtyard was so peaceful.  Plus the staff is very friendly and eager to please.  We enjoyed the cellar restaurant for lunch and the bar on the ground for dessert.  The afternoon tea service looked bountiful and tasty, though we did not try it.  The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was fabulous, with a lot of nice touches.  We would like to give the Merrion more than 5 stars if we could.",5,2014,10,13
200,Calm and serene usually ,"I like how quiet it is here. There is not the frenetic activity that you see in the Shelbourne. However, they are doing construction and it echoes through the courtyard. A little annoying when trying to adjust from jet lag. Bathrooms are great. Tv is tiny. We must be in an Unrenovated room. Staff is very nice. Only other issue is the ventilation. It is so hot in our room even with the window open. I would stay again, probably. May try the westbury. ",4,2014,10,13
200,amazed,"Stayed here with my partner 4 weeks ago, as a treat he surprised me and wow.
The style of the rooms and layout was first rate, and the service delivered by the staff was effortless. We ate out on both nights but the dining areas had a electric buzz as we passed through.
Will stay again on our next vacation to Dublin.",5,2014,10,12
200,A perfect stay!,I treated my 26 year old daughter to a trip to Dublin recently. Our entire stay in Dublin was made perfect and memorable thanks to this perfect hotel! I felt as though I was staying in a friend's home rather than a cold hotel. It gave us a peek into Georgian homes of years ago with the added bonus of beautiful amenities. Comfort and elegance throughout the drawing rooms as well as in our accommodations. I agree with the fact that the most stellar attribute is the staff! They are all simply superb at what they do! Irish hospitality is at its best in this beautiful property. I can't thank the hotel enough for helping make a wonderful memory with my daughter. The location is perfect for walking everywhere. Great pubs and restaurants are right across the street. I could go on and on!!,5,2014,10,12
200,First class 50th birthday!,"Thank you so much for a very special birthday celebration!   The care, committment and thoughtfulness of all your staff, from the Concierge team (notably, but not exceptionally Tom), the Reception, room service, housekeeping and kitchen staff were superb.   It is the little touches that make The Merrion beat the competition - the surprise 'Happy Birthday' fruit platter on arrival for my wife and the filled ice box for her champagne gift.    We wouldn't have chosen to celebrate it anywhere else!   It's a shame there are a minority on Trip Advisor who don't appreciate first class when they experience it.  Thank you Mr MacCann",5,2014,10,12
200,Magnificent,We have had a truly wonderful time in this beautiful hotel. We were welcomed warmly and the staff were so attentive without being in any way intrusive. The food was delicious. Such a lovely treat. We will really look forward to returning here.,5,2014,10,11
200,Simply superb,"Stayed here years ago and I always remember it fondly. 

Now I know why. This hotel is one of the best. Quite simply you can't fault the staff, the rooms or the hotel. 

You step off Dublin streets into a calm oasis of perfection. Love this hotel!!

Make sure to bag a seat by one of the fires in the drawing rooms! No better way to relax at the end of a day. ",5,2014,10,11
200,An Oasis,"Have been staying here over a number of years. Never disappointed. Staff, food, rooms and especially the service is worth every penny..or should that be cent. Love all the attention to detail that you would expect from this establishment. Glad there is valet parking as the garage and allocated car space not for the faint hearted! There are lots of restaurants to choose from in the area.",5,2014,10,10
200,If there were 6 stars...this place would have them!,"We stayed there in September for 3 nights, and wish we could've stayed longer.  It is perfectly located.  The decor is fabulous...the best art in a hotel that I have ever seen.  The food in all the restaurants was all great.  But the best was the staff and all the amenities. All of the staff was so nice and helpful and very very eager to please. The room was very nice....again the amenities were unbelievable.  Wish there were more hotels in the world like this one!",5,2014,10,10
200,Beautiful,"Now I was only here for a afternoon and therefore didn't stay , however we will be staying when we return in March and June with a group , hence why I was there and didn't stay.

Lovely inside court yard and a beautiful reception area. From the outside the hotel didn't look much but then on reflection it is one of the smarter looking buildings in Dublin , great location not far from the train station opposite the government buildings and near a park.

Very much looking forward to returning to stay longer.",5,2014,10,10
200,Very hot bedding but superlative staff,"Staff and service are excellent, decor is stunning. Generally what you'd expect from a five star old world hotel. However the pillow and duvet were incredibly hot, with no separate sheet - didn't feel like asking at 3am though I'm sure it would have been provided. Cooked breakfast disappointing - dry potato bread and poached eggs tasted overwhelmingly of vinegar.",4,2014,10,10
200,First trip to Dublin and found best hotel!,"Beautiful, comfortable , centrally located and wonderful staff and good food.  Wish could have spent more days.  It is delightful, elegant and seems like home, wherever you are from.
June Caldwell/ Manhattan Beach, CA",5,2014,10,09
200,Top notch!,"Always try and stay here on my regular trips to Dublin but not always fortunate to get a room on days required. This place is just sublime.  Friendly, welcoming and service next to none.  No it's not the cheapest but for me, the best hotel in Dublin.  Five star. ",5,2014,10,09
200,Just Absolutely Can't Get Enough of this Hotel,"I LOVE The Merrion!  I say this with great delight as I sit in my plush bathrobe, in my comfy bed at The Merrion!  Having stayed here on multiple visits to Dublin, I had the opportunity to run this fine institution through the Pepsi challenge, so-to-speak, comparing it firsthand to The Shelbourne.  The Merrion was booked for the first leg of my trip, so I had to book elsewhere.  That said, The Shelbourne is nice (I note this in another review), but The Merrion is exquisite, and EVERYTHING is to perfection, ALWAYS.  I have never stayed anywhere else that has finer attention to detail- especially the housekeeping staff, has a more polite and caring staff, and offers amenities equivalent to what is offered here.  And, in comparison to The Shelbourne or the The Westbury, the price is reasonable.  

I also had the opportunity of partaking in the Afternoon Tea this go round.  The drawing room is lovely; however, that option was booked, so I had tea in my room, which was just a wonderful.  You get all of the goodies in the privacy of your room.  What's not to like?  

The Merrion is centrally located in a wonderful part of Dublin, and is centrally located to shopping (Grafton St.), wonderful food (see other posts), St. Stephen's Green, bus tours, etc.  Also, an added benefit is that heads of state and other glittery folks tend to stay here, so you might keep your eyes open for stargazing (I saw Stanley Tucci here in Feb of this year).  The concierge will make spot on recommendations for food, or tours, whatever you like.  There is a gym onsite, as well as a spa, pool and steam room.  If you are in Dublin, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.

Thanks again to The Merrion for truly making this my home away from home!",5,2014,10,06
200,Art Afternoon Tea,"Art afternoon tea in the Merrion is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. The cakes and sandwiches are beautiful and varied. The portions are generous and the tea and coffee list is extensive and you can try as many as you like. The art pieces are based on pieces of art that are housed in the hotel and are wonderful creations, very skillfully done. The setting is comfortable with big open fires. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable. At E35 per person it's the best value afternoon tea from any of the hotels in the city center. My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary and they we so welcoming. A must do if you want a little luxury on your visit to Dublin, the perfect complement to an afternoon in the National Art gallery which is just across the road.",5,2014,10,06
200,Faultless,"We recently had an amazing stay at The Merrion for our anniversay.  Everything about this hotel is wonderful from the reception rooms to the beautifully appointed bedrooms.  From arrival to departure, the staff are just so attentive, friendly and helpful.  The location is just perfect for a spot of shopping or a stroll through St Stephens Green.
I would recommend this hotel to everybody as it is just perfection.",5,2014,10,05
200,I Could Live Here Forever!,"The location of the Merrion Hotel can't be beat, but that is not the best thing about this hotel.  From the moment we walked in the door, we were warmly greeted and invited into a world of comfort and elegance.  This is a beautiful hotel.  We enjoyed wonderful meals and walks in the garden.  The art in this hotel is worldclass.  We found ourselves wandering around the building just to view the art.",5,2014,10,04
200,"Splurge a little, it's worth it","Great location close to museums and St.Stephen's Green. Wonderful restaurants nearby.  Very comfortable bedding.  Service, service, service, but not imposing, rather kindly. Lovely rooms for tea or drinks while chatting in comfort.",5,2014,10,02
200,Wonderful Stay,We recently stayed at the Merrion Hotel for 2 nights and had the most lovely time. The hotel is well situated in Dublin - very close to all the major attractions.  The rooms are large and comfortable.  The beds very nice.  The bathroom had a real shower and a tub - a plus for european rooms. The staff was always pleasant and helpful.  It was a most relaxing stay and we only wish we had been able to stay longer!,5,2014,10,02
200,A Sanctuary in Dublin City Centre,"Though we are locals, we decided to treat ourselves to a night at the Merrion to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We wanted someplace quiet and elegant with excellent service and amenities. The Merrion offered all of these - and so much more.

We'd booked spa treatments for earlier than the check-in time, which was no problem. The staff checked in our bags and registered us straight away before showing us to the spa, where we both enjoyed relaxing massages. The pre-registration made check-in a breeze; everything was ready as soon as we were. We were surprised with a complimentary upgrade, as the staff knew it was our anniversary (I'd included it in the notes section of the website when I booked). There was a beautiful plate of fresh fruit with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate platter - this is exactly the type of thoughtful touch that separates the Merrion from the rest.

The suite was spacious and perfect in every way: spotless, spacious and serene. I loved the fresh flowers and original works of art in the room, both lovely touches that made the space feel more like a home than a hotel. Our package included a bottle of champagne, which was chilling on ice when we walked in. The amenities were top class. The robes were soft and cosy and slippers wonderfully plush. 

We enjoyed drinks in the Cellar Bar, the hotel's cavernous bar - a must-see when you stay here. Though we chose to eat elsewhere for the evening, we returned for a nightcap and took our wine out to the lovely garden out back, as it was a balmy evening. With the twinkling lights on the garden trees and a beautiful view of the fountain, this was the perfect spot to end our celebratory evening, though we were tempted to sit by the fireplace inside the plush sitting room area of the hotel (we'll have to save that for a cold evening).  

Breakfast was served at the Cellar Restaurant the next morning and was absolutely perfect. Again, it's the small details that make all the difference: coffee served in real silver pots; white linen tablecloths; fresh fruit juices and lots of choices - both healthy and indulgent. Again the service was top-notch and flawless.

With so many party hotels in the area, the Merrion is a true oasis of calm and luxury. It's not flashy or brash; it's understated and regal without being pretentious. Though we're only a few miles away, we'll definitely be back - and will dream of it until our return!",5,2014,10,02
200,Perfect weekend getaway,"I booked The Merrion as part of a three night, weekend package with flights via Expedia and was not disappointed. Our trip was a surprise birthday getaway for my partner and from the second we crossed the road to go through the front door, we were blown away by the cheerful, friendly and extremely efficient staff. The room was wonderfully relaxing and the bed... Wow! Like sleeping on a cloud! We ate breakfast at the hotel and took advantage of both the Buffett and 'al la carte' menus, both of which had lots of choice and were offered up by lovely staff. We can also recommend the espresso martins that are served in the Cellar Bar in the evenings! The icing quite literally had to be the Art Afternoon tea however, which was perfect for a birthday treat. The grand yet relaxed atmosphere of the drawing rooms is the perfect setting to enjoy the delights on offer, all of which are inspired by the hotel's own private art collect. Thank you to the staff at The Merrion for making our short stay so enjoyable and we can't wait to come back.",5,2014,10,01
200,A TEN!,"Three nights of glorious care and surroundings!  4 old Georgian renovated houses make up this glorious hotel!
Very attentive staff..helpful with suggestions on restaurants and directions...
Quiet sleep in comfortable room...
It is number 1 for good reason!",5,2014,10,01
200,Perfect spot in Dublin,"We too booked a garden room and found it very comfortable and nicely furnished. The bathroom was incredibly spacious, the amenities lovely and the bed comfortable. But most impressive was the service. The staff at this hotel from housekeeping to reception was friendly, helpful and gracious at all times. They make the Merrion such a welcoming place to stay.

The location was perfect for sightseeing, for catching a tour bus and for dining nearby. The fact it was a few steps from both Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green was a bonus when craving some green space. We had dinner at Il Posto (http://www.ilpostorestaurant.com/) nearby as well as well as Chez Max (http://www.chezmax.ie/) Both very enjoyable.

Because of the steep price of breakfast (29 euros) at the Merrion my husband popped around the corner every morning to Insomniac for juice, coffee, yogurt and muffins. We actually really enjoyed relaxing with the newspaper in the room, getting ready for our busy days in Dublin. 

Oh, and we rode down the elevator on our last evening with Tony Bennett. That was a bonus.  :)",5,2014,09,30
200,Lovely Experience,"You will not be disappointed, everything was perfect. The Merrion held up to it's affiliation namesake ""Leading Hotels of the World"", point. And don't forget to spoil yourself at the 2 Michelin Star Restaurant on premises! You don't get that chance everyday.",5,2014,09,30
200,Everything you could want and some...,"My third stay - and it's an oasis in a mad world. Perfect old world charm and service in a luxury modern surrounding. 
Have moved from Shelbourne - which does have the best bar in any hotel I have been to - to The Merrion and won't be going back. 
Deserves it's #1 position ",5,2014,09,29
200,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Just here for one night... but we got incredible service, and had a beautiful stay.  This hotel is so beautiful, and comfortable for our first night after traveling for 24 hours.  The best, however, was the incredible service provided by Tomas!  He took our GPS to charge it over night, as we were unable to get it to charge in our room.  Great service!   Also, the Merrion Cellar Bar is cute and quaint, and serves great wine!",5,2014,09,27
200,Met all expectations.,"The Merrion provides a quiet spot in which to relax from days spent sightseeing in busy Dublin. It is within easy walking distance of Trinity College, the National Museum of Archeology, and the National Art Gallery.  We had a standard garden room and were most satisfied with it and with the services of all the staff with whom we had contact. Our room was quiet and well appointed. We had a very pleasant stay here; the hotel deserves its very fine reputation.  I was happy to receive fruit and chocolate upon arrival. That alone would almost be enough to bring me back!  ",5,2014,09,26
200,Lovely Hotel,"A fine establishment but they need to make sure that their advertised rooms are correct.  We booked into the Garden Wing expecting a view over their lovely gardens, but the room overlooked the rear lane. I would have given the hotel a 5 star rating, but felt that this was misleading.  The room itself was lovely and staff most welcoming.",4,2014,09,25
200,Out of this world - probably best hotel I have ever stayed in.,"We stayed in Merrion for 2 days in September.  Everything about it was exceptional:  the staff, the rooms, the extras, the food.  They are incredibly child friendly - a feature often lacking in luxury hotels.  The staff cannot do enough to please you - from running past you and your buggy to open a door, to anticipating your every need.  Pure brilliance.  The staff and management should be very proud of themselves",5,2014,09,25
200,Simply the Best,"The Merrion is a wonderful hotel offering first class service from arrival to departure, a beautifullly furnished place that oozed granduer... We recently stayed over for two nights on different days as we were touring, service was exceptional and the rooms and food matched this, we were not dissapointed...The location is ideal for walking as it is close to Grafton street which is where the shops are located and many restaurants...Just a very short walk to catch the tour bus that takes you all around the city.",5,2014,09,24
200,One night stay…….sadly.,"I love this hotel above all others. The warmth, welcome, friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at every level, is the best I've experienced anywhere in the world. The core of it is an old and historic town house, oozing Georgian comfort and grandeur but with every possible modern convenience. It is very well located, moments from St Stephens green, Grafton St etc. We didn't dine there this time but we have in the past and both their bars and restaurant are very highly regarded. If there is a negative it is the gym. You would be better off running around the lovely St Stephens Green.",5,2014,09,23
200,5 Star and Worth It,"We stayed two nights at The Merrion. The hotel is beautiful, the service impeccable, and the location is wonderful. We walked to all the places we wanted to see in Dublin and never used a cab until the trip to the airport for departure. If you want to begin or end your visit to Ireland on the highest note possible, this is it. The Merrion is simply the best in all rating factors.              P.G. Mississippi",5,2014,09,23
200,The Merrion goes above and beyond,"We stayed at the Merrion for three nights in August.  The hotel is located a few steps off the beaten path but still a short 10 minute stroll to Grafton St. as well as many other attractions.  The Merrion is charming!  We loved the wood burning fireplaces and the staff was friendly and quite accommodating.  There was plenty of variety at breakfast - the banana bread in particular was excellent!  We ran into a small issue while staying at the Merrion.  On Sunday August 31st, we needed to be in Galway by 11 a.m. so we made sure we were ready to go around 8 a.m.  Unfortunately, a crane had been brought in to install equipment on the roof and access to the garage (and hence our rental car) was blocked, and would remain blocked for at least two hours.    The staff believed they had notified all guests of this, however, we had not been advised in advance.  Peter MacCann, General Manager, took charge of the situation.  He co-ordinated the rental of another car.  One of the staff, Tommy, traveled with us by taxi to the nearest Hertz depot, arranged for the paper work for the new vehicle, and waited until we departed the Hertz depot for Galway. We managed to make it to Galway in time and all was well.  We truly appreciated the effort made by Mr. MacCann and the staff at the Merrion to rectify the situation.  We understand that mistakes happen and we were grateful that every effort was taken to ensure that a bad situation was made better.  We would definitely recommend the Merrion!  World class service!",5,2014,09,22
200,Beautiful hotel in Dublin,We came to Dublin in late August 2014.  The hotel is located in a townhouse.  It is lovely and charming. The service in the hotel was fabulous.  If there is any negative to say it is that the concierge is lacking.,5,2014,09,21
200,One of the best hotels I have stayed in globally,"As someone who has travelled across the world and enjoyed some great hotels including high service levels in Asia I was curious as to whether The Merrion would live up to the reviews from my colleagues. It did that and some. The highest quality service which was attentive without being too much, high quality modern facilities all combined with genuine character.

My room was large, the bed was huge and comfortable. The temperature was well maintained. Bathroom was very functional but also had character. The Cellar bar was a great spot for a glass of wine and catching up on work and the chef was flexible (I am vegetarian). Also had a formal work dinner in a private room and that was superb.",5,2014,09,21
200,Great place for afternoon tea .,"Had afternoon tea here with my 2 friends . It is so relaxing and staff very pleasant . Food superbe and so artistic . I would highly recommend it .The  cakes are based on paintings hanging in hotel . 
Anna Dunne",5,2014,09,20
200,Perfect End to a trip to Ireland,"This was our last stop on a 10 day golf trip to Ireland. We hadn't stayed at the Merrion before. The experience was exceptional. This hotel is every bit as good as any 5 star hotel that we have stayed at in the world.The staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. The facilities are beautiful. Breakfast was very nice. The Cellar Bar was very friendly and dinner in the Cellar restaurant was outstanding.",5,2014,09,20
200,Probably 5 star rating but I didn't spend enough time there!,"I stayed for one night but wished it had been longer! It was so nice and it is so long since I have been to Dublin, it has made me think it would be a good venue for NYE.
From the moment of arrival until I checked out everyone was very helpful. I was tired on arrival and was pleased check-in went smoothly. The bars and restaurant were very inviting (always important when you are travelling alone). Unfortunately I had to check out the next morning - but I will be back!",4,2014,09,20
200,First Rate,"We stayed here two nights on a TA recommendation.  It didn’t disappoint.  The hotel is well located in the central part of the city.  You can walk to Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area, but the hotel is on a quiet street.  There is a Green Bus stop very near by.  Breakfast was good, but make sure that you confirm with the front desk if it is included in your room rate.",5,2014,09,16
200,Amazing hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  The staff was friendly and very professional.  They couldn't be more accommodating and helpful.  If we ever make it back to Dublin, I would definitely stay there.  It was a wonderful experience!",5,2014,09,16
200,The place to stay in Dublin!!,"Great location, excellent customer service, lovely room. What more can I say. We recently enjoyed 3 nights at The Merrion Hotel and highly recommend it. The location enabled us to walk to a lot of the historical sites and we were only a block away from St Stephens Green.  Many fine restaurants were also within walking distance. The service at the hotel was above par. We enjoyed being pampered by all of the staff. Hope to return again!!",5,2014,09,16
200,Spectacular hotel,"Two nights at this hotel were not enough; I wish I could have stayed longer.  It is lovely (located in a row of Georgian townhouses), the staff is excellent, and the room my husband and I had was perfect: beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and exceptionally clean.  The hotel also is ideally located for sightseeing in Dublin's city center.  I'd make a trip to Dublin just to stay at The Merrion!",5,2014,09,15
200,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed on night on a romantic getaway we had an upgrade from the reception to a suite all I can say is WOW we overlooked the gardens and Leinister house on the other side every thing from the service to the surroundings to the F and B was incredible and truly 5 star many thanks to the team there.,5,2014,09,15
200,First class in every way,"Our group of 30 stayed here at the end of August. We had been recommended the Merrion by contacts in Dublin and could not have been happier with our experience. The staff, rooms and location are faultless. The Cellar Bar & Restaurant are housed in the old wine cellars which are centuries- old and brimming with atmosphere. Would have liked to try the one- starred French Restaurant ""Patrick Guilbaud"" but didn't manage a visit on this occasion. The great traditional pubs nearby such as Doheny's and O'Donoghue'' proved too much of a distraction! A top- tier 5 star property. Recommended.",5,2014,09,14
200,"Quality hotel, quality service, excellent location","The Merrion has everything a person could hope for in a 5 star hotel.  The doorman greets you, the concierge staff is kind and extremely helpful, and every employee has a smile and a greeting as you pass in the hall.  The service is extremely professional and courteous, while friendly and personal. The rooms are lovely and well appointed even though we are in the least expensive offered. We had a spacious room with an easy chair and writing table and the bed was fabulous. The bathroom was large with lots of space to spread your things out. The breakfast is beautiful and recommend you include it with your stay. 

Located near Merrion Square, there is a Hop On, Hop Off bus stop just down the street and you can easily walk to Grafton Street with its shops and street musicians, as well as Temple Bar area with it's easy pub atmosphere. The National Museum is just a couple minutes walk and the hotel itself is about a 20 minute taxi to the airport.  It was an extremely positive experience and a wonderful base from which to explore Dublin.",5,2014,09,13
200,Lovely and classic,"Our two nights at the Merrion was wonderful in every way, from the welcoming birthday fruit and chocolate, to the ungodly-early help with our bags and taxi departure. Our dinner at the attached Michelin restaurant was fabulous in terms of both food and service. This was an elegant experience in an old-worldly, class way.",5,2014,09,11
200,The Merrion,"Lovely hotel in every way!  Convenient location, friendly service and a beautiful room made our stay a wonderful one.  We arrived early in the morning and every effort was made to find and make ready a room for us.  We would stay here again for sure.",5,2014,09,10
200,Pass on the cellar restaurant--as well the hotel,"We stopped into the Cellar for lunch with a reservation. It was empty. 4 staff members to 4 guests and we were still treated as an inconvenience. For an empty restaurant in a crowded city it seems they can ill afford such behavior. 

Terrible service and will never return. If this is how they treat guests in a restaurant, I'd hate to see how they manage guests of the hotel.",1,2014,09,09
200,"This Hotel has ""it"" Factor","So how do I define the ""it"" factor? What is it that could distinguish this hotel from others with the same number of stars?
For me it is the transformation from the street to the hotel's heart - elegant facade, unpretentious, direct from the pavement/sidewalk. Directly into a classic, elegant room which has the important function as the HQ for the very effective concierge team. It transforms into the Reception, now closer to the hotel's heart with more softness of the deep, welcoming sofas and ever-smiling staff.
Further it moves into superbly elegant lounges, with log-burning fires, the smell mingling with those from freshly-brewed teas to accompany the stands of sandwiches and cakes. It then migrates into the gardens, the heart, with their greeness and freshness surrounding you as you walk towards your room. It is then you maybe notice the artwork, if you hadn't noticed it already.
That is how I describe my ""it"" factor - what will yours be?",5,2014,09,09
200,"Wonderful hotel, but ONLY good hotel booked during a 12 day trip through Scotland and Ireland with Abercrombie and Kent","We just returned from a twelve day land tour of Scotland and Ireland, booked through luxury company Abercrombie and Kent. Thank goodness for the Merrion, which turned out to be the ONLY good hotel booked during the entire trip. Frankly, our eleven couples were sad to leave the property, as we were already a week into our trip and had been sadly disappointed in every single property up until then. 

The Merrion is a fine property, conveniently located, with an excellent staff and well-appointed rooms. It is a short walk to many of the best places in the city, in a safe part of town, and the staff is well-trained to guide any visitor through their needs. 

I regularly stay at Five Star properties, and I was very satisfied with this hotel, which met and exceeded my needs. I would highly recommend the property. 

The Merrion is an older property, but it is well-kept, and it will remain one of the classic places to stay in all of Dublin. Of the many places we stayed during our tour of Scotland and Ireland, it is the ONLY hotel I will review, as I cannot blame the other properties for delivering less than I'd expected. Frankly, I blame A&K for putting us at any of those hotels. For the money we spent on this tour, I was shocked that they'd selected these inferior places, particularly for a tour company that bills itself as a luxury company. Either they didn't vet the hotels, or they simply didn't care, and if I had to select one over the other, I think they didn't care. 

Perhaps this is why of our eleven couples, not one had ever booked on an A&K tour before. A coincidence? I think not. 

So, if you're traveling on your own, I give a strong recommendation for this hotel. If you're considering traveling with a group, avoid A&K like the plague.

By all means, feel free to email if you have any additional questions about A&K. I am NOT typically a complainer (see my other reviews), but this was past the pale. I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND not booking with A&K. I realize that some of their trips might be excellent, but for the money we spent, I'd rather not even have to think about it.",5,2014,09,08
200,Comfortable hotel,"This was my first trip to Dublin; we chose the hotel for its central location and good ratings.  Check in was fast, we were given a warm welcome by reception,and  our rooms were ready even though we arrived early.
 The main reception rooms are beautiful, afternoon tea is popular the lounges tend to become crowded,  tables are set aside for hotel guests. My friends and I had tea every day, it was delicious. Our only disappointment   was an early   supper, our  asparagus salad and smoked salmon were not very good.
My room was clean and comfortable, I slept soundly, the toiletries are wonderful, Asprey, a real treat. I made use of  the spa, my masseuse was excellent, and very friendly like everyone else at  the Merrion.  I hope to return next year.",5,2014,09,07
200,A wonderful and elegant city hotel,"The Merrion is an absolute delight.  It is elegant, charming, full of Irish hospitality and perfectly situated for a city hotel.  The room was lovely and spotlessly clean.  The communal areas are beautifully furnished.  Breakfast was excellent with lovely service.  The only criticism I have is that although friendly, the concierge services we experienced did not appear terribly knowledgable. For example, they sent us to a lunch place that was closed! That said, we would not hesitate to recommend it and would certainly stay there again",5,2014,09,07
200,Lovely hotel,"Gorgeous hotel, lovely rooms, service good. Restaurant downstairs lovely. Breakfast delicious.

The only gripe is it's very discreet - found it hard to find - signs would have been helpful. 

Otherwise a really lovely hotel. Would definitely return",5,2014,09,06
200,Extraordinary!,"On our first trip to Dublin we decided to treat ourselves and start somewhere classy and central for the first night. After checking in we quickly regretted not booking for the entire 4 nights we had in Ireland. This is by far the most elegant, service-minded and warm hotel I have ever set foot in!

Upon arrival our room was not ready (we were an hour early) so we dropped our bags and walked out for a quick coffee. When we returned we were told that we had been upgraded, which was an unexpected treat. Our king room was beautiful and spacious with a wonderful view of the garden and water-feature, and a crib had been provided for our little one, and made with gorgeous bedlinen and equipped with a bathrobe and toiletries! The bathroom was nice and well stocked with lovely Asprey toiletries.

One of our reasons for booking was the hotel pool, and it was well worth a visit (two in our case)! The pool area was calm and clean, and the shower room well equipped with towels and high quality toiletries.

We had a drink and a nibble in the cellar bar, and had dinner and breakfast in the room, and on every occasion the food was tasty and delivered promptly.

Apart from the hotel itself being beautiful, the food great and our room lovely we couldn't put our finger on what was different about this hotel at first, but after a while we figured out that it was the staff! Every person we met had an amazing ability to make us feel welcome which isn't always the case when you come with a toddler in tow, but they all genuinely appeared interested in providing great service as well as a smile! It was brilliant!

We are already hoping to be able to return one day!",5,2014,09,05
200,Exquisite city hotel,"My mother and I stayed at the Merrion. My Mom mostly uses a wheelchair and they were very attentive to her needs. The hotel is beautiful, the service impeccable and the fool excellent. We were well taken care of!",5,2014,09,04
200,The Best,"Had a recent 4 night stay, has become a yearly must for me. Booked a  King size room overlooking the lovely garden. The experience from being greeted at the entrance to the final check out is, as always, a real pleasure. The room and bathroom were spacious and the window opens (not always the case in some hotels) to allow fresh air and the scent from the garden below.
This is a true 5 star hotel but attracts an informal approach, not pretentious at all. 
The location is great with many local pubs and good restaurants within a few minutes walk.
Did not dine at the hotel's Patrick Guilbaud restaurant this time but having been there in the past it is worth splashing out, a real experience.
Looking forward to my next stay",5,2014,09,04
200,The jewel in Dublin's crown,"On a short visit to Ireland for a wedding in Kilkenny, we spent a day in Dublin and had the chance to sample the joys of staying at The Merrion.  It's like stepping into an older, far more genteel, and utterly gracious world.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the gardens, the service was as attentive and warm as one could ever want (including the charming gent who brought us coffee and the world's best toast at 5 AM so we could catch our flight), and the feeling of being truly cosseted from the moment we checked in.  The location is perfect for a delightful walk through Dublin -- and, on top of all that, we were two flights up from the door to Patrick Guilbaud, a culinary experience that should not be missed.  All in all ... perfection.  We are already planning our return.",5,2014,09,03
200,ALMOST SUPERB,"Loved the property except for the adjoining room. If it had been an individual room, I would give this property six stars.
Front desk staff was not able to change my room. Told hotel is fully booked up. My loss.
Drawing rooms with fire places are perfect for tea, an evening of lite dinner or just coffee and dessert. 
My room, 215 was gorgeous and the staff is perfectly attuned to guests needs. 
Food in the Cellar restaurant was very good. Continental breakfasts were a bit skimpy.
Too bad it rained my whole stay, I would have loved to eat outside in the garden.
The art work in the hotel is amazing.",4,2014,09,02
200,Joey D,Very accommodating. Has to be one of the best hotels in Dublin Ireland. Very nice rooms. Service was excellent in all aspects. Very centrally located. Can not wait to revisit again. Highly recommend this hotel.,4,2014,09,02
200,The finest hotel and the center of it all in Dublin,"I was visiting Dublin and had the Merrion Hotel recommended to me. This is a beautiful hotel located in the heart of Dublin and within easy walking distance to all of the major sights.  The staff is outstanding, friendly and helpful. The hotel is spacious and welcoming with immaculate and large rooms. They have a wonderful bar and restaurant and a garden where you can use their bikes for free to peddle around town.  I will note that unlike most European Hotels of this caliber, breakfast is not included in your room price and it is quite pricey.  If you are not inclined to enjoy the buffet, you can find a bite to eat at some local bistros around the corner including a wonderful coffee place just next door.  I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend the hotel to any type of traveler, business or pleasure.",5,2014,09,02
200,"Merrion, where have you been all my life?!","I come often to Dublin for business and usually stay at the Gibson (which is an amazing place as well) but this time I arrived with my boyfriend and we decided to stay at The Merrion as it was our anniversary. These two nights were simply amazing. On arrival we were welcomed by the lovely Anna who as soon as she heard we are there for a special occasion got us an upgrade which was a really nice touch. The room was amazing, comfy beds, tea-coffee facilities, all sort of toiletries and a huge bathroom (gotta say I spent there way too much time as I enjoyed it so much:). There was also a bottle of Baileys and some chocolate brought to the room shortly after we arrived, and the waiter who brought it wished us happy anniversary. Turn down service is excellent as well as the daytime cleaning, our room looked spotless all the time. The only little thing that could be improved is the minibar, which was well-stocked but the fridge was dirty and leaking, looked kinda gross. Everybody whom we met on the corridors, reception, concierge smiled at us and on many occasions we were called by our names. (still trying to figure out how can they remember, wow) 
We did not have breakfast in the restaurant as we went for the room service option and Sarah Jane - our waitress on both mornings - was one of the nicest girls I have ever met. Chatty and with so much positive energy I barely needed my coffee to wake up after having her in the room, the perfect way to start a morning. Both evenings we had dinner in the hotel, on one occasion in the Cellar Restaurant and the next evening in the Cellar Bar. The food was just amazing with plenty of coeliac options, including gluten-free bread selection and most of the dishes were available gluten-free as well. My steak was cooked to perfection and the dessert selection was amazing as well. The service of course was great, special thanks to our waiter, Lucia who really went out of his way to accommodate all my dietary requirements. He was also funny and available when needed but not intrusive. On our last evening we decided to go a bit casual so we went to the bar of the hotel for a quick dinner. There I had the burger (which is available with a gluten-free bun) and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. My other half had the seafood tower which he complemented a lot too. But what made our last evening really special was not the food but the service provided by this lovely Hungarian girl, Nicolette. Her knowledge of food, wine and whiskey is lexical and she really made us feel special. My advice would be if you go there ask to be served by her. When we told her we are here for our anniversary she got us a beautiful bowl of strawberries and cream with a ""Happy Anniversary"" writing on the slate, even though we didn't order dessert as we were stuffed it was such a nice touch.
Is the place pricey, yes. But it is worth every cent as you are treated like royalty. Can't wait to come back, thank you very much Merrion and the staff for making our anniversary so unforgettable.",5,2014,09,01
200,Great Location and Fine Hotel,"As we traveled in Ireland we had the need to stop in Dublin to attend various sporting events. Using both private cars and taxis I can say these must be the friendly people in the world.The hotel is nicely done with separate shower stalls plus tubs. The central location places you near the center of Dublln in walking distance. The staff is superb and will accommodate your every need. The concierge made all the reservations and appointments we asked them to make in a prompt and pleasant manner.While not a plush hotel, I would rate it 4 star, the totally of accommodations and outstanding staff makes this a great place to stay in Dublin.",4,2014,08,31
200,Gorgeous Service and Staff*Beautiful and Tasteful!,"My husband and I return to venues that offer superior service and amenities. The Merrion is a beautifully maintained hotel and management must encourage their staff to be gracious, helpful and happy!  Sumptuous and bountiful breakfast buffets that accommodate any palette.  Away from St. Stephen's Green crowds and cars/taxis--quiet and dignified!
A gem!",5,2014,08,31
200,Elegance at The Merrion,"We recently spent a fantastic weekend at The Merrion. We joined very well travelled friends from Switzerland who were in Dublin for a birthday celebration. We all agreed that The Merrion is the best city hotel we have stayed in anywhere. We received such a warm welcome from the concierge and check-in staff - a very nice start to a special occasion. We would like to extend a huge thank you to all the staff at The Merrion for making our stay so comfortable and memorable. We had a beautiful, elegant room in the main house of the hotel, with magnificent Georgian high ceilings with exquisite cornicing.   The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the marble bathroom was spacious and spotlessly clean.  We suggested The Merrion hotel to our friends as they are great art enthusiasts and it was a great pleasure to introduce them to the Merrions magnificent collection of Irish art by some of Ireland's finest artists. We loved the elegant and comfortable drawing rooms with their open fires where one can sit and relax and indulge in afternoon - sheer bliss!  After breakfast we took a stroll  out into the beautiful garden which is exquisitely planted and an oasis of tranquility right in the heart of Dublin city.  We cannot say enough good things about the Merrion and the staff. We loved staying there and feel proud that there is a hotel of this exceptionally high standard in Dublin.",5,2014,08,30
200,When 5 stars mean 5 stars,"Sometimes older properties that have been renovated into ""nice"" hotels just don't cut it. Not the Merrion. These lovely Georgian townhouse in downtown Dublin are lovingly restored and the facilities are first class. But it only gets a 5 star rating because of the staff.  Polite and attentive at every turn. Breakfast is generous, the restaurant very good and the garden is lovely. One of those hotels where it's good just to spend a bit of time kicking back. Nice!",5,2014,08,30

Top class service and hospitality. We had spent 4 months travelling through Europe and the Mediterranean. Dublin was the last stop to visit friends and family and we were glad we picked the Merrion, it was a perfect way to end our holiday.",5,2014,08,30
200,Great Dublin location for walking to all main attractions including restaurants and pubs.,"The Merrion is just good, old fashioned elegance. From the service staff including bellmen, concierge, check-in, housekeeping, bar and restaurant staff, to the rooms to the grounds to the restaurants and bars. All fantastic!  The location is ideal for walking to Trinity, St Patrick's, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, Guinness (truly the best tasting anywhere)  and anywhere in-between. Get a horse a buggy back from Guinness. An education in itself. Would definitely return to the Merrion!",5,2014,08,29
200,Excellent Hotel 5 * all the way,"Great stay at this hotel for a couple of days, the rooms are what you would expect nice big bathroom. 
The staff couldn't do enough for you, try to have the afternoon Tea was delightful to sit the drawing room, would definitely return.",5,2014,08,29
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"When we think of a first class property, only one name is fitting The Merrion!  We have stayed at The Merrion about 5 times and will return in September on our way back to the US.  The staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home.  The ambiance is very elegant.  Everything about the hotel is perfect and we always look forward to returning.  The Cellar bar and restaurant as well as Patrick G restaurant are all wonderful!",5,2014,08,28
200,Great Hotel in Excellent Location,"Really enjoyed staying in the Merrion recently.  The hotel staff was very welcoming.  The room was well appointed and the bathroom was spacious, with a super shower.  We had a special rate which came with a view across the lane to a brick wall.  Oh well, can't have it all.  There is a wonderful garden courtyard and it would have been nice to have overlooked the garden.

 Our only quibble was that the pillows weren't the most comfortable one too thick, the other not supportive enough - but I am sure that would have been corrected if we had pursued the matter.

The location is superb.  Close to the things we wanted to see and Dublin is very walkable.

Unqualified recommendation.",5,2014,08,27
200,Truly 5 star in an unbeatable location,"Just back from a trip to the Merrion which once again showed how a 5 star hotel should be run. The service levels are exceptional and staff really go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. The hotel itself is a special place, the reception areas have a  real ""wow"" factor with fine art and furnishings and a luxe feel, but the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. Even when the hotel is full, it is an oasis of calm in a great city centre location. Rooms are beautifully decorated, quiet, with complimentary magazines and bottled water. Beds are supremely comfortable, and the breakfasts are nearly worth a visit alone. But it is the staff which make the real difference here, with a genuine interest and enthusiasm throughout. I've stayed in many Dublin hotels and this is consistently the best.",5,2014,08,27
200,Always wonderful,"Another amazing visit to our 'go-to' Dublin destination. The hotel is fabulous, welcoming and has an undeniable charm. 
Having stayed here for 14 years we now feel we return as friends.  The little touches are what sets The Merrion head and shoulders above the others.",5,2014,08,26
200,Fantastic Service,"We stayed at the Merrion for 4 nights recently. This was our first trip to Dublin. All of the hotel staff worked as one and the service was very uniform and consistent throughout our stay.  Very friendly and helpful at all levels.  James and Shawn (Sean) were very helpful at the concierge desk providing answers to our many repeat questions as to directions, restaurant choices, tours and taxi service.  The room service personnel were very prompt when we needed additional water and providing early morning (515 am) breakfast that was accurate as ordered.  The front desk helped us by providing a $200 cash advance since we were short on euros and this was convenient to avoid having to travel to a bank.  My wife and I enjoyed the afternoon coffees and pastries.  We dined at the Cellar restaurant several times and the service and food was also excellent.  The room was always very clean and tidy and the bathroom was spotless and the complimentary shoe shine service was good. We noticed the staff wiping down the door frames for dust in the hallway during the day.  This impressed my wife who is very particular on cleaning.  We had visited Rome and Paris on our vacation prior to arriving in Dublin and out of the three hotels the Merrion hotel was the best as to quality of the room and service for the price.  We would highly recommend them.  Also, the location was convenient to the Museum of Ireland (very nice) and many good restaurants and was a short walking time (15 minutes) to many shopping opportunities nearby.",5,2014,08,26
200,wonderful hotel,"I took my wife for her birthday for a four night stay in a superior garden room

the hotel was excellent the facilities were exceptional and the staff were very helpful

would not hessitate to visit again

the final night was somewhat spoilt by the guests of a minor celebrity'd daughters wedding swearing and abusing the staff but this was hardly the hotels fault",5,2014,08,26
200,Wow!,"Amazing from start to finish, booked in early as we were having lunch at Patrick Guilbauds restaurant and everything went smoothly, from our car being parked to bags in the room everything was seamless. Hotel facilities outstanding, room was luxurious and turn down service was excellent. Breakfast was outstanding and our server Claudia (I believe) made it even more special as it was my partners birthday and surprised him with a small birthday cake. Spa and leisure facilities were unbelievable it's the small touches that make this place so special and definitely worthy of more than 5 stars. Overall this was one of the best hotel experiences we have had so far and will definitely be returning.",5,2014,08,25
200,Very nice place but lack of charm,"We stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights in August and although our general comment is very positive we were slightly disappointed with our stay.
The Merrion is a rather big place since they have that new building over the garden. We had booked a junior suite in the older building looking for some charming old Georgian atmosphere which we didi not really found in the hotel except in the lobby and drawing rooms downstairs.

We were upgraded to a suite on the upper floor in the old building. Good size drawing room but smaller bedroom with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is not excellent: very clean with many towels but very small and ill placed no mixer taps for the 2 washbasins (you can hardly wash your hands), noise when filling the bathtub, shower with shower head only.

Also I was surprised to see the vacuum cleaners left  in the corridors to our suite, day or night, always there, as if there was no other place for storing the cleaning equipment.

Breakfast is very good as for the quality of the food and everything they can cook whatever you want. But we did not like the breakfast room in the basement, no natural light, very far from our room with very many people and too much noise and activity in my opinion.",4,2014,08,25
200,Called in for Best brunch ever,"We were in Dublin and called to The Merrion Hotel for some brunch in The Cellar Bar. We had fish and chips with the minted mushy peas for 20 euros each. It was very tasty and worth the money. Shane, Rachel and Phil went out of their way to give us five star service. They made us feel so welcome. I definitely would recommend a visit to The Merrion.",5,2014,08,25
200,Wow 5 star plus,This is most definitely one of the best hotels 5 star plus.  From the moment you arrive the door staff the reception staff are absolutely fantastic you will not find any faults here. We got to our room which was beautiful the view not great when I mentioned this to the the wonderful reception staff Caroline front of house manager and they apologised and upgraded us to a magnificent suite 114/116 which we are in now had dinner in the cellar restaurant more wonderful staff. I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in this area and believe me they could most definitely come here and see how real 5 star hotels do it. Staff.food.room.spa.just the whole stay from start to finish unforgettable.  5 star and more. Can not say enough good things about the merrion I want to stay here and never leave.  Excellent,5,2014,08,24
200,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion on my first trip to Dublin, and it was the perfect choice. 

Great location within walking distance of the centre and transport links. Booked a room in the Garden Wing, looking out onto the central gardens, which was lovely and quiet. 

The room was a good size. There was plenty of storage, the bed was really comfortable, and there was a nice seating area by the window. Bathroom was large and very clean. 

The staff were polite, friendly, and helpful. The seating areas downstairs were lovely, and the pool in the spa area looked great. Would definitely try and stay here again if I go back to Dublin",5,2014,08,23
200,Superb hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in August . Superb polite efficient ( but understated )  service by all staff from doormen, housekeeping, reception , spa, restaurant etc. 
Took wrong lift  one day to the spa and ended up in car park. Member of housekeeping , who had just gone off shift and was on way home , took me on short cut back into hotel and to the spa. Could just as easily have ignored me or just opened door and said ""go through there"".
Afternoon Tea was relaxing and just perfect ,  visiting friends were hugely impressed.
Will stay again and highly recommend  The Merrion  .",5,2014,08,22
200,Best hotel in Dublin,Our family traveled to The Merrion in Dublin with three children and stayed for a long weekend. We never wanted to leave! They sent the kids little gifts like chocolate covered fruit and smoothies and provided them with little robes and slippers. They truly enjoyed all the small touches. The hospitality was exceptional! The room was one of the best I've ever stayed in...my husband and I would love to go back for a grownup visit! Great restaurants are located in the hotel and a lively street with more food and shopping are within walking distance.,5,2014,08,22
200,"Lovely stay, excellent location","Stayed here in July, 2 connecting rooms, classic style in line with the building. Rooms are comfortable and fairly spacious, good size bathrooms with separate shower, but only 1 sink. Toilet plumbing leaves to be desired (takes a long time to refill) but it's an old building I guess. Staff is super lovely and friendly. Breakfast buffet is not the best in my opinion, would expect more fruits, more cold cuts, it's a little scarce for this type of hotel although additional dishes can be ordered (several at extra cost making it slightly too pricey for what it is as the buffet itself is too limited for this size of hotel). Hotel has a lovely garden, friendly and helpful concierge staff (with lots of nearby dinner suggestions), hotel is within walking distance of all the sites and parks so no need for taxis or anything. Indoor swimming pool, small gym, spa, with friendly and helpful staff. Cannot fault much although the upkeep of an old building should always be a high priority. Child friendly, kids menu, connecting rooms, gifts and robes, highly recommended.",4,2014,08,20
200,A piece of heaven.,"We stayed here for two nights in July, on my sisters recommendation.  It was absolutely wonderful from the moment we pulled up in the taxi to the moment we left. There is little I can add to all the previous wonderful reviews on all the merits of the Merrion, but I just have to say something about it !!!  It is a very relaxed comfortable almost homely feel place. It exudes warmth and friendliness in a most underrated and natural way.  The staff were remarkable from doorman to front desk to the cellar restaurant, each with their own personality and professionalism.  Rooms were beautiful, beds so comfy and linens and towels luxurious.  We were just in Dublin for two days ( visiting form the USA) so we had many friends and family in Ireland come to see us in the hotel. They were treated as royal and loyal guests and their cars taken care of while they visited.  We had dinner in the Cellar restaurant and this was truly great and very delicious. Unfortunately we never made breakfast, ( jet lag and late nights!!) but my sister assured me it is wonderful.  I would highly recommend the Merrion, it is almost like staying in a beautiful private home. I hope to return one day and I will not tell any of my friends and family I am there so I can just relax and enjoy this ""piece of heaven"" in Dublin City.",5,2014,08,20
200,Lovely first trip to Dublin!,"We traveled to Dublin for the first time as a family in August 2014 and stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights. What a great introduction to Dublin, we loved it! Our kids - ages 8, 11 and 12 enjoyed the incredible location and walking around the city. The rooms were incredibly well-appointed, the beds comfy and the hotel was quiet and perfect for a good night's sleep. Beyond that - the decor is so well done (for those who look out for those things) - really, really pretty! The location relative to downtown Dublin was perfect -we were able to enjoy St. Stephen's Green and all of the city's amenities. Oh, and the breakfast at the Merrion is delicious! We hope to be back soon, thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2014,08,19
200,Just had a great stay,"Great location, room was excellent as was the bath.  We had a wonderful stay, with excellent and very accommodating and informed staff.  The location is central but delightfully quiet and secure. Would go again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,08,19
200,Such a Charming Hotel,"A lovely introduction to Dublin.  The fireplaces and the decor created the warmth that I had hoped for in Ireland.  Frankly, I don't think the website photos accurately capture how wonderful and diverse this hotel is (their basement restaurant and bar are really unique and very cool - and I'm pretty hard to impress)  We booked with Fine Hotels so breakfast and dinner in their charming restaurant were included (which is a really worthwhile amenity).  We also had dinner in their fine dining restaurant and it was French perfection -- definitely buttoned up and proper -- but still charming and warm.  They also arranged for my bag to be sent back and it beat me home.  Well done Merrion.",5,2014,08,19
200,Luxury in Dublin,"We had a fantastic mini-suite in the ""old building."" Well, the suite was anything but old. Very modern and luxurious with a dressing room in between the large bedroom/sitting room and the large fully equipped bathroom. The staff was all excellent. Good, quiet location. Very comfortable accommodations. On our last day we had lunch at the adjoining, pricey, but excellent, two Michelin star Guilbaud Restaurant, staffed with a proper (English speaking) French wait staff. Although we didn't have it, the hotel is also renowned for their afternoon tea.",5,2014,08,18
200,Very impressive,"This grand Georgian hotel is beautifully decorated, but despite its imposing rooms is very friendly and warm (literally, when we visited there were fires in the grates!) Very attentive staff throughout, a wonderful bar (very cosy with the fires) and well located in Dublin. Our room (333) was enormous, with a family size bathroom which came with separate bath and shower. The bed was big enough to lie across diagonally without touching either side! Best night's sleep in a long time, very quiet too. Only downside was an odd mobile phone interference noise which seemed to come from a speaker in the bathroom? Infrequent though. The following morning we enjoyed the pool and sauna, again, faultless. Spa treatments are on offer but you have to leave the basement pool to go up to the first floor in your dressing gown, which is slightly off-putting. We didn't eat in the restaurant but hear very good things. Highly recommended.",5,2014,08,18
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"I have been lucky enough over the years to stay at The Merrion Hotel, Dublin, Ireland on a few occasions and in my opinion, it is the best hotel in town.   The location, style, ambiance, staff and the food is absolutely superb .... can't wait for my next luxury trip!",5,2014,08,18
200,Excellent for a luxury stay,"This beautiful facility is well located and beautifully furnished. If you are not comfortable in more formal surroundings, you might choose a different hotel. The rooms are beautiful, the bar is wonderful and the breakfast is outstanding. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved it.",5,2014,08,16
200,Wow,We stayed here for my wife's birthday.I bought a package that included dinner and breakfast in the cellar restaurant.I wouldn't normally spend that amount of coin on a night away but seeing it was a special occasion I went for it.Can't fault the place.Best hotel I've ever stayed in.The meals were extraordinary.5 star bliss.Will definitely return.Worth every penny,5,2014,08,16
200,THE Place to Stay in Dublin,"From the time my wife and I arrived, the staff at the Merrion were friendly, attentive, accommodating, and helpful.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience our first night in Ireland.  If we return to Dublin, this is where we will be staying.",5,2014,08,16
200,"Fantastic hotel, lovely room and great location","Had a lovely nights stay in the Merrion! From start to finish I couldn't pick a fault! All the staff were so attentive and helpful. The hotel very kindly upgraded us to a junior suite in the main house! Wow! It was fantastic lovely bathroom and massive bed! Breakfast was delicious.

Can't wait to return to the Merrion again soon!",5,2014,08,15
200,Delightful stay,"We stayed 2 days  - my wife and 2 daughters - in this tasteful hotel.
Interconnecting beautiful  rooms with a view on the parterre garden were perfect.
We had delicious snacks on the garden terrace while the elegant drawing rooms  with antique furniture and quality art works are ideal for Art Afternoon Tea near the open log fires.
Outstanding food .Very kind staff.
We loved everything about the Merrion.",5,2014,08,15
200,A great experience,"One of the best hotels I have stayed at. From the warm welcome from every member of the friendly staff to the immaculate, well equipped rooms, everything was 'just right'. Superb location within a short walk of major attractions. The free WiFi a welcome change from the pettiness of many supposedly top hotel groups who charge for this now essential service. Sorry to check-out and look forward to a return visit.",5,2014,08,15
200,The best hotel,What a great hotel fantastic customer service great location with staff that give a very warm welcome. Afternoon tea is epic and the art work gives a interesting new perspective of staying in a hotel. It's four town houses turned into a hotel spar and pool are beautiful,5,2014,08,14
200,A hotel that needs some vast improvements!,"I really do not want to write this but I feel I must to explain what presently the situation is there. At present there are far too many young people on especially reception and in the bars and tea areas who have not got the faintest idea about either the city or the service they are providing! Even basic knowledge on local information and how to serve a pot of tea! Although the concierge they are FANTASTIC they know their stuff and they make you feel like a king and queen! 

Rooms - in the new building need careful choice some look at the garden indeed but they also look at a very ugly rundown office building across the way and junior suites have views of the most awful back streets you could imagine! NO view of the garden at all! ...Not one junior suite! Except in the old building, nice but instead you look at the presidential palace! 

Rumour has it that the S Hotel is better! That is what the locals say and unless the Merrion can improve its staff training possibly by getting some of the concierge staff on the front I would not really say it is the best place in town at all! Service and a nice view regardless of being in the city is vital! I for one don't want to see ugly views and the inside of connecting tunnels to the new section where bits and pieces of broken furniture or non used items are left to be seen!",2,2014,08,13
200,Amazing ,"Simply outstanding. Service,
Food,
Staff. Amazing. Room was beautiful. What really
Stood
Out for me was the afternoon tea. Plenty of food and the cakes were to die for. The art interlink is an extremely idea. Loved everything about it. A huge treat but an absolute
Must and for the price completely good value ",5,2014,08,13
200,Crème de la crème - a faultless experience,"We stayed here last weekend as a family for a special birthday celebration and everything was absolutely first rate from arrival to departure. A really top hotel that has the lovely feel of a very special house - beautiful decor and art and yet personal, unlike many 5 star hotels.

A great, central location with very good, spacious rooms and large, comfortable beds and all the facilities that one would expect - and, more than that, the x-factor of a terrific ambience and truly excellent service - prompt, personal and very warm and natural (special mentions to Marko in The Cellar restaurant and Ciara who served us Afternoon Tea, but all were first rate).

On Saturday we had booked lunch in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud - that was excellent top-notch food and wine (the Triptych Pouilly Fume was fantastic and the monkfish with tomato converted even our meat-committed 16 year old) - and so on the Friday evening we thought we'd have a lighter, more informal dinner in the Cellar Restaurant and that, too, was high quality - especially for the price - really delicious and enhanced by a great selection of wines by the glass (better quality than one would normally expect by the glass).

On Sunday, the treat of the Afternoon ""Art Tea"" topped off the weekend perfectly - the setting of the Drawing Room and the service were just fabulous.

A faultless experience.",5,2014,08,13
200,Wonderful escape,Stayed on the 11th in the garden annex The room was wonderful - can't imagine what the other rooms would look like as this room was faultless.  The staff were very helpful and it was lovely to relax in the cellar bar until we ate our evening meal. The terrace looked vey inviting too but unfortunately it was too wet to sit outside. Will definitely stay again,5,2014,08,13
200,Comfort and class,"We spent 5 nights at the Merrion in July and were so pleased with our choice.  The location of the Merrion was perfect - close to everything, yet tucked on a beautiful and quiet street.  The charm of the hotel and gardens combined with the comfort of our room was just the perfect combination for our stay.   We are a family of four and booked the family promotion which featured 2  full adjoining rooms  - a king for us and 2 single beds for the girls.  This proved to be  a nicely spacious, well appointed option.   We also very much enjoyed the garden views from our rooms on the 3rd floor - so nice to open the french doors to the princess balconies for fresh air and sound of the fountains, especially since it was light out until almost 11:00pm each night.  We also appreciated the option for room service delivery of the included breakfast  - an abundance of fresh bread, fruit, pastries, yogurt, and more (very nicely presented) where a lovely way to begin each day  - we a huge fans of a leisurely room service breakfast getting ready for the day and the Merrion did not disappoint.  

The only negatives for our stay were the 1. the WiFi (upside - it did force us to forget about squeezing in work during vacation) yet seriously so slow at times it was almost non-functional.  And the food quality during our otherwise very enjoyable Art Tea  - the sitting rooms/setting is such a nice slice of old world charm.  As a family, we enjoy the treat of afternoon tea  - and have made this choice at luxury hotels across and outside the US -  we all felt the food looked nice yet was just so-so - bland and no standouts here.  Even the second course of ""Art inspired desserts"" was a very clever concept and yet not as tasty as was pretty.  If you go, I recommend skipping the full tea and just enjoy a cocktail/coffee/tea and soak in the charm of the space.  

We would absolutely stay at the Merrion again - the service and accommodations were tops.  Charm all around.  And last but not least - the art collection is a treat take in and adds so much to the overall ambiance of this lovely hotel !",5,2014,08,13
200,Excellent Hotel,This hotel was perfect. It is right down town close to everything. The staff were great. Rooms were nice. It is a higher end hotel so plan on spending a little more.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin. Walking distance to a lot of sights. I recommend having the Beef and Guinness stew from the Brazen Head. ,5,2014,08,12
200,Fabulous stay at the Merrion,"First class hotel, lovely afternoon tea.   Wouldn't say breakfast unless it is included as it is really expensive and not worth it.   There are fabulous eating houses close by.   Didn't eat dinner here.

The garden is wonderful in this hotel, hard to find in a hotel in the centre of Dublin.

Very clean, wonderful staff, all in all, a fabulous hotel  Will go back to the Merrion for sure.",5,2014,08,12
200,Much nice than the photos suggest,"I sae the great reviews but the photos online don't do it much justice.

We arrived and were greated with a smile by every staff member from the door man through to the reception.  

I was anxious as we arrived at 2pm and check-in is at 3pm however as a member of the Leading Hotels in the World loyalty scheme they were able to offer an early check-in.

its fair to say the hotel is getting a little tired in places but the room was great, tv system is a bit confusing but soon got used to how to change the channels.  The bathroom large and toiletries very nice.

Wasn't so hot on the cellar bar which was a bit dark for a lunch-time meet with family but sadly everywhere else was full.  Im not so sure if that was truly the case of where they hiding us in the basement because we had young children on tow to be honest.

The breakfast was particularly nice.  Always happy to find both pancakes and french toast on the menu ;)",5,2014,08,11
200,Heaven on Earth!!!!!,"Stayed two nights and wish I had stayed a month.  First of of all I wasn't happy with the initial room we got, but Lisa got us a beautiful room on the 3rd floor with views of the garden.  The staff are terrific, the rooms are the epitome of understated class.  The bed one of the best I've seen.  The bathroom has a shower and tub as well as double sinks within walls of white grey marble.  Just a stunning environment. The Spa has a great pool and the Spa treatment staff we're professional and top notch.  The Michelin Star restaurant connected to the hotel was an outstanding experience and the breakfast in the cave of the hotel was terrific too.  Currently in Le Monde in Edinburgh and wishing I was in The Merrion!!!!!  You can't go wrong in this hotel.  Thank you Merrion for a wonderful stay. . .and special thanks to Lisa.  ",5,2014,08,10
200,Romantic Break,We stayed here as a treat for our anniversary. Absolutely love this hotel. Staff are so friendly & welcoming. Room was beautiful - so elegant with great views over the garden. Can't wait to return again. ,5,2014,08,10
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I've stayed in a number of hotels including the Clarence, Westbury and the Shelburne and the Merrion is the best by a distance.  Charming staff, beautiful building and incredibly comfortable accommodations.  Clean, extremely well-equipped and exquisitely furnished, my room also had a lovely view across the courtyard.  I only ate on room service but the food was lovely, arrived quickly and was not over-priced.  I would not hesitate to stay here on my next trip to Dublin and only wish I had discovered this lovely hotel sooner.  The amenities in my room were comprehensive and high quality and the service was unobtrusive but charming.  I could not recommend it more highly (and trust me, I am a really really fussy business traveller).",5,2014,08,07
200,A Dream,"From the concierge at the door, to the beautiful white marble reception, to the beautiful smell of the turf fire place and chesterfield sofas in the lounge to the 5 star bedrooms with every luxury I just love The Merrion. It doesn't matter what room you get, you are in absolute decadence and complete excellence of service. I absolutely recommend the hotel for special occasions for any couple. I really do recommend also room service delivery of breakfast. It is quite special to be woken and dress in your robe and have a silver service breakfast wheeled in and be sat down by the waiter first thing in the morning. Silver lids lifted off to what is absolutely a buffet of beautiful pastries, fruit, juices, tea/coffee and the all important full breakfast, how you like it. Obviously, its the Merrion if you dont like whats above they will present you with anything you want. Amazing.",5,2014,08,06
200,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"The Merrion Hotel was one of our favorite hotels on a recent tour of Ireland.  The Merrion Hotel is sophisticated and elegant, while at the same time being very warm, welcoming and relaxing.  The hotel showcases a very nice collection of art works.  There are plenty of places to relax and read a good book or newspaper or visit with friends and family.  The garden is beautiful and very serene and peaceful. There are several dining options, which are all wonderful.  The staff is very professional and friendly and the service they provide is outstanding.  We stayed at the Merrion at the beginning of our tour and again at the end, and the rooms were very clean, comfortable and well appointed with nice views of the garden.  Even though the Hotel is in the city, it is very quiet.",5,2014,08,06
200,Excellent Hotel,"Great experience at this hotel, stayed in the Merrion Suite, which was really well presented and nicely furnished. The staff were friendly and efficient. The outside café area around the pond was really relaxing, lovely place to have a coffee in the afternoon. Overall excellent hotel, great location close to everything",4,2014,08,04
200,Golf trip to Ireland,"Hotel is a bit overpriced to be honest, but it is in an excellent location and the amenities are fabulous. Everyone there is more than happy to try and make your stay as pleasant as possible and the food was great.  We have stayed there twice now and each stay was excellent. I believe you will enjoy really enjoy the hotel and the staff.",5,2014,08,04
200,Looking forward to returning,"My wife and I spend a wonderful 3 nights here recently and are looking forward to a future visit.

It's a wonderful hotel and excellent staff.  It was a 5 Star experience in every dimension.  We'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a luxury property centrally located in Dublin.",5,2014,07,31
200,Stay at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin,"Everything about our stay at The Merrion was perfect.  Beautiful hotel, in a good location, and the staff was remarkable.  The front desk staff was most helpful in getting us checked in and in locating good pubs as well as an outstanding restaurant for dinner, Matt Thresher's  
The Merrion is expensive but well worth it.",5,2014,07,31
200,Like It; Didn't love It,"This is a lovely hotel in a great central location.  I phoned in a reservation for seven days and was promised a garden view room.  When I arrived, I was told the garden view was available for only 3 days and for ""my convenience"" they would place me in a room with a city view; that is, an alley way.  Staff was very polite throughout.  Maid service was especially great.  Food was mediocre and the service indifferent to me, perhaps because I was a single.  There was no way just to have a bit of porridge and a cup of coffee in the morning without being charged 26 euros for the continental breakfast, which I did twice, thinking there must have been some mistake.  The pub downstairs was enjoyable as was the spa.  When I expressed my concerns on the hotel's website, the assistant to the assistant manager contacted me, promised to look into the problems and never got back to me.",4,2014,07,30
200,Artist's tea was well worth the time,"We booked a slot for an artist's tea here.  Wow, what a lovely and well worth experience.  The hotel has one of the largest private collections of art in Europe.   It's something like 36 euros each, but you could even share one tea among two people if they allow....there was plenty.  For a special occasion, this is tops!!! Very romantic if you want.  A family nearby brought grandpa and even a 2 year old, to celebrate his 70th birthday.  Tea meant, first a cold beverage of your choice or champagne.  I chose an awesome ginger lemon iced tea, which was incredible.  Served in the comfy room off the terrace.  You sit on couches and chairs as if it was your private sitting room.  Two courses actually meant more food than we could finish.  Served on a silver 3-tiered tray, there were cheese, meat, egg salad, cucumber and salmon sandwiches.  The second tier was cakes, yummy scones and a muffin...all chef specialties.  I have a nut allergy and they were abundantly sensitive to it..making sure I would have no health problems.  Any dessert which contained nuts, was not put on my plate, plus they pointed out which things I should avoid on my husband's tray.  After not finishing everything, they wrap it up for you to take home.  There was actual tea, of course, but more varieties than I could imagine.  They serve you...don't even think of trying to pour on your own!  The top tier was homemade jam, lemon curd and  clotted cream (which is like whipped cream and butter combined).  Delicious!!!  Ok, I am still writing because, this wasn't the last part.  Finally you are served 3 chef creations that are based on 3 paintings in and around the room you are currently in.  Of course, you are given small cards showing the relevant paintings.  The desserts are tasty, oh so creative and fun!  By now you are sleepy and relaxed beyond comprehension...we were told that guests fall asleep all the time.   I would do this again in a heartbeat!  Book it online even if you choose to stay elsewhere.  Check out the wonderful garden outside the hotel as well.",5,2014,07,30
200,5 Star start to finish,"I recently stayed here with a group of old friends who were meeting up for a mini reunion from all over Ireland and abroad. We wanted to treat ourselves a little and be close to city centre restaurants and bars. It was my second time visiting the Merrion and I'm happy to say it was every bit as good as I remembered.  The staff were incredibly polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. When our numbers changed to include an extra friend, a cot was provided without fuss. The very spacious bedrooms are bright, airy and meticulously kept. We very much enjoyed the swimming pool and cocktails on the terrace. My only(minor) criticisms are that the layout is a little awkward to navigate, particularly when tying to find the pool from the main hotel area and that the selection of beers on the bar menu is limited and uninspired (one of our group is a beer nut and was disappointed that only the usual susoects were on offer).  Otherwise, a real five star experience in the heart of the city",5,2014,07,29
200,Loved this hotel,"Great European charm in a lovely hotel. Great location to sights, music, restaurants, shopping and the hop on hop off bus. Loved the room and big bathroom. Cozy sheets and comforter. Very comfortable hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant.",5,2014,07,28
200,brunch in the cellar bar,"The service was 5 star from start to finish. It was an excellent way to finish our girls weekend as we were made feel extra special! The food and cocktails were delicious but the extra mile the staff went was really what made the experience, especially our waiter phil. He was friendly and helpful and we were never left waiting or looking for help as he was there on hand at just the right times. Finishing touches such as iced strawberries for our prosecco and over all presentation and service was just perfection. A really enjoyable experience...we were made feel like valued customers and really made our weekend! Special thanks to Phil.",5,2014,07,28
200,5 Star hotel not 5 star breakfast,"Stayed at The Merrion on on a Saturday in July, the hotel is great from the time you meet the front door staff to being checked in, we a had a king room in the Garden wing, the room was a great size and truly a 5 star room. The hotel itself is immiculate and the decor is great, the gardens are worth a short explore. We didnt try the health suit so we cant comment. The only downside is Breakfast, when we booked we wernt given the option to include it in the rate, we knew the cost €29! per person however expected something special at that cost, breakfast is served in the cellar (not the prettiest part of the hotel), we were sat at our table and the server was more interested in pointing out the cost than anything else, she was fairly abrupt which set the tone, we both order full irish as we were hungry, full irish arrived, it is the first time that I have seen 1 sausage, 1 piece of bacon, 1/2 a mushroom, 1/2 a tomatoe, a piece of some sort of bread, and two poaced eggs called a breakfast, it wouldnt have filled a child. The eggs tasted of nothing and my wife wouldnt eat hers and asked  for scrambled egg, they didnt take the plate away they left the poaced eggs which wernt wanted and brought a side plate with scrambled eggs (which my wife said were nice), a man asked if everything was ok with Breakfast, I commented on the size of Breakfast however that was that. When we returned to our room we had a knock and two staff brought in coffee and buckfizz, it was 10 in the morning so we had the coffee.I would have preferred not to be charged for Breakfast however that clearly wasnt an option. We checked out and again the staff were atentive. Overall a great hotel however please avoid the breakfast as it dosnt fit to the rest of the hotel experience.",4,2014,07,28
200,Setting the Benchmark in the Hospitality Industry,"The Merrion was an absolute bliss to stay at. 
We travelled with an 8 week old infant , and our every need was taken care off. 
Attention to detail, is what the Merrion is all about. We arrived to a room with a 
baby crib, a baby gown as well as an entire baby range of toiletries. 
The staff are incredible and were empathetic to us as young parents. 
The Patrick Guilbaud was also exceptional, with service and quality of food worth their Michelin stars.
One of the best hotel experiences we have encounterd on a global scale.",5,2014,07,28
200,Truly superb hotel. World class standard.,"The understated elegance of Georgian Dublin still survives at the Merrion Hotel. Standards of service are simply outstanding from the smallest detail of room service to the wonderful Art Tea (an absolute must). What a pleasure it is to see the simply outstanding collection of Irish art spaced around the hotel along with historical artifacts and photos. Take a stroll in the lovely garden and pay your respects to the James Joyce statue before venturing out into the Georgian surrounds that await you.

As others have noted the rooms provide for an outstandingly omfortable stay. Everything one is likely to need is provided to ensure guest comfort. 

The hotel has a connecting door to the wonderful Michelin two star Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud' (see separate review) but as all great hotels the residents bar is able to provide excellent bar food for hours after a return from a night discovering th city. 

Our only negative was the standard of breakfast provided. Not nearly as good as we had experienced in other Hotels in Ireland. Hot Irish breakfast plates were placed on our table while we were still eating our cereal and the fried breakfast was very disappointing in comparison with far cheaper establishments. 

Overall the Merrion is clearly a five-star experience and Dublins finest hotel. We would have no hesitation in staying there again. We would however take breakfast elsewhere.",5,2014,07,26
200,What a great hotel,"If you're looking for a great hotel in Dublin, this is the place!!!! The service is spectacular. The rooms are comfortable. A/C works great, free WiFi. The restaurants are great. The spa is great. It is centrally located to great food, pubs and shops. Trust me, this is a hotel you want to stay at!",5,2014,07,26
200,Wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin,"At the advice of our bicycle tour operator, Backroads, we booked The Merrion. The service was impeccable starting with the doormen in greatcoats and top hats. Reception was cordial and we were given a guided tour of the well equipped hotel. We received a  complimentary upgrade to spacious, immaculate room facing the Parliament. We were a short walk to Trinity college, Christ church cathedral, and the Guinness storehouse. Dinner at the cellar bar was excellent. My fiancee's fish and chips were the best ever, and I had the chef's special that night, wild boar.  Our concierge recommended an excellent pub nearby. ",5,2014,07,26
200,Flawless Experience in Dublin,"We chose to stay in the Merrion as a special treat for the last night of our vacation in Ireland.  We had experienced a variety of accommodations during our trip, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, and even a castle.  We were pleased with all of our accommodations, as we had researched them well on Tripadvisor and other sites prior to booking. Staying at the Merrion was the absolute highlight.   I have to say that the SERVICE at the Merrion was one of the things that made our trip so memorable, in addition to the locale, the rooms, and the amenities. 

The young lady at the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful.  It was very comforting, after 10 days of touring, hiking, and driving on the left side of the road for the first time in our lives, (!), to be immediately checked in and upgraded to a larger room because our room was not yet ready.  This young lady, named Kate,  escorted us directly to our room and gave a friendly tutorial about various features of the room with which we might need assistance.  This was very unique, as sometimes you do struggle with how to turn on the lights, how to work the television, etc., when you check into a room, and these seemingly minor issues were worked out in advance for us.

The room was quiet as a vault.  I had requested a quiet room, and I did not hear a sound coming from any of the other patrons of the hotel while I was trying to sleep.  I slept in the newer wing of the hotel, and perhaps it was soundproofed.  Regardless, as a light sleeper, I was very grateful for this.  The bed was very comfy, with some kind of foam topper included in the mattress.  This also contributed to a full night's sleep, which is not always easy to get in hotels.

We did not have dinner in the Merrion, but chose to dine out instead.  We did, however, have  room service breakfast, as our flight home was scheduled for early in the  morning.   The breakfast was elegant and served with extra special touches which I will try to show when I figure out how to upload pictures on Tripadvisor!

When it came time to leave, we were bundled off efficiently into a cab waiting outside. All the staff were lovely.  Staying at the Merrion was a fitting end to a dream vacation in Ireland.  My husband, who is usually not easily impressed with hotels, was particularly impressed with this one.  It is my hope that we can return to Dublin someday, and that we can spend more time in this gorgeous hotel.",5,2014,07,26
200,Classy classy classy! ,"If you want to be treated like royalty, stay at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. The rooms (not only the suite which half of our group was lucky enough to stay in, but the regular rooms as well) were absolutely beautiful and comfortable enough where you weren't worried about breaking anything just by touching it. They even turn down your bed for you in the afternoon and leave you slippers and a bottle of water! Not to mention the food which was some of the best I've ever had in my life and that which was fit for a king (or a lot of kings with the amount they give you). The indoor pool downstairs was very clean and really nice, and the attached sauna was small but very relaxing with the minty clove aroma. Lastly, the location is perfect. It's in close proximity of pretty much any tourist destination in Dublin. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to make their Dublin experience an incredible one. Say hi to Dave the doorman for me!",5,2014,07,26
200,the best,"i really love this hotel - i love its quietness - i love its situation - . it has an understated elegance that is very appealing. the staff are solicitous but not interfering. the beds are extremely comfortable. the breakfast, the afternoon tea divine. i always try and stay here on trips to dublin and this time came also with our family including a young grandson and i have to stay he was treated really well - cot, balloons, baby book, baby robe in the room - baby chair ready for all meals. all went smoothly. its a credit to the management. one of its main selling points - if the above is not enough - is its location - just round the corner from stephens green, beside Grafton street etc, and yet perfectly calm. my top 5 anywhere.",5,2014,07,25
200,Been in the country now city time!,"We arrived and the staff was very nice. They took us to our room and it smelled like smoke to me. I requested to see if they had another room available. They found one and let us see/smell this one and it was much better. This room 127 was even closer to the elevator. Our room was smaller than the picture on the internet, but was happy to not smell smoke. I did think the decor at the hotel was nice. I was very shocked at the menu prices. Just for a club sandwich it was a little over $30.00. We did not eat at our hotel due to price. The staff was very nice and hotel is in a good location.  
",4,2014,07,24
200,Finally- a true 5 star hotel in Europe,"From check in to departure- truly a wonderful experience! The charming entry is deceptive and the hotel is actually quite large, with the guest areas set back from the street. Our room faced the interior courtyard and was very quiet. The room itself was beautifully decorated and appointed and a  very nice size for a European hotel.  The bed was extremely comfortable, foam pillows brought immediately and comfiest slippers provided. The bathroom was also very nice and large with great towels and amenities. The concierge on duty when we arrived was very reluctant to recommend any pubs in the Temple Bar area even though we wanted to go there. We did find some on our own and had great times so really not sure what the issue was. Other than that, the staff was wonderful, so professional and helpful. Although the Merrion is a little off the beaten track it is really worth the walk to the tourist areas to stay here. There is a reason The Merrion Hotel is number on TA for Dublin.",5,2014,07,24
200,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"I frequently travel to Dublin and always enjoy staying the The Merrion. The hotel is in a historic row house and has a very authentic/antique feel. It is situated right in Merrion Square and Baggot St, where there are a lot of historic pubs and nice restaurants within a short walk. The rooms are spacious and updated, but still with a very homey feel. The bathrooms are floor to ceiling marble with the most lovely bath products. The staff are very welcoming and are always offering to assist you from arriving in the taxi cab to check out. In the colder months, there's a wood-burning fire in the lobby/tea room, which only adds to the charm of this hotel. I'd highly recommend staying at the Merrion!",5,2014,07,23
200,Wonderful Experience,We enjoyed the wonderful experience last Saturday having afternoon tea in the Merrion Hotel. From the moment we arrived we were looked after so well. Our car was parked for us as there was no suitable place for us on arrival. The staff were exceptional and the afternoon tea just lovely. We were waited on hand and foot and the signature art course was amazing and explained beautifully. The decor and ambience of this hotel is spectacular and I look forward to my next visit,5,2014,07,23
200,"The Merrion Hotel, Outstanding!","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Merrion Hotel, Dublin.  It combines Old World charm and service, as we've never had it before.  The property is beautiful, inside and out.  Our guest room was large, modern, and well appointed.  The staff is both professional and friendly.  Our breakfasts were delicious, with plenty of variety available.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,07,22
200,This hotel is amazing!,"We recently got married at the Ritz Carlton, and I have to say, The Merrion is on caliber with the Ritz.  This hotel is immaculate, the staff is outstanding and the overall experience was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better time.  Look no further, this hotel is where you want to stay when you visit Dublin!",5,2014,07,22
200,The Highlight of Our Stay in Dublin,"Dublin was unfortunately a forgettable city, but at least The Merrion made up for what the city lacked.  We stayed in the main house in The Lord Antrim suite and was quite pleased with the spaciousness and simple elegance of the suite.  The treatment at their Tethra Spa was superb as was the friendliness of the staff and hotel manager.  Thank you for the free wifi (yippeeeee) and for ending our trip to Ireland on a fabulous note!!",5,2014,07,22
200,Fabulous place to stay,"Right in the middle of shopping and attractions, the Merrion is a great place to stay.  The people there are so nice and very attentive to anything you might need.  We felt so welcome there. The rooms are really luxurious!  The beds are comfortable with thick feather comforters, and the room includes heated towel racks, plush robes and slippers.  And best of all, it's air conditioned!!  The wifi is very speedy.  I hated to leave!  High tea every afternoon in a beautiful indoor or outdoor setting, your choice.  The seating area for all guests has an inviting fire and highly polished brass appointments.  It's really just lovely!  And about 15 min. from the airport.  There are no gas (petrol) stations between the hotel and the airport, though, so fill up before you leave for the airport.  The grounds are just beautiful, too.  Flowers and shrubs are really well taken care of.  Hydrangeas as big as your head!",5,2014,07,22
200,Nice hotel but not for me,"I can understand why lots of people love this hotel.Rooms are nice, very attentive staff, decent location. For me it was a little too much though. Some people like all the attention that they would get here but not for me and my wife. We went walking one night and I had a back pack and when I came back I walked back up to the entrance and 2 workers tried to carry the backpack for me. I am just not that kind of guy...that being said if you are that type of person this is the place for you. The rooms are nice. Instead of paying 29 euros a piece for breakfast I walked 50 yards to Cook and Lollys (not sure of the name but is blue building very close on corner) and grabbed some fresh fruit and scones for 9 euros which is all we need. I am not sorry we stayed there but next time in Dublin I would probably go for something a little more low key.",4,2014,07,22
200,Excellent stay,"We stayed at the Merrion in June for a long Dublin weekend. Service was excellent and friendly. The location is convenient for sights as well as shopping and dining. Temple bar is a swift walk away. Had the room without breakfast, but there were lits of delis and coffeshops nearby. Would definetely stay there again.",5,2014,07,22
200,Very good but let down by the restaurant,"Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. Room was very nice but try and get one that overlooks the courtyard not the back street.

The only downside was the restaurant where i ordered steak which had lots of fat in the middle and a large section of fat on the edge (difficult to see with the lighting!) when I mentioned it they did give a small reduction on the final bill but that wasn't the point. Given it is quite expensive, I would expect top quality steak. Saying that, my partner had blackened sole and said it was excellent.",4,2014,07,22
200,The Art Tea is wonderful!,"We enjoyed the afternoon tea along with the Art Tea on a June 2014 Sunday afternoon!  It was wonderful to be spoiled by the tea sommelier and staff!  We sat by the fireplace with the windows open and thoroughly enjoyed the tea, the sumptious pastries and sandwiches and all the art and the desserts created to replicate the art!  It was wonderful!  
I heard about the Art Tea from Tea Time Magazine!
One of the highlights of our visit to Dublin!  What a delightful hotel!  I would like to stay here the next time I am in Dublin!",5,2014,07,22
200,Romantic weekend in Dublin,"My partner and I enjoyed our weekend very much. The rooms are standard rooms as far as size goes, but the linens and the bathroom are very nice. The bed was very comfortable. We could, on one night, hear our neighbors very loudly, so that was a disappointment. Turn down service at night is really nice. The bathroom shampoos and soaps were already plentiful, but we kept getting more and more - - to the point where we had them lining our countertop! A bit excessive, but better than none. One morning I woke up to the smell of roses. It seems that sometimes rose scent is pumped in to the rooms - - or so I assume! Very nice. The staff is kind and welcoming, making you feel like you're their most special guest. Definitely a plus. The location was excellent! It's in a quieter area of Dublin, so it's peaceful and quiet, yet there's still a bunch of stuff to do! We loved sitting and having a quiet conversation and drink in the garden!  Speaking of a lot to do in the area, some of the best Irish music in Dublin is known to be at O'Donaghue's right around the corner! We found an excellent breakfast spot around the corner also. The breakfast at the hotel, while plentiful and delicious, is served downstairs in The Cellar restaurant where there is no light. We found it too dark to visit more than once. Another great plus is that the ""red tour bus"" stops right there! Very convenient.",4,2014,07,22
200,Perfect!,"This is a great hotel which really deserves it's number 1 rating. Had seamless check in and check out which a lot of other hotels could learn from. It is also the best smelling hotel I have ever stayed at- the peat fire in the drawing room along with the hotels signature scent was really heavenly. The other thing I loved was the heated towel rack in bathroom. Other Irish hotels all have them but Merrion's worked the best. Big puffy beds and friendly low key staff. Good spa and pool. Dress nicely so you fit in. But really, really great.",5,2014,07,21
200,beautiful hotel in great location with Amazing Staff,"We had one night in Dublin and so checked into the Merrion.  What a fantastic welcome, we also got upgraded room. The room was great (and bathroom) staff superb, and the cocktails excellent.  It was so good that we checked back in again 2 days later!",5,2014,07,21
200,A dream hotel in Dublin!,"This hotel was our best experience in Dublin. Beautiful lobby, tea rooms, and breathtaking outdoor gardens were only the beginning. The rooms were tastefully decorated with colorful pastels and had elegant bathrooms. They were also very quiet and comfortable after busy days.
The pool and exercise areas were fragrant, clean and provided extra amenities like hot tea and fresh fruit. The bar and one of the restaurants that we used within the hotel were very pleasant. The great service, guidance and attention to details made it like a dream. We had some trouble getting reservations, but our overall enjoyment was beyond what we expected. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,21
200,Touch of class,Another fantastic stay at The Merrion.  The service and atmosphere is world class. Cannot beat the convenient yet quiet location near St Stephens Green.  Staff were very helpful with email queries before our arrival.  My wife loves the elegant rooms in the Main House.  Be sure to have the breakfast!,5,2014,07,21
200,Now this is pure LUXURY,"Title says it all - well located , high quality service and superior product - luxurious and quite old world meets new world glamour.
I can't fault a thing with this hotel - we were in Dublin for a wedding at a hotel around the corner and decided to stay here to be away from the wedding madness and what a good decision. This has to be in my experience the absolute and unquestionablly BEST hotel in Dublin. 
The room is very elegantly services and while our room was not huge the space was very well allocated. The accessories in the room from toiletries to slippers to bathrobes were all of a very high quality but it's the small things that really impressed the most. A can of starch with the ironing board - simple and genius , a tall shoehorn - much better.
My only regret was not doing the walk around the hotel on the first and not the last day as I may have both ahead a dri in the basement bar and even gone for a swim if only I had known.
The only negative , and I do realise its a different market of us visitor and business people in the foyer but the price of a coffee and muffin seas more than as little excessive there ..... I went to th delightful corner cafe and had take out instead 
Otherwise delightful and I will be back

If this helps click 'helpful' :-)",5,2014,07,21
200,You will be treated like royalty.,As soon as we walked into the Merrion my partner and I were made to feel like royalty. I'm not the type of person to want to stay at such a fancy place but we decided to treat ourselves on our one night in Dublin and we are so glad we did. The hotel is perfect in every way. Our room was grand and comfortable. The bathroom was draped in marble. The bed had the most comfortable mattress and linen. The hotel has lovely gardens where you can enjoy some high tea. And the best part is the art collection throughout the hotel. Painting after painting was historic and inspired. The Georgian building sits in front of the Irish Parliamient Buildings and the area is really chic. There are amazing pubs and coffee shops within walking distance to grab a Guinness or some local fare. The spa also was quite lovely.....small but lovely. But the stars of the Merrion were the individuals that run it from the spa attendant to the concierge. The level of service was incredible. It's a very pricey experience but even if you can go for just one night I would recommend it. The historic buidling and area are simply brilliant!!!!,5,2014,07,21
200,"Beautiful Artwork, Quiet Location, Near Attractions","The gardens and afternoon tea were our favorite aspects of this hotel.  The bed was comfortable, the room was a nice size, especially for European standards.  The bathroom had heated floors and towel rack, with great amenities.

The staff is very accommodating and professional.

We appreciated that it was on a fairly quiet street for peaceful sleeping, but close enough to walk to all the shopping areas along Grafton Street, as well as the Temple Bar area and museums.  The tour buses are all available just a few blocks from the hotel.

Wifi was great (and free) in the room and public areas - and even worked well in the outside garden!

We recommend the location for couples, families and also noticed a lot of business people in the hotel as well, enjoying meetings while at afternoon tea.",5,2014,07,20
200,first class stay!,"We only stayed one night in the Merrion, and enjoyed it very much. The welcome from reception and efficiency of checking in was excellent.  Our room was upgraded and we were very happy with the room and the bathroom. Our whole experience was positive and I can recommend it very highly. Hope to stay again should we return to Dublin.",5,2014,07,20
200,Great experience,"We stayed overnight in the Merrion during July.  The whole experience was first-class, especially being upgrade to a Junior Suite!  The accommodation and food were superb  and the staff were totally efficient and very friendly.

Our room was large and luxurious with a view over Government Buildings. The hotel is just around the corner from Stephen's Green and is within easy walking distance of the city centre.

We are looking forward to a return visit to a wonderful hotel.",5,2014,07,20
200,Best service in town!,"We had the wonderful experience of staying at this lovely, historic hotel for our holiday in Dublin with our 14 month old daughter and loved every minute of it. The staff are all wonderfully trained and very children orientated.... from the amenities in our room to the ""extras"", like giving us bread to fee the ducks at the park. The hotel is filled with artwork, the gardens are lovely and the dining is superb. Certainly 5-star! We look forward to our return.",5,2014,07,19
200,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,"My friend and I were over in Dublin for a few days and decided to try the Afternoon Tea at the Merrion Hotel as we had only heard good things....we were definitely not disappointed!!

On arrival, we were shown to a lounge by a young lady and seated right next to a beautiful fire place (which was on).  The chairs were very comfortable and table was beautifully set.  Our waiter Alexandre then came over and introduced himself and explained the food, teas, hot chocolate etc. Very informative!!  The food itself was delicious and there was certainly plenty of it! 

Throughout our meal, Alexandre refilled our water on several occasions and ensured that everything was ok.  He is certainly is a credit to your team and deserves an acknowledgement for the outstanding customer service.

Would return with no hesitation!",5,2014,07,19
200,Afternoon Tea,I had Afternoon Tea here on 13/7/2014. It was a wonderful experience with fantastic service from a very professional staff. We were made to feel so welcome and comfortable. The food was delicious and the pastries all modelled on beautiful paintings hanging in the Hotel. A delightful Sunday afternoon. Highly recommend it.,5,2014,07,19
200,What a perfect place to end our trip,"This beautiful fresh hotel perfectly blended the old and new in the heart of Dublin.  It was centrally located, the rooms were spa like, fresh, clean and very comfortable.  We had a beautiful courtyard view.  The service was magnificent.  Reasonably priced, you could not ask for a better package.  One of the best decisions we made!",5,2014,07,19
200,Not a good nights sleep,"Checked in at 9pm and was given the last available room at the end of long corridor in the modern extension. Room had clearly not been refurbished in many years and was not of 5 star hotel standard. Receptionist offered to move me  to a suite for an extra payment of E1000 per night. When I said no, that I would not pay E1000, I was told I could have the suite for E500. When I again said that our expense policy would not allow me to make a supplementary payment, I was told I could have the suite for E200. Weird discussion... 

So ended up staying in the room as no alternative solution could be found. The air-conditioning unit was incredibly loud, constant lorry reversing/ loading and unloading outside the room and moving of bins through on the pavement/adjacent yard kept me awake from 4am. The small shower only provided a trickle of water in the morning. 

When I checked out, I spoke with the receptionist and she only said 'we have never heard that the room is noisy' before handing me the bill. Really felt ignored and will not use the hotel again.",1,2014,07,18
200,No 1 in trip advisor for a reason,"We decided to start our honeymoon rely an spent two nights prior to travelling to the states in the merrion hotel.
We were lucky enough to be staying in a suite ""the packenham suite"" what luxury, gorgeous bed and bedlinens, separate seating area,separate dressing area and huge bathroom with separate bath and shower. Shortly after checking in the management sent up a bottle of champagne congratulating us on our wedding, very nice touch.
The staff we encountered were all so friendly and helpful, we were walked to our suite by the receptionist who showed us around the suite.
We ate in the cellar restaurant for breakfast on one morning and we both left completely satisfied.
Whilst my husband enjoyed the pool and spa, I enjoyed the art afternoon tea, a luxury but well worth it. I have had afternoon at some other 5 star hotels in Dublin and the merrion is top of the list!!
Many thanks to the manager Peter McKenna and all his wonderful staff who made our stay such a special and memorable one",5,2014,07,17
200,Excellent stay at the merrion,"My family and I stayed at the merrion last May . From start to finish it was a joy. Staff very friendly and helpful.  We had adjoining rooms, beautifully decorated, overlooking the garden. Great location. Wonderful room service menu with a fabulous selection for children. Afternoon tea is a must but make sure to prebook.   We enjoyed our stay so much that upon departure we rebooked for the following month.",5,2014,07,17
200,An excellent hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel.  The concierge, receptionists and bar staff are friendly, professional, attentive but not intrusive.  There is a very homely feel to this hotel and we felt completely relaxed in the gorgeous surroundings.  The room was very well appointed with plenty of amenities - the tv could have been larger - but this is only a small gripe.  The bathrobe and slippers were the best I have ever received in any hotel!  Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay here.  This is a haven from the busy Dublin streets - and more tranquil than any of the other major Dublin hotels yet not lacking in atmosphere.  A delight to visit!",5,2014,07,15
200,Perfect Place to Stay,"The Merrion Hotel thinks of all the things a traveler could need.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and very quiet.  The mattress and pillows are very comfortable.  The bath towels are soft and thick.  Every evening we would return to our room to find water by the bedside, slippers laid out and fresh towels in the bathroom. It was define. 
The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance of everything!  The staff is friendly and attentive to your every need.  Our visit to Dublin was wonderful and the Merrion Hotel helped make our visit very memorable.",5,2014,07,14
200,Great stay,Recently stayed for two nights. Got the night crew on arrival who were ok but offered no suggestions on what to do or where to go as we had an very early morning arrival and rooms weren't available. Wish they had suggested to us when booking to book an extra night. When we arrived at the hotel later in the afternoon it was another world. The service and staff were amazing. Top notch in every way. The room was large and the beds were very comfortable. The room service set up and delivery was excellent too. Wish we had more time to stay here. We will book again.,5,2014,07,13
200,Fully deserves its 5 stars and its #1 TripAdvisor ranking,"A hotel with its own art collection, beautiful prints on every corridor, elegant furnishings, super-professional staff, great location, brilliant (if pricey) breakfasts, huge comfy beds, deep baths, crisp linens, relaxing and yet stylish décor, quiet dark bedrooms, wonderful public spaces, a courtyard garden, sculptures, log fires, chandeliers, great curtains, a convivial cellar bar.

Just perfect for a special occasion get-away. We loved it! And not as expensive as you'd think, when you compare the service and quality to what you typically get in (say) London.

If I could give The Merrion 6 stars I would.",5,2014,07,13
200,5 stars well deserved!,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was perfect! Everything that is great about a hotel can be said about the Merrion. It is located in a nice area of Dublin, walking distance to popular areas like Grafton Street and many great restaurants and pubs. Rooms are large and spotlessly clean, with large bathrooms, great shower/tub and high quality amenities. The breakfast in the Cellar restaurant was wonderful with both continental breakfast and separate made-to-order hot items.

Enough good things can't be said about the service (including the reception, concierge staff, room service, housekeeping, restaurant staff, etc.) - everyone we met was incredibly pleasant, helpful and diligent and this made our stay stress free and very enjoyable. Other hotels should send their staff to the Merrion for training!",5,2014,07,12
200,True 5-star hotel!,"This place is simply amazing! Gorgeous hotel with great people that are genuinely looking foward to make your stay perfect, from the time you step in until you leave.

Spacious room with luxurious bed, and probably the best pillows I ever had in my life! Slept like a baby! Spectacular and spacious bathroom with separate stand-up shower and bath. All that for around 200euros per night, which I considered to be GREAT value!

Don't bother going anywhere else if you go to Dublin!",5,2014,07,10
200,"Perfect, as always","This is one of  my favorite hotels, which again proves that luxury and warmth can go together.  The way the staff greets you, the perfection of the service, and the charm of the rooms add up wot what was a great stay for me.",5,2014,07,09
200,"Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","My wife and I stayed for three nights at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, May 28 - May 31, 2014.  I could not say more positive things about this hotel.  It is located in a very delightful section of the city, the Georgian section near Merrion Park.  It was close to most everything.  The staff was extremely helpful and attentive.  The room was very luxurious...we were delighted.  We were looking for a comfortable place to stay that was within walking distance to all parts of the city and we found exactly what we wanted.  It was very close to Trinity College and St. Stevens Green.  We will definitely return next year!  W. Thyne, New York, USA.",5,2014,07,08
200,Lovely hotel let down by breakfast service,"We’ve overnighted here twice in the past year. It’s a very comfortable hotel in a central location. 

Staff are excellent, rooms are spacious and comfortable. Lounges are perfect for lounging and the internal garden is a very pleasant oasis – weather permitting.  

The only negative we found, on both visits, was the breakfast service. The first time the breakfast room was about half-full, the staff seemed to be poorly organised, under pressure and took a long time to take our order and bring our food. 
On this latest visit, we were almost the first down to breakfast. Despite this, the service was very slow and my perfectly cooked poached eggs were almost cold when they eventually arrived. I’d have sent them back but couldn’t face the further delay in having them replaced. 

It’s a pity to have one’s very positive overall experience of the hotel marred by the poor service for one’s final meal there.",4,2014,07,07
200,A very special place,"I don't write that many reviews but wanted to after my recent 3 night stay at the Merrion. This hotel is sheer class. Situated in one of Dublin's most beautiful areas near St Stephens green it is located near the main shopping areas and many great bars and restaurants.

I've stayed in a few great hotels all over the world but the Merrion takes the biscuit and had the best staff I've ever encountered, they were outstanding in every possible way. 

We rented their bikes and cycled all over Dublin, enjoyed dinner there one evening and had drinks in the cellar bar and the residents bar. The rooms, grounds and spa were beautiful.

A review can't do this hotel justice. All I'll say is that I'll never stay in another hotel in Dublin again.",5,2014,07,07
200,The best hotel in the world!,"The only place to stay in Dublin is The Merrion Hotel. The fabulous rooms, service and location cannot be beat! Between sightseeing and business, it was always a joy to retreat to the drawing room for afternoon tea or a pre-dinner cocktail. Our server, Alexandre, was especially helpful and fun to chat with. I look forward to visiting the Merrion in the future.",5,2014,07,07
200,A Holly Golightly Place,"To me the Merrion Hotel is the what Tiffany is to Holly Golightly - nothing bad can happen here. It is a special place. It isn't cheap - it is a treat and we can't afford to spend more than one or two nights at a time here, we have always been treated in thee same courteous manner by all members of staff. The rooms are furnished in a traditional manner, always well equipped and decorated with attention to detail. Breakfast in the room is a special moment and the amazing art collection, throughout the building makes the stay even more special. 
Yesterday we unexpectedly received an upgrade to a beautiful room, it made my week end! Thank you Merrion Hotel for looking so well after your clients. As long as I spend week ends in Dublin, I will stay there.",5,2014,07,06
200,Wedding Anniversary,"We stayed at the Merrion in June to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful, elegant and staying there made the weekend really special. Our welcome by the doormen and being escorted into reception was amazing. 
We booked a deal which included champagne in our room and a 3 course meal in the Cellar restaurant which was very good. I was a tiny bit disappointed that reception or the restaurant weren't aware of our anniversary given I had mentioned this on emails to the reservations team and assumed this would be passed on but no big deal. 
Breakfast the first morning wasn't great, with lots of little problems. This was bought to the duty manager's notice who did apologise and everything was 100% the next morning. The quality of the cooked breakfast was great but I didn't think the cold buffet selection was overwhelming. 
The swimming pool was very nice and very clean.
The location was great for exploring the rest of Dublin and I wouldn't  hesitate to recommend the Merrion especially for a special occasion. ",5,2014,07,06
200,The best afternoon tea ever!,"We travelled from Southampton to Dublin just for afternoon tea! It actually only cost the same as going to London on the train. We have had quite a few afternoon teas I so e wonderful places but this was the best. We arrived to a table all set for us with a view of the wonderful log fire. The too was very elegant . The staff we absolutely wonderful. So attentive. As vegetarians we rarely find we get delicious sandwiches, they always seem to be soggy vegetables! Not here. They were wonderful, they understood that we do eat cheese and eggs. We then went on to delicious scones, we loved the lemon curd as well as the raspberry jam. And then on to a great assortment of cake. And if that wasn't enough you,then have course two! The impressive art cakes. The whole experience was faultless. We will definitely return next year to repeat the experience.  This is a must do!",5,2014,07,05
200,"Lovely stay, great location","I was traveling with cousins who always stay at the Merrion. I confess it is usually out of my price range when I'm in Dublin, but this was definitely at treat. First the positives, of which there are many. You are greeted at the Merrion by every, and I mean every, staff member you encounter. The training of the staff and their quality is evident from the moment you arrive. They are very responsive to each guest and go out of their way to be helpful and welcoming. Housekeeping is lurking, I swear, behind the potted plants for the moment you leave your room to make it perfect for you before your return. The toiletries in the bathroom are Asprey and far and away the best I have ever encountered. I confess I ""pilfered"" ever bar of the soap they left in my room, and they very kindly left two morning and evening. The bellmen deserve special mention as well. They were a welcome site every time we returned to the hotel and so very helpful with bags, cabs, directions, recommendations, anything and everything. 
The Cellar Restaurant served an ample and wonderful breakfast each morning which was a part of our package, and, it must be said, I would not gave availed myself of if it had been a separate charge because of the expense. We had dinner there one evening, and as good as the dinner was, and it was phenomenal, the service was even better. I really tip my hat to the Merrion's attention to training and detail. 
The only negatives are few and maybe a little picky but the service in the Cellar bar was a little diffident and unenergetic, perhaps because of the volume. Perhaps because the service is so very good in the rest of the hotel, the lack of perfection there was more obvious. The last thing is the overall cost of staying at the Merrion. Our room (first floor/garden wing) was nice but nothing to write home about. The bathroom was quite nice, but the shower was on the tight side. And the cost was a bit breathtaking for me. I think as a treat, and because of the service, it was ultimately worth it, but it is costly to stay. Overall though, well done!",4,2014,07,04
200,Exceptional Service with Amazing Amenities,"I echo the other reviewers in that the service at the Merrion is exceptional.  All of my quirky requests were greeted with a smile and immediate response.  So, don't hesitate to ask for whatever you need; I am confident the staff will work their magic for you.

I was in the Lord Antrim suite and it is spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom amenities are Asprey, which I really love, and everything you can need is provided for you (cotton swabs, robes, cozy slippers, shower cap, etc., etc., etc.).  Plenty of fluffy towels and a lighted make up mirror (which I found pretty useless because it doesn't extend out from the wall, so unless you are very tall, it doesn't really work).  Each room was very large, but surprisingly the shower stall is very small and as usual (I can't tell you how many times I've mentioned this) there is about 6 square inches of shelf space in the shower, which is not nearly enough.  I am mystified why hotels don't put more shelf space in their showers, as it is a real practicality and not having it is a real annoyance.  

The TVs worked great, but the internet was strange in that there is only a one day log in so I had to keep logging in each day.  Seemed unnecessary and I would recommend that the hotel try to remedy this. There were great books in my suite which I delightedly browsed and a small bit of terrific whiskey was offered complementary.  The bed and bedding are great and there is plenty of closet and drawer space.  

Also, at times, it seemed understaffed at the door (short of porters and doormen).  However, I ordered room service and it was delicious and prompt with very friendly service .  Housekeeping had a few missteps, but they were remedied without issue.  The concierge printed out my boarding pass for me without trouble.  I used both the pool and the spa and they are excellent.  Unfortunately, the day I used the pool it was full of a family (I think) and they were screaming and splashing, so it wasn't as restful as I had hoped.  I wish the hotel would reserve a half an hour or so just for adults.  My spa experience was terrific and I wouldn't hesitate to use it again.

The hotel itself has a strange layout.  There are two buildings connected by a glassed in walkway which goes through the middle of a lovely garden.  If you are in the main building, you cannot get to the spa without going through the lobby or winding your way down some stairs, and at least 2 elevators, which is a labyrinth.  The reason I mention this is that if you want to change into your robe before going to the spa, you will have to trek though the main reception areas.  I went once in my clothes and had to come back carrying a wet bathing suit.  The next time, I didn't care and walked right through the public sitting rooms in my robe and slippers.  This is the second luxury hotel I have stayed in around the world where this is the case and it frustrates me greatly.  I would like to go directly down one elevator to the spa, discreetly. And with all the incredible amenities the hotel provides, I was very surprised not to find a spa bag to use; one for sundries and a wet bathing suit, to use between the room and the spa.  Perhaps this is something the hotel could provide in the future.

Nevertheless, this is a great hotel with service around every turn.  You will not be disappointed with either their effort or the location.",5,2014,07,02
200,The Merrion,"I can't say enough about how wonderful The Merrion Hotel is.  My husband ended up in the hospital and the hotel bent over backwards for me.  I will be forever grateful to them for their kindness.  The service is wonderful, the people who work there are kind and caring.  Definitely a 5 star hotel.",5,2014,07,02
200,Most comfortable bed i have ever slept in,"We only stayed here for one night but that was still enough to make me want to leave a good review. As soon as we arrived....we went to the wrong door but someone came running out to help us get to the right door and carry our cases, check in was very easy and quick then we went up to our room, lovely big bed and very clean. The next day we went for a walk but it started raining just as we walked out, we needn't have worried someone came running out with an umbrella for us, great service! We checked out which was again very easy and quick and then went an used the spa facilities as our flight wasn't until later, amazing, the biggest pool you have ever seen, steam room and more, even the changing rooms have everything you could need. over all very pleasant stay!",4,2014,07,02
200,Very nice. Good location,"After learning that the Shelburne was fully booked, we found the Merrion. It really is a very nice hotel with good service. We had a king garden room with huge windows that overlooked a small garden courtyard. The room was spacious, the bed comfortable and the bathroom was large and beautiful. The shower was nice and hot with good water pressure. Don't you hate it when the hotel shower stinks?
The location was very good. Close enough to walk to pretty much everything. We strolled easily to St. Stephen's Green, which is a beautiful small park.

The service at the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered room service the following morning and it was right on time, beautifully served and kept very hot. 

We had the art tea in the afternoon. The tea was delicious and the sandwiches and pastries were very good. We were a little disappointed that with the ""art"" part of it. While the desserts represent the paintings in the hotel, we thought they would be exact little replicas of the paintings themselves. Still worth it for the experience and deliciousness, not so much for the art. 

We didn't get the use the beautiful hotel pool that we saw in the photos. We were planning to. Sorry to have missed that. It looks beautiful. 

A very good choice if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2014,07,02
200,Impeccable service,"This is a very expensive hotel, centrally located near Merrion Square, and walking distance to St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College. Our family of 9 travelers, ages 6-80, enjoyed our stay and can't speak highly enough of the staff, from doormen to receptionists to concierges to maids to waiters. They were all unfailingly polite and attentive. This is the kind of place where our youngest child was welcomed with a pint-sized hotel robe and tiny slippers. Can recommend for families willing to pay for luxurious service. ",5,2014,07,01
200,Wow!,We stayed for three nights while in Dublin and had a great experience at The Merrion.  The service is outstanding and you are taken care of the minute you pull up.  The facility itself is beautiful with gardens and tea rooms.  Everyone was exceptionally helpful and friendly (although the concierge lacked a little in friendliness).  The location is excellent and everything is within walking distance.,5,2014,07,01
200,Wedding of John and Mary Hanly,This 5 star hotel should be a 6 star hotel as its service and attention to details is trully fantastic...I attended a wedding and it was one of the best wedding I have ever attended...I was a Wedding Planner up to a few yrs ago and I have never experienced the luxury that this hotel has to offer...each of the staff were so professional and friendly. This was trully a fantastic experience and a brilliant wedding...well done to all...Josephine,5,2014,06,30
200,World-class. Exceptional.,"The Merrion Hotel is located in the Georgian quarter of Dublin, which makes it close enough to walk or take a quick taxi/bus ride to most major attractions. It is distant enough from Temple Bar  and other popular tourist areas such that the Merrion retains an air of quiet elegance and feels like a reprieve from the hustle of the rest of the city. It is a historic property with one of the largest private art collections in Europe but has been converted to a modern hotel with all the amenities a luxury property can afford its guests. It is conveniently located on the sight-seeing hop on - hop off bus tour and round the corner from some famous and wonderfully charismatic pubs. Service is exquisite - possibly the best I have ever had. There is no request that the staff will not attend to on your behalf in a competent and gracious manner. The concierge is able to make taxi bookings, concert and restaurant reservations, offer location advice, and sell tickets to all the main Dublin attractions, not to mention provide an umbrella on a rainy day or arrange airport transfer. All the hotel restaurants are of the highest quality although the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant requires reservations well in advance of your visit. A particular highlight of this hotel is that they offer the High Art Tea, which is the best high tea I have experienced - delicious, decadent, and the desserts are inspired by the hotel's own art work. The rooms are large, comfortable, and both the street and garden views offer excellent views. There is complimentary water, fruit, and chocolates placed in your room daily as well as a nightly turn-down service. Complimentary WiFi is available throughout the hotel. This is truly a lovely hotel with exceptional service and amenities and subsequently, expect to pay handsomely for the privilege of staying here. That being said, it is without question, our place to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,06,29
200,Amazing hotel in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed here for only one night but I wish it had been longer. This hotel was wonderful. The rooms and beds were clean and comfortable, the concierge was very informative and helpful and the garden was just beautiful. Location is perfect too - close to many great attractions and hotels.
The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 was that the WiFi service was terrible. I had planned to do some work from my room but was unable to due to really terrible WiFi connection.",4,2014,06,25
200,What every hotel should  be,"perfect stay and perfect place;) close to everything , a wonderfull  ( large ) pool , large rooms, nice garden and especially wonderfull staff: every one had a smile everytime . As it was my wife bithday , we had on top of that  a fruit basket , some chocolates; a garden view, the bikes to ride to phoenix park were free; etcetcetc",5,2014,06,25
200,A great hotel in Dublin,"I'm slightly ambivalent about the Merrion.  It's a beautiful building in a great location but the service provided at the front of house lets the place down.  
A luxury hotel needs to be run smoothly at all times, not to have to keep calling to remind the staff that things need to be done. Apologies are swift - and generous -  but better not get to that stage. The front desk needs to sharpen its act and the porters at the front need to be more American - greet, chat rather than looking like bouncers lurking around.
Rooms are lovely, well appointed (but come on - do you think your guests want instant coffee?  A press and some ground coffee in the rooms, please) and everything is excellent.  The 2-star Michelin in the building is worth a try; the Cellar restaurant does great seafood but needs some marketing as it was a bit of Crypt when we ate there.  Beautiful garden.  I'd definitely return.",5,2014,06,24
200,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"I took my girlfriend to Dublin for the night, and booked the champagne getaway. When we arrived, we were informed that we got an upgrade to a junior suite (I think I had pulled the heart strings a little...) 
The room was so good we didn't really want to leave. It was huge, and everything is lavish and luxurious. The bed is about 2feet higher than any other I have stayed in, and the turn down team made everything look pristine.
We ordered champagne to the room and it arrived promptly and with a smile. And this is the USP of the Merrion - the service is out of this world. Example - you leave car with hotel and they take it away and park it for you. I left my coat in the car, my stupid fault. I told the concierge that I needed my coat, he was immediately on the phone to get it retrieved and apolgised for the delay. I said ""Don't worry, I'm an eejit"" - he wouldn't have it. He remained apologetic for the delay, all 2mins of it. But his apologising wasn't OTT or uncomfortable, just a genuine fella doing a great job.
The spa is awesome too, infinity pool is terrific so relaxing and therapeutic. Breakfast was delicious, really good quality - which frankly you come to take for granted.
Oh, and the Cellar Bar is wonderfully atmospheric.
Book a stay in this hotel, hope for an upgrade (if you aren't lucky enough to have a spare 1,000EUR) and revel in the luxury.",5,2014,06,22
200,A Hotel that will give you memories to last a lifetime..,We stayed in the Merrion Hotel as we were celebrating a graduation. The lobby has beautiful furniture and sofas where one can sit down and relax. Afternoon tea is well worth having and is an experience that is not costly for the service you get. The room was great and had everything one could want but its design and colour of materials used made the room into a room I can still remember.  The service was top class and the breakfast was as expected great..I would rank it as the best hotel in dublin to stay in.,5,2014,06,21
200,Air-condition mars the rating,"Merrion hotel is rated #1 at Tripadvisor and also highly recommended by my friends from the US. Stayed 2 nights at their Deluxe King room. 
Staff at reception, gym, restaurant are friendly and ready to help. The gym opens at 0630 but they made an exception for me to go at 5am. 
Reception guy name Tomas is very helpful, upon seeing me at 5am walking to the gym, he followed me there as he's worried the gym staff in charge has probably fell asleep/not there. 

Couldn't rate it 5 star as my room air-condition failed to work. Maintenance guy came first evening couldn't rectify it. Next morning I rang reception and the manager in charge told me she'll see to it. 
We came back after a day's trip and air-condition still fails to work. Told them and maintenance guy came again. I got a standing fan but it was noisy and unable to make the room cool down. We were sweating in our room on both nights. Upon checking out, told the friendly reception that they shouldn't give out room that has faulty air-condition. He apologize but I felt unimpressed by this whole episode. Merrion could have done a lot better. 
Good location, wifi works well and very good restaurant Patrick Guibaud but please make reservation in advance.",4,2014,06,21
200,weekend retreat,"just what the dr ordered. we have had  lovely time as usual, we love it here, flights in and out great, hotel never lets us down, well done the emerald island, will always return, home fro home....bless you xx",5,2014,06,19
200,Art Afternoon Tea at the Merrion Hotel,"Afternoon Tea at the Merrion Hotel is treated as an experience of not only the lovely food provided but also the art on display in the Hotel.  The staff are charming and most helpful, particularly Alice who took care of us on the day of our visit. The cost is €36 per per person with an additional charge if champagne is partaken.  There are big fireplaces in the room with open fires lighting which add to the cosy atmosphere.  We did not feel rushed at any stage and the staff were very attentive in a discreet way.  Art Aternoon Tea at the Merrion should be considered as an experience and  treat.",5,2014,06,19
200,Quaint and elegant stay in Dublin,"This hotel was recommended to me from friends who live in Dublin. The location is great - within walking distance to everything and in a very safe, quiet part of town. We arrived at the hotel from our Transatlantic flight around 9:30am. Through the hotel concierge, I arranged the airport pickup. Excellent transfer and a very courteous driver who gave a quick rundown of Dublin and the area surrounding the Merrion. Upon arrival, we were informed the rooms were not yet ready (we did not expect them to be), but to have some breakfast and check back to see if they were. We did just that and found out the rooms would be ready closer to 12:30. We went for a stroll and checked back to the hotel at 1:00. The rooms were not yet ready. How disappointing - especially after a tiring journey. We sat in the lobby awaiting our room. It did not become available until 2:30. The staff was very apologetic and did their best, but it would've been best to not have given a 12:30 time for the room to be ready if they couldn't guarantee that. I think the hotel was very busy for that weekend and left the staff a bit flustered. 

Once the rooms were ready, all the stress melted away and we were fortunate to have a room upgrade to a Junior suite. We had two rooms total, separate floors, but both so beautifully appointed and unique in their styles. Cannot find a single thing to complain about with these rooms. 

Turn down service was excellent and much appreciated after a long day in Dublin. Beds are extremely comfortable. Bathroom products were excellent and the bathtub provided much relaxation. The tea kettle with tea bags or instant coffee was great in the evenings/mornings. 

I received a welcoming treat of a bottle of Bailey's and a box of chocolates - quite a delight and treat. The Merrion truly knows how to add on extra touches everywhere. 

The property itself is unassuming from the outside and overwhelming once inside. The seating areas in the lobby and tea rooms are comfortable and cozy with fireplaces going (the fireplaces in the room are just for show). The garden is so peaceful and well maintained. The restaurant, The Cellar, is beautiful. 

Each morning we had breakfast in The Cellar - it was excellent and the staff were very easygoing and pleasant to deal with. By the second morning, our preference of tea and coffee were known and brought out immediately. Very attentive staff all around. 

Dinner in The Cellar was nothing spectacular. The staff for dinner weren't as attentive and friendly as the breakfast staff are. We had a better dinner another night at Hugo's down the road. 

Our time in Dublin was too short, but well spent at the Merrion - truly a home away from home. I cannot wait to return!",5,2014,06,19
200,Excellent,"My wife and I have stayed here many times over the years for business and leisure. I can't stress how wonderful the place is. Staff are lovely, food and drink very special and the hotel itself is a beautiful place to be. Just a short walk to St. Stephen's Green and the city centre. Will be back soon!!!",5,2014,06,19
200,"Very nice, quiet, clean, and special place",We really enjoyed are stay here. Very nice place with quiet nights. It nice to get some rest when you have been out on town all night. We found it to be super clean and the people were very friendly and helpful,5,2014,06,18
200,Elegance,"From the moment you walk in the door the service you receive is simply unrivalled.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with the turn down service being an added treat.  The location is as good as it gets and the valet parking service is very efficient.

One criticism was our Afternoon Tea Experience.  Service was very slow and attention was only attracted when we attempted to pour our own tea.  Furthermore despite informing the staff before ordering that one of the party had a nut allergy they served two hazelnut desserts to them.  The staff were very apologetic, offering a complimentary drink, however we were soon asked to vacate before being offered our second choice of tea.  

Overall the hotel still gets 5 stars and I hope our Tea experience was a one-off!",5,2014,06,15
200,Very comfortable - Recommended,"The Merrion is an upscale hotel well located in Dublin, suitable for business or personal travel.  The staff is excellent.

The room we had was on a lower floor but very comfortable, with a large bathroom and comfortable bed and pillows.  The room was quiet and clean.

No real drawbacks to mention, I would stay there again without hesitation (although we didn't receive any upgrade as other reviewers did...).  Early check in (around 1pm) would have been nice after our flight from SFO.  The TV controls could have been more intuitive, and the TV could have been larger for this class hotel (about 24"").",4,2014,06,15
200,The great Dublin hotel,"I actually went there in March a few years ago (and I catch up on my hotel reviews during my holidays!) to visit different Dublin locations for an event (and stayed at the Merrion). The Merrion is a true LHW, elegant, in very good condition, brilliantly managed). The hotel manager himself sorted out a few mishaps and was a true gentleman (while at other lhw/slh hotels you never see the manager as they 'outsource problems to their employees/line managers). This hotel is perfect for any kind of trip (business, romance, city trip, a girls week-end, etc). The only flaw ? Maybe the fact that to go to some rooms you have to cross half of the hotel ground floor and I didn t like to 'bother' people having tea to go to my room, but that was due to the hotel architecture. Should I come back to Dublin, I ll come back to the Merrion!",5,2014,06,15
200,First Class,"Perfect Service, first class rooms, great food amazing location. I could go on but I have to say, if you get a chance to stay in Dublin, stay at the Merrion you will not be disappointed. The bar is open 24 hours for residents and food is also available. The log fires in the lounges are a nice touch and the gardens, which are immaculate , also impressive.",5,2014,06,15
200,Perfect hotel,We stayed for just one night and wished it could gave been longer. Lovely welcome as we arrived with valet parking. Hotel close to most areas of interest but taxis waiting outside the hotel if we needed to go further. Stayed in a garden room which was large and comfortable. The turn down service at night was fantastic with fresh towels and the room tidied. Breakfast lovely and staff could not have been more helpful. This was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in and will be coming back ,5,2014,06,14
200,Super service in a great location,"Classy hotel in the centre of Dublin. We were upgraded to a very nice suite, large area in both rooms and a well equipped bathroom. A little more space for toiletries on the bathroom vanity would be good. We ate in the  Patrick Guilbaud restaurant which was excellent.

We enjoyed walking the streets and parks and returning the comfort of the hotel.

Well worth a visit.",5,2014,06,14
200,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"We received an upgrade upon checking into the merrion. Our suite was larger than most NYC apartments. We stayed in the older side of the hotel & although the property could use some tlc, this did not diminish the positive experience in staying here. Extremely comfortable, well planned out space. Staff at the hotel are all extremely friendly &  welcoming. Centrally located so all of our sight seeing efforts were done on foot. Definitely would recommend to friends & would return here in a heartbeat.",5,2014,06,13
200,Sky high tea,"Had afternoon tea here recently. A new must on my visits to Dublin. Was never an afternoon tea person but a bit of bubbly with Paul's art tea is now a ""thing"" I reckon.

Didn't stay but what I did experience leads me to think the rating is well deserved",5,2014,06,11
200,Absolutely Lovely Hotel!,"Really well situated in close proximity to St Stephen's Square and not too far off Dublin's famous Grafton Street.

This hotel is really lovely. Very classy and comfortable. I travel a lot and am fortunate to stay in some amazing hotels all around the world but there is something really nice about the Merrion that makes it quite special. No matter what time of year I have stayed there the charming sitting room and bar have the most wonderful smell of peat from the open fireplaces. 

The staff are really professional and very helpful. The rooms and bathrooms are well appointed and of large proportions. Excellent, high ceilings. 

My only two small criticisms are that, having stayed there a number of times since 2001 I have noticed that it is starting to show signs of wear and tear and, secondly, whilst they do have wi-fi it is not constant and drops off frequently. Neither point will prevent me staying there again.",4,2014,06,11
200,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here 3 night for new year. Super location  to get around Dublin and quiet area. Restaurant and lounge bar staff first class, food excellent. Rooms extremely well furnished so elegant.  Only issue was attitude of reception on check in seemed rather superior and allocated us poor ground  floor room next to kitchen, back entrance and view of brick wall of garage not city as booked - even though we arrived early and waited patiently until check in time. They moved us up 2 floors but I'll not forget the experience. Overall lovely hotel.",4,2014,06,10
200,Fantastic Afternoon Tea!!,"We went to the Merrion for afternoon tea recently to celebrate a special occasion. It was absolutely fantastic. Everything was perfect. The setting was beautiful. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
The food was really lovely. The sandwiches, scones and cakes were very tasty. The second course of the three cakes based on the art in the hotel was such a treat. We had a wonderful afternoon in the Merrion and I can't recommend the afternoon tea highly enough!",5,2014,06,10
200,Lovely but needs updating,"Great location (as per Shelbourne and Westbury) but a more intimate atmosphere (smell of turf fire, luxury service etc.) vs. Shelbourne (ground floor packed) and Westbury (also a little busy).

Would agree with all the past positive reviews however it is getting tired and needs upgrading - bathrooms are too old fashioned and the wi-fi is very patchy - time to invest some money back?",3,2014,06,10
200,Absolutely Divine!,"Stayed here many times, last time luck was on our side and we got an unexpected upgrade which made our stay here even more special.  Everything about this hotel is just perfect, the rooms are beautifully decorated and absolutely spotless clean.
The 5 star service is friendly, charming and professional.  Food is great in the restaurant and bar but the afternoon tea is a real treat ""not to be missed"".  My absolute favourite hotel.  Will be back again.",5,2014,06,09
200,Wonderful introduction to Irish Hospitality!,"My daughter and I stayed two nights at the Merrion and agree with many of the other reviews....It is in a class by itself....that right mix of formality and hospitality.

We did not get a chance to eat in the fine dining restaurant...but, the casual venue was incredible.

Would never consider staying anywhere else in Dublin!

Great Location but tucked into a quiet street...",5,2014,06,05
200,Perfect Hotel for anyone who likes to be pampered,My husband and I stayed for one night when we were going to the opera in Dublin. I cannot fault any aspect of the hotel. the room and bathroom were spotless and everything was of the highest quality .We can't wait to go back!,5,2014,06,05
200,Do yourself a favor and STAY HERE!,"My husband & I spent 3 nights at the Merrion and I nearly started to cry when it was time to leave. This hotel is perfect! We travel alot and have stayed in some amazing hotels around the world. There's something really special about the Merrion that sets it apart. Its incredibly charming and quaint but incredibly luxurious at the same time. The staff was so wonderful. The grounds were lovely, location is great and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous. We upgraded to a king suite - definitely worth the money. I could've stayed here for weeks!",5,2014,06,03
200,Fantastic non ostentatious,"Our driver taking us to The Merrion from the airport claimed this is the best hotel in Dublin, and I think he may know what he was talking about . From the outside you'd barely know it's a hotel,  us from the greeting at the door, upgrade to a great suite, the friendliness, and helpfulness of the concierge, this place was a treat. Great drawing room for drinks and or tea. Lovely things to look at. And a very nice spa.",5,2014,06,02
200,First Class,"The Merrion Hotel, in my opinion, is in a class by itself.  The property is very well run and the staff are most helpful and friendly.  The hotel is in an excellent location in central Dublin.  The City Sightseeing Bus Stop is a short distance away, as is Grafton Street and other shopping.  On either side of the hotel, also short walks away, are two lovely parks -- Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green.  Another plus is the large garden and patio behind the older Main building of the hotel. This provides a green oasis that most of the other top hotels, that I saw, do not have.  The newer Garden wing rooms look out onto this greenery.

I highly recommend this hotel looking to anyone looking for the best hotel in Dublin.",5,2014,06,01
200,Wonderful place,"We spend a weekend in Dublin.  The Merrion is a wonderful place of understated class.  The level of service and the friendliness of the employees is just great.  We just had a standard room but if that's Merrion standard, you can give us that any day.  We didn't dine in the hotel but we had breakfast every day - again, the quality was great always. Concierge helped us with restaurant bookings and did a brilliant job. We also used the Spa and had some treatments - very nice experience.  Long story short, if we go back to Dublin, we'll go to The Merrion.",5,2014,06,01
200,"Great Location, Service and Comfortable Rooms","This hotel is in a great location to Dublin's city center. Do not expect a grand entrance-the lobby is quite small with a concierge desk to your right as you enter-it is a series of four connected townhomes so you walk though a few rooms to gain entrance to reception and the bar. We had superior garden wing rooms- in the basement so dont expect a nice view. That being said, the rooms were spacious, comfortable beds, silky sheets with plenty of wardrobe space, an electronic kettle with tea and coffee fixings, a hairdryer that worked very well and a bathroom with both a tub and shower. The staff are wonderful, they seem to genuinely care to be helpful. The breakfast in the Cellar restaurant was very good (recommend the bed and breakfast rate). They offer nightly turn down service. The inner garden is quite lovely. This hotel is a respite for the weary traveler-if you are looking for noise and excitement book the Shelburne. Our only disappointment is we didnt have time to book the afternoon tea.",5,2014,05,31
200,Top Class!,"Where do I start?  Excellent weekend spent at the Merrion Hotel.  Food was superb, room was lovely and staff were more than helpful and very pleasant.  Loved the turndown service  and all the little touches which made our stay very special. I couldn't recommend it enough!",5,2014,05,30
200,One of the Best,"From check in to check out, everything about this hotel oozes class, professional service, friendliness and relaxation.  My three nights in this lovely city hotel were absolutely perfect - and I usually find something, even something little to be concerned about.  The rooms were beyond clean, well-appointed and restful.  Restaurant food in the hotel left no reason to venture outside for meals.  Staff highly trained yet approachable.  What more can I say!",5,2014,05,29
200,Absolute treasure in Dublin,"I stayed at The Merrion Hotel for 2 nights in May. It is an absolutely fabulous property with beautiful rooms and an outstanding staff! Our luxurious room was huge with a king bed in the newer garden wing which was very quiet. After an overnight flight from the states we checked our bags and were able to shower and change clothes in the Spa.  Our bags were already in our room when we were able to check in later in the day. We had dinner at The Cellar Bar which was good. Afternoon tea in the drawing room was a delightful experience. Their own small bar off of the drawing room is very nice for a quiet drink. All of the staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. I made reservations 6 months in advance and got an incredible rate through the hotel's website. This is truly the nicest property that I have ever stayed in with a staff that gives outstanding service.
The concierge recommended several restaurants including Matt the Thresher for  Sunday night dinner. It is near the hotel and excellent. Treat yourself to this hotel; the location is excellent.",5,2014,05,28
200,extraordinary hotel,"I've been a guest of the Merrion more than twenty times. I look forward to each visit.  

Some notable features of the Merrion: It's a brownstone, and from the outside does not look at all like a hotel. It's across the street from the remarkable structure that is innocuously called 'government buildings.' It's in an area of the city that feels close to everything: St. Stephen Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, the Book of Kells and the Long Room at Trinity, and excellent restaurants including Michelin star winning Guilbaud's (which adjoins the hotel) and L'Ecrevain, and also Ely's Wine Bar, the Pearl Brasserie, Hugo's, the Bang Cafe, and Chez Max, and the hotel's own Cellar Restaurant, among others. Pubs abound, including O'Donohues across the street, which is Dublin's center of Irish music sessions (every night starting around nine), but also Doheny's around the block and Toner's down the street. The neighborhood feels a lot like Manhattan's Greenwich Village. 

The hotel rooms are elegant, and the staff are remarkably well-trained and helpful. They make one  feel like one lives there. The modest spa has a great pool, a steam room and a sauna room, and full toiletries for guests. Massages are expensive but well worth it. (Dublin is an expensive city.)

I can appreciate why Bruce Springsteen stays in the Merrion's penthouse suite when he's in town.",5,2014,05,28
200,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.,"We picked the Merrion from the trip advisor web page as just about everyone has something good to say about the place. We were not disappointed, a first class hotel, right in the centre of Dublin. Everything about this place is special, the hotel décor, the gardens and the room were all superb. But what makes it an outstanding hotel is the staff and the high standard of service that they provide. Everything from the chauffer who picked us up at the ferry port to the concierge guys and the bar staff were all top notch. The best of the best though were without a shadow of  doubt the housekeeping staff, the turn down service staff in particular, who provided little bedside mats, slippers, replenished toiletries and with their attention to every detail they were absolutely phenomenal. They made us feel like royalty. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.",5,2014,05,28
200,High Class in Dublin,"Best hotel in Dublin, hands down.  Everyone who worked there during our stay was exceptionally nice and went out of their way to ensure we had a lovely stay.  We requested a quiet room and were put at the end of the 2nd floor facing the garden.  We had a quiet and comfortable nights sleep in our king bed.  Room service was great, and the shower had hot water and great water pressure (something that we found was hard to come by in Ireland)!  We had coffee and pastries in the sitting area in front of a beautiful fire the next morning.  Wish we could have stayed longer, and will definitely stay at the Merrion again if we ever go back to Dublin.",5,2014,05,27
200,Perfect!,"A really nice luxurious hotel in the centre of Dublin City. I stayed here on the first night of my honeymoon. Room, bathroom and turn down service was excellent. We had our dinner in the Cellar Restaurant and the staff couldn't do enough for us. When they heard it was our honeymoon, two glasses of champagne were sent to the drawing rooms for an after dinner drink. The bar man also made me a cocktail that wasn't on the menu. Really friendly, efficient staff. We left before normal breakfast times so had room service. Breakfast was perfect. I would definitely recommend staying and will be back myself.",5,2014,05,27
200,Birthday weekend,"I stayed in the Merrion for a birthday celebration weekend in Feb - I'm a little late writing this review but this hotel was so fantastic I have decided better late than never.
It was fantastic from start to finish - it's the most beautiful hotel and probably the best service I have ever received from hotel staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and I felt that the staff were out to ensure that you had a great experience.  We were on a tight budget that weekend but I felt as important as any other guest (and we saw a few famous faces) - that to me is one of the differences between a good hotel and an outstanding one.  I left a pair of shoes behind and they were posted back to me within a couple of days.  I'm planning a visit soon and I can't wait to go back - the next time I will be dining in the restaurant and enjoying the bar more!!
On a practical note - it's in a brilliant location where you can walk to great pubs and restaurants and the shopping district.     
The spa was not the reason I went there so I don't think it would be fair to comment - remember its a city hotel and it's not usual to get fabulous spa facilities in these type of hotels.  The pool was a perfect temperature but had little room to sit and read the papers after a swim - my husband used the steam room and he was happy with that.  Overall this area was very clean, well staffed and quiet.",5,2014,05,27
200,Art Afternoon Tea,"Myself and some friends booked in for afternoon tea at the Merrion recently and I was extremely excited to see just how good it was. I'd like to consider myself as an afteroon tea expert, given that I've had it in almost all of the main Dublin hotels (!!), so I think my review is fair. My first impression of the Merrion was one of disappointment - there doesn't appear to be a foyer as such - very bland entrance for such a salubrious hotel. However, the lounge where we had our afternoon tea was much more grand. Unfortunately, we were left standing for several minutes before being shown to our seats so this didn't get us off to a flying start! Having said that, the staff did their best and were very professional but that's kind of where I have the problem. I felt they were too professional and had been trained within an inch of their lives in terms of how to act and what to say to the customer. Nothing felt natural to me. At one point I asked for more milk and after 5 minutes when it hadn't arrived I asked the lady again and she said she thought waiter had brought it to me. Now, why could she not have just filled the jug herself and bring it to me? It seems as though everyone has their role and, unfortunately, as a result the service fell short for me. Our tea was served about 15/20 minutes before the food so had gone cold by the time it arrived. I found it almost impossible to get a cup of HOT tea (a REAL pet hate of mine) and by the time we'd been given a fresh pot my sandwiches were almost gone. On the plus side, the food was really lovely. The sanwiches I had (vegetarian) were really lovely and were freshly made for me. Not being a cake lover, I just had a scone with cream and jam and that was very nice too. The 2nd course consisted of 3 cakes which had taken inspiration from the art work on view in the hotel was a lovely unique touch. All in all, we really enjoyed the experience and certainly felt in no way rushed to leave or anything like that and I'd certainly go back, but I'd like to see a more relaxed approach from the staff, not unprofessional by any means, just maybe a bit more personable.",4,2014,05,27
200,An almost perfect stay,"I had stayed at the Merrion many years ago and hoped it hadn't changed, it had, it was even better than I remembered

From the 1st minute to the last the staff, from check in, to the chambermaids were friendly and would do anything to help  the doormen and concierges were fantastic

The room was great, spotless, nicely decorated with a huge bathroom... Everything we wanted, the public areas with fires were great for rainy evenings...

They even have hotel bicycles, which we borrowed for a great day cycling round the canals.

The only complaint, the receptionist when we checked in said we had a room with a lovely view if the garden, in fact we had a lovely view of a dirty grey  wall,  ( room 157 avoid if you can ) which was really dissociating as the gardens are lovely, but this dint really detract from the great stay. Maybe management can add some flowers or some small bushes or something to the balcony to mitigate the terrible view..

Anyway a great stay, we loved Dublin and love the Merrion, we'd love  to come back some day",5,2014,05,26
200,Perfect hotel in Dublin,"Lovely luxurious hotel!  The rooms & bathroom are very spacious - and impeccably clean.  Service is amazing.  The grounds of the hotel are beautiful - they have a lovely garden.  The afternoon tea service looked very good although we never found the time!  The Cellar bar and restaurant was also very good.  The location is perfect - close to everything,  Would definitely recommend and return the next time we are in Dublin,",5,2014,05,26
200,A winner in every category,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay in Dublin, fantastic location, excellent staff, beautiful room overlooking the stunning courtyard garden, delicious breakfast.....I can't wait to stay here again and take afternoon tea in the Drawing Room.",5,2014,05,24
200,A perfect 4 days stay,"There are so many notable details: a beautiful garden, all personnel (house keeping, bell captain, reception, ...) is very helpful and friendly, rooms are thoroughly cleaned day by day, concierges always have a recommendation be it for food, leisure or an evening out. The Merrion is also centrally located - all major sightseeing attractions are reachable by foot, .... a perfect stay in Dublin! Only the weather is to be improved a little ... ;->",5,2014,05,23
200,Old world charm first class service,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with our son and mother. The suite was beautiful and perfect for the four of us. Our stay included breakfast and that was absolutely amazing! I have never had a breakfast with so many choices and the food was to die for. We looked forward to breakfast every morning. High tea was so unique. Then pastries were replicas of the art hanging all over the hotel. Never seen anything like it. Our meals, room, service were impeccable. We love Dublin and will only stay here on our return. We hated leaving!",5,2014,05,22
200,"Excellent, elegant, seamless, friendly.","From the moment our taxi stopped at the front of the beautiful establishment we were amazed and delighted.  We had read all the reviews and expected the best but were still absolutely stunned at the delivery of a first rate service, always with a smile and nothing ever too much trouble.  We enjoyed all the facilities offered, treatments in the Spa, beautiful meals in the Cellar Bar, the Art Afternoon Tea, and dinner at the Patrick Gilbaud Restaurant, and each experience was beautifully conducted, and we felt  comfortable and welcome.    I particularly enjoyed sitting out on the terrace, the gardens are a feast of elegant clipped box, beautiful stone statues,  drifts of colourful herbaceous planting, twinkling fountains.  The garden is a calm, energising oasis and one would not believe you were just a stone's throw from the busy street.  It goes without saying our room was spotless, elegant styling with beautiful soft furnishings and muted shades of painted furniture.   We are definitely coming back, four days was just not enough.",5,2014,05,20
200,Best in Dublin,"We visited the Merrion Hotel for the third time recently.  As usual, there was a warm friendly welcome from every member of staff. The comfortable public areas for relaxing with a drink and a newspaper, the beautiful artwork on the walls and the lovely rooms all combine to make this the perfect Dublin retreat.  What really sets the Merrion apart, however, is the well trained, helpful staff for whom nothing is too much travel. The hotel is in a wonderful central location and makes a wonderful peaceful retreat after a busy day shoping or sightseeing",5,2014,05,16
200,"Beautiful Hotel and Grounds, Awesome Location, Very Nice If Not Exceptional Service","This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of central Dublin, within a short walk of St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, the National Gallery, the National Library, the National Museum, and Trinity College.  The front of the hotel is comprised of two Georgian mansions , while the newer wing of the hotel is towards the back, built around a gorgeous courtyard garden.  We had a superior king room overlooking the garden and fountain -- it was lovely.

The hotel itself is beautiful, grand and gracious in appearance.  The main lounge in the Georgian portion of the hotel is stunning -- lots of comfortable seating and large fireplaces with a roaring fire going 24-7.  It's a nice place to sit and have a cup of tea and plate of scones or toast over breakfast, and is where the hotel's High Tea is served.  Note though that it is almost impossible to get a seat there at certain times of the day unless you call in advance.  Also, at the time that the High Tea is being served, you can't just get a cup of tea and a plate of scones.  They will send you to the bar for that.  

The rooms are also quite lovely.  Our Superior King room in the new part of the hotel was very large, and very well furnished with light colored walls and fabrics. The bathroom also was very large and in marble, with both a tub and a shower.

I can't say anything negative about the hotel but I give the hotel 4 rather than 5 stars only because I have had the pleasure to stay at some really remarkable properties recently, where even if you are not a ""VIP"" you are treated like one, and each attention is paid to your personal preferences and wishes.  I reserve my ""5 star"" rating for such hotels.  The level of the service at the Merrion, while good, did not reach such exceptional levels.  There were a few exceptional exceptions -- Alice Thompson, the customer service manager, remembered us by name and that we had come to celebrate a special occasion.  She was friendly and welcoming at all times.  The gentleman who checked us in and the room service staff also paid close attention to details and were quite attentive.  However, the service quality of the rest of the hotel and staff could be compared with that of a good business hotel, as opposed to a truly great, luxury five star property.  You feel like a number, rather than a truly welcome guest.  

I would recommend this hotel to friends and would most likely stay there again in Dublin, though if someone were to recommend another great property, I'd be open to trying that as well.  There are certain hotels that, if I am in a particular city, I will stay only at that property.  Based on my first visit to the Merrion, I couldn't say that I would only stay there again should I have the chance to return to Dublin.",4,2014,05,14
200,Hands down the best place in Dublin,"Go on and treat yourself to a really nice place. Friendly and helpful staff coupled with traditional Irish hospitality. This place won't  disappoint. Perfect in charm and elegance, with a perfect location close to everything. Try the cellar bar. The best place to quietly unwind. Or get more upbeat at any of the pubs across the street. Mr. Guinness is calling you!!!!",5,2014,05,14
200,Exceptional,"When writing reviews I normally have a fare idea of the good & the bad from my stay, visit or trip. In this case, and for the first time since I started posting on Tripadvisor I do not have a single negative to write or comment on, from my stay at The Merrion.
From being met outside the hotel upon arrival, to having the car packed upon departure was as pleasant an experience I have had on holidays. I will not go on about the location, the room, facilities. These speak for themselves, and I suppose by reputation The Merrion is a beautiful place to stay or just spend an afternoon.
What stood out for me were the staff. Check-in, cleaning staff, reception, waiting staff in the restaurant, concierge... Friendly, welcoming, helpful. Just exceptional.",5,2014,05,13
200,Simply the Best,"Ultra comfortable rooms, excellent food, friendly and attentive staff, rapt attention to detail, building full of character with wonderful art almost everywhere one looks, superb location and reasonable prices for a 5 star. If you want the best hotel in Dublin that is unlike the usual offering available most everywhere, the Merrion is the one for you.",5,2014,05,13
200,Even better second time around,"Stayed for just one night to attend Breaking Dad in the Gaiety Theatre. This was my second visit to the Merrion and so was warmly welcomed back by the lady on reception and allocated room 101. This is  easily the largest hotel bedroom I've stayed in,double bay windows with a view of the garden,and so quiet you could hear a pin drop. 

The Merrion is quite rightly the No1 5 star hotel to stay in if you're coming to Dublin. The quality of the rooms,the location of the hotel and the  professionalism of the staff make it such an enjoyable stay. Hopefully next time I can stay a bit longer. You will not be disappointed with this hotel,it's reputation is well deserved. Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,13
200,"Love, love, love this hotel!","Such a pleasure.  The service and rooms are superb.  The location is great.  On my last visit, I had an amazing massage.  My only wish is that there was a better lounge for relaxing pre and post spa treatment.  Can't wait to visit again.",5,2014,05,12
200,Beautiful hotel in perfect location!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Merrion!  Called and booked 2 rooms directly with the hotel and the receptionist was very pleasant and friendly.  Took no time at all and a confirmation email was sent to us immediately.  Better price than the Westbury, Westin, and other hotels so it was an easy decision.  The location is absolutely perfect, and the hotel is stunning.  Staff was very welcoming, helpful, and accommodating.  Had delicious afternoon tea in front of the fire.  Our rooms were well-appointed and immaculate, though the blankets were a little thin.  We had a very good dinner in the Cellar and drinks at the Cellar Bar.  O'Donoghue's right around the corner was our favorite pub in Dublin.  Would definitely stay at the Merrion again and recommend it to family and friends!  Perfect place to end our Ireland adventure!",5,2014,05,12
200,A very good hotel with Great service,"I have stayed in numerous hotels in Dublin when on business, this time I was booked into the Merrion.

A very unassuming frontage belies the large efficient friendly and comfortable hotel that is the Merrion. Spread across numerous properties around a block in Dublin centre, but the ability to move inside the hotel makes this all seamless. 

Warm welcome taken to the room and shown what one needed to know, the standard great, even a Bose Wave sound system - perfection.

We ate out that evening so I only sampled the food at breakfast where the welcome was very friendly and the service outstanding good explanation fast and nothing too much trouble.

Check out was a breeze despite being busy around half past eight.

One regret with my stay - it was only one night!",5,2014,05,11
200,OK -,"I'm Irish but now live abroad but visit Dublin a lot. I had never stayed in the Merrion and usually stay in the Shelbourne or the Fitzwilliam. To be honest it didn't live up to the glowing reviews here. Check in was very nice. Room was ok - faced a brick wall and some sort of gym. Common areas  - eg around the lifts etc. are a bit shabby. Pool nice but small and the gym area was full of locals early in the morning. The hotel seems to sell gym memberships to the public. Breakfast was ok. I was in a hurry which I explained to the staff and they did serve me very rapidly.

Service in the lounge area was appalling on the other hand. each time I asked for a glass of wine it took about 20 mins to arrive. The place was not exactly packed. 

The service was very good overall but I really don't understand the rave reviews of this hotel.",3,2014,05,08
200,Everything we expected and more.,"My husband and I took a belated honeymoon to Ireland and spent our first night at the Merrion Hotel. They upgraded us to a suite and we got five star treatment the whole time we were there. The room was amazing - it was so beautiful (and clean). The service was great with one of the managers coming to greet us when we arrived. We got one of the hotel packages, which included champagne on arrival and dinner at the Cellar Restaurant. I think the only negative would be that the restaurant's food was probably a four out of five (my beef carpaccio was a bit bland. It could have had some parmesan cheese or be a bit more salty), but the breakfast there the next morning was also amazing! Would highly recommend.",5,2014,05,06
200,5* Everything,"Unfortunately, we had to check out today. The Merrion Hotel, it's staff, it's rooms, it's character, it's experience, it's warmth, it's style - all 5 star.

We live in Dublin, and checked in for one night for a special occasion. We enjoyed the hotel so much, we booked for a second night the next day - and will certainly be back.",5,2014,05,05
200,Superb all rounder,"Stayed here for a week in January on my own. A truly wonderful hotel. 

check-in quick and easy. polite if not quite 'friendly' staff generally. Rate was very good. 

Had a room in the new part of the hotel just about overlooking the garden. was a bit dark as in a corner on ground floor. but it was winter too. room itself was in Excellent condition. Great amenities, tons of towels comfy bed, nice shower. TV was fine though tended to turn itself off sometimes. wifi was ok. can't remember if included or not. breakfast was excellent, but did get busy on the weekend (which, to be fair, they warned guests about which was a nice touch). lovely sitting areas with fires and amazing art collection. had club sandwich in lobby bar/area - was fine but bit pricey. downstairs in the Cellar bar was ok but with so many 'real' irish pubs near by you'd be bonkers to be down there for too long/often.

location excellent. minutes from most of the sites, restaurants, pubs and shopping. taxi's always going past. staff at front door were pleasant and helpful. 

only small thing is i don't think its terribly child friendly (like under-10s). its an adult hotel, quite quiet and reserved and lots of steps etc. if you want somewhere for that, Four Seasons is much better equipped in my opinion.

but overall, one of the best hotels i've stayed in anywhere.",5,2014,05,05
200,Pure indulgence,"My wife and I stayed at the merrion hotel in late 2013.From the moment we arrived it was absolutely superb ,nothing was too much trouble .we had chocs and champagne on arrival in our room . The food in the restaurant was amazing !! All the staff were very attentive specially the concierge . Dave Waller stoke on trent ",5,2014,05,03
200,Incredibly good!,"Merrion is one of the finest hotels I've stayed so far, and certainly holds the best staff I ever came by! They are all very nice and proficient, meaning to be of help anytime. Rooms are spacious and quiet.",5,2014,05,01
200,The only place to stay in Dublin!,The Hotel Merrion is the only place to stay in Dublin.  It is far and above any other hotel I've been to in the area.  The rooms are absolutely superb. The restaurants are amazing and the staff is helpful beyond any I have ever encountered.  The hotel is in a wonderful part of Dublin. Don't think twice…book here!!  Oh yes they have a fabulous spa with a myriad of treatments!,5,2014,05,01
200,like staying at a friend's very elegant city home...,"The Merrion exceeded our expectations in every way.  We stayed in the front part of the hotel, based on several earlier reviews, and had a very grand room.  It was the perfect mix of traditional (high ceilings, lovely moldings, sumptuous fabrics) and contemporary (tonal colors, a bit of geometric pattern, and a yummy bathroom.)  The location was great, it was very easy to walk everywhere we wished to visit and dine.  The staff was helpful and warm.  We would never stay anywhere else in Dublin!
Only one warning, it is a bit hard to find the hotel on your first visit.  We arrived on a rainy night after many hours of travel and drove by twice before recognizing the awning.  This understated elegance is very much part of the Merrion's charm… just be forewarned.",5,2014,05,01
200,One Night Not Enough,"After a few days touring Ireland we decided to treat ourselves to a night at the Merrion.  We were not disappointed.  The car was taken care of on arrival which was a relief as the road outside the hotel was extremely busy, and again the car was returned to us outside the front door as we left.   We stayed in a garden room which was wonderful.  Everything we could possibly need including robes and cosy slippers.  Cocktails, dinner and breakfast were all included for us, drinks and meal were great - although we could not understand why we could not eat until 8.30pm when there were lots of empty tables.  Sadly though breakfast was a little disappointing.  The staff are all very courteous however they lacked a system -  Our coffee and toast did not arrive as promised and we had to chase both, not what we would have expected.    We throughly enjoyed our stay, the location is super, the facilities first class and the comfort of the rooms and helpfulness of staff excellent.  ",5,2014,05,01
200,Understated elegance,"From the moment we arrived at the doorstep of The Merrion, the staff did everything possible to ensure a pleasant stay! You are personally escorted to your room while features of the hotel are highlighted. Peat fires warm the drawing rooms where you can linger over a pot of tea. The gardens are worth a stroll and I love the James Joyce statue with excerpts from Ulysses! The room was spotless, very comfortable, and filled with amenities. Our room rate included a full Irish breakfast in The Cellar Restaurant. There was a wide array of yogurts, breads, pastries, cereals, fruits to choose from prior to the cooked portion of the breakfast. The wait staff did everything to see that the meal was enjoyed. It was difficult to want to leave the comforts of the hotel but the lures of Merrion Square and the surrounding streets encouraged us to explore. A beautiful hotel with service to match made our last days in Dublin extremely memorable. We will return!",5,2014,04,27
200,Absolutely wonderful,"Hands down the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff was wonderful and helpful. They upgraded us to a suite that was gorgeous. When they found out we were visiting Dublin on our honeymoon, they sent up a free dessert to our suite. Location of the hotel was within walking distance of attractions in historic Dublin. Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,04,24
200,Spa excellent,"I thought the food was average and fell short of the standard expected, for example the pancake for breakfast was rubbery and tasteless. The spa was very nice and a treatment from Niamh was excellent.",4,2014,04,24
200,This is how it's done,"If you've read any of my reviews, you know that I place a premium on customer service.  Any other hotel I review from now on, will be judged against the Merrion, and it has set the bar pretty high!

From the minute you pull up, you are taken care of!  After the checkin process was complete, our concierge took us to our room, and explained how everything worked, where everything was, (both in the room, and on the hotel property).

One of the things my wife wanted to do, was the afternoon tea.. We found out that you need to book that in advance, because it is very popular, and was sold out.

This hotel is within walking distance of most of the touristy things in Dublin, like The Book of Kells, Grafton Street, The Fitzwilliam Card Room haha yes that's right.. very nice parks in the area, too.. 

Everything was great about this place.. If you're booking there, make sure to get breakfast included.. We didn't, and it was 27Euro per person.. other than that, I can't think of anything negative.. Any of the staff we encountered dropped anything they were doing, to answer any questions we had.. 

We felt like Irish royalty staying here, and I would recommend The Merrion Hotel to everyone who asks me.",5,2014,04,23
200,you really want five star service that you can rely on,"The Shangri-La Singapore continues to never disappoint. 

Once again here is the benchmark in five star SERVICE in the hotel industry bar none!!!

 From desk clerk to waitstaff to the cook on the line at breakfast to the Waterfall restaurant for an IT department who knew how to fix the lap top ......Horizon Club great bang for the buck. Truly amazing consistency in the business. Everyone is three steeps ahead of the guest.
Kudos to Reto Klauser and his staff. Thank you Thank you Thank You

200,Unashamed Luxury in heart of Dublin,"A complementary and unrequested upgrade to a suite got us in the mood right from the start.  The suite was beautiful.  Tasteful, with two large TV's, Nespresso machine, iPod Dock, great bathroom, second WC, separate luggage room, and very comfy sitting room with dining table.  It was so comfortable that we requested our dinner to the room, and even though this was a package deal, there was no issue made of our request, and we even strayed off the set menu.  Breakfast in bed the next morning was just faultless, and the staff were soooo friendly, accomodating, and helpful.  This is a very DUBLIN hotel, by which I mean that it has the sort of character missing from so many International brands.  Staff are eager to please, and they don't look as if this eagerness is simply the result of some training course - it seems totally genuine.
Just two small food-related quibbles.  I don't mind paying € 13 once in a blue moon for a good fruit salad, but at that price it needs more than just apple, melon and a smattering of black berries. Where is the orange, pear, peach, plum, banana, strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants, kiwi, etc.  And my duck was as tough as old boots, and even though I finished every bit, it was really not up to par.  Other than that, I can't recommend the Merrion highly enough.",5,2014,04,23
200,5 Star luxury at its best!,"5 Star luxury at its best! not pretentious,Impeccable service, Spotlessly clean.
Stayed 3 nights at the Merrion in a deluxe garden room, it was absolutely faultless. The friendliest staff I’ve met in ages, nothing was too much trouble. Concierge service brilliant, breakfast served with smile & style. We ate at the Hotel on Good Friday as all the “public” bars restaurants are closed on that day. Food was excellent & also great choice of wines.
Housekeeping brilliant, we forgot toothpaste and we were supplied in minuets with complimentary dental pack, this Hotel delivers bang on the money on every point! Many 5* hotels are right up themselves, not this one! I am looking forward to our next trip to Dublin",5,2014,04,23
200,"""welcome to the Merrion,I'll get rid of the car""","That's a great opening sentence to hear when arriving at an hotel, uttered by a chap in a top hat and riding cloak. A lot of hotels have men in ridiculous uniforms lurking outside but this was my first truly useful one, valet parking is not a big deal but rare in the U.K and Ireland. After a long weekend of racing cars, a long drive from Belfast and some tricky navigating of Dublin the last thing we wanted was fiddling about with city centre parking.It was a sign of very good things to come, from an irrepressibly smiling receptionist, to several fit young men spiriting luggage away , we knew we had arrived at a place that knew something about hospitality, not just accommodation. 
So low key it's hard to spot, the Merrion has a facade of three Georgian town houses in a terrace but is actually quite a large hotel with two newer wings behind around a lovely formal garden with fountains. Reception looks like your aristocratic uncle's stately home drawing room and the welcome is probably better than you would get from your own family...There are, in fact a couple of very comfortable drawing rooms deeper into the hotel next to the bar that have 24 hour service for snacks and beverages, which we tested having a 4.30 am departure, good coffee served up immediately at that hour is again an achievement. Our room, a superior double or some such was large, very well appointed and furnished with enough fluffy towels, bathrobes and slippers to get lost in. More importantly the bathroom, although furnished with Victorian style fittings worked perfectly, a rare thing in the British Isles.
We had late dinner in the Cellar restaurant, quite formal and correct but we still managed to get our rather serious young waiter from The Loire laughing, which helped everybody enjoy themselves. Food was very good, modern 'euro' style cooking, seared scallops and the like, small portions but good, much better than the other way around. The same cellar hosted breakfast, which was also excellent but I would much prefer a breakfast room with natural light.
Naturally the car was waiting when we emerged into the dawn light, I could really get used to living like this...",5,2014,04,22
200,The best Dublin has to offer,"My lovely boyfriend and I just returned from a week in Dublin celebrating his birthday.  I booked online based on reviews from other people and selected the Merrion hotel.  From the moment I booked, everything was fantastic.

I first reached out via email to the hotel which I would highly recommend, Emma was the first to respond to me and she was kind and helpful.  I was able to upgrade our queen room (that I booked on Expedia) to a king room directly with the hotel which was very convenient.  Not only that but she helped make dinner reservations for us, booked show tickets, and offered advice on what to see and do.  Everything leading up to the trip was handled with swift perfection.

When we arrived we were greeted by name and our room was ready.  We stayed in a King room in the main house with a small balcony overlooking the lush gardens.  The gardens are beautifully groomed and dozens of fresh flowers were blooming in colors of pink, red and white.  The fragrance could be enjoyed up to our second floor balcony.  The bed was enormous and comfortable.  The pillows were large and cozy although the bedding was light and on a few nights a blanket would have made us more comfortable.  The bathroom was huge, all white marble and a deep tub and separate shower.  Two terry cloth robes were provided and I used them daily.  They provided a hair dryer and even brought up an adapter for the wall for our electronics.

We were greeted with a special desert that had “Happy Birthday” written in chocolate on the plate.  I had arranged for chocolate dipped strawberries and red wine to be delivered and it was promptly brought to the room and set up in a lovely fashion.  On Easter we also received a special treat of pastries and chocolate which were delicious.  The room has a well-stocked mini bar and my only drawback to it is that every morning there is a knock on the door to review its contents.  

We ate in the Cellar Bar which is sexy and stylish; dark and intimate,  The food was very good, I had the pasta and he got the steak.  All great choices.  We dined in the Cellar restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  Although breakfast is expensive, about 29 pounds or close to $36 dollars for breakfast…the dinner was good with the best calves liver I have ever tasted!  I got the rib-eye and I can promise you, if you have never tried liver before, get the liver.  I also recommend the peas and bacon.  Yummy.  We did not participate in the “Art Tea”.  It looks amazing but the truth is you get sandwiches and pastries along with desserts and scones and I don’t know how anyone can eat that at 3:00 and then be hungry for dinner.  Room service is top of the line, we had breakfast delivered and it was timely and hot.  And I got sick the last night we were there and they even brought me ginger ale at 4:00 am.

We enjoyed the spa, got massages and they were heavenly.  I would bring your bathing suit, we didn’t but I think we would have enjoyed the gorgeous pool.  

The staff was amazing, David works the door and he is kind and helpful.  Every person we met was nicer than the next.  It is a bit more expensive than some of the other hotels we considered, but well worth the cost if you ask me.  Thank you Merrion for making our vacation perfect.",5,2014,04,22
200,Impressive afternoon tea,"Brought my family to the Merrion for their ART tea on a Sunday. The whole experience was magnificent and Conor our server was exemplary, couldnt have done more for us to enjoy our stay. The whole hotel is thoroughly deserving of its 5 stars. Looking forward to going back again.",5,2014,04,21
200,One of the finest hotels in the world,"I have been in some very nice hotels in my life such as the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok and The Connaught in London. I can tell the readers of this review, unreservedly, that The Merrion ranks as one of the top hotel experiences in the world. My wife and our three children (7,9,13) stayed there for a 4 night stay and we were treated like royalty, albeit in a warm and sincere way. You can't really do any better in terms of location. The building itslef is elegant, understated, old Dublin charming, and houses a beautiful collection of art - the largest private collection in Ireland, I believe. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and spacious. The Cellar Restaurant, where we ate breakfast every morning and dinner 3 of the 4 nights, is excellent. Be sure and experience their Art of Tea - it's a must do. Can't wait to come back!",5,2014,04,21
200,Perfect hotel - perfect location - fantastic staff!,My husband and I stayed at The Merrion Hotel over the Easter weekend.  The staff were the best trained staff of any hotels we have stayed in around the world.  They were extremely friendly and went out of their way for each and every guest.  We had lunch in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud which is ajoining the hotel and this was amazing also.  Please note you need to book this restaurant well in advance of your trip so as not to be disappointed.  We had breakfast in the Cellar restaurant in the hotel and I can honestly say it was the best breakfast we ever had in a hotel.  The bedrooms are nicely furnished with a huge bed and while the bathrooms are a little dated and need to be refurbished they are extremely clean and have both a shower and bath.  This hotel is the perfect location for visiting Dublin.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  It was just fantastic.  The perfect hotel in the perfect location.,5,2014,04,20
200,Relaxed and superb stay,"Just returned with my 7-year old daughter after staying at the Merrion for 3 nights during the Easter break.  The service we received from every single member of staff was faultless and from the first greeting by the Doorman to the last farewell at check-out, I was made to feel special and a valued customer.  The bedroom was gorgeous - THE most comfy bed that I've ever stayed in (and I have travelled the world on business!).  I want to buy a bed just like that one.  The room was spotlessly clean and the extra touches like Asprey's bathroom products, a fruit bowl and complimentary bottled mineral water made the stay extra special.  My only comments were to do with the facilities for children - there were only cartoons on early in the morning (RTE Junior) and, despite the website promising bespoke Miss and Master crockery for junior room-service dining, my daughter was only served food on regular hotel crockery with large adult-sized cutlery.  That saying, did it spoil our stay?  Not at all.  

The Spa was ultra-clean and the pool got warmer as the day went on (swimming in the evening means a couple of extra degrees of warmth over the morning temperature).  The spa staff even supplied flotation devices for my daughter, though she was so happy in the pool that she actually learned to swim without them whilst we were there!

We stayed in the Garden Wing which had beautiful views over the superb garden.  We stayed in room 137 which was close to the lifts, so if you want a quieter room, ask for one with a greater number!!

Location-wise, the hotel is about 5-10 minutes' walk from the busy St Stephen's Green and shopping on Grafton Street, with the Luas again only about 10 minutes' walk away.  

If you fancy a mini quick-tour of the city, try the new Dublin Road Train Tour which has just opened, running from outside the National Gallery a few minutes walk from the hotel.  Interesting commentary and, despite being in a train look-alike which was a bit daft, we loved it!!",5,2014,04,20
200,Beautiful and peaceful setting for our Dublin stay.,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay in Dublin. We stayed in this beautiful hotel and were impressed with the elegance and peace that it offered.
It is ideally located for a short stay .... Close to the action but in a quiet street!!
The staff were incredibly efficient and polite.
We were on a bit of a tight schedule and were out from early in the morning till late in the evening - so we didn't really make full use of the facilities that the hotel had to offer. Neither did we have the opportunity to eat at the hotel's highly rated restaurants!
I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel in the future ... I might try to go for longer, next time!!!",5,2014,04,18
200,Mainly good service,"This is a good hotel in a great location. The service from concierge, reception and the lounge area is excellent. We have stayed here before and enjoyed it just as much then. The only issue (still) is the Cellar Bar where we waited ages to get served. Not great when you have just arrived from the airport with 2 hungry teenagers.",4,2014,04,17
200,A true 5 Star in Dublin,"We recently spent a night in the gorgeous Merrion Hotel and had a really lovely time. We had lunch in The Cellar bar which was very nice and reasonably priced. Our room was beautiful and there were some lovely, unexpected touches when we arrived in our room. Dinner in the Cellar restaurant was delicious with a wide selection on the menu. The wine suggestions were very helpful and the overall atmosphere and surroundings were very pleasant.   Breakfast was also very enjoyable with a wide selection to choose from. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough and look forward to our next visit!",5,2014,04,17
200,The Greatest Hotel in Dublin,"Every time I stay at The Merrion, I feel like home, great location, ambience, service, and above all a discrete environment. The feeling is like being in Pole Position. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to all my Special friends and contacts, cause is a Special place.",5,2014,04,16
200,Worthy of 5 Stars Plus,"This is a lovely, classy, and very elegant hotel situated on a quiet street in the center of Dublin.  During a 2 week trip to Ireland with another couple, we spent several days at The Merrion on both ends of our trip.   The staff is friendly, helpful, and makes the experience wonderful.  We loved the hotel so much that we returned early from other parts of Ireland to stay there.   The bar is wonderful and through Stuart, we had lessons on Irish Whisky.   Staff recommendations for restaurants were great although the hotel restaurant is very good also.  We had a delicious breakfast every morning sitting in front of a fireplace.  This is a quiet, lovely hotel with large modern (marble) bathrooms and very comfortable surroundings.  Our friend used the spa facilities and said they were very good.  Would have written this review earlier but we returned home to family illness.   We are planning to stay at The Merrion as soon as possible.",5,2014,04,16

200,Another Great Stay,"Have just returned from another short stay with my wife at The Merrion. The whole experience was first class. A three course dinner and breakfast were included in the package and these were excellent. On arrival at the room a cheesecake with a 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate were waiting for us. This accompanied by the fact that the duty manager Mr Murphy went out of his way to introduce himself on the morning of our departure, congratulate me on my birthday and ask us all about our stay just indicates that extra mile that the hotel goes. A special thank you to the Cellar Bar manager who sorted us out with cocktails (also included in the package) even though my 'retro' request wasn't on the menu! Wouldn't consider anywhere else.",5,2014,04,14
200,"Beautiful hotel,with wonderful  staff!","We have just returned from a very enjoyable stay at The Merrion.  What a wonderful gem of a hotel. Excellent location, central to everything and practically next to the lovely St Stephens Green.  The welcome on arrival is very warm and friendly and the receptionist personally escorts you to your room. All the public rooms and bedrooms are beautiful, with every home comfort. Fantastic mini bar, outstanding room service menu (24 hours) complimentary mineral water which is topped up throughout the day. Evening turn down service with even more mineral water etc.  the hotel was recommended by a friend who stays here and now I know why.
We enjoyed afternoon tea,  two courses, the second course being 'The Art Tea' which is just wonderful. The chef creates 3 pastries based on a choice of 3 pieces of the hotels private art collection.  The waitress asked if we were celebrating anything resulting in complimentary champagne and a personalised 'happy birthday' plate being given as it was my wife's birthday. Very nice touch. ( we had also received a beautiful desert 'happy birthday' plate brought to our room, on arrival) Most definitely spoiled !

We didn't leave the hotel much as we enjoyed the lovely surroundings so much and felt very relaxed there. Beautiful pool and spa area, we enjoyed two fantastic cooked breakfasts and dinner in the Cellar restaurant and drinks in the cellar bar.  The hotel is immaculate and very well maintained. There is also a lovely garden terrace. 

The thing that stands out most about The Merrion, is it's staff. They are so very friendly, pleasant and helpful in a professional and discreet manner. Nothing is too much trouble. They are exceptional and most certainly play a major role in making this hotel such an enjoyable place to stay in Dublin.  We will most definitely recommend The Merrion Hotel to friends and family and hope to return again soon. 
Thank you all for a wonderful stay!",5,2014,04,14
200,"Sheer quality, class and elegance!!","We have stayed here on several occasions over the last few years and i'm amazed at how the staff make you feel so welcome and as if you've known them for years. The rooms are excellent, service is second to none and the food is fantastic. We tried three of the rival 5 star hotels last year and was disappointed on all occasions, its the merrion all the way for us from now.

200,Afternoon tea at The Merrion,"This review is just of the afternoon tea only as we did not stay at the hotel, though I should add that the hotel reception where we waited to be seated was stunning and the reception staff extremely professional so I would definitely come to try the accommodation should I ever be in Dublin again.

We were seated for our afternoon tea by a charming man, who ended his shift straight after we had placed our order, to be replaced by a blonde lady (I think Polish). We ordered the rose champagne afternoon tea for two.  The afternoon tea arrived promptly and had 5 small sandwiches each on the bottom tier and some battenburg, lemon bread and fruit cake on the middle tier along with some very small scones.  The top tier had butter, jam and lemon curd on it.

The 5 sandwiches were lovely and, since we had been walking round Dublin all morning and it was, by now, 3:30 we asked for some more.  Well, you would have thought we had asked for the chef to come out and do a little dance for us.  Having had afternoon tea on numerous occasions at Claridges in London, and also at the Berkeley (for the Pret-a-Portea which is very similar in conception to the Merrion), I had understood that asking for more sandwiches was not only expected but offered! Indeed, at Claridges in January, there were many more sandwiches to start off with than at the Merrion, and when the waiter removed our plate he said ""same again?"", to which we of course said yes!  Anyway, back to this hotel.  The waitress looked very shocked and then said she would have to speak to the kitchen, and off she shuffled.  She came back about 5 minutes later and said there would be an extra charge of 8 euros a head for more sandwiches or we could order a plate of sandwiches off the menu for 13.50 euros.  Having by now ordered two more glasses of champagne, so was spending close to 150 euros (as I was treating my friend), I found this extra charge to be disgusting.  Is this hotel really saying that, having spent 150 euros, they could not bring out an extra 2 egg rolls?!!  Well yes, that is what they were saying!

By now, still no tea had arrived - in the end, we had to ask the waitress where it was.

Finally, three minuscule cakes turned up (which the menu itself describes as 'miniature', just to give you an idea of size). All forgivable if these cakes had been bite-sized taste sensations.  Alas, no, one of the three would not have been out of place at a high-street bakery, given that it was a very plain biscuit with icing on it with a ghost design piped on top - I think Greggs do similar at Halloween.

Anyway, I am sure if the hotel deigns to respond it will by saying something like 'we have very many satisfied customers who find the portion sizes to be more than satisfactory'.  Well, the hotel should note this - being two girls in our early thirties we were not satisfied at all.  Also, on the assumption that no other guest would have asked for more (given the shock that our request caused it is obviously not a common occurrence), surely the kitchen could have accommodated our lone request and provided the extra sandwiches for free?!  

As intimated throughout this review, this is the worst afternoon teas I have had at a high end hotel, in terms of quantity as well as quality.",2,2014,04,13
200,simply magnificent,"My husband and I stayed at this super hotel as a treat for a recent birthday of his. Checjed in early. Room not ready at that stage which didnt matter to us. Our bag was graciously taken care of while we went down tow. On return we were escorted to our room, which had been upgraded to a stupendous suite. What a fab birthday treat. We availed of a treatment in the beautiful Tethra spa which was fab. All in all an experience to behold from checkin to checkout. Staff so friendly and helpful. Well worth a visit. We will certainly be returning. Cant wait",5,2014,04,13
200,Afternoon tea at Merrion Hotel,"Visited Merrion Hotel for an afternoon tea in March 2014. What a lovely setting in the heart of Dublin. The service was excellent and selection of the teas was good. Food wise tea for 2 was more than enough for two us. If I'm being slightly picky there could have been more savory options but that just my personal taste. However, the macaroons we had to finish with were extremely beautiful and delicious. I would sincerely recommend this experience if you are visiting in Dublin.",5,2014,04,10
200,Superb,"We stayed here for a short 3 night break on a bed only basis.  Fantastic room, all the attention to detail you would expect.  

All the staff were very friendly and helpful and made you feel welcome.  

We ate in the Cellar Restaurant which was superb.  I wish I could make liver and bacon taste so delicate.  

We didn't eat breakfast here but there are lots of places just outside - try Voila around the corner to the left.  

One of the main things I couldn't work out even after studying countless forums and websites was how to get here from the airport if not using a taxi.  It's very easy - we used the Aircoach heading towards Leopardstown.  Drops you off in Kildare Street which is a 5 minute walk.  Collects from Dawson Street.  An effortless way to get to and from the airport.

Anyway, back to the Merrion - we would definitely stay here again. It's in a perfect location - away from it all but then on the edge of everything.  Loved it.",5,2014,04,10
200,The Elegant Merrion Hotel,"I brought my partner here for a surprise Birthday trip. Our Taxi Driver on the way from the airport assured us that we had chosen the best Hotel in Dublin and we were not disappointed. This is a truly elegant, comfortable and luxurious hotel in a lovely part of Dublin. Our room was spacious and comfortable and overlooked the very pretty garden area. But it was the wonderful, friendly and helpful staff who made this such a memorable stay, with special mention of the Concierge team and the Doormen. Nothing was too much trouble and they always had a smile and a friendly word. They even laughed at my partner's terrible jokes! The only downside was that we felt that the breakfasts were rather over-priced but there were plenty of alternatives in Dublin town. Would we stay here again? Absolutely, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Merrion.",5,2014,04,09
200,Art Afternoon Tea at The Merrion,"This is an experience for a special occasion or for when one has something to celebrate - which was my reason for booking afternoon tea with one of my oldest and dearest friends.  This I knew would be a very special afternoon for us to experience together.  I have enjoyed The Art afternoon tea here a few times but this was her first time and I had told her how wonderful it was.

I had booked online via the hotel  website and had received both a follow up call and an email to confirm the booking, I even got a phonecall on the morning of our booking to confirm that we would be coming along which I thought was a lovely touch. When we arrived we were shown to our table which was at a lovely comfy sofa with plenty of space - perfect. However, then followed something which nearly made me want to take a star away from the review - the lovely staff member in a very nice manner said 'you do know that you have to be finished by xxpm as we have later bookings for the table - you would have been informed of this when you booked"" - I just nodded as I didn't want anything to take away from our afternoon - however, NO, nobody ever mentioned vacating the table at a certain time - which wouldn't have been a problem if they had, but just left a sour note to my afternoon and made my friend anxious to watch the clock in case we overstayed our welcome! So a tip to the staff at the Merrion - try to come up with a different way of communicating this time limit to your guests.

I mentioned I wouldn't take a star away for that because it would be so unfair as the Afternoon tea and the service were absolutely wonderful.  Firstly you order your choice of tea or coffee (would be nice to see a coffee menu) which are then served along with some beautifully dainty sandwiches, scones, clotted cream. Jam, lemon curd, cakes .....yum!  Then along comes the special pastries that are created to match the hotels art collection.  They taste as good as the look.  We were unable to eat everything so the very nice waitress offered to pack up a box to go for us which was so kind of her.  

All in all a wonderful experience which I hope to enjoy again in the future - however, be aware that there may be a time limit on your table even if the hotel don't mention it during the booking process.",5,2014,04,09
200,Our new favourite hotel,"It's rare that a 5 star hotel really delivers. But this one does and indeed exceeded our expectations. 

The welcome was warm, the garden wing room was perfect (apart from the view, but we weren't there to sit our room and look out of the window) with a heated marble floor in the bathroom, the bed was comfortable, the wifi actually worked, the room service quick and the food exquisite. Breakfast included the best pancakes I have ever eaten (try the banana and orange). We blagged an early table in  Patrick Guillbaud one evening and I now know who will cook my last supper. It was truly outstanding. The gym and pool were perfect too, but the star of the whole experience were the staff. 

I thought the Four Seasons in Bali was unbeatable for unassuming but superb customer service. But some how the Merrion was even better. Amazing staff training and just great to see. To give you a flavour, they offer a 24/7 cashmere bed sock service! 

Stay here if you have the budget. The Merrion is right in town and we walked everywhere. 

We loved both Dublin and the Merrion. For a long weekend not too far away you couldn't find better. We will definitely be back. ",5,2014,04,06
200,Delivers a 5 star experience,"My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend in Dublin. She had always wanted to stay here, having lived in Dublin and heard about its reputation locally. And it lived up to our high expectations.

The hotel certainly fits the bill for luxury. It is decadently but tastefully decorated - especially the lovely paintings dotted around the hotel. When we stayed there (for Valentine's weekend) they also had an impressive sculpture made of chocolate in the reception area! The bedroom and en-suite bathroom were well-equipped and a good size. 

I also really liked Bar no.23  (we enjoyed a few post-dinner cocktails there on both nights - always excellent). Also good for celebrity spotting, if that's what you are into!

Food-wise, I really liked the breakfast - we did room service one morning and went down to the Cellar on another, and both were great. Room service is fantastic, exactly what you want from a 5 star hotel, but be warned - it is pricey.

Also, we enjoyed the spa facilities and bought a massage package. The massage was so relaxing, I nearly fell asleep! So top marks there. The pool was also nice, we were the only one using it in the evening.

The location, too, is perfect for exploring Dublin. 

And throughout our stay, the service was universally excellent. Staff were always helpful and eager to assist.

Would love to stay there again (even though it isn't great for the bank balance), so would definitely recommend to others.",5,2014,04,04
200,Excellent stay,"Stayed at this hotel again at the end of March and experienced again a very excellent customer service from all members of staff. I lost my dear mum at the end of November  unexpectedly and when I arrived I was greeted by Manwella and Jamie warmly and wanting to know how I was coping with out my dear mum as I had lived with her and cared for her for the last 28years.
The food as always was again excellent and the hotel staff maintain a very high standard of cleanliness. May I once again say thank you to all the staff for their kindness and friendliness when I stayed recently. Will be going back in October for another stay of which I can't wait for as it's like going from home to home which is an excellent bonus when you are travelling alone. Again the Bream family should be very proud of their hotel. I have stayed in other hotels in Llandudno in the past and they definitely did not come up to the high standard like the Merrion Hotel does. Thank you once again.",5,2014,04,03
200,Great Honeymoon Hotel!,"Can't praise the staff at the Merrion enough! Everyone was so professional, polite and friendly with it. Check in was the best I have experienced anywhere in the world, including the guy on reception giving us a guided tour of the hotel and even taking us out into the street to give directions to places he had recommended we visit. We were fortunate enough to have our room upgraded and it was wonderful. Spacious, spotlessly cleaned and well maintained and so quiet despite overlooking the road. I think we may have found the place to celebrate our anniversaries!",5,2014,04,03
200,Mother's Day treat,"My husband treated myself and daughter to a night here while up Dublin at a concert. I cannot say enough about the attention, politeness and taking care of you from the moment you step out of your taxi or car. Every member of staff could not do enough for you and everyone of them looked pleased to be seeing to your every need. We ate in the restaurant and the quality of the food was excellent. Cannot wait for a return visit. Also as it was a mothers day treat they upgraded us to a suite - a little bit of heaven in Dublin",5,2014,04,01
200,Exquisite and perfect...,"This was our second stay at The Merrion and as returning guests we knew what to expect and were certainly not disappointed. 

From the moment we arrived the hotel staff were efficient and friendly, yet always professional. We were fortunate to stay in the most amazing room (392) overlooking the Irish Government buildings on the third floor. The swim in theTethra Spa pool, the delightful afternoon tea and the Champagne in our room all added to a most magical and relaxing stay. Breakfast (full Irish of course) in our room on Sunday morning which was delivered on it's own table was just heavenly.

We have decided after staying at many fine hotels that The Merrion is by far in a class of its own and we can't wait to return (although next time, it will be for at least 2 nights as we just didn't want to leave).

If you are looking for the perfect romantic escape, then The Merrion is the only place to stay.",5,2014,04,01
200,Perfection,"Sixth stay here. Used to come for glamorous breaks with boyfriend/ fiancée and now we return with our young children. Used to drink champagne until the small hours in the bar, now we are in bed asleep after an in-room movie. The only hotel I have ever stayed in that caters for everyone in a professional and seamless manner. We will be back!",5,2014,03,31
200,Cant fault this home in dublin,"A wonderful stay again at the merrion. Understated opulence with wonderful staff. All the staff can't do enough for you to make your stay special.

You really do feel like you are staying at your home in Dublin. ",5,2014,03,30
200,Worldclass,"Stayed for a birthday treat,what a treat it turned out to be.Staff who do it as it should be done without exception,evening meal in the Cellar restaurant which would rival any of the best in Ireland (a hidden gem).Room was luxurious and well appointed,with a box of chocs and bottle of Baileys compliments of management as a birthday gift.The treatments in the Spa are magnificent and delivered with understated elegance,the Spa itself is a little on the small side and needs an enlarged thermal suite but this is only nitpicking as you don't stay in citycentre hotels for the Spa.Pricewise it is at the upper end of the scale but if you feel you're worth it the Merrion won't disappoint.",5,2014,03,30
200,"Fabulous staff, wonderful hotel","We stayed for one night only and whilst this hotel is at the top end of the price scale, the staff made such a difference. From the barman in the 24 hour bar, to the ladies on reception, to the doormen and car parking valets, every member of staff was fabulous. Nothing was ever too much trouble. If it was raining we got handed a brolly on the way out the door, if we needed the car brought around to the front of the hotel, it appeared. The staff are what makes this a charming experience - many thanks.",5,2014,03,29
200,"Great location, food and service!","Two couples met here for a night away.  We availed of the hotels great 7 star steal offer and enjoyed B & B and a magnificent tasting menu in the infamous Patrick Guilbauds restaurant. A bottle of Mumm Champagne awaited us on arrival and we left with the Sunday newspapers.  Such a wonderful art collection...outstanding!  The location of the hotel in the heart of Dublin caps it all off.  We toured the Taoiseachs office and Cabinet room on the Saturday morning, which is right across the street from the Hotel.  An amazing break that left us all feeing refreshed and looking forward to a return visit!",5,2014,03,27
200,Delightful,A beautiful hotel ideally situated.  Very pleasant staff who greeted us with a smile.  Excellent level of cleanliness.  Will definitely be staying here again in the near future.....................................,5,2014,03,27
200,Merrion Hotel,"Our family of 5 had the pleasure of staying at the Merrion Hotel for 3 nights for the St. Patrick's Day holiday.  The moment we arrived we received a very warm greeting from the staff, and that continued throughout the entire stay.  Prior to our arrival,  the Merrion reservation and concierge team helped us with planning our stay, and arranged a rental car for our departure to tour western Ireland.  My only regret is the stay was too short, we did not have time to use the pool or spa; but I am sure I will be back to stay at the Merrion again in the future.",5,2014,03,26
200,Superb hotel. Top notch and faultless.,"A would return to Dublin just to stay in this hotel. It is exquisitely appointed, akin to staying in a luxurious, yet homely townhouse with service that is attentive, gracious and charming. The hotel's location is second to none. The perfect place to explore the delights of Dublin by foot. Cocktails in the bar are a must and the fish and chips in The Cellars restaurant is the best in town. Breakfast was delicious with an amazing buffet selection with many authentic Irish produce. Don't forget your swimming gear to enjoy the pool and spa. One of the best hotels I have stayed in for a very long time. Top notch and faultless.",5,2014,03,26
200,"Touch of class, would recommend it to anyone.","I have to say I can't fault this hotel in any way!! We stayed on the 3 night merrion deal and from arriving to leaving the staff can't help you enough. We had booked in dec however our flight was cancelled so we re-arranged, at the time the staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for us, which was why we wanted to book the same hotel, I found them so friendly and helpful! The hotel is so classy and elegant. Fab stay and can't wait to return. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us.",5,2014,03,25
200,#1 Ranking Completely Justified,"From the moment we pulled up at the hotel our every need was taken care of. The doorman and concierge took everything out of our hands before we could even leave the cab whisking away our many bags efficiently and with no unnecessary fuss.

We arrived from Australia after 24 hours on the plane and were greeted warmly at reception by incredibly professional staff. We didn't get the name of the lady who checked us in but it was a reservation under Adam Baric on the 23rd of March. I mention her specifically because she is a credit to the hotel. She understood how tired we were and went above and beyond to arrange for our room to be cleaned first thing and make us comfortable in the meantime. I cannot express how grateful we were for the early check in after flying halfway across the world!

The hotel and garden are beautiful. Crackling fires in the reception rooms creates a welcoming, cosy atmosphere and is a welcome retreat from the cold outside. We had breakfast at the Cellar restaurant which was fantastic - try the brioche French toast if you have a chance.

Our room itself was spacious and well-appointed with a view over the garden. As others have mentioned, everything had been thought of from an umbrella to borrow to bathrobes and slippers. We wanted for nothing. The attention to detail extended to the turn down service. After rushing to dinner we returned to find our room tidy and inviting - perfect for people suffering from jetlag!

The location of the hotel was also great. It's an easy walk to cafes, restaurants, shopping and tourist attractions.

We have stayed in many exceptional hotels around the world, but the service we experienced at The Merrion puts it at the top of the heap. They have achieved the perfect balance of being warm, welcoming and attentive in a subtle way without being in your face and overbearing. All staff we encountered were a credit to the hotel. Other luxury hotels could learn a lot from The Merrion in regards to their service and staff.

We were so sad to leave, but we will be back next time we are in Dublin. If you are coming to Dublin, do yourself a favour and stay at The Merrion. You will not regret it.

",5,2014,03,24
200,Excellent Hotel!,All aspects of this hotel were excellent.  The room was very comfortable and all facilities were spotless.  You could not ask for better service or more polite staff.   We contacted the concierge by email before our trip for tour recommendations.  Clare was very helpful in planning and scheduling two of our tours.  We would definitely recommend this hotel!,5,2014,03,23
200,Great hotel in Dublin.,"We stayed here on St. Patrick's weekend for one night and were amazed by the great service and high standard of everything in the hotel. The reception and concierge couldn't be more helpful and the rooms were everything you could need. 

We also had dinner in the Cellar restaurant and it was lovely. 

Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a luxury stay in Dublin.",5,2014,03,23
200,Luxurious Hotel,"You are greeted by a doorman with top hat and tails, a warm fire welcomes you in the lobby.  Staff was very friendly and helpful,  and the room was beautiful.  Bathroom was completely marble with tub and glass shower. Luxurious towels were on warming towel bars, and bath robes and slippers were provided.  The room had a minibar, kettle with tea and coffee, Wedgewood cups and saucers, and an English ""brollie"" for use.  Cellar bar and restaurant were exceptional, and the pool/spa was spectacular.  Everything was wonderful....we felt like Royalty!!!",5,2014,03,23
200,"5 Star Luxury, Fantastic","My wife and I have just returned from a 2 night break at the Merrion Hotel. I was absolutely blown away by this hotel, it was fantastic. We arrived and were met by the concierge who took our bags and had our car parked. The check in was efficient and friendly, a nice welcome to the hotel and it gave us a taste of the standard of service that we were to enjoy throughout our stay.

Our room was beautiful with a lovely view of Merrion Street and Government buildings. The hotel itself is beautifully maintained and the decor and furniture etc are of a very good quality. The hotel is full of beautiful paintings and art works. The cellar bar was very comfortable and the staff very friendly.    

I could go on and on about this hotel but I will keep it short. I have stayed in numerous 5 star hotels around Ireland but this beats them all hands down. The service and staff are exceptional, each member of staff is a credit to the hotel. The staff are very attentive but not overwhelming. This is an expensive hotel but reasonably/competitively priced within the 5 star market. This was a treat for my wife and I and I believe it was worth the money. The location is fantastic also and a great platform to explore Dublin. 

There were numerous small touches during our stay that made our stay memorable. I can only hope that one day we will be able to return.",5,2014,03,23
200,Top Hotel Experience,We were spending a Christmas present voucher which made it doubly attractive. We had stayed here before but it's always such a treat you are surprised!. From the minute you step in the door everything is organised. We had a garden room overlooking the internal quadrangle garden -very calming.  Going out for lunch slightly raining -here's an umbrella. Going to the theatre  let us get you a taxi. Every request is attended to with good humour .,5,2014,03,23
200,"Wonderful hotel, very central location to central Dublin","We just returned from St Patrick's day weekend, we chose this hotel based all the other reviews on trip advisor.  The reviews were spot on staff were all very helpful, willing to accommodate you in any way.  The conceige provided excellent restaurants options for dinner and the associated reservations.

We asked for an upgrade to an interior room which we did receive.  Breakfast was a good decision to include during our stay, many options to chose from.

Try the cellar bar and hotel bar for drinks before or after dinner the staff was great.  

You won't be disappointed if you stay here",4,2014,03,22
200,Faultless,This is our preferred hotel whilst in Dublin.  Been a couple of times now; wouldn't go anywhere else.   More expensive than everywhere else but worth it.  Service from all staff is always polite and perfect.    Everywhere is super clean.  ,5,2014,03,22
200,"Comfortable Luxury, Convenient Location and Friendly Staff","Arrival at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin almost instantly dissolved the exhaustion of a 14 flight from SFO.  Daniel, head footman, greeted me by name upon arrival.  I mean, before I had checked in...  he opened the taxi door and said, Miss Little, welcome to The Merrion.   It stunned me and, although I had a reservation, I still don't know how he knew it was me as the hotel was fully booked!

Check in was quick, again welcoming and thoughtful - asking how they could help me get settled, get rested or get started on my week in Dublin.  Desk staff likewise knew me before they knew me...   and all staff that came in contact with me once, called me by name every time thereafter.  Every time.   Ran into the bellman in the elevator, greeted quietly by name ""Good morning Miss Little, are you finding your stay comfortable?""   The waitress who served lunch earlier in the day ""Good evening, Miss Little.""  The doormen came to hold a taxi for me to get to the office in the morning... ""Have a lovely day, Miss Little.""   Every time.  Without fail but quietly and without intrusion.   I felt safe and luxuriously welcome and at home.

The Merrion is centrally located, appointed in traditional luxury without being too grand.  The art throughout the hotel is amazing.  My room was a good size, spotlessly clean, updated yet traditionally decorated and very well appointed.  4-pc Bathroom all marble and porcelain and huge (especially by European standards)!  Housekeeping and room service all top-notch.

Each sitting room, parlor, dining room is comfortably sized, well appointed, fireplaces were always lit adding pleasant, quiet authenticity to the room.  The small, cozy bar well stocked and the barmen very knowledgeable and proud of the featured Irish whiskey's.  When we ordered the whisky flight and asked about whiskey, they sent Charles (?), the whisky sommelier who provided great information. 

Not only is this my Dublin hotel - it is now the standard by which I'll measure any European hotel forever.    I loved it.  I loved every minute at The Merrion.  You will too.",5,2014,03,22
200,"Excellent hotel, spa and staff",Stayed here for Valentine's weekend. Lovely hotel and very attentive staff. Gorgeous afternoon tea and relaxing spa treatment (massage). Bit pricey but worth every penny. Basic room. Nothing too fancy but pleasant and comfy enough. Nice turn down service. Would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning.,5,2014,03,21
200,Fabulous Meal in the Cellar Bar,"Hands down - this was the best meal that I have had all year in Dublin 

Service with a smile and attention to detail from Tania & Elvyra - they couldn't have been anymore welcoming or friendly. They explained the menu to great depths and even made some tasty recommendations 

I had the Pink Salmon Mousse & Merrion Superfood Salad - thoroughly recommended! My Merrion 'Pot of Gold' for Dessert was even tastier! Presentation was second to none on all dishes. 

I can see why The Merrion is ranked Number 1 Hotel in Dublin - Staff are trained and selected well which makes all the difference 

I'll definitely be returning",5,2014,03,21
200,Fab place to stay,Stayed at the Merrion for three nights to celebrate St Patrick's. Fantastic place to stay. Hotel is luxury itself in all areas. Service is second to none. Bar prices a bit on the high side but expected when staying in an hotel of this calibre. Excellent location. Thank you for making the weekend so memorable.,5,2014,03,19
200,Hard to surpass,"We stayed at the Merrion for an anniversary night away and were not disappointed. From the first welcome and throughout our stay the staff were faultless. As with any well run establishment they are never in the way and always there when you need assistance.

We were upgraded to a room with a view in the old part of the hotel and would highly recomend this hotel. 

The complimentary bottle of champers went down a treat.",5,2014,03,18
200,A HIDDEN GEM,"This hotel is fabulous. The rooms are gorgeous, the staff is friendly, it is everything you would want in an expensive five star hotel. Afternoon tea was splendid and they offered many tasty treats that my kids loved. But that pool, wow!! This hotel has an indoor pool made out of artisan tiles that is just spectacular. When you swim in it it looks like you are swimming under the sea!

Definitely the highlight of our Ireland trip. I love how the hotel looks hidden from the front, but extends very large in the back. Will definitely be back here!",5,2014,03,18
200,5+ Star Hotel,"I can say without reservation that this is THE NICEST hotel that I've ever stayed in anywhere in the world.  If I could give this hotel 6 Stars I would.

What makes this hotel so special is the dedication to services and elegance. The property itself is stunning.  The hotel marries old world elegance with modern comforts seamlessly.  The staff, from the bellmen out front to housekeeping, are all dedicated to providing first class service and they do so with such sincerity.  

I had mentioned in my reservation request that I was celebrating a special occasion and the hotel was so kind to upgrade me to a wonderful room French doors overlooking the gardens.  The room and bathroom were truly spectacular.    

Unfortunately I spent one night at The Merrion.  I regret that during my stay I failed to really enjoy all of the amenities that the hotel has to offer.  I did dine in the Cellar restaurant that adjoins the hotel and it was a fabulous meal.  The food and the service were first rate in a relaxed and enjoyable setting.  

While I don't find myself visiting Dublin regularly, I would most certainly stay here again in a heartbeat if given the chance.  I would also recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates tremendous service and the classic elegance of a luxury hotel.",5,2014,03,14
200,Wonderful,"We stayed there recently to celebrate my husbands 40th.
The hotel was fabulous and the service impeccable.
We had dinner in Guibaulds also ... superb
The room was a lovely size and beautifully furnished, but the bathroom was a bit outdated. Dissapointing to not have a proper shower (only one in the bath)
All in all a fabulous experience however.",5,2014,03,14
200,Excellent!,"This was a fantabulous hotel in a very well-situated area of town. Within walking distance to all of the good stuff. There were bowls of really fresh Fuji apples all over the place, which were so welcome. The staff was super responsive and the rooms...well, we had two rooms. One was small and overlooked a nasty alley, and the other room was twice the size and overlooked the 5-star courtyard. They cost the same amount. So...ask a lot of questions when you book, I guess.",5,2014,03,13
200,The epitome of Luxury,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Merrion a number of occasions and always enjoyed it.
The staff are wonderful & nothing is ever too much trouble for them, especially the concierge & portering staff.
I had the pleasure of spending my birthday there last week & for the first time ate at Patrick Guibaud.
There are few 5 star hotels in Dublin & whilst I’m always a Four Seasons fan the Merrion just has the edge for ambiance.
I love the Shelbourne too & always enjoy a drink in the Saddle room bar but the bar & foyer are always a bit too busy for any meaningful relaxation.
If you want a city centre location, with safe car parking ( always valet ) & exquisite cuisine you really have to just book The Merrion.
Check their own website for regular special offers.",5,2014,03,07
200,Quite simply the best,"Had the pleasure of staying at The Merrion for about a week. Everything - room, service, food - was excellent. I have stayed in many luxury hotels, but The Merrion is now my absolute favorite. Not flashy. Understated and elegant. The staff is peerless. The property is beautiful. In Dublin, do not stay anywhere else. And when you do go, be sure to ask for a room in the main house. Just gorgeous. ",5,2014,03,06
200,The best hotel I have stayed in so far!,"Excellent hotel. The room we had was fabulous, we were complimentary upgraded to a suite to celebrate my fiancées 30th birthday! The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us! I wish we could of stayed another night and I will definitely book this hotel again. ",5,2014,03,05
200,"Fantastic Hotel, Best Service Ever!","We were amazed by the quality of service and kindness of ALL the people who work in the hotel, whether it be the Concierge, the receptionists, the waiters, the bartenders, room service, housekeeping, spa staff and I really hope I'm not forgetting anyone because they all deserve to be remembered! 
We had such a lovely stay, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and so comfortable, the courtyard is one of the many cherries on this cake.
We have two young/very young children and the Merrion made us feel at home and they we're so wonderful with the kids, the kids menu is the best I've ever seen, they have little bathrobes and slippers even for toddlers so they can go down to the pool. The pool is so clean and pleasant, the spa treatments are great.
There is not one negative thing I can say about the Merrion, I just can't wait to go back!",5,2014,03,05
200,The Merrion Hotel - quite simply superb,"Our stay in The Merrion Hotel was a delight from start to finish.  From the moment we arrived we were very well looked after by the attentive and professional staff; all of whom were a credit to the hotel.

We had not stayed in the hotel before but had been there on many previous occasions for drinks and/or lunch.

The food (as always) was superb and the room and facilites were excellent.  

Repairs/replacement were being carried out to the carpets in the drawing rooms on the morning of our departure but even this was handled professionally and with no disturbance at all to the guests.

We cannot wait to return and would recommend without hesitation.",5,2014,03,05
200,Friendly,"One of the best choices of lodgement in Dublin. Walking distance from some Dublin city sights such as The Stephen's Green, The National Gallery and St. Patrick Church. Dependencies includes a large swimming pool and steaming room at the basement. Courteous costumer service are available and they were very friendly and kind with me and my partner. Having brunch at The Cellar Restaurant really worth it.",5,2014,03,02
200,Best hotel in Dublin!!,"Stayed at The Merrion for two nights last weekend for my boyfriend's 26th birthday. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, the rooms were beautifully decorated, gorgeous Italian marble bathrooms and the comfiest bed we have ever slept in!  Ordered breakfast to the room on the first morning which was pricey but lovely tasting and set us up for a nice swim in the stunning swimming pool. My boyfriend then had a hot stone massage which he highly rated. The second night we came back to the hotel extremely merry and rowdy after being out all day and night round Dublin, the staff were amazing and found us highly entertaining - there was no snobbery or people turning their noses up at us haha we had a ball! The meal in the cellar restaurant was fab too and we enjoyed the drinks in the cellar bar! Thank you Merrion for a great weekend, we will be back (if you let us) :D xxx

200,Brilliant,"Just home tonight after 4 nights there.  Wow, what can I say.  The young man at checking went above and beyond to make us welcome.  I wish I had his name to give him credit.  He remembered speaking to my husband and made great strides to make us feel welcome.  He was warm, friendly and made a great holiday for our kids, remembering our name to say hello during our stay. Keen, who brought our bags to the room was such a lovely fresh faced help.  Everyone in the hotel was friendly and kind holding doors and greeting us.  I especially enjoyed the gentlemen who helped me with the stroller at the door even though I said I was fine.  The pool was great, (the woman who got floaties for our 3 yr old was a hero). The location was super and we cannot wait to go back.  My 6 year old cried for an hour while leaving as she wanted to live there.  Top notch, thank you!",5,2014,02,28
200,Understated Elegance and Charm,"The Merrion hotel is beautiful visually and located perfectly in Dublin. Despite the lovely surroundings and outstanding food and wine, I would consider that the best thing about the Merrion is its staff. They have the unique ability to anticipate your every need, before it even arises! Their professionalism and ability to please is second to none. As we were celebrating a special birthday, upon arrival, we were fortunate enough to receive a room upgrade, which made the entire stay extra special. Looking forward to the next visit!",5,2014,02,26
200,The Jewel in Dublin's Crown!,"Have just returned from a fabulous stay to celebrate a special birthday with my Wife. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel the most important person in the Merrion. From the conciege to the front of house staff everyone is there to make your stay memorable. 

We were upgarded on arrival and enjoyed the champagne in the room. The Spa was a wonderful relaxing experience. 

We had breakfast in our room and Casey and her team were fantastic (thankyou for the card, chocolates and cake!). The restaurant is a great experience for both lunch and dinner. The standard of food and service second to none.

 It is the attention to detail which makes the Merrion such a special place. There is a air of calm and tranquility throughout the whole hotel. A truly unique experience! Thank you all. We will be back!",5,2014,02,25
200,5* LUXURY IN DUBLIN,"The whole 5* experience starts as soon as you arrive. A warm, friendly welcome awaits at reception followed by a porter who gets your lugagge to your room at lightning speed. The GARDEN room was immaculate, the bathroom was clean and well stocked. The Merrion has thought of everything (check the cupboards and drawers) and it was a truly wonderful experience. 
Dinner was expertly served to a large group of us (14) in the CELLAR and this had all the touches of a Michelin star restaurant. The Merrion staff at at all times attentive but not intrusive. Noting is too much trouble and the ambeince of the Merrion makes you feel relaxed. Breakfast in my room was served promptly at the requested time and again every conceivable item was on the table. 
I used the SPA for a massge by a great guy called Hud Alex. He's from Brazil and after 30 minutes with him your aches and pains will have disappeared completely. Well done Merrrion - you have a loyal guest for life",5,2014,02,24
200,flawless,"thank you once again to all the staff at the merrion for another flawless weekend.
we had a lovely time and fell rejuvenated after our weekend away.
the food in the cellar restaurant was excellen,t and on this occasion we also had dinner in restaurant Patrick Gibaud, which was amazing.
I know the hotel is not cheap, however you get what you pay for.
Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,02,24
200,Fantastic 5 star service,"Stayed for one night as part of my partners birthday celebration. Ramona checked us in. She was lovely. We arrived early and went to The Cellar Bar for lunch and she brought down our room key. Damien and Phil gave us excellent service. The chocolate mousse was delicious. The Merrion is very central. Breakfast was beautiful, such a selection of everything. The homemade pancakes are yummy. Vanessa and Charlie looked after us very well. The room we stayed in was really beautiful. Very spacious bathroom. Hope some day we get the chance to return. Thank you The Merrion we enjoyed our stay very much.",5,2014,02,23

From the moment you arrive at the door you are taken care of: car parked, luggage delivered to the room, turndown service, nothing can be faulted. Service is friendly without being excessive. Spa was wonderful. Thank you for another lovely stay.",5,2014,02,21
200,"Wow, service second to none....","Stayed in the Merrion for our 30th Wedding Anniversary for two nights. I have not experienced such personal, professional and friendly service in any other hotel.

We were upgraded to a Luxury King room in the main house due to it being our anniversary and we were treated to a beautiful cake personalised with happy anniversary on our arrival.  Had a wonderful afternoon tea on the first afternoon and were given a glass of champagne on the house to celebrate......felt like royalty.

Every member of staff, without exception, was friendly and greeted us by name on every possible opportunity.  The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and your every wish was catered to whether it was in the restaurant, the spa or the concierge. I already want to return!!

Many thanks for an amazing stay.",5,2014,02,19
200,Wonderful Hotel,"Not the cheapest place in the world but if you want class you have to pay for it and I thought the value for money was excellent. Superb cocktails and sumptuous wine.
Its nice to treat yourself now and again.",5,2014,02,19
200,Great Service,"Possibly the best service I have experienced in any hotel. Really enjoyed the evening I spenct there. As I was walking down the corridor a woman working there overheard me saying I needed to charge my phone she told me she would take it and charge it and deliver it to the bar where I was going, simple things like that which made it an excellent hotel to stay. Bedroom was very comfortable and the concierge was very helpful. Will definitely be back",5,2014,02,19
200,Fabulous Stay!,Stayed for 3 nights in a garden room and it was great. Service exceptional. Warm and friendly. Rooms are understated and elegant. Room service was fab and bar well stocked. It was our anniversary and they sent a lovely desert to our room! The spa was amazing and the algae wrap was the best treatment I have ever had! We will definitely come back!,5,2014,02,19
200,As good as it gets !,"From the moment we arrived to our departure this hotel was faultless .You feel so relaxed the moment you walk in the door (time seems to slow down , which is not a bad thing ). Really can not recommend enough . The staff are incredible , decor beautiful , superior garden room amazing , food excellent  , treatment area and pool brilliant . Maybe looks a little expensive but worth every penny .",5,2014,02,19
200,The Best Hotel I have ever stayed in.,"I have stayed in many hotels around the world, but I have to say The Merrion is the best I have ever stayed in. From the way you are treated on arrival to the food, excellent breakfast and warm homely atmosphere, this is a must to stay at if visiting Dublin. Great rooms, great service matched by a beautiful City. Simply excellent.",5,2014,02,18
200,Great hotel shame about the rugby,"Stayed in the Merrion again with the tribe for the Scotland v Ireland game. The service was impeccable as usual from all the staff. My sons had room service breakfast which got devoured and which they said was excellent, their room service burger again was very good although I have to say at €25 a pop plus service charge was pretty expensive. All in all the best hotel I have stayed at in Dublin",5,2014,02,18
200,Amazing service in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I availed of their Valentine's Day package which consisted of an overnight stay, dinner for two at the Cellar Restaurant and breakfast the following morning (although we both live in Dublin, we love staying in fancy hotels in the city centre!). From the moment we arrived, the level of service we were to receive was evident, from the valet who looked after our car and bags, to the person at reception who, in addition to booking us in, then left his desk and brought us directly to our room, explaining the hotel's history as he did so.

The room was lovely and the 5-course meal was the nicest we've ever had. Breakfast was also of a very high quality. Another great asset is the Cellar Bar, which had a very relaxed atmosphere.

I would highly recommend the Merrion and hope to be able to stay there again.",5,2014,02,18
200,Old world finery with modern twist,Stayed here overnight for rugby weekend. The concierge is extremely professional even remembers your name on checking out. The hotel is beautiful with large drawing rooms and blazing fires. I had the afternoon tea which was a nice experience: I would highly recommend. Comfortable room with garden view. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom. I missed breakfast so cannot comment. The hotel is a little pricey and the room service menu was a bit pricey. However if you want indulgence and a memorable experience worth the little extra. Best recommendation- take walk around the inner gardens and spend time reviewing their art collection.,4,2014,02,16
200,Amazing hotel,"We arrived on the 30th of January only to be greeted with an amazing welcome from your warm, highly skilled concierge team headed by Sean. Such professionalism and attention. Tom was also so attentive in making sure our car was parked to perfection and he is such a pleasant person. We felt like royalty to say the least! We then proceeded to check in with your very friendly reception staff and subsequently escorted to our amazing room overlooking the internal gardens. One of our requests was to have a relatively quiet tranquil room given my wife is a very light sleeper and needless to say, you exceeded our expectations. My wife has been very supportive lately due to my recent illness and I wanted this to be a special experience. Needless to say, Sheila graced us with this amazing room and I am eternally grateful to her for giving us this wonderful privilege. 

Dinner on Thursday was something else. Our first port of call was the cellar bar where we enjoyed a couple of pre dinner drinks served by Shane. He exudes fantastic qualities including warmth, positive attitude and a high standard of service. A very true professional. Dinner was amazing and the service second to none. We could not fault our food at all! This may sound cliched, however the overall experience was just perfect. I also have to mention that both breakfast experiences were again, wonderful. Our hot plates were cooked to perfection and the service yet again, of the highest standard. 

I also have to say that our room was regularly presented to us  beautifully both during the day and in the evening when we were left the odd treat by way of bottled water, fruit plates and our bed turned down with such impeccable detail. 

The Merrion has a certain calm that I cannot describe. We have been fortunate over the years to stay in various destinations but none that have a uniqueness such as yours. It is not pretentious in any way and just has a certain feel that I cannot put into words. You have obviously achieved something special and once again, I thank you sincerely for a truly wonderful two day visit. 

I understand that I will not have mentioned everyone and apologise for this. Again Mr MacCann, sincere congratulations to you and your team for putting the Merrion in our opinion, at the top of the tree and beyond.",5,2014,02,15
200,Five star,"We have stayed at a number of five star hotels in Dublin Centre but this is the best. Lovely hotel with a traditional homely feel. Dined in the Cellar restaurant and the food was excellent. Also, used the spa - hot stone massage, which I can definitely recommend",5,2014,02,12
200,What a wonderful find!,"I've visited Dublin many times in the last twenty years and had never stayed here - a colleague said she would stay there for our trip so I decided to join her. From the moment I arrived I felt so at home. The staff were exceptional - polite and very welcoming and helpful. The public rooms - 'drawing rooms' are just lovely with open fires and comfortable settees and easy chairs. Overall it's shabby chic without being shabby - it is wonderful. My room was super - easy room temperature control, a window I could - and did - open, a warm towel rail in the bathroom, a fantastic shower, all mod cons including Asprey toiletries (I've only ever come across these at Gleneagles and they're lovely), and a really comfortable and good night's sleep. Thank you to the Merrion - I'll definitely be back and will gladly recommend it.",5,2014,02,11
200,"Great location, superb service, huge bathrooms!","We recently stayed at this hotel and could not have been more pleased. Although it has an unassuming entrance, inside is lovely. Our room was cheerful and the bathroom was frankly the largest we have encountered in European hotels, as well as nicely appointed. Dublin in January was chilly but the common areas of the hotel all had lovely warming  fires burning throughout the day and night. Service was impeccable - waitstaff in the bars and downstairs restaurant were friendly and helpful. The doormen were very knowledgeable.  The hotel location can't be beat!",5,2014,02,11
200,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in this hotel last week after a long haul flight. We were exhausted, but we got an early check in. What a luxury!!! We have stayed here several times before including the night before our sons wedding so we knew what to expect but this time surpassed our expectations. Thank you to the Merrion Hotel for looking after us so well.",5,2014,02,10
200,"Amazing hotel, Exceptional experience","This hotel is by far the best hotel in Dublin, the Conceirge, Reception and Restaurant Staff are truely a pleasure to deal with. They are so professional, couteous and helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be back. The food was exceptional, everything was just perfect.",5,2014,02,10
200,Faultless,Just spent another fabulous weekend at Merrion.  My husband and I make an annual trip to this hotel and we are never disappointed.  The staff are outstanding and the hotel itself gorgeous.  Nothing is left to chance and all staff go out of their way to be helpful.  We look forward to our return visit.,5,2014,02,10
200,A wonderful birthday surprise,"Stayed at The Merrion as a surprise for my significant birthday and I was certainly not disappointed!  We did a few laps of St Stephens green before we found the very understated hotel but when we realised we had arrived we were greeted by a very calm gentleman who took over everything and our perfect stay began.  The room was charming - we were overlooking the gardens.  As it was a special birthday I received champagne, chocolates and cake - all lovely ! We ate in the 2 Mitchelin star restaurant which was lovely - we had the tasting menu - fantastic !",5,2014,02,09
200,Trip to Dublin,"I recently visited Dublin for a Saturday night to visit and have a nice meal, as it was January the weather was not good but I stayed in The Merrion Hotel in Dublin which was excellent. The rooms are very well equipped and all the facilities are there that you need. it is not cheap but it is a 5 star hotel and you are probably better off getting a suite for a family than as a single person like myself. Good bars in the hotel and a lovely pool spa etc so would be good for a few days visit if you have the time.",5,2014,02,06
200,One of the Best in Dublin,"This is one of those prestigous, quiet properties with lovely, well-furnished rooms that says ""old world luxury"" from the first stop at reception. Rooms with all the bath & bed accoutrements, spoiling you. Library and fireplace rooms perfect for tea and reading. Wonderful pool - however, the spa needs updating. It is feeling tired compared to other more updated properties in Dublin. A wonderful splurge that is quite pricey but worth it for a getaway weekend. ",5,2014,02,05
200,A Fabulous City Centre Retreat,"From the moment of arriving outside the front door of the Merrion to departing two days later, our stay was an absolute pleasure.  By far the hotel with the most to offer of any city break we have stayed in and an excellent location.  The team in each area of the hotel, especially the front of house team, the cellar bar and health club and spa, were superb.  The hotel is very well decorated and presented throughout yet retains immense feeling of warmth and a welcoming atmosphere.  Excellent bedrooms and bathrooms with very good facilities provided.  Great food choice at breakfast although the team were perhaps unorganized and very slow.  Dinner downstairs in the Merrion was superb and offered a wonderful menu.  Fully recommend the hotel and look forward to any opportunity to enjoy it again soon!",5,2014,02,04
200,A very good hotel,"A very comfortable hotel with extremely friendly, helpful staff. The public rooms are enticing and the bedrooms are well-appointed. Our only criticisms are that the Sunday breakfast service in the Cellar restaurant was poor and a minor point is that the bedrooms are too hot and the air conditioning is very noisy when one tries to cool the room.  It is not a cheap hotel, by any means but it is the best we have stayed in in Dublin. ",4,2014,02,03
200,Worth every penny,"It's not often you find a 5star hotel that delivers on every aspect being perfect for both couples and families.  I had the pleasure of staying in the Merrion twice recently within a very short period.  Firstly without the kids when my husband was doing the Dublin Marathon and secondly as a family for a pre Christmas break.  The level of service and attention to detail on both occasions was exceptional.  There was a pre marathon menu and post marathon sports massage available during our first visit and the location made the Merrion an ideal choice for marathon runners.  On entering the hotel you feel a sense of calm, the atmosphere is genteel and relaxing and the well appointed rooms tastefully decorated.  
On our second stay we had two interconnecting rooms which these days is a rarity in hotels and absolutely perfect for our needs.  There was a welcome pack for the Children with smoothies and fruit kebabs and mini dressing gowns and slippers in the wardrobe.  We did have an unfortunate incident with my son locking himself in the bathroom which was swiftly dealt with by the arrival of a maintenance man and disaster was avoided. We ordered dinner from the room service menu and standard was excellent with a very well thought out menu for the younger ones.  
We made daily trips to the hotel pool which was extremely welcoming and the staff made a fuss of my son who is autistic, making sure we had buoyancy aids.  We started off with a timid boy afraid of the water and came home different child who was very relaxed in the pool and actually enjoyed swimming.  My daughter loved the loungers and felt very grown up sipping her drink at he side of the pool.
Another thing to note is the quietness which is very welcome and hard to achieve in a city centre location.
I cannot praise this hotel and staff enough and will, I am sure be a repeat visitor every time I return to Dublin.",5,2014,02,01
200,Art Tea at the Merrion,"Arrived here at 2.40pm for a 3pm booking. Everybody was so hospitable and friendly. Was immediately shown to the bar as our table wasnt ready yet. Had a lovely pint while waiting although prices are a bit stiff so beware.
Art tea was absolutely superb. The collection of perfectly made sandwiches, different variety of tea, the smoked salmon, beef, scones, clotted cream and jam was mouth watering. The wonderful topping on this irresistible cake were the deserts. 3 deserts made and designed after 3 artworks in the hotel. Magnificent designs and very tasty to boot.
Add in the tranquil setting in the drawing room and the friendly, knowledgeable staff who couldn't do enough for us and I think this wont be the first or last time the Merrion will be seeing us as customers. Superb.",5,2014,01,30
200,Superb hotel!!,"I have been staying in the Merrion on and off for the past 3 years on business and work and i have always meant to write a review on just how absolutely wonderful this hotel is. As a solo lady traveller i find the Merrion simply superb both for high standards of excellence and on amazing staff. From the minute i arrive the doormen greet me by my name and look after me with such kindness and are so welcoming. My luggage is always taken care of and the reception staff are so professional but equally welcoming. As i am alone i never feel nervous or uncomfortable far from it as every member of staff is always so kind and the room service is definitely first class. My room is in the garden wing and its always immaculate and so well taken care of and its just so nice to feel so welcomed everytime i stay. If anyone is a solo traveller and needs a truely wonderful hotel in Dublin then please pick the Merrion as you will certainly feel very safe, relaxed and you really wont want to leave. So i just want to say a big thanks to all the staff for always looking after me so well i really appreciate your wonderful 5* service.and well done to the Merrion. Mrs. G Kearney",5,2014,01,29
200,Lovely hotel,"Our first stay in Dublin was a bit challenging as my wife was quite ill; however, the wonderful staff and beautiful hotel made our stay more than comfortable.  The Merrion Hotel must pride itself on its exceptional staff, all of whom are quite professional and caring.  I was most impressed with the front desk crew, including the doormen; these staff often are the first impression for guests, and the Merrion crew were most helpful.  The rooms, hallways, grounds and restaurant were well maintained and spotless.",5,2014,01,25
200,Excellent Hotel,Great service from every single member of staff I came into contact with.   Professional yet friendly.   Very comfortable public areas and a great cocktail bar.   Cellar restaurant meal was very good.   Room was immaculate and good size.  Highly recommended.,5,2014,01,22
200,Great Place in the heart of Dublin,"The Merrion is probably one of the best options in Dublin.
We had two adjoining rooms in the newer part overlooking the garden.
Rooms are comfortable, clean and super quiet.
Room service is outstanding, the BEST fish & chips of all of Ireland!
Great place!",5,2014,01,20
200,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"We had a wonderful stay in Dublin in part because of this great hotel. Perfect service, we felt pampered from the beginning to the end. Everybody in this hotel is very nice and  deserve all the applause. Wonderful food and service at the Cellar restaurant. The Art Tea was perfect, in front of the fireplace, impressive  artworks  all over the hotel. Not to miss the James Joyce statue in the garden. Will stay there for sure if we have to go back to Dublin and recommend to anyone who love staying in wonderful hotels.",5,2014,01,18
200,Great couple of days,"Had an amazing couple of days with my wife at this super city centre hotel. We had a fantastic meal in the restaurant and a great meal in our room. The public rooms really are a relaxing area to sit and watch the world.  I would highly recommend this hotel for some time out.
",5,2014,01,18
200,"A top quality, beautiful and peaceful sanctuary right in the centre of Dublin.","This was our second time at The Merrion and it has had some money spent since our last visit but it manages to have everything a top quality hotel needs, wi fi, top notch bathrooms, very quiet and well equipped bedrooms but step out of this 21st Century environment into a 18th Century Georgian environment, turf fires, candle lit bars and original elegance of time gone by.
The staff were everywhere when you needed them but service was unconspicious and highly efficient. Everything appears to move at a different pace and we found ourselves relaxing and enjoying sitting reading, having a coffee or a drink far removed for the hussle and bussle of a majpor city right outside youir front door.
The Merrior is located right in the centre of Dublin, a 5 minute stroll from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street shopping hub, or turn right at the door and explore Merrion Square and the homes of the famous people who lived there, or cross the street to the National Gallery.
We were sorry to leave, had a brilliant time and visited the 2 star Michelin Restaurant in the hotel which was outstanding and the wine list is about 3 inches deep! Service was impeccible with a traditional French theme using the highest quality local produce. My mouth wtaers just thinkibng about it.
The rooms were serviced twice a day - not just a turn down service but a complete revamp of everythibng that was needed.
Relaxing luxury with the Capital right on your doorstep - if you can bring yourself to leave this luxury environment.
Well deserved Hotel of the Year 2013!",5,2014,01,18
200,Great First Impression,"Loved the ambiance, character, and the boutique nature of this hotel.  Wasn't quite sure what to expect and was definitely impressed with the staff and the elegance of the hotel.  Will stay here again when coming to Dublin.",5,2014,01,17
200,Wish we had longer here,"We stayed at the Merrion for 1 night before we left Ireland.  The staff was extremely welcoming and accommodating.  The property was elegant and comfortable.  Our room seemed a bit dated, the carpets maybe a bit old and I haven't seem a bedspread in a fine hotel in a while, but that didn't inhibit our enjoyment at all.  They catered to my kids, bringing robes and slippers for them.  Plus an array of baby bath products.  The Cellar restaurant was delicious.  And room service in the morning was delightful.    Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to enjoy this hotel to the fullest, but we will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Dublin.",5,2014,01,15
200,One of the Best Hotels Ever,"We stayed at the Merrion over the week of New Years.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty.  The bell staff and front desk employees were as kind and accommodating as possible.  The hotel itself is inviting, and has so much to offer.  From seating areas for a quick bite or pint, to high tea (so much fun - try it at least once!), two pubs and one really good restaurant.  My wife remarked that she could just move in.  The full breakfast was one of the best ever.  The rooms are a bit small, but the bathroom was large and luxurious.  The hotel amenities are excellent.  The concierge Clare, was amazing.   If you go to Dublin, stay at this hotel.  I will be back.",5,2014,01,13
200,Perfect Christmas thanks to the Merrion Hotel,"My partner and I stayed in the Merrion Hotel over Christmas. Despite living within walking distance of the hotel, we decided to stay in The Merrion as a way to get away and spend some quality time together. We were treated fantastically by the staff, who are incredibly skilled in their roles. The hotel is beautiful and situated in the heart of Georgian Dublin. We also had a delicious Christmas Day 5 course lunch in the Cellar Restaurant and awaiting in our room (Superior King) was a welcome basket and bottle of champagne. We spent the evening in the imposing residents lounge in front of an open log fire drinking mulled wine and eating mince pies. We were treated extremely well at all times by the staff and we really felt accommodated for. The room was adequately equipped with everything one would need for a comfortable stay. Our room was overlooking the well maintained garden and while we were walking off our Christmas lunch our room was tidied and the bed made. We have since returned to the Merrion's Cellar Bar and will continue to do so. The breakfast was delicious and there is a plentiful selection of fruits, cheeses and pastries etc and we also had a traditional Irish breakfast (the potato bread was probably the best I ever had!). If you stay in the Merrion, make time to see the amazing art on display. If i remember correctly, there is a guide to the artwork in every room. I would suggest including information on the history of the hotel and building. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a luxury break, attentive staff and historic surroundings.",5,2014,01,12
200,Fantastic,"Me and my husband recently visited the hotel for the first time and it sure wont be the last. From the minute we arrived til we left we were looked after in the best possible way. Staff were so helpful and service was so good. The only thing I can complain about was that at breakfast the cellar restaurant hadn't been cleaned properly from dinner the night before as there was broccoli on the floor around the table we sat at, but that was just a minor thing. Will save up to return as soon as I can. We had booked the five star steal deal and it was worth every penny.",5,2014,01,12
200,Excellent hotel in good location,"Travelled to The Merrion on business in December 2013 and stayed for 3 nights. The service starts at the front door with the doorman who is polite and helpful. The checking in process was quick and effortless and lack any sort of fuss. The rooms were of a good size, very clean and well appointed and all the staff that work in the hotel are helpful and efficient. Location for business of pleasure is very good and a simple transfer from the airport. This is a fantastic place to stay in Dublin and would heartily recommend anyone staying here. I look forward to returning again later this year.",5,2014,01,11
200,Beautiful Hotel!,We stayed here for a night in December and were upgraded to a suite in the main building that was beautiful. After eating at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant we went to explore this elegant hotel. The staff were very helpful and polite in all areas and the staff in the breakfast room were superb with nothing too much trouble. Although we didn't get the time to use the spa we were very impressed when we had a look around and will definitely make time on our next visit.,5,2014,01,11
200,The Merrion is a wonderful hotel.,My partner and I stayed at the Merrion Hotel just before Christmas 2013.  We had a wonderful stay and the hotel staff could not have been more helpful.  The service was second to none and the old world charm is lovely.  It was worth every penny.  I also had a treatment at the Tethra Spa.  It was fantastic. I cannot praise the Merrion enough and I'm not easily pleased.  We will be staying again without a doubt.,5,2014,01,11
200,A perfect stay,"Our first perfect experience was the unexpected call we received from them 2 weeks before our arrival to make sure that we had something planned for New Years Eve as the events were filling up. They took care of our reservation for the Cellar Bar and verified the reservation once we arrived. They also sent us an email a week before we arrived to let us know, so that we were not surprised, that they believed our flight was due to arrive hours before the check-in time and made sure we knew to drop our luggage off and that they would take everything up to our room once it was ready, which we did. (While waiting we enjoyed a wonderful brunch in the Cellar Bar) The food was fantastic, the room was so very comfortable, roomy and clean. The pools was amazing, clean and the sauna off the pool was the perfect temperature. Even though I did not take advantage of the Spa, the staff there were very down to earth, professional and friendly. They recommended a great salt scrub when I asked them for a salt to use in my bath and it was the best scrub I have ever used and it really helped my fatigued winter tired jet lagged body. The bar is open 24 hours, to hotel guests only, and was a wonderful place to unwind and enjoy an Irish Whiskey (try the flight) or one of their many delicious house drinks. The entire hotel is simply beautiful filled with lovely antiques and art. But will really makes this a 5 star hotel is the staff.. they truly made our vacation perfect.",5,2014,01,10
200,Excellent Hotel great location in Dublin with very Professional Staff.,"Booked 1 night over Christmas 2013 and lucky to have stayed in many lovely hotels all over the World over the last 20 years.
The Merrion Hotel is certainly one of best in a great location in Dublin with excellent Professional staff.
John ",5,2014,01,10
200,Wonderful New Year's Eve,We visit The Merrion on 3 or 4 times a year and it is our favourite Dublin hotel. Over the last number of years we have spent New Years Eve in The Merrion and this year was one of the most enjoyable. The staff make you feel so welcome and even though the hotel was fully booked they had time to stop and talk to you and make you feel special. Our trip to The Merrion was the highlight of Christmas 2013.,5,2014,01,09
200,Perfect relaxation,"perfect location just a short walk from Grafton Street and Stephens Green,very relaxing and extremely good staff. We Irish still aren't used to valet parking and its high charges.
Dinner and breakfast as good as you would expect.",5,2014,01,09
200,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel really is a gem.  We spent four nights, including Hogmany, in The Merrion and it was such a special experience. The hotel is beautifully decorated with works of art complimenting the impressive drawing rooms and bar.  Afternoon tea looks incredible, sadly we did not have time to try this but it is on the to do list for next time.  The Spa is just stunning with the most helpful staff and high quality products.  Our bedroom was in the Garden Wing (I think that is the correct name), and we were so impressed.  The decor was classic and the bed and seating were so comfortable.  Excellent facilities and extras provided for you, everything is to the highest quality.  There is a handbook in the room and I would really recommend taking the time to actually read this one properly as the hotel can offer you so much, it is really worth having a look at so you can make the most of your stay.  The courtyard garden is perfect and worth spending some time in.  The staff at reception are also exceedingly helpful, as are the concierge, I have never experienced such friendly, happy people! The food: wow!  We had room service two of the nights, the food was amazing (!), served quickly and presented immaculately.  We spend Hogmany in The Cellar Bar which is beautiful and very atmospheric, again, the bar food is delicious.  Brilliant wine list as well.  A bonus was the live band playing that evening, superb!  I really cannot fault this hotel whatsoever.  Please stay here when you are visiting Dublin, you will not regret it!",5,2014,01,06
200,Frosty reception when checking in with a gift voucher,"We staying here recently thanks to a wonderful wedding gift from a friend for a special occasion. The ambience of the hotel and the decorations made the hotel look great. The concierge staff were very friendly upon arrival but we were most surprised with the greeting we received at the reception desk when I informed them that Ihad a voucher to cover the cost of the stay. The reception staff tried to dissuade me from using the voucher and pay by card instead. This was surprising and embarrassing for us it the busy reception area.
On the other hand the bedroom was really nice and the bed very comfortable. The swimming pool is great and the spa area impressive. We had dinner in the cellar restaurant and found the food to be of a high standard and the restaurant staff to be very professional. The breakfast was also of a very high standard and the staff went the extra mile to ensure we had everything we needed for breakfast in a relaxed environment on the Sunday morning.",3,2014,01,06
200,Keeps getting better....,"Another amazing Xmas at this stellar property... Of special note this year was the GENUINE friendliness of the entire Room Service, Front Desk and (incredibly/refreshingly) the Operator (!) staff. I should also mention that i received an email follow-up to my ""guest questionnaire"" which i dropped off at the front-desk at check-out. In the spirit of constructive feedback i had pointed out very minor hiccups which i thought mgmt might appreciate. Well, they did, and i was informed that ""suitable re-training will be put in place"". How's that for being on top of things! Keep it up Merrion, you are better than ever.

P/S: The Dead & Coffee Cake
A unique hidden-gem of a discovery in, of all places, Deansgrange Cemetary in Blackrock. This cemetary deserves a visit on its own (antique) merits, but we were delighted to stumble upon The Tranquil Tea Rooms within the cemetary grounds. Hands-on owner serving up what was the best coffee cake i've ever tasted plus delicious French-press coffee, scones, walnut cake and other traditional Irish treats. Seek it out if you are in Blackrock.",5,2014,01,06
200,splendid luxury hotel in central Dublin,A classy place with understated elegance.  The staff were friendly and so helpful.   The rooms are smart and clean with every amenity.   We were there for our first wedding anniversary and were supplied with champagne and chocolates personally annotated,5,2014,01,06
200,Lovely family stay,"We stayed with our 3 teenagers in mid December. Each staff member we encountered was polite, friendly and helpful. The rooms were well-decorated and peaceful. The included breakfast in the Cellar restaurant was high-quality. My husband and I loved having drinks in the evening by the fireplaces in the lovely, cozy sitting rooms. We were able to easily walk to museums, Grafton street, Trinity College, and the like from the hotel.

I would happily stay here again on another trip to Dublin!",5,2014,01,04
200,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is excellent in every way. Staff excelled themselves after I discovered on arrival I had been robbed at the airport. Although nothing to do with the hotel they made the whole experience as painless as possible. The style of the hotel was sofisticated but relaxed often difficult to achieve.
The facilities were exellent, I loved the pool but would like to have seen children banned at certain times so you could be sure not to bump into them (and their nannies).
The restaurant was also very good, not always the case in top hotels.
Would recommend and return.",5,2014,01,04
200,One of the best,"From the moment we arrived at The Merrion we were treated with the utmost professionalism and courtesy.  So refreshing to see ample well trained staff, with humour and instinct as well as a wealth of local knowledge.
It being Christmas time, the hotel was decorated with an array of beautiful lights, making the most of its natural charm, and giving us a really special experience.
The room was gorgeous, with a wonderfully comfy bed and luxurious bathroom, including really good scales which showed me as half a stone lighter than my own at home!!  A small extra would have been a duvet on the bed - the nice quality blanket provided was not quite cosy enough for a December night.
We really wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the delightful sitting rooms and terrace, as well as try the fabulous looking pool.  This hotel had something wonderful to see around every corner, and we will definitely return when next in Dublin.",5,2014,01,03
200,Excellent anniversary getaway,"We stayed on a winter getaway deal for one night for our 5th anniversary.  We had a plate of cupcakes put in the room which was a lovely touch.  Gorgeous room, huge bed and bathroom and sitting area.  Lovely swim and excellent breakfast-an excellent romantic escape!",5,2014,01,03
200,Nice Experience but...,"Did not completely meet our expectations.. 

on arrival, escorted to our room which was very spacious, clean and comfortable, we were then given a ""brief"" overview of the hotel facilites. unfortunately, this was rushed and we were left still unsure re the restaurant / pool opening times etc etc 

service, overall very good but not 100% (slow on busy periods in restaraunt) not good when you are dining with young children!

staff (in all areas), extremely helpful and polite

location, great for grafton street etc 

would definately stay here again !",4,2014,01,03
200,Excellent stay in Dublin!,"We enjoyed our short stay and would stay here again next visit! The rooms were comfortable and the staff most helpful. We loved the art collection on display. The location was ideal for us, and we were able to walk to all the points of interest.
",5,2014,01,02
200,A Bit of Downton Abbey,"The staff is fabulous, not just warm and welcoming but a bit of old Ireland.  Of course, what do I know, I'm a New Yorker originally from California.  And the Hotel is first rate.  The rooms are luxurious and clean with intelligent furniture that facilitates the tea service..available right in the rooms.  There were freshly baked cookies delivered to the room daily for that tea.  Terrific.  
And the teenagers in our party loved the luxury and High Tea (a bit pricey).  Dinner in the cellar restaurant was great.  Extraordinary desserts.  Great Stay!",5,2014,01,02
200,I Love this place,"The Merrion is my favourite hotel ever, I do travel a lot and have experienced a lot of different hotels but none compare to the Merrion. I like this hotel so much I decided to get engaged there, the friendliness and warmth of the staff is second to none. Any time I'm in Dublin I go into number 23 for  a drink, for me it's more like a living room than a hotel, the staff always make you feel so welcome. I had the pleasure of having afternoon tea today and again I felt so at home in the Merrion everything was superb and Michael's service in front of the fire was spectacular, a little hiccup with the bill when I said the Afternoon tea was prepaid I was told it wasn't, rather than the waitress saying I'll check, after a quick discussion the matter was resolved adequately.
My engagement anniversary is coming up and of course I chose the Merrion, I can't wait until February to be back there, the reservation staff were so helpful in ensuring I got the same room as before which had such sentimental value to my partner.
I hope to stay in the Merrion three times next year and I know all will be as exceptional as my first!",5,2014,01,01
200,The Merrion has a nice homely gesture for such a grand  five star hotel. It deserves its No 1 Hotel in Dublin rating,"Thank you to the lovely Merrion Hotel for their kindness to my teenage niece Maeve. As art lovers, we had treated ourselves to coffee there. This was to take the chance to view the Merrion’s hugely impressive 19th and 20th Century Irish art collection. On hearing it was my niece’s 16th birthday, the pleasant manageress treated her to a free hot chocolate. She was chuffed with this.  It was a nice homely gesture for such a grand  five star hotel. For its combination of warmth and style, I feel it deserves its No 1 Hotel in Dublin rating",5,2013,12,27
200,Comfortable Luxury for a Nice Price,"We would not have chosen the Merrion except for a winter deal offered on their website.  We have stayed in 4-star hotels, but for this trip we were traveling lighter.  Our room was very comfortable with plenty of space to relax and get through our jet lag.  Our room overlooked an alley - but we weren't in our room much during the short days of winter.  The free wifi was unexpected.  We had an overpriced breakfast that we didn't repeat during our 4 night stay.  We had a nice dinner followed by drinks in the bar on our last night - this experience was a much better value.  The staff couldn't have been nicer, the location was fantastic and we had no street noise.  I only made it to the gym once, but the facilities were more than adequate.  We would return - knowing that we would have a reliable experience without the gotchas normally associated with luxury hotels.",4,2013,12,26
200,Loved our stay at the  Merrion Hotel,"We had a delightful 5 night stay at the Merrion this December. It is expensive for a vacation but we felt the location, ambiance and outstanding service was worth the cost.  Prior to our trip, we had a number of email communications with the concierge team who were very helpful in making restaurant and tour reservations for us in advance.  During our stay, we continued to rely on the staff for additional recommendations for activities and restaurant choices and their advice and help was outstanding. They clearly made us feel like our trip was their top priority and we never felt like we were competing with other guests for their attention.

I also have to mention that our dinner in the Cellar and afternoon tea in our room was delicious and again featured great service.  In fact, every single person we dealt with from housekeeping to bellboys to desk staff was friendly, caring and professional.

We walked everywhere on our trip to Dublin and found this hotel was well situated for walking excursions. 

Overall, we recognize that the Merrion is by no means a budget conscious choice for a hotel but we felt the experience was well worth the price and we would stay there again without any hesitation.",5,2013,12,18
200,"Wonderful Staff, the perfect place in Dublin","I stayed at The Merrion for 4 nights in November and had a wonderful time.
All member of staff were very attentive and friendly, especially Sarah from room service who took such great care of me! When she heard on the phone I had a cold: she brought me some cloves and honey, a delightful person!
As I was alone on business I used room service a lot, food was excellent and delivered in a very timely manner.
Had dinner at the bar once also which was perfect.
Our meeting rooms was very cosy and our breaks were just delightful.
I really hope that my company will send me again to the Merrion. 
And also a wonderful location and very knowledgeable Concierge and super friendly bell boys!
Thank you!!",5,2013,12,16
200,Fantastic Hotel,My husband and I stayed for two nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel was wonderful with warm friendly staff which made our weekend very special. The NO23 bar is excellent with a extensive choice of drinks. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and eating out. ,5,2013,12,16
200,Not worth the reputation.,"Having read all the reviews I was expecting something special along the lines of Dromolond or the Cliff House etc.
To summarise it is just a standard hotel with alot if pomp.
Rooms are very plain, disappointingly so.
Hotel staff are good.
Bar staff are not, to the point of being rude and incompetent.

In summary it is in no way a special destination and I could only recommend it as a typical over night hotel from my experience.",3,2013,12,15
200,Classy and comfortable - a real gem,"Really enjoyed my short stay at the Merrion. The hotel is classy and comfortable and is well located.  The hotel is very clean and quiet and seems a popular spot for morning or tea-time business meetings.  The staff was very courteous and professional.  My room was really clean, quiet and comfortable and the hotel gardens are beautiful.  It caters to the business traveler and somewhat of an older clientele. Everything about my stay was top notch and I will try to stay here again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2013,12,13
200,The Merrion  - superb Dublin hotel,"I just had my 3rd stayed at this fantastic hotel during the last years. It is a "" must ""to stay there if you have tried it once. Superb service, always smiling staff, nice rooms, great morning swimming in the pool and enjoyable and luxurious treatments in the spa. And of course the Afternoon Tea in front of the open fire. This time we had not booked before arrival and could not get a table during our 3 days stay. It was because Christmas coming up. So remember to book your Afternoon tea, a "" must "" as well. Looking forward to the next stay at The Merrion Hotel, we will be back!",5,2013,12,09
200,Fabulous experience,"I had a fabulous 2 day break at the Merrion Hotel recently, a birthday present courtesy of my children, where the experience was truly wonderful. The Merrion is richly deserving of its 5 star status. The rooms are very comfortable, the surroundings luxurious without being stuffy and the staff are second to none. From the moment the doorman greets you by asking your name and assisting with check-in you are a pampered guest. What I like most is the outstanding service from each and every person you encounter during your stay. Service is delivered with exceptional efficiency yet in such a friendly manner and without the fawning attitude that often prevails in high end hotels. The attention to detail is what makes this such a wonderful hotel. The afternoon tea is an experience not to be missed and as for the Tethra Spa!! What can I say. I had the Balinese massage which was absolutely fabulous. Laura, my masseur, was professional, friendly and made the experience truly relaxing. Although I live in Dublin The Merrion is my number one choice for a short break. I first stayed there about 5 years ago and take great pleasure in returning as often as I can.",5,2013,12,05
200,best in Dublin,I booked two rooms for my in laws and myself and my wife. I did this through expedia  but would not do so again as it is better to go through the hotel itself . We didn't  like the rooms allocated as I had thought we would have a garden view and not one facing a wall. I agreed to stay one night here and the second night they upgraded us. The best part of this hotel is their staff as they are very  helpful very friendly.  Don't bother with other hotels in Dublin and try this one as we shall be back.,5,2013,12,03
200,First class,"Greeted by member of staff when parked up, bags and car keys taken- no hassle. Efficient check in and then escorted to room by a delightful member of staff. Beautiful gardens, gorgeous corridors and rooms. Had a drink in the bar and at one point I counted 11 members of staff in the bar area at one time. This is an older 5 star in complete contrast to the Marker which I stayed in on the same trip. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2013,12,02
200,A grand duchess of a hotel,Another wonderful stay at the Merrion - from arriving in the taxi to the doorman asking your name (which is then used constantly by every staff member you come into contact with) the hotel just confirms you are in a quality establishment.  From the beautiful and luxurious surroundings of common rooms to the wonderfully comfortable and stylish bedrooms the place is simply stunning.  Food (both room service and in the Cellar Restaurant) is excellent and nothing seems to much trouble to make your stay memorable.  It really is now the only place that I would wish to stay in Dublin!  Although we have only stayed once previously it really felt like coming home.  Truly excellent!,5,2013,11,30
200,Exquisite Hotel in the Best Part of Dublin,"I stayed at the Merrion on business when traveling to Dublin in July and every aspect of this hotel is magnificent.  I arrived WAY before check-in time (like 7 am) after an all-night flight in hopes of exploring the hotel and spa while I waited for my room.  The team at the Merrion made me comfortable while I waited and did get me into a room by noon.  While I waited, I had time for several espresso's in the drawing room, a tour of the hotel, lounging in the spa, swimming in the pool, and a short walk around the financial district.  

The rooms are beautifully appointed, and have everything you would need while away.  The marble bathrooms are absolutely beautiful and I loved having a full tub and scale.  The decor seems to be unique to each room, as I stayed in two different rooms on each end of the week long trip.  

The concierge was spot on in his recommendations of restaurants, so do ask if you need assistance with finding excellent food.  Also, the breakfast is wonderful, so get up early and make time for it!",5,2013,11,29
200,Luxury executed,"On our second of three nights at the Merrion. My wife and I love it. Went to dinner at Patrick Guildaud (awesome in its own right) at 9:00 and turn down service still came; returned from dinner with a full ice box and water slippers, etc all set.  Great location in upscale area with plenty of bars and shopping nearby. Highly recommend. ",5,2013,11,29
200,Top class elegant establishment,"My Wife , 6month old daughter and myself stayed at the Merrion  Hotel  recently and received the most hospitable of welcomes. Everything was taken care of with great efficiency and decorum upon arrival and the amenities and the room were very impressive and sumptuous. The icing on the cake was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. All in all, a most enjoyable experience and wish to bring my family again. Top class hotel  with hard working, friendly  and very hospitable staff attending to any request with style and competence. Brilliant stay. I cant praise it enough. Look forward to staying again.",5,2013,11,29
200,Elegant in Dublin,"Very elegant hotel - it's easy to miss if you're driving past/ unfamiliar with the area. The location is excellent, with the National Gallery (lovely!) and National Museum within a 10 minute walk. Trinity College on one side (do see the Book of Kells through a guided tour by a young student and visit the Buttery Cafe after, for a quick cup of tea and a bite), and the swish Grafton Street area are also within a 10-minute walk each.

Absolutely top-notch staff - Daniel on the Concierge desk and Mhairi at Reception are of particular note. Our room faced the beautiful garden, and was very comfortable. The staff is happy to advise you on travel, day-trips etc and will make all the arrangements. We were pointed towards excellent running trails, with maps to navigate the neighbourhood.

The Merrion has a notable art collection in case you don't have time for the National Gallery; two paintings by Jack B. Yeats (brother of W.B.) greet you in the foyer as soon as you enter the hotel. An enormous basket filled with logs sits just by to feed the fire which is indeed a welcome sight when you step in out of the cold. There are log fires in the very elegant drawing rooms too which obviously people could not resist while we were there. Personally, I loved the charcoal braziers outside next to the gardens where you could sit with a drink. Or two.

Didn't care for the breakfast, though it could be that I got there within 10 minutes of closing time. Which might explain the cheerful note from the manager advising patrons to enjoy an early breakfast the following day ! Staff at the Spa were helpful and that's what earns this hotel top marks from me: stellar staff.",4,2013,11,29
200,One of the Best,"We first started staying at The Merrion shortly after it opened and it remains out favourite hotel to visit when we want comfort, service, relaxation and class.  Just superb in every way.  Fab location, peaceful, almost hidden but right in the heart of Dublin.  The staff are excellent, and indeed there are even a few left who remember us from the early days!  In some ways, I loath writing a great review in order to keep the place a hidden secret, but then they deserve all the best!",5,2013,11,27
200,The only choice for staying in the Irish capital.,"I am usually not a big fan of independent smaller hotels but must say The Merrion hits all the right notes.

Location wise you could not ask for better when in Dublin in a word ""Unbeatable"" situated right across from the grand and stately Parliament building with Merrion Square (great running paths), National Gallery, National Museum, Trinity college and the Grafton Street shopping district all within a few minutes’ walk from the hotel.

Stayed in a Junior suite in the main house and it was exquisitely furnished and appointed opulent being the only adjective to truly describe the overall feel and flow with the highlight being the sumptuous bathroom with separate bath and shower and all the extras, cosy bathrobes and bespoke Irish toiletries.

The public areas with log fires wonderful Irish fabrics and antiques and French windows offering nice views and access to the gardens are wonderful. With the most impressive aspect being the hotels private collection of exquisite art on site. Creating the atmosphere as if you are staying in one of Europe's great art galleries fitted to serve as a hotel.

The service, is exactly as one would expect, attentive and top-notch quiet and unobtrusive throughout the hotel from the excellent concierge in the lobby to turn-down service in the suites.

In hotel dining options match the standards of the hotel I ate at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud (see my separate review), the only 2 starred Michelin restaurant in Ireland is on site. Breakfast is especially noteworthy with freshly baked goods, to superior buffet items to tempting breakfast items cooked to order.

To sum it up The Merrion is classy, elegant, and should be the accommodation of choice for any traveler when staying in the Irish capital.

I know it will be mine in all my future trips to Dublin.",5,2013,11,27
200,Alsolutely perfect,"Business trips to Dublin have taken me to some pretty grim places. I finally decided to bite the bullet and book the Merrion. Booked a standard garden room street facing and could not have been happier. From the moment the taxi door was opened, to the point three days later when my departing taxi door was shut my experience was fantastic. There is complete consistency of staff, from reception, bar and waiting staff, to room service and those you pass in the corridors, they are all a delight. I loved the art collection....in fact whats not to love....bite the bullet and pay the extra euros to stay here, you will not regret it. Have no idea what those who reviewed poorly were on???  Thank you all, I will certainly be back. Would have been full points only the shower wall and grouting in particular could have done with closer attention.",5,2013,11,25
200,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion, simply the best.

Staff , friendly and well trained.

A hotel of real class and elegance combined with old school charm, and character. 
Bedrooms are beautifully appointed , with a breakfast worth getting up early for. 
Stay at this hotel, it will not disappoint.",5,2013,11,24
200,Great hotel,"We were at the Merrion at the end of August this year. It had everything a hotel should have -- friendly people, great service, beautiful inside and out, and a great location. The interior was very nicely decorated, both in the rooms and the public areas. They have a wonderland breakfast in their Cellar restaurant. 

No review of this hotel would be complete without mentioning the Art Tea. They have a beautiful tea service in the afternoon with sweet and savory items, all wonderful. Then for dessert (who knew there was dessert after tea?) they bring out three magnificent pastries. Each pastry is inspired by a piece of art in the hotel. It was amazing. 

We had booked a regular room. We were upgraded to an amazing suite with a master bath. The suite had a very comfortable living room and a half bath. And there was a small for my son (15) to sleep on a rollaway bed.

Traveled with friends AND family. The site won't let me pick more than one category below.",5,2013,11,22
200,Wow what a great hotel,"We've been all over the world, and have to say this place has it all! From its central location to the friendliest nicest staff we ever experienced, this place cannot be beat. They deserve each of their five stars, and we'll def stay there any time we are in Dublin.
The rooms are lovely, large, and super quiet (a big bonus, considering you're right in the midst of everything). The breakfast was astonishingly great. And the entire staff deserves a ""niceness"" award...there wasn't a thing they wouldn't do for their guests (and they often went above-and-beyond). You just can't go wrong here...so just go!",5,2013,11,15
200,Amazing Spa Treatment,"I recently got the most amazing spa treatment in Tethra Spa in the Merrion Hotel. It was the first time I've had a hot stones massage and I will most definitely be getting one again. I felt so relaxed and rejuvenated after the treatment. My therapist, Laura really tailored the massage to my needs and even spent time with me afterwards explaining the benefits of the hot stones and giving me tips and advice on my skin routine, various products, etc. I couldn't recommend this spa highly enough! ",5,2013,11,13
200,Wonderful ambience,"We only stayed for one night but the hotel has a wonderful ambience with extremely professional and helpful staff. 

While it is pricey I still think it offers good value for money compared to other hotels I have stayed in.",5,2013,11,13
200,Impressed by the 'Cellar Bar',"Haven't stayed here for several years - nothing to do with quality - more to do with price! However were invited to the 'Cellar' for dinner by friends visiting the city and was most impressed. The food was very much above average and atmosphere not at all stuffy. Plenty of fish and chips with fine wine was the order of the day! What not to love? The waitress was extremely impressive in her memory of given orders with English obviously not her first language. Quite a feat!
All in all would love to return!",5,2013,11,12
200,Great night,"Stayed on Saturday and had a wonderful night, the room was fantastic and all the staff were wonderful and most welcoming. After check-in we headed for a drink in the Cellar Bar had the skinny soup a bit late for me but it was lovely, we then want back to our Suite to get ready for the evening. Had a lovely meal in the Cellar Restaurant, the staff were very friendly and attentive. We finished the night with a drink in the drawing rooms lovely and cozy especially with the fire being lighting.",5,2013,11,11
200,"Great location, but expensive!","The location cannot be bettered, just beside the House of Parliament. The staff are very professional, but a little clinical and cold. They are mostly Eastern European, and hard-working. The bar menu is superb, from club sandwiches to soup. The ambience is low-key and well-off, people meeting for afternoon tea after shopping. The fairly pretentious French restaurant Guilbaud is next-door. There are numerous other restaurants in the area. Rooms are quite nice, standard fare. The garden outside is nice for a short walk.",4,2013,11,10
200,Excellent staff,"There are so many different and special areas at the Merrion. Beautiful drawing rooms for relaxing with tea and coffee, the Room 23 bar for elegant cocktails, the Cellar bar for a more casual time with draught beer and snacks.  Breakfast downstairs is tremendous - the porridge was just right.  Our room - a junior suite was everything we could have hoped for and the entire staff was wonderful.  The sunshine even cooperated.  This was a total five star experience.",5,2013,11,07
200,Opulent excellence with Irish charm,"The grand finale of my first visit to Ireland was two nights in the Merrion and what a great experience.  I suspect the Iron Duke would be taken aback at the luxury of his birthplace but for us modern folks our higher expectations are met here in full.  The staff really seem to care and are both charming and efficient and since you can visit one of the great restaurants of Dublin without getting your feet wet, why woudl anyone ever want to leave.  The style of the older buildings has been retained with deft and gentle modern additions.  One of the great hotel experiences of teh world.",5,2013,11,07
200,outstanding.. pure luxury,"We went to the Merrion for our 20th wedding anniversary. Our plane from England, unfortunately, was delayed both ways. Caroline , the front desk manager was outsatnding. When she realised how much of our weekend we had missed with flight delays, she upgraded us to a beautiful suite. On our  return journey, we were so worried whether our plane would even take off, due to the storms in England. Caroline allowed us to stay in our room for a late check out at no extra cost. The staff , especially Caroline, at the Merrion made the weekend so special for us. The food in the Cellar restuarant was out of this world. We cannot recommend this hotel enough, it is pure luxury. I felt like I was living at Downton Abbey.",5,2013,11,04
200,Excellence isn't an accident,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at the Merrion. From the minute you drive up to their door, someone is there to make sure you have a great experience. The valet gentlemen are first class, front desk is incredibly helpful and they've really embodied the standard of personal  service. The rooms are very large and we were treated to a beautiful fruit plate upon arrival. 

Their level of personal service is no where more evident than the nightly complimentary shoe shine. After slogging through the rain and muck of our sightseeing jaunts, it was such a welcome treat to wake up to clean, shined and polished boots for the next day! 

Our only suggestion for the hotel would be a better map or directions for guests unfamiliar with Dublin. The hotel doesn't list a street number/address just the street name and we had some trouble finding the property. They don't have a huge marquee or signage, so the hotel is easily missed along the busy street. Check the map in advance so you know approximately where you are headed and that will help.",5,2013,11,02
200,Elegance in Dublin,"I have no idea what it takes to create and sustain a world class hotel, but the Merrion Hotel in Dublin is doing it perfectly. Staying at the Merrion is more than just luxury, it is an experience, a sensory opportunity to allow yourself the treat for being taken care of by people who truly care about your well being. The staff is helpful, knowledgeable and top hospitality professionals. The rooms are warm, cozy and simply appointed. The beds are comfortable, and the entire hotel is a soft edge in hard world. There is an art to luxury hospitality, and the Merrion Hotel is the master.",5,2013,10,31
200,Comfort in Dublin,"We have recently returned from Ireland and stayed 3 nights at the Merrion. We thought the location was excellent, in a safe area with pubs and restaurants and walking distance from Grafton street and Temple Bar. The rooms are large with traditional furnishings. A bit warn but with very nice linens comfortable beds and large marble bathrooms.The salons in the hotel were beautifully appointed and the fireplaces were great in the afternoon or evening with drink and small plate service available. We did not eat in the restaurant or have breakfast as we thought the 29 Euro  PP charge for breakfast was over the top. I would stay there again but they should rethink their breakfast pricing.",4,2013,10,30
200,Always wonderful,"Words cannot do justice as to how pleasant it is to stay in the Merrion, we never stay anywhere else when we overnight in town. it is great to have an excuse of a celebration to stay there. Our daughter's wedding was held there in 2008 and it was so nice. The location is great, the staff are so professional and welcoming.",5,2013,10,30
200,Leave real life at the front door,"Our stay at the Merrion was absolutely wonderful, there is a reason why the Merrion is the number 1 hotel in Dublin!
It is the building, the facilities, the food but most of all its their staff!  They treat everyone with respect and such warmth, they are so impeccably turned out and professional. An example was Sarah Jane (lovely chatty girl from room service)
We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite in the main house, the decor of the room is like something from Downtown Abbey absolute Georgian Dublin opulence. 
A bottle of champagne was delivered to our room as we were celebrating our engagement and the meal in the Cellar Restaurant was delicious, Dermot there was a fantastic host and helped us choose the best wine to go with our meal!
I was really impressed with my Darphin facial with Irene  and my fiance enjoyed the pool area
The breakfast was yummy, we went for the french toast brioche with berries and it was divine! 

Thanks to the Merrion for making our night away so wonderful!",5,2013,10,29
200,"If you want to be spoiled, come to The Merrion","Everything about the Merrion was fantastic.  From the doorman welcoming us, to the desk staff, to the champagne in our room and restaurant recommendations, everything was top notch.  The rooms are lovely, with nothing forgotten, the breakfast was delicious, and the staff was always helpful but never invasive.  We loved it and highly recommend a stay here!!",5,2013,10,26
200,Utterly Amazing!,"Our stay at the Merrion was splendid! The hotel is even more beautiful in person than through the pictures posted on their website.
The staff are so personable, professional and impeccably trained it nearly defies categorization.
The Drawing Room is a marvelous place to have tea and enjoy the warm fireplace while relaxing.
The gardens are so beautiful and well maintained.
The rooms are beautifully appointed and the housekeeping staff keep them immaculate.
We had a problem with the power converter we brought with us but the amazing maintenance man helped us out far exceeding anyone's expectations.
The concierges are everything you could hope for in terms of assistance and friendliness.
We were impressed with every single individual we encountered during our four night stay. 
Thank you Merrion staff & management! Your reputation as a world leader in luxury accommodations is well deserved! 
",5,2013,10,25
200,Top notch service and relaxation,"We went for a 1 night stay to the Merrion hotel in October and had the most fantastic time. This was our third time at the hotel and the service was absolutely outstanding. We arrived very early morning and the room was ready for us the check in. The reception staff dealt with our check in quickly and efficiently and also showed us to our room. We had a room in the main house and the decor and facilities were outstanding. We utilised the pool and gym facilities in the hotel which were very quiet and more than adequate. Again the service from the staff was outstanding and the toiletries, towels and changing facilities superb. We had cocktails in the hotel bar prior to dinner which were outstanding. The concierge was helpful and recommended and booked a local restaurant for us, which was superb. As for the breakfast the next day, we could not have asked for anything else. Thanks to all at the Merrion and Caroline the head reception desk who couldn't have done more. We will definitely return!!",5,2013,10,25
200,A Gem in Dublin,"I stayed in this hotel for several nights this past September and it met every expectation from the minute we got out of our rental car and were met by a very nice gentleman, dressed elegantly, who arranged to take our bags and we entered paradise. The hotel is stately and one feels a bit like royalty when one stays here. There was a parlor with a fire blazing and there is tea service for guests where one can enjoy some food by the fire in lovely surroundings. The hotel is immaculate and the rooms are well-sized and comfortable. The guests have the use of a robe and slippers and I enjoyed making a hot cup of tea in the comfort of my lovely room. I ordered The Irish Times which I found attached to my door in a lovely black bag. The location is excellent and the staff is unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful - particularly the concierge. 

We also stayed at The Shelbourne for two nights, which was extremely nice - but there is a lot more hubbub there - the lobby is filled with comings and goings and there is much activity at this famous hotel. I actually preferred the quiet of The Merrion as I appreciated the peacefulness and tranquility. I would not hesitate to stay at The Merrion when I am in Dublin again.",5,2013,10,25
200,Now thats 5 star!,"I have stayed at this hotel before (January 2010 & January 2012) and since visited the bars here many times and I have to say its nice to see warm Irish hospitality is alive and well, the staff here are for sure ""hospitality professionals"" with specific refference to The Cellar bar and restaurant, Tom and his team in the bar always offer a genuine welcome and the price is surprisinly favourable for a 5 star hotel in city centre Dublin! A must try!",5,2013,10,25
200,Probably the best in Dublin,"Stayed for one night recently on a special occassion trip to Dublin. We had been given a voucher which we had used to upgrade to a nicer room and the hotel upgraded us again to a nice suite. I would definitely recommend paying the extra to stay in the older part of the hotel as the rooms have lovely vaulted ceilings and nicer furniture and much more character than the garden wing. Its more of a country house feel - the bathrooms may seem a little dated but I feel like they are in keeping with the oldly manor house style.
Concierge and reception are top class - The bar is a little stuffy and I dont like that you cant have a drink at the bar - you have to take a seat and they take your order. The day rooms are nice - perfect for lazy afternoon tea and rading the paper. Also the art collection throughout the hotel is fantastic - my personal favourite ""The Gombeen Men"" by John Boyd
Breakfast is a trek through the hotel and then a lift to the cellar bar area - so I'd recommend ordering breakfast in Bed. We didnt use the pool / spa area but it did look most attractive.",4,2013,10,24
200,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend, the hotel is beautiful friendly staff.  We booked lunch in the cellar restaurant and dinner in Patrick Guilbaud restaurant.  Cellar restaurant nice atmosphere but average food.  The Patrick Guilbaud restaurant was like theatre ! the service amazing!  Food was a bit rich for us as we had the tasting menu.  But well worth the theatre for an experience.",5,2013,10,22
200,Dinner at the Merrion Hotel,We had dinner at the Merrion Hotel on the 13th of September.It was my husbands 40th reunion and the class dinner was held at the Merrion. The food was great in a lovely setting.The staff were very friendly and welcoming.It was a very pleasant evening.,5,2013,10,20
200,A Polished Gem Glittering with Service,"This is our first time in Dublin and we sadly had to check out today after only two nights at this elegant, charming hotel.  From the first warm hellos from the doormen to the attentive service at the included breakfast, the knowledgeable  concierge's assistance at booking restaurants, providing adaptors and directions and finally the doormen's jokes and well wishes as we departed, the staff was exceptionally trained, gracious and caring.

Our room was spacious and comfortable.  The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of many attractions, shops and restaurants.  It is well worth the price paid.

We'll be back for a longer stay.",5,2013,10,20
200,Probably the best,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The rooms are nice, clean and spacious. The lounge is great place to relax. I really wish the pillows were a little smaller.",5,2013,10,19
200,A merry stay at the Merrion Hotel,"We just finished a 5 night stay at the Merrion.  The Merrion was recommended by an Irish friend.  We could not have been happier with the warmth of the staff there, the elegance of the hotel and the unbeatable location.  It's not often that a hotel can be both welcoming and world class but that is how it is there.  You are somehow made to feel that you are home while surrounded by art and surroundings dating back centuries. The room was pristine and lovely.  I must say I did have to venture out to other sources for my coffee fixes as the Merrion coffee was not up to my picky standards but they even help direct me to where I could find a wonderful Cafe Americano around the corner.  I",5,2013,10,17
200,You get what you pay for - excellence,"A great stay from start to finish, a warm and efficient welcome from the check in staff, a very nice room and I used the gym and pool where the staff were equally helpful. The public rooms are a delight and do take a moment to look at the gardens.",5,2013,10,17
200,Excellent stay!,"Stayed recently on a Saturday night with my wife. Everything was perfect from our arrival until our departure, I really did not want to leave. Open fires, relaxing spaces to have afternoon tea or read the papers, swimming pool and gym this hotel has it all.
Breakfast was excellent and the staff were brillant throughout our stay.
I cannot wait to go back!",5,2013,10,16
200,Just outstanding,"Such an wonderful place. We stayed overnight and ate in Patrick Guilbaud's to celebrate a special occasion. Our room was very comfortable and quiet, overlooking the garden. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. Truly deserving of its 5 star status. What an amazing experience also in Patrick Guilbaud's -- stunning food and service.  If you want a really special stay in Dublin, stay here!",5,2013,10,16
200,Lovely,"Merrion is so lovely. The gardens, the room, the cellar cafe and the staff were all wonderful. We stayed in a renovated room on the first floor. The cocktails and the potted salmon were wonderful from the Cellar. The Full Irish breakfast was fantastic. Everyone must try the Irish yogurt-especially the Lemon Curd. I am going to have to find it in the US, I hope. One caveat-I did feel under-dressed while walking through the living room. So bring your A game, not your trying to pack everything in one carry one suitcase game!! The location was great, it was a quick cab drive to most of the downtown locales.",5,2013,10,15
200,soooooooooooo nice,"another very positive stay at the merrion.
I know there are other 5 star hotels in Dublin, but we just love it here.
Its consistant, the staff remember you,  the location is great, and I love the fact, that once you step inside, you forget you are in a city.
We had brunch on Sunday in the cellar bar and it was really lovely.
crispy bacon to die for......
Looking forward to our next visit in December.",5,2013,10,15
200,One of the Best,"One of the finest properties I've ever stayed in anywhere.  The accommodations were wonderful, the service outstanding, the grounds and gardens delightful and the location is perfect.  Great food, great ambience and the staff could not do enough for you.  They were friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and quick to respond to your every need.

Our stay was outstanding in every possible way.

We will use The Merrion as a centerpiece for a return trip to Ireland in the next few years .",5,2013,10,14
200,Outstanding!,"We were there the first week in October, 2013. The care and attention from the staff here is extraordinary in every way. Excellent location, and Ireland's only two-star restaurant is on premises. Try it!",5,2013,10,14
200,Merrion,"We stayed at the Merrion in Sept.   On arrival in Dublin for 2 nights and at departure from Dublin for two nights.    It's a very nice hotel and it's a good location where you can walk to shopping etc...   There is also a hop on hop off bus stop right near the hotel.   I would not qualify the hotel as a 5 star but would put it in the category of clean, well sized rooms and very good service.    I would stay there again.",4,2013,10,14
200,Beautiful hotel with a great garden,"I stayed at the Merrion a couple of weeks ago as it was the hotel my group decided to book.

The location is quite central. It is an old fashioned 5 star where you will be well taken care of.

The staff is very friendly and very attentive to service.

Beds are comfortable and the room I stayed in was huge.

I had a view onto the Beautiful garden which I was unable to visit as it rained the entire time I was there.

A small criticism on the breakfast. It was not worth the €29 I paid. Despite having so many staff, I struggled to get a glass of orange juice (I had to ask 3 times).",4,2013,10,13
200,Georgian Elegance and Grace,"We booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were not ill advised. We spent five wonderful nights here and everything was top notch. Our room was serviced early and this was ideal for a short afternoon rest each day before heading out again. Every member of the staff is courteous and helpful and gracious. We had afternoon tea on Friday; they call it Art Tea. It was a highlight of the trip. The pastry chef is a master at creating teacakes inspired by paintings hung around the hotel. A unique and delicious experience. We stayed in the garden section of the hotel and each morning and evening walked past and though a lovely, sculpture filled garden. Our room was large, lovely, and quiet. Elegant drawing rooms burning logs and peat welcomed us each day as we entered the hotel.",5,2013,10,13
200,"Wonderful hotel, worth going back to except for the restaurant.","Nice rooms. Efficient and very comfortable, with everything you need. Good  service. Friendly and helpful. Interesting architecture. Terrible service in their restaurant, but otherwise very nice. Just don't eat in the Cellar.",4,2013,10,12
200,Amazing Hotel in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our anniversarry trip to Ireland. The Merrion was so lovely! Rooms and facilities were as described on their website, but it was all the small details that made this place amazing. Nicest room I've ever had in Europe,  with a wonderful bathroom with shower and a tub. We had one breakfast at the hotel restaurant and some drinks at the Cellar Bar - both were great. 
Right after we checked in,the hotel sent up a tasty chocolate mousse as an anniversarry treat - yum!",5,2013,10,12
200,Ireland Holiday,"We chose the Merrion as it was the number 1 rated Hotel in Dudlin, it was our first stop over for our six week holiday so we  were looking forward to getting  over our Jet Lag before we started our 
Ireland bus tour. Upon check in we were told that they had upgraded us to one if the suites in the main house  junior suite we thought ok this is nice once we get into the hallways the young receptionist tells us that they have just painted the hallways however the paint smell should not affect us in our room I did not give it another thought when we first went into the room as we were both quite tired after just having flown 30 hours to get there when the porter came with our luggage 
The smell was very strong in the room we rang reception and asked to be moved that dis happen and we moved to a garden room 1st floor small but nice. We did go back at the end of our bus trip and stayed in the main house Merrion suite beautiful great end to our Ireland holiday 
Did not want to leave",5,2013,10,11
200,Little Gem,"In Dublin, travelling as a couple enroute to a family wedding (held round the corner at the Shelborne). Just the ticket as far as we were concerned. If you want flash/bling, this is not the place. Just about everything exudes understatement, which in no way detracts from the efficient & helpful front desk, spotless room (we had an inside one, overlooking the gardens), bright public rooms, very adequate breakfast area & well sited/lit indoor pool.

If we had to nit pick - The room towels/robe were more budget quality than is necessary. Service at Breakfast was variable.

Overall :  Not cheap but worth the splurge. Assuming the money is there, The Merrion will be my Dublin residence for future visits.",4,2013,10,10
200,Beautiful stay at an amazing hotel,"My boyfriend had booked a night for us in the merrion for a birthday treat. From start to finish it was amazing! The staff were so friendly, the food was fab and the room gorgeous! Cannot recommend this hotel enough and encourage anyone wanting to stay in luxury to stay here.",5,2013,10,09
200,A wonderful oasis in Dublin,"My wife and I spent two nights here as part of a six day tour through Ireland. We came away rating our experience as a ""top twenty"" urban hotels in the world"" based on our travels of fourty years. Don't let the plain façade fool you; much awaits you inside. A classically decorated hotel with warm and friendly service, outstanding food, several dining choices and a terrific restaurant in the stone vaulted basement floor. Outside service in a couple of spots in the inner, private garden and reflecting pool is a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. The Merrion is ideally located central to many sites; Guiness Brewery, Jamieson's Distillery, Christ Church, and many others. You cant lose betting on this property.",5,2013,10,08
200,Peace and quiet with beautiful art,"What a great location in Dublin. Close to everything but very peaceful. Beautiful drawing rooms to relax, admire the art, have afternoon tea, snack or cocktail. Lovely rooms with understated elegant decor. Staff was helpful when needed and very friendly. Breakfast in The Cellar restarant was very good. Nice buffet, really no need to order a full breakfast unless that is your thing. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Dublin. ",5,2013,10,08
200,Everything and everyone wonderful,"From the moment we arrived everything was wonderful.  Staff and particularily concierge service was great. Clare was very helpful with show tickets and dinner recommendations. Visited twice while in Ireland, great location.  If we return to Dublin will definitely stay there again.  The swimming pool and steam bath were a welcome change from most other hotels in Ireland.  High tea was wonderful.",5,2013,10,08
200,Nothing left to chance at the Merrion,"This highly rated hotel operates a somewhat awkward physical layout with seemingly effortless attention to detail.  As a solo female traveler, I appreciated the individual attention provided by the staff.  From the welcome and offer of an umbrella by the doorman each time I arrived or departed to the helpful suggestions of the breakfast waiter and the prompt summons of an early morning taxi (a BMW, no less) by the front desk staff.  

Consider the Art Tea with champagne for a whimsical take on an enjoyable tradition.

A redesign and expansion of the property is planned.  However, the one thing that can't be improved upon is the central location which provides easy walks to the museums and city center shopping, food and drink.",5,2013,10,07
200,Extraordinarily pleasant experience!,"I found myself in the city centre on one of our wonderfully painfully rainy evenings last week.  Having made loose venue arrangements with a friend, I decided rather than venture any further in a downpour I ducked into the Cellar Bar in the Merrion where I had never found myself before.  Not because I hadn't wanted to, more that it never occured to me.  

I was more than pleasantly suprised that in contrast to the rest of the hotel ( which i do love but not for a glass of wine on a rainy tuesday!) the bar was warm and cosy with a really nice humm of happy punters.  And no wonder.  I was greated like a long lost friend by staff members, dispensing with any idea of austere service in a 5 star establishment.

As i was on my own waiting for my friend, I got chatting to the manager  ( Damien if memory serves me!) whilst he was recommending a glass of something nice.  Is there anything this man doesn't know about wine! I settled on a glass of Ruinart , and the rest of the bottle went down very well with the Seafood ""Tower"" we ended up ordering.  We had no intention of staying for more than one drink , but we stayed and ate there too!

When we were about to leave, the barman ( Mark?) insisted we stay put whilst we organised a taxi to the door so we wouldn't be caught in the deluge.

Maybe I shouldn't be surprised at the really high level of service we experienced.  Without being in your face, we were looked after seemlessly and warmly.  

The divil is in the detail, and these guys have got it right. the right amount of care and all the little extras without being showy.

The ultimate showcase of the Cead Mile Failte!",5,2013,10,07
200,Outstanding stay in a perfect hotel,"You know that you have arrived in the right place if the face that greets you smiles, asks you how your travel was en escorts you to your room. The lounges next to the reception have an at home feeling with multiple burning fire stoves and plush upholstery. On the walls there is an impressive collection of Irish art, as a matter of fact the largest in private hands. The rooms are large and so are the bathrooms and immaculate. Service is to the tee and whatever you want you will get. I happened to arrive at 10.30 pm and the reception immediately realized that I must have been hungry and offered a lovely sandwich service as soon as I got settled in. next to all this there is a lovely garden, and wonderful pool, sauna and spa. The beds were great as were the pillows and the food very good. The best thing however is the people working there, always friendly, helpful and in for a chat. I would definitely come back here. Tip: if you have a late departure (> 5 pm), reserve an art tea (their rendition of a high tea). It is truly lovely, and the teas, and small bites are to die for. On Saturday and Sunday it can be busy so be sure you reserve a seat. It comes with a beautiful set up and a book that explains all the art that you see when you wander the halls.",5,2013,10,06
200,Love this stylish hotel with its excellent staff,"We came here as a birthday treat for my husband.  When we arrived the concierge welcomed us by name - impressive!  Our comfortable room overlooked the delightful gardens at the back and was very quiet.  The luxury marble bathroom had both a shower and a bath. We chose communicating rooms for ourseves and our family - not all hotels have this facility.  The public rooms were beautifully furnished and the real fires added to their cosiness. Unusual  works of art adorn the walls of the hotel.   Excellent Irish breakfasts served in the Cellar Bar.  The staff were without exception excellent  and friendly - helping us sort out replacement tickets for an event we had pre-booked, or recommending places for traditional music, and booking us tickets for the open air bus tour.  My only regret is that we only had time to swim in the beautiful pool once.  It was heavenly. The hotel is a 20 minute walk from the centre which was absolutely fine and it was always a treat to return there at the end of the evening.  When I come back to Dublin I will always choose to stay here.",5,2013,10,05
200,Stunning Hotel and Superb staff,"We attended a function in Dublin and planned on staying at a different hotel which was booked out. I am so pleased that we ended up at such a beautiful hotel in more ways than one ! The hotel is very elegant the rooms the same, the atmosphere in the hotel (staff included) was second to none - this I do not say lightly.
I really would have loved to stay longer to enjoy the location and the experience :) Thank you to all the staff for a lovely stay.",5,2013,10,03
200,Best Hotel Ever,"This hotel waa definitely way better than i expected! Firstly when we arribed we were met by the concierge who carried our bags in and was so polite! We checked in at reception which was quick and the girl there explained all the facilities and amenties in the hotel. She walked us to our room in the garden wing which was great because we wouldnt
 have been able to find it!! She gave us the wi-fi code and left.! Straight away concierge had arrived with our bags! Yes our view was to a wall but it is dublin city! The garden was spectularbto walk through! Our tv had great channels. We even had a stereo beside us!! In the evening accomadation were in and had changed our room to an evening style, shut curtains, left ice, bed covers ready to sleep in! The bed was so comfy youd never leave it and the pillows were so soft! The best thing about the room was the air conditioning where you could be aa hot or as cold as you please! The hotel is great! It was hard to hear noise from outside which was great! Each day the accomadation staff were so pleasant and also the concierge! Especially John whom we talked to about Clare hammering cork! The merrion is close to museums,
Grafton st and shops!.  I would advise this to everyone!!",5,2013,10,01
200,Highly recommended in Dublin,"What a beautiful hotel in the Georgian quarter of Dublin! The hotel itself is a wonderful building, with a hidden gem of a courtyard garden behind the heritage facade. The staff provided outstanding service and the dining was remarkable. We were impressed enough with the Cellar restaurant, which has a very good menu, but the two Michelin star Patrick Guibault restaurant is a culinary experience elevated to the level of a fine art.",5,2013,09,29
200,Amazing,"Amazing hotel with so cute staff. Very comfortable beds, quiet rooms on the ground floor. The location is good, it's close to the marrion square, it's a beautiful and large park. The holiday was lovely here.",5,2013,09,29
200,Splendid hotel,"A beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff and superb food centrally located to the National Gallery and to Trinity College, for those who wish to see The Book of Kells. Also close to Merrion Square, a large park.
The hotel surrounds a garden and has several large lobbies filled with comfortable seating that overlook the garden. Many of the guest rooms overlook the garden also.
The rooms are  luxuriously furnished, and the beds very comfortable.
The Merrion is perfect, really, but the best part is the warm and extremely helpful staff: reception, concierge, housekeeping and the waitstaff in the dining areas. Everyone goes out of their way to cheerfully help you in any way they can.",5,2013,09,28
200,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband I are were extremely lucky to have stayed at the Merrion Hotel in July. We were warmly welcomed by everyone, starting with the doorman out front. The entire staff made our stay perfect. Everyone at the hotel wanted to make  sure we were as comfortable as possible. I cannot thank them enough. After a very long,overnight trip from California we were exhausted. Their kindness and concern were greatly appreciated. Our room was beautiful, on the ground floor, opening to the gorgeous courtyard in the center. In the middle of a huge city, our room  was so very quiet. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable.The breakfast downstairs was delicious, with lots of choices. The hotel's location is perfect.Walking distance to a lot of sights. We will be back! Thank you so much.",5,2013,09,28
200,A world away from the 21st century,"I have been lucky enough to have stayed at the Merrion many times since it opened over 10 years ago.  It is 4 Georgian houses made into one of the most elegant hotels in the world.  A discreet entrance with the doorman helping with everything into a spendid room with the reception desk.  All the rooms on the ground floor have peat fires ,  soft comfortable armchairs and sofa's and views onto the Georgian Garden.  Delightful in both Spring/Summer and Winter when you fall asleep after a great dinner in front of the fire probably with a glass or two in hand.
The rooms range from the suites - with separate sitting rooms, to cosy but good size.  Great bathrooms and Asprey toiletries which smell divine (I have since bought in London).  A great bar upstairs , or a more modern bistro bar down in the cellars and it has the Michelin starred restaurant attached - which is quite amazing on both food or service.  
A hotel you can escape the world in - or indulge in the local food steps away at some great restaurants less than a 10 minute stroll away.  It is about 20 mins walk to Grafton Street and if too far then call in the Shelbourne for refreshments !!!",5,2013,09,27
200,Outstanding Service,"I cant think of a hotel we have received better service. The staff is so welcoming and friendly, most importantly very genuine. The hotel is very well located but with poor signage so if you are driving for the first time you are likely to miss it. The room was great with all the amenities one may need. Breakfast was delicious with plenty of options. Concierge staff is very helpful. The biggest pluss of this hotel is the restaurant option for Patrick Guilbald famous two michelin star restaurant, a must try!",5,2013,09,25
200,A Classic Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is wonderful in every way.  The service is impeccable, the location perfect, rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the decor is incredible.  This hotel has a fabulous art collection.  I understand it is one of the largest private collections in Ireland.  They even tie in the art collection to afternoon tea (a must).  The gardens are beautiful, everything was perfect!!!",5,2013,09,25
200,Great Place to Stay,"We had a phenomenal experience here.  Room was very pleasant and large by European standards.  Modern bathroom.  Very attentive and pleasant staff.  the follow up wake up calls as a normal course of events was greatly appreciated by this jet lagged traveler.

We had breakfast at Cellar restaurant and dinner in the Cellar bar.  Both had very good food and very good service.  A bit pricey but this is a trade-off for the convenience factor.

This is one of those places I will fondly remember and hope that I will return in the future.",5,2013,09,25
200,Lovely Hotel,"Very friendly, helpful staff.
Lovely room, comfortable.
Good value delicious food in the Cellar restaurant
The best hotel pool that I have ever swum in.
We didn't use the spa facilities apart from the pool and steam room so no comments other than this.",5,2013,09,25
200,Beautiful Hotel with Outstanding Service,"What a special spot. Beautiful hotel with outstanding Irish service--the right touch of friendliness and professionalism for us.  Rooms are beautifully well-kept, garden is lovely, beautiful art throughout, classic furniture, wonderful beds (slept well!).  The Merrion made our first trip to Dublin truly wonderful.  We thoroughly enjoyed the included breakfast - wow - and on the day we were taking a tour & needed to leave before the breakfast hours they offered to either bring us a packed breakfast or provide room service (we chose room service and it was so very lovely).  We enjoyed a dip in the relaxing pool each night before dinner and after walking the city during the day--not the chlorinated, bright blue kind in the US but a softly lighted, large relaxation pool.   There was also tea by the fire and drinks in the garden -- everything about this hotel was so very special.",5,2013,09,24
200,What a fab place,"Really really nice, especially the garden courtyard on a sunny autumn day. Only minor gripe would be the prices for food - eur 20 for a snack, eur 35 for breakfast, thats pretty bull market prices in a bear market economy, so i just eat elsewhere imstead. Everything else is lovely.",5,2013,09,24
200,The Merrion Hotel is unpretentiously elegant,"My spouse and I enjoy discussing and rating hotels after having completed our stay, usual categories, location, style, staff, maintenance etc. We concurred, this property ranked very high in all categories.  Appreciate unpretentious, a small sign on the outside lets you know the name (yes a doorman is there but adds to the charm), it is part of the Leading Hotels of the World chain and they have very high standards to be met.  What we found appealing was the casual air, yet extremely professional, staff deferential yet with a certain friendliness, interior not modern but didn't want super modern in Dublin.  Bath exceptional and mattress, honestly the best one of the entire trip, joked that most hotels in Ireland must order from the same mattress company, but not The Merrion. We loved the location, hop on and off bus right at the door, walking to the central area easy, restaurants close by...had a wonderful meal at Matt the Thresher....
Public areas lovely, just the right ambiance, sat often in the bar area...yes, it is expensive, the most we paid actually for a night's lodging, but we both felt worth it and were glad we had opted to splurge. oh yes, the breakfast was served in a very nice dining area....and was delicious.",5,2013,09,23
200,Marvelous Merrion,"The hotel was excellent!  We enjoyed our four nights there, and we never experienced a misstep.  Everything  was perfect, and everyone who worked there was friendly and very helpful.  Our one disappointment was not with the hotel but rather with their restaurant.  We had dinner at their restaurant, Patrick Guilbaud.  A review of that restaurant will be rated under the restaurant section, but the hotel is amazing and should definitely be considered  as number one when staying in Dublin and looking for a ""high end"" hotel.",5,2013,09,22
200,"Best shower in Ireland, fantastic location. Very formal, though.","Excellent staff, beautiful hotel, strong wifi (hooray!) and great showers (double hooray!). Right across the street from the national museum, walking distance to Trinity College, the cathedrals, shopping, restaurants, and the Guinness storehouse. It's pricey, but how many hotels have a dude in a top hat hanging out on the front steps? The rooms are a little small, and our view... well, best to keep the curtains closed. Maybe this paints me too clearly as an American, but any hotel that requests that guests dress smartly at all times while in the hotel seems like it's trying a little too hard. I'd absolutely stay there again and recommend it to others, but the atmosphere was too formal for me to be really comfortable.",4,2013,09,20
200,Spectacular,"I never write reviews for anything, hotels, restaurants or products, and I doubt one more glowing review for the best hotel in Dublin is of much value. However, having just returned to the States from a 5 day stay at the Merrion in Dublin, I have to add my two cents that this play is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at, and that includes many Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton resorts. The Merrion's food, accommodations and service are equal to both, but with a style, quality, warmth and uniqueness all its own. Wow from start to finish, especially the staff, the nicest and most competent group of professionals you will find anywhere, from the doormen and concierge, to front desk, food servers and those at the spa. On top of it, we had a group rate and paid the equivalent of $300 US per nite for a room including a great breakfast that would easily be 2 or 3 times that at most other hotels of this quality. Unbelievable! Would give it 6 stars if I could!",5,2013,09,20
200,Luxury without pretension,"Stayed for two nights with two friends to celebrate our 40ths. Or as we coined it our 120th! The highlight of our stay was cocktails in the lounge on Saturday evening, pure decedence. The efficient, friendly and attentive staff are without doubt the best selling point for this hotel, our waitress on Saturday night for dinner, who also served us for breakfast on Sunday was a breath of fresh air and provided excellent service. I know that during our stay there was a couple of very minor points of criticism the fact that I cannot recall them now indicates that they were of no significance. A memorable and enjoyable experience, excellent location and the best breakfast ever!",5,2013,09,20
200,Wonderful hotel great location,"It' was our first time visiting Ireland and we flew into Dublin airport. After a short taxi ride we were at the merrion hotel.  It was a beautiful well kept property.  We felt very welcomed and pampered.  Tea in the drawing rooms was very special.  Enjoyed the restaurant good food good service.  We would love to return.
",5,2013,09,20
200,Simply the best,If there is one thing I like it is a 5 star hotel. My parents have been going here for years and pestering me to come. I stayed for two nights in August after a family wedding. I was simply blown away. The standard of this hotel makes it one of the best in the world. I have stayed at virtually every hotel in Park Lane. I have stayed in the Savoy ( twice the price ) and some of the finest hotels in New York. None of them are a patch on The Merrion. Simply stunning. Great staff and friendly service. Special thanks to Damien in The Cellar Bar who made us feel so welcome and thanks to him for looking after my elderly parents on their many visits over the years. We will be back as soon as possible. Quite simply the ONLY place to stay in Dublin,5,2013,09,20
200,"Classy, top notch service","We had a great stay here and will definitely stay again.  Phenomenal service from doorman to spa. This is a place where they know your name (like a Ritz standard) and mix English charm with Irish hospitality.  Literally the only reason not to give 5 stars is that the Garden wing rooms, while great, just have a slight second class feel.  You just can tell if you're in ""that wing"" that the rooms aren't as nice.  It's also slightly...and I mean slightly...off from the more center area.  But it's a beautiful place and we'd look to stay longer next time.",4,2013,09,19
200,Outstanding,"Excellent hotel; very friendly service and great location.  Arrived early from the US and got shower and breakfast while waiting for room.  Very relaxing and soothing atmosphere.  Not hectic.  Overly helpful staff.  Not much view out the front, but interior gardens are nice.",5,2013,09,19
200,Choose your room wisely or forgo rest,"Large, well appointed rooms, but mine was down the hall from some corporate party, so it was noisy.  Like trying to sleep in a crowd.  I called reception to ask they tone it down, and by 11pm, they did.  Otherwise, I would credit the staff as being friendly and attentive.",3,2013,09,19
200,Wonderful hotel,"I consider the Merrion Hotel the best hotel in Dublin.  Even though I live in Dublin, I stayed in the hotel and there was nothing I could fault.  The food in the hotel including the Cellar Bar is fantastic.  The Merrion also has a great wine menu.  The service is always outstanding and staff are so friendly while extremely professional.  There is just something very special about this hotel and no matter if you just go for a drink in the Cellar Bar or stay in the hotel, it is a wonderful experience.  I think my 'dream' would be to live in this hotel.",5,2013,09,17
200,Fantastic,"Our travel agent booked us here for our first night in Ireland.  It was wonderful the staff was very nice and we received our promised upgrades without asking.  The High Tea in the Drawing room was both beautifully presented and tasty.  Yes, expensive but worth every penny.",5,2013,09,17
200,The perfect place to stay,"We stayed there for two nights. It was walking distance to St. Patrick's Cathedral and to Guinness storehouse. It is centralized to just about everything. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for you. They were very cheerful and helpful. The rooms were large and very clean, The bathrooms were large also clean. Excellent Wi-Fi service there. I would definitely go back again. ",5,2013,09,17
200,Perfect for a quiet night,"I value my sleep more than anything and as such I rate this hotel as a 5 star. There are other hotels closer to the busy shopping streets of Grafton (therefor more noisy at night) and nearer the ferry ports and river (further away from city centre), but this is perfect for sightseeing, just a short walk away (about 15 minutes) from Grafton street and very close to Trinity College. Staff are very attentive and service was excellent.  We had a light snack in the drawing room rather than dinner as we have already had a big lunch earlier in the day and the food was superb, just the right size portions. Later on we had a drink in the bar and despite the bar being full, it was very quiet and relaxing.  As we were leaving very early for our ferry back to Wales, we ordered breakfast in our room, which came promptly and if I need to critissize, it would be that the portions were too large, but the food was lovely. We had booked in for the Spa Package, I chose the fitness massage and my husband had the Swedish massage, the staff in the spa was very professional and we both enjoyed the treatments.  We would stay here again if we are in Dublin.",4,2013,09,16
200,Terrific,"A beautiful hotel located in an old Georgian era building. Whilst old on the outside, everything looked brand new on the inside and the entire place from the carpets to the pillowcases were sparkling. Excellent location not far from St Stephens Green and the bustling pubs of Baggot Street. And to top it all off, Mr Obama stayed here a whole back!!! ",5,2013,09,12
200,Service overload,"charming and delightful as the hotel is, the extent to which the irish will go to please is, on occasion, suffocating.  Sure I could have put up the do not disturb sign - Had at least 5-6 visitors to the room every day!! I guess they had to make sure everything was perfect! first world problems stay in five star hotels.

The bathroom was spectacular, the shower was great.
gym was not so sensational, but there are nearby options for lifting as required.
breakfast was great...",4,2013,09,10
200,Elegant hotel,"We stayed at The Merrion hotel for 3 nights last August. The hotel is centrally located, yet very quiet. Our room faced an inner court with a beautiful garden. Rooms are beautiful, spacious and well kept. The bed was very good. Breakfast was very good too. The concierge was the best concierge we've ever met.There was an elegant atmosphere with an excellent service. A beautiful, spacious swimming pool added to our pleasure.",5,2013,09,10
200,Afternoon tea not to be missed!,"I would just like to say thank you to all the staff at the Merrion hotel for a wonderful stay. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody. You really are made to feel that nothing is too much trouble. If I had to sum this hotel up, I would say that it reminds me of Fairmont hotels in terms of its excellent service and attention to detail, except with even friendlier staff.

The afternoon tea is definitely not to be missed! Sitting in one of the hotel's large comfy sofas in front of a magnificent open fire - while it was cold and windy outside! - enjoying a posh afternoon tea was a highlight of my stay:-)  It was posh, but friendly at the same time! (You do need to book in advance for the afternoon tea. I was lucky as somebody had cancelled.) 

I was also delighted by the hotel's artwork. They house an impressive varied collection spread throughout the hotel which is recorded superbly in a glossy catalogue which you can keep. 

I have no complaints whatsoever about the food or the room we stayed in. I was staying with my 12 year old son and because we needed a twin room I was concerned that we may end up in a less attractive room. Instead the room was perfect. We were in room 325 which overlooked the hotel's gardens and charming rectangular pond. The room was a decent size, the mini bar was very well stocked and there was a flat screen TV - not overly large, but perfectly adequate, plus all the usual necessities: iron, hairdryer etc. Likewise, the bathroom was fine. I liked the modern all-glass shower cubicle.

Breakfast is very good :-) My son loved his full Irish breakfast, whilst I was more than happy with the buffet selection. In any event, the staff are very willing to get you whatever you would  like. The service truly is second to none.

Although our trip was brief, we did try out the gym and swimming pool. There's not a lot you can say about a treadmill! It worked and was fine! The swimming pool is a good size. My son really liked it and said the water was the clearest he had ever been in for a pool. He wears goggles and could see the whole length under water! Its styled like a Roman sunken pool - to my mind at least - with a big fresco painting at one end on the wall. All very nicely maintained and very clean. I didn't have an opportunity to try the spa. I am saving that treat for next time perhaps!

In terms of location, the hotel is directly opposite the Irish Government's Parliament, as well as some art galleries. It is very convenient for town and the sights in general. I really enjoyed the stroll I had with my son around St Stephen's Park - even though it was raining! Although the hotel is lovely, I did miss it as I first went past, as it does not have a very showy exterior like some other hotels. However, there are doormen outside, so if you just look for them, you can't miss it!

I will definitely be coming back to this hotel when I have the opportunity :-)",5,2013,09,10
200,Perfect Base for Exploring Dublin,"The Merrion is a great hotel in a perfect location for exploring Dublin.  We arrived early, but they whisked away our car and bags to let us head out on the town.  That theme of outstanding, friendly, and efficient service continued throughout our stay, from our constant requests for directions, through the front desk service (including exchanging dollars for euros at a good rate with no fee), through the restaurant.  Our room was not huge but was comfortable and well-appointed, with high end fixtures and separate tub and shower.  We faced the internal courtyard, which was quiet and peaceful in spite of the fact that you are in the middle of a large city. The lobby and lobby bar were a lovely, welcoming taste of this Georgian neighborhood.  Continental breakfast was included with our package and was excellent -- fresh fruit, yogurt, baked goods, and the best homemade granola of our trip.  We also had dinner in the hotel restaurant and found the food and service both exceptional and well-priced.  An overall excellent stay, and we would recommend The Merrion to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, friendly five-star experience in the heart of Dublin.",5,2013,09,10
200,Elegant character close to St. Stephen's Green,"Lots of charm in this older but well maintained hotel. Lovely cave-like bar downstairs.
Wonderful dining room also.  We had dinner and breakfast there.  Close walking distance to St. Stephen's Green and onward to Trinity College.",5,2013,09,10
200,Outstandin and low key,"The hotel is located in the Georgian section of Dublin. The discreet sign is easy to miss, but that is part of the charm of this first class hotel. From the moment of our arrival, everything was delight, smooth and professional. The room was lovely with a fantastic bed, marble bath with separate tub and shower, and very quiet. It was an easy walk from here to the sights and sounds of Dublin, with the National Art Gallery across the street. High tea and cocktails are served in the drawing rooms and outdoor patio [which overlooks the lovely courtyard gardens. The spa has good services and a quiet, calm atmosphere, decent price for a good therapeutic massage. A buffet breakfast is offered at a fairly steep price for what is offered- basically a continental breakfast, but it is convenient.",5,2013,09,09
200,Worth it!,"We spent two wonderful nights at the Merrion for a ""splurge"" Anniversary celebration, with the breakfast included and a Brown Thomas shopping promotion.  Staff were uniformly excellent, the room was quiet and very comfortable.  The Hotel was sold out but it felt at times like we had the place to ourselves. The breakfast could meet any need and the basement breakfast room was well appointed and serviced by attentive staff.   We had a very good first night meal at the Cellar Bar.  The ""23"" room on the main level is open 24/7 for guests to get drinks and food.  We has some late night snacks in the lovely setting: understated, refined elegance.
Location is great for walking to the main sites. The shopping package was worth it, and we ended up with a nice sweater from Brown Thomas.
Taxis: 30 euro from airport to Merrion, 25 euro from Merrion to airport: not sure why the fares were different.
The only con: it is expensive.
One other note: the Merrion is looking to expand into an adjacent building, but I think any construction is at least a year out.",5,2013,09,08
200,Many positives but not perfect,"Positives - great location, excellent swimming pool, great breakfast (though first morning, the service needed a bit of a prod) and special mention to the front door team who took away and brought back our car each day (the parking is well worth it even at E20 per night).  

What wasn't so good?  The rooms in the newer block felt a bit dated (eg showers poor by today's standards for a hotel of this price) and because the old part of the hotel is used for afternoon tea and only has the very expensive rooms, you don't feel really part of a great old style hotel.  Front of house OK but no better and despite arriving with our luggage at 10.00, knowing rooms wouldn't be ready until 3pm, when we returned at 3, one of our rooms still wasn't ready.  

We enjoyed our stay, but without feeling it was exceptional.  That said, we did leave comments and will give credit to the follow up from the hotel within a couple of days which shows that they do care about their standards.  The rooms we were in are apparently in line for a refurbishment, addition of coffee machines, which would have made a big difference.",4,2013,09,08
200,Charming,"The Merrion is located beautifully in Dublin.  It is in walking distance to Trinity College,Dublin Castle,Great restaurants,shops and bars and many other sites in a beautiful part of town.  The brick townhouses are beautiful and the room was beautifully appointed and very comfortable.  The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful.  
The public rooms were beautiful and although we did not have high tea, it looked fabulous!",5,2013,09,08
200,Wonderful service,"Recently stayed two nights in the Merrion. Had a great time. Staff were wonderful - from checkin to the bar to breakfast to the guys out front, even the initial reservation was made easy! Great location, easy walk to everywhere with great pubs and restaurants nearby. We stayed in the garden wing, rooms were good, thought they would be fancier but that's just being really picky! Enjoy!
PS Incase management read this - we were awoken at about 5am one morning with some lady and one of the staff talking at the top of their voices at the room beside us. She was checking out. Perhaps ensure that staff talk quietly to guests at that time of the morning!!",5,2013,09,07
200,Gorgeous,"The Merrion's location in Dublin is truly top-notch; steps from shops, pubs and culture, it could not have been better. The hotel is a charming brick town house in style, placed in a lovely residential area -- yet it is quite large is size. The lobby and public rooms were decorated in beautiful furnishings, modern art and white marble. The interior courtyard and gardens were lovely looking and the spa area was great, (with an excellent lap pool). Upon our arrival there was fruit, chocolate covered strawberries and juice in the room. We had a very early flight, so we were brought an amazing room service selection of breakfast goods, in great quanity. The service was very good throughout our stay and we look forward to going back to the Merrion sometime soon.",5,2013,09,06
200,Could have lived there!,"Our travel agent got us an upgrade we hadn't requested, so we ended up with a three-room suite with fireplace and marble bathroom.  The location in the heart of the city is excellent (everything walkable), the common rooms have fires going, the staff will do anything for you, the grounds are beautifully landscaped and perfect for an afternoon respite, and the Irish breakfasts are superb.  We could have moved right in!",5,2013,09,05
200,Brilliant hotel,"Excellent service, atmosphere and rooms. Cellar restaurant was lovely for breakfast and dinner. Both houskeeping and roomservice were very quick in responding when i needed/ wanted items. Concierge and doormen always very polite, helpful and proactive. Would definitely stay again.",5,2013,09,04
200,Impeccable Service,"We recently spent 4 nights at the Merrion for a city break in Dublin. The location is excellent, in the Georgian quarter, but right on the Hop-on-hop-off sightseeing bus route and walking distance from many of the main sights. the hotel is extremely well kept & maintained, clean, elegant and classy. The room and bathroom were spacious and excellent, give or take one or two minor plumbing foibles, and there is a nightly room and turndown service. The service is impeccable throughout -- efficient, responsive, and professional. Staff are also unfailingly courteous and friendly -- something that unfortunately could not also be said of all our fellow guests. One strange tradition is the lighting of fires in the lounges every day of the year which in a warm spell made them uncomfortable. Traversing to and from rooms in the Garden Wing inevitably involves walking through those lounges (an unfortunate layout feature in our view). The concierge and porterage are also excellent, and valet parking and retrieval of the car was 'seamless. The Cellar Bar is very good for informal eating and light meals. The main restaurant is good but very pricey. With a '4 for 3' deal and complimentary car parking we felt we had good value for money at a top notch 5-star hotel. If anything would make us think twice about using the Merrion again it would be the cold, aloof atmosphere created by many of our fellow guests -- but a hotel cannot choose its clients and maybe we just hit an unfortunate week in that respect.",5,2013,09,03
200,A perfect start to our first visit to Ireland,"We stayed just for one night in September, but wish it was longer! The hotel itself is beautiful, so elegant with lovely grounds and drawing rooms, but it is the staff who make the experience such a special one - nothing was too much trouble from ice to extra pillows to an extra early breakfast. The Irish breakfast was fantastic. Well located, we will certainly stay again on our next trip. ",5,2013,09,03
200,Another level in service!,"We only stayed one night here last month as we needed to find somewhere in the city before we moved on to our next destination.
When I go home to Ireland we normally stay at the Ritz Carlton down in Powerscourt so we have certain expectations on good service and accommodation.
The Merrion is arguably know as one of the best hotels in Europe perhaps the world so its reputation did precede it.
Even in our short stay there were several examples of where this service was impeccable in fact I would almost say the staff were almost telepathic to our needs! Small things, nothing elaborate but enough to make you think to yourself afterwards that was bloody impressive!",5,2013,09,02
200,Fantastic lobby,"We did not go passed the lobby. Unfortunately, when we visited this last weekend, the Merrion was full. However, our hotel's lack of a lobby meant that we were forced to head to the Merrion to see whether they had room in their lobby for us to sit for tea in the early afternoon. The lobby at the Merrion is filled with interesting art and furniture, and is a lovely place to sit and have tea. We'll be staying here if we ever come back to Dublin.",5,2013,09,02
200,Afternoon Art Tea,"After checking out various hotels in Dublin that did afternoon tea, I took my mum to The Merrion Hotel. The art aspect was really unique and I was interested in seeing their collection as well. The room was quaint and comfortable, and the staff were lovely. They were very welcoming, friendly and explained the teas really well. 
The afternoon tea included a choice of tea and two courses; the three tier stand of sandwiches, scones and cakes, followed by a trio of desserts based on three paintings from The Merrion's own art collection. Apart from looking absolutely exquisite, the whole thing was delicious, and extremely filling. We went at 3.30pm and it did me until supper. 
A really luxurious and relaxing way to spend our last afternoon in Dublin, and you can get it with champagne as well for special occasions. I recommend taking  a couple of hours to really enjoy it. It's a little bit expensive but you get what you pay for so I think it's worth it as a treat.",5,2013,08,31
200,Tradition & Class,"Spent 3 nights at this beautiful hotel in mid August.  The property is beautiful and very well maintained.  They welcome you from the moment you get out of your car, letting you know that everything will be taken care.  We were walked to our room by the woman who checked us in and chatted the whole way.  The ambiance of the hotel was warm and inviting, the staff could not co enough for you.  The bar area was well stocked and the bartender was knowledgeable about all of the liquors.  Tea time was special, the fireplace was always lit and the tea room was inviting.  Our bedroom, although it did not have a view, was beautifully appointed.  The concierge was extremely helpful regarding restaurants and pubs. Turn down service every night was so nice to return after dinner and the pubs.  When it was time to check out, the bellman was up to our room within 5 minutes after calling, our car was waiting outside.  This was a beautiful hotel to end our Ireland trip at, although it may be pricier than other hotels in Dublin, it was well worth it.  The Merrion has the highest of standards.",5,2013,08,30
200,Dublin in Style,"The Merrion is a gorgeous property located directly across the street from Parliament. 
The staff is excellent which is why Heads of State stay there.
The fireplaces located throughout the property provide a unique atmosphere.
Try the cellar, the food and spirits are refreshing.",5,2013,08,27
200,Spot on,"Lovely hotel, very accomodating staff, comfortable room with everything you could possibly need on hand. Only criticism is that they forgot to deliver our morning paper!

Valet parking service was superb
Breakfast was delicious
Beds extremely comfortable
Bathroom cosmetics of a very high standard
Lovely room view over the garden
Excellent knowledgable concierge and reception",5,2013,08,27
200,One Happy Family,"We had an excellent experience! For a four night stay in two rooms we got a discount and only had to pay for three nights. The rooms were fantastic, overlooking gardens with a small desk area and four piece bathroom. Our rooms were upgraded at check-in. The service was excellent. The staff was friendly, helpful, and responsive. The restaurants were excellent and very accessible. We had a wonderful time and cannot wait to go there again!",5,2013,08,24
200,Like putting on your favourite comfortable relaxing clothes,"Returning to the Merrion is indeed like slipping into nicely broken in clothes in which you feel most comfortable. The standard of service and affability as always of all the staff are a true delight.

The Merrion pulls of an incredible feat of being familiar, welcoming and easy with allways still seeming to feel like a special treat.

A small gripe is that the room allocated was near to the housekeeping service section so there was a bit more early morning noise than I would like. A different room request next time!",5,2013,08,22
200,It set the bar for our Ireland experience,"We stayed here for our first three nights of a ten day trip through Ireland.  Lovely, lovely staff, gorgeous grounds and elegant rooms and common areas reigned our experience.  Guests are pampered with exceptional service in every aspect of the hotel from the doormen to the room service.  I wish we didn't have to leave and cannot wait to return.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5,2013,08,20
200,Excellent place to stay when in dublin,"We stayed for one night last week and had a wonderful evening

All the staff were very attentive and the reception rooms were very welcoming

The bedroom was immaculate and although we did not eat there for dinner the breakfast and the dining room itself were faultless",5,2013,08,19
200,Gracious and welcoming hotel staff,We stayed at the Merrion for several nights during our tour of the UK and Ireland.  The Merrion is a great hotel in a great location with great staff.  They gladly fulfilled every small request we had from a bandage to another luggage rack.  Breakfast was superb.  The doormen were always so friendly and helpful.  Five star+ hotel.,5,2013,08,18
200,Perfect !,"Great Location in city center, large and spotless room well decorated and equipped-  perfect service throughout the 3 days I stayed there.
Wish all my stay were as pleasant.
Meeting rooms were large & convenient.",5,2013,08,16
200,Elegance and Style!,"We have stayed here several times and obviously love this quiet, stately gem of a hotel! Very well-trained staff who remember your name and face and your ""wishes""--fabulous!  Beautifully furnished rooms, immaculate and well tended.  Now the breakfast.  Unbelievable!  So yummy and again, the staff are so pleasant and greet you by name every day.  
The location is the best: off the busy square so noise is not an issue.  We always love to stay in hotels that are romantic and NOT convention-style hotels.  The Merrion is perfect!  We will return--",5,2013,08,16
200,It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,"In 1978, my college classmates and I were fortunate enough to take a trip to magical Ireland. We kept saying we would return but it took us 35 years to get our proverbial acts together. It was worth the wait. A lot has changed in 3 1/2 decades (including the absence of our priest and nun chaperones this time around). The Merrion Hotel was our first stop in this reunion tour (note -- only three of us, thank goodness, made this trip). We each had a junior suite. Well, it might not be the least expensive way to house oneself in the fantastic city of Dublin, but it sure as heck is worth every single penny. From the minute you hit the sidwalk outside of the Merrion, greeted by a charming, top-hatted doorman, you know you have reached a very special destination. The service, from the afore-mentioned doorman, to the bellboys, to the front desk is superior. I have to make special mention of three groups -- the housekeepers, the concierge staff, and the spa staff. 

First - housekeeping ... I travel a fair amount and I have never, in lo these many years on this earth, seen such immaculate conditions every single moment of my stay in a residence. The suite was beautiful but made more so by the attention to detail of the housekeeping staff. I am a swimmer (they have a fantastic pool and spa, btw) which means I am prone to using a LOT of towels and can create a bit of a mess. I never once returned to a room that was less than pristine. Magical these little elves! 

Concierge staff -- from LISTENING to our interests for dinner venues they selected exactly the right mix of restaurants each night of our stay. I have to admit ... during that last trip to Ireland, fine dining (or even good dining) was not something we discovered. Not this time. Ireland and its ""Good Food Ireland"" initiative has surpassed all our expectations. Spectacular. Every meal was fantastic and I owe this to the brilliance of the concierge staff. They were very patient with our middle-aged eccentricities and could not have been more spot on with their recommendations. They secured the perfect reservations, always had cars when we needed them, and when some of the group needed some attention to their hair (blow outs), even arranged to make that happen. I'm not sure what these folks could not do! 

Spa -- A lot of hotels, especially high end like the Merrion, have spas. But not staffed like this. Again, it is the staffing at this residence that makes it so far superior to its counterparts. I had a bit of a manicure issue. Sounds trite but trust me, if you found yourself traveling around with nail peeling off you, too would find this a sort of ""emergency."" The staff were just lovely. Not only did they resolve the issue for me, they remembered me every morning as I shuffled by en route to the pool and checked in to make sure the old nails were holding up. OK, yes, it is the little things! 

I have not stopped talking about this hotel since I returned to the States. Save those pennies and make this a ""must stop"" on your next trip tp Dublin. You will not regret it.",5,2013,08,16
200,Perfect in Every Way,My sister and I stayed at The Merrion at the beginning of our vacation and loved it so much we came back to Dublin to stay another night.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  Service top notch.  Centrally located for walking everywhere.  Will definitely stay here when we come back!,5,2013,08,13
200,Great stay in Dublin,"Merion is a great hotel in the downtown Dublin. Walking distance from the main scenic views and shops.
Service is great with friendly staff.
Take the opportunity o dine at their special restaurant. It is expensive but food is fantastic and it is worth the experience.",5,2013,08,09
200,Top notch!,"I stayed here for four nights with a group.  The service has been impeccable.  The rooms are cleaned twice a day, breakfast was very good as we're the food in drinks in the lobby bar.  The rooms were luxurious, the gym/pool well maintained and the gardens beautiful.  I wold highly recommend this hotel for anybody who wants to be well pampered.",5,2013,08,08
200,Beautiful Hotel! Truly a Five-Star experience,"The main building of the property is in a combination of 17th century town homes that are beautifully decorated and maintained in their proper elegance.  The property includes some newer  additions in the rear (17 yrs old I believe) which all surround a lovely courtyard with a central fountain, sculptures, and seating for tea or lunch weather permitting.  

The service was some of the best I have experienced.  Top Notch! 

My wife and I enjoyed a spa treatment and a swim in the pool. We were both very pleased with our treatments.  

I would highly recommend this hotel if it fits in the budget. We also stayed at the Westbury  Hotel in Dublin and were not very impressed, but the price was considerably less.",5,2013,08,08
200,Overnight stay,"Living in Rathmines, Dublin, we never stayed in The Merrion before. But, we received the present of a voucher for an overnight stay and a meal in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. What a wonderful experience. The staff are really well trained and demonstrate a great attitude towards the guests. We were made to feel most welcome. Nothing was too much trouble for them. A special treat was breakfast brought to our room on a very clever trolley/table. The best value for €5 ever.",5,2013,08,08
200,Superior hotel in the heart of Dublin,Stayed for 3 nights on our visit to Dublin and this hotel helped make it a very memorable experience.  We were totally impressed with the level of professionalism exhibited by all members of staff that we came in contact with.  The hotel itself is a historic gem that has been well maintained and captures that old world charm of Georgian Dublin.  Great location steps from all of the action but just on the edge which meant the surrounding area was calm and quiet.  The pool was fantastic as were the gardens.  We didn't eat any meals here but the bars and restaurants on premises looked good.  This was a 5 star experience for us.,5,2013,08,07
200,Fantastic stay,"We arrived at the Merrion Hotel after 36 hours with no sleep as we were caught up in the air traffic controllers strike in Spain caused by France. I can not begin to describe how we were feeling, but once we stepped inside this magnificent hotel all our worries disappeared, the reception we received from the front of house staff to the housekeeping, restaurant staff and everybody in between was second to none, they all went out of thier way to make our stay the most enjoyable we have ever had at a hotel. We stayed in many up market hotels in Europe but this place by far took the cake. Congratulations must go out to the management and staff for providing us with such a wonderful experience. We will return. Kind Regards the Alderman family",5,2013,08,06
200,Still the six star hotel in Dublin!,"We had a very good  stay....upgraded to a larger room as our room was not prepared. Sheets and bed linen of super quality - excellent high thread count and beautiful new white fluffy towels. Slippers were also above par - soft and of a decent size - even my size eleven feet fitted with ease. Service was excellent once it was established I was not going to be monkeyed around waiting for a ""normal"" 3pm checkin which I was informed was the ""norm"" in Europe - umhh....they must be very busy at exactly 3pm checking in all those waiting guests!.......but given the upgrade I let them sincerely off the hook! Thanks. Our stay was perfect Riverdance and then lunch in Patricks next door 2star Michelin - magical lunch and stay - memorable.",5,2013,08,06
200,A few minor issues,"We spent two nights at the Merrion to kick off our week in Ireland.  The hotel is, of course, gorgeous and the service was impeccable.  We had just a few minor complaints.  Our room was stuffy and even on maximum cooling could not be made completely comfortable.  And we couldn't leave our window open as there were bursts of evening noise from late night partiers that woke us.  Second, the 26 euros for each continental breakfast (yes, that's right- no hot food, just continental) was ridiculous.  Despite these issues, the historic building itself is beautiful, the room was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The garden was gorgeous so we took the long way through it whenever possible.  The location was very walkable to many restaurants and bars. Staff was professional and friendly and eager to help whenever possible. The Merrion is pricey, but we would have considered it a better value had we slept better.",4,2013,08,06
200,Charming!,"The Merrion is in a great location directly opposite The Parliament buildings. It's walking distance from parks, pubs shops and restaurants. It's close to Grafton Street which is a wonderful area bustling with activity.  The architecture is 3 Georgian Town homes  put together to make one space.  The town homes were built in the 1700's. The First Duke of Wellington was born there. We had a Junior Suite with a Large Living Room. The bed was off to the side. The Living Room was very comfortable.",5,2013,08,06
200,What a great stay!,"This was a beautiful hotel in a great location to many places.  They really made you feel special!  When we check in they TOOK us to our room and showed all of the amenities about the room.  We have traveled many times and this is the first time any hotel has done this.  

The garden area was abolutley spectacular!!

We didn't eat at the hotel because of the prices, other than that it was a 10!!",5,2013,08,05
200,Excellent - best hotel in Dublin!,"We recently stayed at the Merrion, and it was superb.  From our first enquiry, Attila in the Reservations Department was incredibly helpful.  It was lovely to arrive at the hotel, as it looked like a georgian townhouse from the outside, far from the corporate look of other hotels.  Inside, the Merrion is surprising, because it is built around a beautiful garden. We were really impressed with the service from all of the staff, who went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay.  The bedroom was gorgeous, really nice and spacious with a lovely view of the garden (we were also upgraded, thank you!!).  The bedroom and bathroom were far bigger than other 5* hotels we have stayed in nearby, and the rooms were very quiet.  Breakfasts and evening meals were great in the Cellar, and we had a wonderful meal in Guilbaud's.  We found the hotel very handy for town too, as it is about 5 minutes' walk from Stephen's Green.  Overall, top notch service, a beautiful, elegant hotel, and a wonderful stay.  We will definitely be back and we would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the perfect hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,08,03
200,Lovely historic hotel near everything,"My husband and I love history and old architecture. We also love to walk to attractions. The Merrion Hotel provided us all of the above and more. The staff was consistently friendly and service was excellent. The room was lovely and comfortable. We were there on July 4th and when we returned to our room from our sightseeing, we found fancy tea cakes with a red, white and blue theme and a note wishing us a Happy Fourth of July! We ate dinner one night in the Cellar and it too was excellent with great service. We could easily walk to anything in City Centre; the Tourist Information, Grafton Street, the parks, Trinity College, good eaterys and O'Donoghue's Pub (heard great music there). Our one disappointment was that the buffet breakfast, although good, was overpriced even by hotel standards. The Concierge was happy to give us directions to a good, inexpensive breakfast place nearby.",5,2013,08,02
200,Maybe our favorite hotel ever stayed in,Loved this hotel!  Rooms were great and spacious for Europe.  Hotel has lots of character and was great environment.  Service in all terms at the hotel was superb.  We loved the turn down service!  We would love to go back on our next trip to Dublin!!,5,2013,07,30
200,Deserving of a 5 Star rating.,"Finally a hotel that lives up to its star rating.  We received an excellent welcome, both friendly and professional. Our luggage was delivered to our room within 5 mins of arriving, which was great as we wanted to make the best of the day and head out straight away. The rooms are traditionally decorated, very bright, airy and spotlessly clean. They were also very well maintained, a good size and had a cosy, homely feel. The furnishings, linen and toiletries all provided the luxury you expect when you stay in a 5 star hotel. The hotel inner courtyard was a delightful surprise and an ideal place to sit on a sunny day. One word to describe The Merrion would be elegant.

The hotel is in a great location, central but not in the thick of all the noise. We unfortunately never got the opportunity to try the very tasty looking high tea (we will return another time for that). We did however eat in the cellar restaurant with friends and found the food and service to be very good, if a little overpriced. 

The gym was one of the smallest I’ve been in however it was sufficient. The Spa prices I found very expensive for the services offered. The girl was very nice and the treatment was ok however when staying again I would probably go elsewhere for a treatment to get better value.

Some negative things I would have to point out were – 
We found the Internet to be a little slow. 
The air conditioning was very noisy.
You could hear water running in the bathroom pipes very clearly, especially in the mornings when people in adjacent rooms were showering.
However none of these issues would stop us from staying in the future.

When we are back in Dublin later this year The Merrion will definitely be our first choice.",5,2013,07,30
200,Lunch at the Cellar Bar,"Excellent quality of food, menu selection and physical atmosphere.  Wonderful salads, fantastic service.  Price, not cheap, but excellent quality.

The only downside is the basement venue, quite dark and down a steep stairs.",4,2013,07,30
200,Wonderful hotel,"We treat ourselves to a weekend in Dublin every year and given that it is a treat we splash out on the Merrion. To my mind, what the Merrion does best is subtle, understated elegance allied to superb service which is consistently attentive, friendly and yet unobtrusive. If you want flashy or loud, don't stay at the Merrion, however if it is true quality you are after, look no further.",5,2013,07,28
200,This is what 5* means,"Sometimes, a 5* rating is just an excuse to give 4* or even 3* service at a higher price.  The Merrion shows what 5 stars really means.  From the moment of our arrival, when the concierge took our car away, to the time we checked out, the service could not be faulted.
If there is such a thing as an ""Irish"" welcome, then I would suggest that there is also a specifically ""Dublin"" welcome as well.  5 stars can bring a certain stuffiness and fawning attention, but not here.  The staff - and there was no shortage of them - always seemed to be looking for some way of helping to make the experience special.  
Make no mistake, this is not a hotel for anyone on a tight budget, so for most people, it will be somewhere to stay on a special occasion.  But you will leave with a warm glow, having been pampered and ""mothered"" in every way.  Rooms are immaculate, with crisp linen, luxury cosmetics, well stocked mini-bar, robes and slippers.  The only slight quibble was poor water pressure in the shower.  The spa is relatively small, but there is a well equipped gym, a lovely 18m pool, and a steam room (no sauna).  There are three options for dining.  The Cellar bar offers great value, with main courses in the € 20 - €25 range.  Next door, the Cellar restaurant is cosy, with a nice a la carte menu, and if you really want to splurge, the hotel boasts Ireland's only 2* Michelin restaurant.  A huge thank you is due to all the staff, who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2013,07,27
200,"luxery accomodation, Great Location",We wanted a hotel in the heart of Dublin that provided a great service and luxury accommodations. The Merrion hotel met all of our expectations. Check in was smooth and the accommodations were top notch. We asked for an upgrade and they accommodated us with a smile. I would stay here again.,5,2013,07,26
200,Number 1 for a reason,"The merrion retains its position as the best in Dublin, and I can see why. We stayed for 2 nights. The rooms are utterly luxurious. The spa is wonderful. Looking forward to returning soon. Thank you so much. ",5,2013,07,25
200,Expensive but worth the price,"Highly recommend the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.  We splurged and stayed in the Dungarden Suite, which was huge, allowing my sons to be loud and stay somewhat in control.   This is a traditional old hotel with a fantastic location, across the street from government buildings, the National Museum and the National Gallery, and down the road from Trinity University.  We were big fans.  If you can afford it, worth the money.",5,2013,07,25
200,Luxury accommodation in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed here for our first year anniversary. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel - the staff were immaculately turned out and extremely helpful and the rooms were spotlessly clean and spacious. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom was very luxurious with it's Italian marble finish. We went for the Full Irish breakfast both mornings of our stay which I have to say was a mighty feed which kept us going until tea time.

The location is perfect being a 2 minute walk from St Stephens Green and a 5 minute walk from Grafton Street.

The only complaint I had was that there were a lot of slamming doors from about 8:30 in the morning. We stayed on the first floor garden wing and it sounded as if there was a room near to us that was used by the hotel staff due to the frequency of the door slamming. For a hotel that promotes itself as a luxurious I would expect to be able to have a lie in in the mornings.",4,2013,07,25
200,Had a lovely stay,My 17 year old daughter and I stayed in the Merrion for 1 night on a short trip to Dublin. We both very much enjoyed the pool and I had some really relaxing treatments at the spa. The room was spacious and the air conditioning was a blessing as Dubin was very hot. we spent the evening in our room and had dinner via room service. A very pleasant way to spend an evening!,5,2013,07,24
200,The Merrion hoteel,"Born in Dublin many years ago,I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin  [although my last trip was  in the year 2007]. My recollection of this hotel is that it is  one of the best in my humble opinion.Price of rooms in Dublin are high,but that;s a problem in Europe.",5,2013,07,23
200,5 Star Luxury in Dublin,"We were upgraded to a very nice room overlooking a magical garden  setting. The room was absolutely 5 star all the way around-beds, linens and fine quality hotel amenity products. 
I am a member of the paid-for membership from Leading Hotels of the World and my experience reflects this membership. 
We also had the continental breakfast daily. It was 24 Euros and if paying for this and not on a package, I wouldn't recommend it. It is only average in selection,however, the staff is quite attentive. I probably would not recommend eating in this same restaurant(the Cellar) in the evening. It is nowhere near worth the price and it is just average quality food. We had a very strange waiter named Sven. He was absolutely the oddest waiter I have ever had. We asked him to take a photo of the table and he said that he always refuses to do this for people but would make an exception this one time. What? Whatever...the service was filled with oddball quirks and comments like this. 
They have a lovely collection of art in the hotel and a nice brochure explaining it in the rooms. The corridors of the hotel are quite drab, though, and the entrance décor is banal at best. Cocktails in the lovely garden area are served nightly and it is just gorgeous. 
On another note, some friends of ours were also staying at the hotel and walked out on their meal at the 2 star Michelin rated Patrick G. (second name escapes me). They literally could not get waited on after being seated and finally left. 
Overall, it is a very nice property and service is good from the hotel staff. I would just skip the restaurants on property. Too many other options in Dublin.",5,2013,07,22
200,"A cold, uncomfortable experience","The reviews of the Merrion seem to be uniformly complimentary, but as a single traveler in June of this year, it was a very underwhelming experience. Entering the foyer, the coldness and formality of the reception was extremely disappointing.  I and my (separately traveling) companion were kept waiting in the uncomfortable waiting room for almost two hours after arriving at 3:00pm as our rooms weren't ready, and the attitude of the reception desk was insultingly dismissive. If this hotel doesn't want single travelers, they should make this clear. Also, we were rudely treated at the Cellar Bar, a bizarrely uncomfortable experience. I know this is a very minority opinion, but it's what happened. I expressly complained to management, and haven't heard back, so I guess their business is independent of randomly bad experiences. The room was exemplary, however, but didn't offset the poor service.
This is Ireland, a nation that thrives on friendliness, but not here. A major disappointment.",3,2013,07,20
200,Luxury and convenience in Dublin,"Very close to all major sites in Dublin.  Quiet, clean and excellent service.  Breakfast was good and restaurant offer excellent food for a hotel restaurant.  Not to be missed.  Staff was very helpful.  Older but well maintained.  Would stay there again.",5,2013,07,20
200,A first class experience of magical Georgian Dublin,"Admittedly a splurge, the Merrion is nevertheless worth every penny. Our standard room was exceedingly spacious, with a beautifully appointed bathroom boasting a separate tub and shower. A small, sunny Juliet balcony overlooked the manicured gardens, where thanks to amazingly hot July weather, we enjoyed several refreshing drinks. The complimentary nuts and nibbles are very more-ish.
The service is truly top notch. Our room was serviced twice daily, with toiletries constantly replenished and the bed nicely turned down in the evening. Breakfast was delicious and we enjoyed starting the day with strong coffee poured from heavy silver pots.
I feel the lounge and bar areas are where the Merrion really comes into its own. Gloriously plump sofas sit under a fine collection of Irish art. Candles flicker in the bar in the evening, and as the light fades one gets a true sense of what it must have been like to live in this, a sprawling Georgian terrace mansion - now converted and given a new lease of life of course. Curl up with a book and soak in the atmosphere. This is an Irish experience to relish, a magical one perhaps.
To round off our stay we had the eight course tasting menu at the hotel's two Michelin star Restaurant Patrick Gilbauld. And just to really bust the wallet we opted for the selection of matching wines with each course. What an experience. It's international, grown up food, but crucially a joy to eat. The staff are also good fun.
Do stay here if you can.",5,2013,07,20
200,Would always now return to the Merrion,"The Merrion is a fantastic hotel. We were upgraded to a room in the main house and it was fab. We loved all the public areas and the hotel restaurant, bar and outdoor areas. Breakfast in our room was excellent, served both days by Jemal who was charming and polite. The hotel's greatest asset is indeed the exceptional staff and management team.  The room and the hotel generally was spotlessly clean but if i were to offer the management team any feedback on an area for improvement it would be for housekeeping staff to be told to close doors after themselves rather than letting doors bang close. It is so simple but would improve the sleep quality for guests who wish to lay in!

Finally I must add that unfortunately we had a poor experience of Pat G's and would not recommend but whilst this is part of the Merrion hotel it is a separate entity. 

The Merrion deserves to be number one on trip adviser and it will remain our hotel of choice in Dublin. Well done to all the staff and team! ",5,2013,07,20
200,Truly magnificent from start to finish,"From the moment we pulled our car into to be parked for us until we checked out it was truly amazing. Huge thank you to the staff that were so kind and helpful to us, especially the young guy at reception who checked us in (sorry I cannot think of his name) he was so lovely. And also the 2 girls on the bar staff that night, extremely friendly girls. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone especially if is an anniversary birthday concert etc... As it is a treat but also we can all stay at fancy hotels and expensive hotels that are very beautiful but they would not last a day in this society anymore without having exceptional staff to run it. And that is what you get at the merrion! ",5,2013,07,19
200,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"Yes this place is pricey but worth every single penny, treat yourself you won't regret it. It's a first class place without being snobby. All the staff are professional, helpful and very friendly. The food is delicious. Even in some of the best hotels room service food can be a let down, not in this place, it was just as good as the dining room. Felt so pampered having breakfast in my room, it arrived so beautifully presented and tasting so good. I felt like royalty for 6 nights, thank you to all the staff, I'm hoping to see you all again next year. Saving hard :)  Dublin is a great place. Places worth a visit, The Merry Ploughboy Pub (excellent night out), Glasneven Cemetery,Kilmainham Gaol",5,2013,07,18
200,Luxury,This was a wonderful break in a luxurious hotel with very friendly staff. The food was delicious and even when we came in after our concert we were able to enjoy a very late supper. Afternoon tea is a must. We will return. The location is perfect for exploring Dublin on foot.,5,2013,07,17
200,Luxury,"We recently spent a weekend in this beautiful hotel and it was special. The room was spectacular, the staff were very helpful, afternoon tea was delicious. I would compare it to Gleneagles Hotel except of course it's in the city centre. Look forward to returning.",5,2013,07,17
200,FABULOUS PROPERTY!  from the moment you drive up!,"Amazing staff!  Stacey at front desk so helpful!  Concierge and Bellman so nice!  Food delicious!  Rooms IMMACULATE!  best slippers EVER!  housekeeping is top notch!  Spa, pool and gym are not crowded and clean and well attended.  would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2013,07,17
200,Art Tea is a must,"We spent the afternoon at the Merrion for the Art Tea to celebrate a birthday. Simply perfect! Beautiful surroundings, superb food, and impeccable service. This is the perfect place for special occasions.",5,2013,07,15
200,Good old Merrion!,"Delightful room, squishy bed, amazing lunch at Patrick Guilbaud restaurant and splendid breakfast- a really great break! Make sure to request a more old fashioned room in the main building- lovely decor and garden views.",5,2013,07,15
200,Perfect blend of luxury and comfort,We had all had extremely high hopes for our stay at the Merrion and all of these expectations were exceeded. The staff were both friendly and efficient and would stop at nothing to ensure that our stay ran smoothly. We all adored our rooms and found that they all oozed with classic charm. The food was also excellent! Be sure to try the afternoon tea it was superb and artful. The Merrion's extensive art collection was another highlight of the hotel. We would like to thank the staff at the Merrion for making our stay memorable and relaxing. We felt we saw the true Dublin and would stay here again! ,5,2013,07,15
200,Wow,"This lovely hotel was perfect from the minute we pulled up outside to the minute we left.  The staff were so freindly and couldn't do enough for us.  The check in staff were really efficient, the concierge was very helpful, the doormen were so courtious and friendly and the housekeeping staff were so nice they even played with my children whilst they were in for turndown service.  Top marks must go to the restuarant though for their over and above service and caring attitude towards my sons dietry requirements. 

The hotel itself is in and ideal position close to the shops, St Stephens Green and it also has a tour bus stop just outside it. The rooms are clean and comforatble and the pool is lovely too.  The whole hotel is in a class of its own.

I have stayed in many 5 star hotels but I have to say this is by far my favourite.",5,2013,07,14
200,TripAdvisor reviews get it right again,"Stayed at this hotel last night and it certainly liver up to its excellent rating by Tripadvisor reviewers. Walm welcome, perfect location, great beds and a truly wondeful breakfast. Staff couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. We were a large group, which sometimes can be a problem but not at the Merrion. Thank you we will stay here again on our next visit.",5,2013,07,14
200,So nice!,"Our first trip to Ireland, what a great spot, convenient to all the touristy things and close to many places the locals frequent as well. Front desk staff and the concierge were super nice and so helpful.  Recommendations for places to eat, best tours to suit our interests, all great. Charming old Georgian style buildings with spacious rooms and every comfort. Not inexpensive, but worth the splurge!",5,2013,07,13
200,High quality service,"I loved our stay here at this hotel. The service was outstanding, and I felt relaxed and well taken care of the entire time. Our room temperature was perfect, and the bed was very comfortable. There is a really nice interior courtyard where you can sit when the weather is nice. We did have very slow service in the Cellar Bar but I can overlook that given the stay was otherwise perfect.",5,2013,07,13
200,Wonderful Stay,"The Merrion is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin, an easy walk to many of the major downtown major attractions.  Our room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.  Service was terrific and the food at breakfast was delicious and ample.",5,2013,07,12
200,"Service, location, decor - all good","We chose this hotel because of the location and were not disappointed.  The staff is very nice (as is everyone in Ireland), and the decor and gardens quite lovely.  I would not rate it in the ""top top"" category but I think it is the best in Dublin and we would definitely stay there again.  Lunch in the cellar restaurant was especially good.",4,2013,07,09
200,Afternoon Tea at the Merrion,"I just had to post a comment on my recent visit to The Merrion for Afternoon Tea, as it was so good!  From the staff to the food to the service - the entire experience was delightful.  The ambience of the Georgian Dining Rooms, coupled with the magnificent art throughout the hotel are a joy.  The dining rooms open onto an exquisite Italianate garden - in good weather there is a terrace where you can sit.  The staff provide excellent service, amusing anecdotes and a thorough knowledge of the art on which the nove desserts are based.

We really enjoyed it & can't wait to return!",5,2013,07,09
200,Perfect,"I managed hotels internationally for 20 years so I have an appreciation of what it takes to make a hotel operate as magically as The Merrion does.  Well done to all the team.  We had organised a tour of Ireland for 19 people, starting n Dublin and wow how perfect.  Everyone loved the hotel.  A magical start to a magical tour.  We will definitely be repeat guests...even though you are a long way from Australia!!  Special thank you to Matthew Rowlette who from day one demonstrated that our stay would be something special.  Rudy in the Cellar bar was brilliant.  Bright, warm, in command and nothing was too much trouble.",5,2013,07,08
200,Excellent hotel in a central location,"During my stay in this fantastic hotel, I enjoyed a number of features that it had to offer. The hotel offered great service and a very high standard of accommodation that was enjoyed by myself and the rest of my family. The Merrion Hotel is also in an excellent location and I thoroughly recommend it to visitors of Dublin. I would most definitely love to visit again.",5,2013,07,08
200,Fantastic stay,"We have stayed at the Merrion on numerous occasions in the past but this was one of the best stays so far. We stayed for 2 nights and also had dinner in the Cellar Restaurant. That was fantastic and as a coeliac to be told that any dessert can be adapted was a real treat especially with the selection available. Normally dessert choices are limited to fruit salad but not here.
The staff are really professional, friendly and helpful without being over the top. The hotel was very busy the weekend we stayed and the standard of service was fantastic at all times.
I had a treatment in the Spa which I really enjoyed - Yvonne was very helpful with organising things for me.
We will definitely be back again and again.",5,2013,07,07
200,Really Outstanding Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel comprised of a number of townhouses in a row opened up to create the flow of a hotel.  We had a suite on the first floor with two bedrooms and were attached by a common are in the middle.  The accommodations were wonderful.  The staff was over the top helpful and nice.  There is a lovely outdoor courtyard in the centre of the hotel and we had beautiful weather.  They have a really cool bar in the basement that is ""grotto"" style and very unique.  The whole place was wonderful.",5,2013,07,06
200,Great Hotel but Could Be Improved,"A stay at this hotel gives you a very quaint Irish experience. There's a very nice feel to the whole place, especially the bar, tea room and seating areas off the lobby. Traditional but homely style. Service is very good and the location is okay, pretty central in Dublin. However the rooms are pretty out-dated. No duvets, just a sheet and blanket, and I found that strange. The gym is terrible - the few bits of equipment they do have are old, don't work properly and desperately in need of replacement.",4,2013,07,06
200,A well located hotel...,"We stayed at The Merrion Hotel the first and last night of our trip to Ireland. The hotel is well managed and centrally located. One can easily walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar area, the National Museum of Art, etc. Having experienced two types of rooms at the hotel, I can recommend the junior suites in the main part of the hotel. The room is very spacious and lovely. The superior garden king room is considerably smaller and looks tired; not up to the standards of a 5 star hotel. The breakfast is wonderful with many choices.",4,2013,07,06
200,Among the very best,"We were hesitant to book at this hotel because it looked formal and a bit stuffy when viewed on the Web.  Not so.  The Merrion Hotel offers a world-class experience with the warmth of Irish hospitality.  The location, service, and facilities are probably the best in Dublin, and this obviously costs a bit.  But the overall experience is well worth the price considering the prime location in a major city.

The associated restaurant (Patrick Guilbaud) is the best in Dublin according to Michelin, and we certainly weren't disappointed.  However, the ""art tea"", served in the hotel's drawing rooms, is an experience that can't be duplicated elsewhere.",5,2013,07,06
200,4 star hotel,"A very cosy hotel. Staff is friendly. Hotel is equipped with a bar, a fusion restaurant, swimming pool and gym facilities. They even allow adding an extra bed per night only for 20 euro per night because i booked a 2 person room for 5 nights but there were 3 of us in first 2 night.",4,2013,07,05
200,High end class!,"I stayed a week at the Merrion for a work trip in March 2013.  I'll be honest, this would be out of my price range for a personal trip so it was quite the treat to stay here for business travel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especailly when giving directions and recommendations for getting around.  I absolutely loved the bathrooms and all of the amenities!!  I had dinner downstairs in the restaurant bar one night and it was excellent, espcially dessert!",5,2013,07,05
200,three for two,"Spent three nights here, a couple of weeks ago. Pretty swell, all in all. The staff, housekeeping all the way up to the concierges, a dedicated group. Half the Irish Open golf contingent was arriving as we left, as was German Chancellor Merkel, so they see to every need of the upper crust in the normal course of business. Excellent location, across from St. Stephens park, and Merrion Square. Best of all, they have a three nights for the price of two policy, good year round. I wouldn't hesitate to return.",5,2013,07,05
200,Fantastic hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Merrion during our time in Dublin on a recent trip to Ireland. It is absolutely first rate, one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in anywhere. The location is excellent, just a short walk from attractions such as Trinity College, St. Stephens Green, and the shops on Grafton Street. Our room was spacious and well-appointed with a queen bed, TV, and free wifi. The bathroom was amazing by typical hotel standards, beautifully outfitted with separate tub and shower. We had a daily breakfast included at the hotel's Cellar Restaurant, which featured a very good continental buffet and a full traditional Irish breakfast. Our only minor quibble was that the restaurant didn't seem to have quite enough capacity to handle all of the demand on a couple of the mornings that we were there -- maybe there was just an unusually heavy rush on those days. We ate out for lunch and dinner, so I can't comment on the in-house restaurants, but they have a good reputation. What really makes the Merrion stand out is the people and the level of service. The staff go out of their way to make sure your needs are met, and they are unfailingly friendly and helpful. You will not find a better place.",5,2013,07,05
200,Amazing,"I stayed here as a treat for my mothers birthday. This hotel is amazing. The staff are so professional and helpful. We had a dinner in the caller restaurant all the food was really well cooked and presented, beautiful lobby's, big old fire places and so much style. 

Expensive but so worth it",5,2013,07,05
200,Amazing staff - everything is just top notch!,"I spent a few days in Dublin and stayed at the Merrion and have to say it is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  Being I travel quite a bit, I was quite impressed with the how accommodating and friendly the staff is to the guests.  The location is great, walking distance to the shops, restaurants and bars.  The rooms are nice with a very spacious bathroom.  Big kudos to the staff serving drinks and tea - they are simply the warmest and engaging group! Highly recommend this hotel to those traveling to Dublin!",5,2013,07,04
200,excellent experience,"Eventho our stay was short it was very memorable and we had a great time being very well looked after on our trip to Ireland. Staff were extremely helpfull, rooms very nice and quite and food amazing!!  Thank you very much we will come back for sure!",5,2013,07,03
200,Best hotel in Ireland - maybe anywhere!,"My wife and I spent a week in Ireland, and I decided to splurge a bit on a few nights at the Merrion Hotel.  This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in!  Classic beauty and charm.  Fantastic location, across from the Parliament Building and just a block or two from some of the most famous bars and restaurants in Dublin.  We arrived jet lagged from a miserable flight from the States, but the Merrion worked hard to get us in our room early and make us comfortable while we waited.  We had food in our room, the bar and the Cellar Restaurant (the Michelin-starred Patrick Guilbaud was out of our price range), and all of our meals were wonderful.  We'd like to return sometime in the future and try their afternoon Art Tea, with all of their sandwiches and desserts specially created and inspired by the outstanding art collection at the hotel.  Comfort, convenience, and restful quiet - definitely worth the extra cost.  We loved it!",5,2013,06,30
200,Fantastic!!!,"I've been lucky enough to stay here many times and it is always superb. The rooms are bright and relaxing, the beds very comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful.

The Cellar Bar and Restaurant are both fantastic with excellent food and drink, including expertly mixed cocktails.

The spa treatments, according to my wife, are splendid and the pool is perfect.

I can't praise this hotel highly enough and am looking forward to my next visit already!!!",5,2013,06,27
200,Above and WAY Beyond...,"Twenty-five family members spent a memorable week at the Merrion from June 8th until June 15th. The service and ambiance were first class and having been there 5 years ago, the place only gets better with age.
I want to point out and acknowledge one individual who works at the Merrion that I didn't even meet until I got back home to New Jersey.
When our plane touched down in Atlantic City concluding a remarkable family reunion in Dublin, my luggage wasn't there. Calls by the pilot back to the airport in Dublin were fruitless. The bag was not at the airport, not on the bus that took us there and not left in the lobby back at the Merrion. Enter Merrion Concierge, Sean Lally.
Sean phoned me 4 times over the weekend, he was as determined to find my bag as I was; he even reviewed video tapes and found me handing the bag to another concierge and him placing it on the bus. A further search of the bus found the bag in an area away from where other bags were placed. Sean phoned me on Sunday morning with the good news and assured me the bag would be mailed out to my home, immediately. It arrived safely on Wednesday.
It's this kind of service that sets the Merrion apart from other hotels, not just in Ireland, but all over the world. It's the Sean Lally's who take such pride in their vocation that they continue to provide the ultimate in customer service even when the customer is no longer a guest.
Thank you, Sean, for your professional and caring attitude.

200,can't wait to return,"This was our first trip to Ireland (mid to late May 2013) and it would be impossible for the hotel to make our trip any better.  We spent a week at the Merrion and they did everything to make this the most enjoyable vacation we have ever had.  From the monent we arrived with the greeting at the door, the grereting at the front desk, to the immediate availability of the room and to the staff at every level (housekeeping, staff in the Cellar Restaurant for breakfast and dinner, staff in Bar 27 and Cellar Bar), it was the most accommodating hotel in which we have stayed.  It is within walking distance of all major tourist araes and attractions (museums, restaurants, Trinity College, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, etc.).  Our balcony overlooked the garden with a view of James Joyce every morning.  The breakfast is suitable for anyone from those looking for a full Irish breakfast to those just looking for fruit or a bowl of cereal.  The meals were excellent from full evening dinners in the Cellar Restaurant, pub food in the Cellar Bar and elegant meals in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud which is attached to the hotel.  this is a 5 star hotel in every respect and we cannot wait to return.",5,2013,06,23
200,Outstanding in every way!,"Arrived from Atlanta after a delayed flight and was exhausted. Our room wasn't ready so they upgraded us to a deluxe King room.
The staff were all outstanding and attentive to our every need. The room was beautiful and quiet. The bed comfy. A great place to adjust to a long travel day. The pool was great and the breakfast heavenly. My only regret is we only had one night here before hitting the countryside.",5,2013,06,23
200,First rate hotel experience,"This was  our first visit to Dublin. Our impression of this beautiful city and
notably The Merrion Hotel was amazing.  We loved the comfortable drawing rooms,beautiful and functional bedroom/bathroom, and magnificent artwork displayed throughout the hotel. Our balcony window overlooked the sculpture garden with
James Joyce in prominent view.All the staff were most welcoming,kind and genuinely interested in our welfare:from the doormen , to reception,to the servers in the tearooms and in both bars.It was hands down the best hotel experience we have ever had.The location is central and perfect to access parks,hop on hop off bus,shopping,and excellent restaurants.

200,Old fashioned style and service,"Within walking distance of main tourist areas and surrounded by cafes, pubs and convenience stores. Walking distance from Aircoach stops  Dawson Street and Trinity College.
 The bedroom was nicely furnished but rather tired furniture and carpets , did not have tea/coffee making facilities, you have to ring down to reception and they bring you a tray. Huge marble bathroom and lovely luxury toiletries, again tired . Fab pool and spa area including steam room.
 The staff everywhere were exceptionally helpful and polite,public lounges were tastefully decorated, but on the Saturday afternoon were full of afternoon tea bookings, so there was no where for residents to sit. Thought the price tag of £260 (room only ) was expensive . I did mention the tired room on checkout and was told they are part way through a refurb, and our room was yet to be done and to be fair the hotel did give me a partial refund which was much appreciated. I look forward to staying again in the future but in a refurbished room. It was good to see and experience service how it should be and recommend you stay !",4,2013,06,21
200,Old World Charm!,"Our recent stay at the Merrion was wonderful.  From the moment we walked in the door until our departure we were amazed with the excellent detail to service. Kudos to the entire staff for a job well done.
It's nice to see that a 5 star hotel follows through from beginning to end.  We look forward to a future stay at the Merrion Hotel.
Thank you!",5,2013,06,20
200,Did not want to leave.,"To list all I loved about The Merrion would take pages.  Simply put it is perfection. Everyone was friendly and so helpful nothing was too much trouble.  Special shout out to the helpful and very funny doormen!  The public rooms are so beautiful and comfortable and the turf fire was a nice touch.  The bed was heaven on earth and the pool was so nice after a busy day of walking all over Dublin. 
I loved having drinks outside and strolling in the garden in the evenings so peaceful.  When I returned home there was a letter from the General Manager thanking me for choosing The Merrion no hotel has ever done that before. Thank you Merrion staff for an amazing visit.",5,2013,06,19
200,Go to the Merrion Hotel,"We just spent 2 nights in the Merrion Hotel in Dublin, having come all the way from Dun Laoghaire.  It was a lovely experience being a tourist in our own city, but the highlight was the hotel itself. Truly five star, excellent staff, food, room and general surroundings, afternoon tea etc. A luxury treatment in the Tethra Spa was an added bonus - excellent therapists, great pool & steam room. I didn't go into the gym (not relaxing!) but it seemed to have lots of equipment if that's your thing. I strongly recommend it.  We were in the old part of the hotel, but I'm sure the garden wing is lovely too.  Oh, and have a good look at the art collection while you're there.",5,2013,06,19
200,Irish Gentility; Service Above Board!,"My husband and I love this hotel.  It makes us feel very content.  This time especially because my husband obtained a serious health issue when we deplaned in Dublin from the USA.  The house doctor arrived within 15 min of our call.  Very qualified doctor and prescribed meds that helped my husband through the 10 day trip. The Merrion service is superb.  Reception and Concierge are accommodating, efficient and spot on.  Management is hands on as well.  I truly feel that this hotel offers the most genteel and superb service and accommodations that no other 5 star can compare.  Quite an extraordinary place. And the location is most convenient to the heart of Dublin.  Everything is within walking distance.",5,2013,06,17
200,The best hotel in Dublin.........no buts!!!,"We have stayed here four times now and loved it more and more each time!  What brings us back you ask??  Everything!!  From the rooms, to the service, to the aroma of the peat in the multiple fireplaces, to the wait staff just waiting to be called upon, to the delicious food, to the beautiful building......I could go on and on!!  Don't miss this place, you'll be so happy you won't want to leave!!",5,2013,06,17
200,Absolutely fabulous!,Perfect location. The 2 Patrick's  at the concierge desk were invaluable - helpful in everyway from getting us to the ATM to a our traIn tickets to our hotel in Galway. Execeptional dinner in the Cellar. Top notch in everyway. Thank you!,5,2013,06,16
200,Special,This hotel is real luxury we only stayed one night but it truly was fab and made our Wedding Anniversary one to remember.  As the hotel is situated on the outskirts of St Stephens Green its an easy walk through to Grafton Street but  sitting relaxing in the beautiful gardens of the hotel its hard to believe you're in the middle of Dublin and the hustle and bustle of the busiest shopping area in the city.  Its simply wonderful.,5,2013,06,13
200,The finest hotel anywhere,"The Merrion is absolutely fantastic in every way. I just returned from my third stay there and I am more impressed with each visit. The service is flawless, and I mean flawless. The rooms are quite spacious and are beautiful. The gardens are incredible. It is such an amazing value.

So many thanks to the wonderful staff who went out of their way to make our stay so fabulous. Tommy at the front door is a national treasure. I wish I could recall the names of each and every one of you because you are so special.",5,2013,06,13
200,"High end hotel … but not for me, sorry.","Let me begin my review by putting my rating in context – I would’ve been inclined to offer a further half star rating if this was available. My husband thinks the hotel deserves more. As with every review it is subjective.

There are a number of factors which affected the quality of my stay and these are the reasons why I am marking the Merrion down. However I always endeavour to provide a balanced review and have listed some positives attributes in addition, to enable you to make an informed choice.

Firstly – the negatives.
1.	Room temperature. We were blessed with blue skies and temperatures sitting in the early 20’s during our stay, and am certain that the room temperature would have been ideal over a cooler period. On the first night we used the air con, and found this did little to alleviate the heat. The unit was also incredibly noisy. We then requested a freestanding cooling fan for our room, which was delivered promptly. On the second and subsequent nights we used this and opened the windows. This was better but still greatly impacted on our sleep quality.
2.	Each morning we were awoken by the sound of doors banging shut from other rooms along our corridor. This problem would be eradicated if the doors were fitted with a soft hinge function, and would greatly reduce noise.
3.	Vegetarian dining at the cellar bar resturant. The two options of soup or salad are uninspiring. Further consideration of vegetarian dining would have been appreciated.
4.	Stairs. The lifts project a very opulent image, the stairs are less aesthetically pleasing. Some guests prefer to use the stairs and some tender loving care in this area of the hotel would make them more visually appealing and in keeping with the rest of the hotel, as opposed to being starkly functional. 
5.	Gardens. The gardens are immaculately kept and a credit to the hotel. However, given the nice weather we were often frustrated that the rear section was cordoned off for functions.
6.	Toilet brush. Some 5*hotels provide them, most don’t. Personally I do not feel comfortable leaving this for housekeeping to address.
7.	Although I was decently dressed in casual attire I did feel as though I was being judged by some of the guests and therefore did not feel comfortable spending much time in the public areas of the hotel. There was an air of pretention.

Secondly - the positives –
1.	The room was spotlessly clean, as was the Merrion. You will not fault the standard of cleanliness.
2.	Professional and courteous customer service.
3.	Good central location – a 5minute walk from Grafton Street, Saint Stephen’s Green, City Bus Tours etc. In short – all amenities that you would require for a city break.
4.	Wonderful indoor 18m pool and steam room. Well worth a visit! Would recommend.
5.	Beautifully tended grounds.
6.	Complimentary water provided in room daily.
7.	Bowls of apples dotted around the vicinity. Nice thoughtful touch.",3,2013,06,10
200,Great Family Trip,Hotel was wonderful to me and my kids. Could not have done more to help with any request my family had. I loved the afternoon tea and my kids loved the front door man who was always happy to see them and help out. Very good area and easy to walk into city center.,4,2013,06,09
200,Memorable,"It is hard to fault this hotel. The location opposite the Parliament a few hundred yards from St Stephen's Green and Grafton St is hard to beat.

But it's the sheer luxury of the place that makes it truly 5 star.

We only stayed for 2 nights but so glad we did. The big chunky sofas in the lobby area are a great place to hang out and the staff whilst very efficient are not at all intrusive.

We were lucky that the weather was warm and sunny and we had the chance to eat in the courtyard garden, a rare opportunity in most hotels.

My favorite part was the little bar in the front, lovely selection of single malt whiskies.",5,2013,06,09
200,Disappointing,"This hotel is far more expensive than many alternatives. The room was comfortable and the staff repeatedly welcomed you and asked if there was anything they could do. Unfortunately whenever we did ask for something it was too difficult. For example:
-we paid 500 euro for a meal in Patrick Guilgaud but the staff refused to say what was in the degustation menu so we could make an informed decision between it and the al a carte menu.
- we tried to book a high tea and were told by staff that high teas were booked out two weeks in advance.
We won't be staying again and wouldn't recommend this hotel.",3,2013,06,09
200,A memorable afternoon tea that will stay with me,"Had an afternoon artist high tea with my mum here. Great rooms and furnishings, roaring fire, impeccable and yet personal service, delicious sweets and savouries, easy central location to walk to, and overall good value given how fabulous the whole afternoon was. I will never forget it!",5,2013,06,08
200,Supreme in all aspects ...,"A delightful hotel , responsive staff , great location , divine rooms , fine fare .... this has it all and a lot more , the chic factor , ....so few find it , the merrion does , would make this no 1 in dublin , it has show but it has more  substance .... four seasons staff should visit ....do not miss this though take good credit card as comes at a price , though who cares when the memories are so strong ... and lasting , thank you all",5,2013,06,07
200,Lovely Stay,"We enjoyed our two night stay. It was a bank holiday weekend, however, the hotel is an oasis of calm. The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated. Our large room was on the first floor with a view of the gardens. It was very quiet. What has been said previously about the staff is true. They are, for the most part (see below), helpful and professional. The first evening I order a drink with dessert in the Cellar Bar and when the manager learned I did not care for the drink, he brought me something he thought I would prefer at no cost. The last evening of our trip we dined at The Cellar and truly enjoyed our experience.

Our only quibbles are the lack of coffee/tea facilities in the room, or the offer of those at no cost in the lobby or bar in the morning. It would have been a nice touch. The other is the minibar service. As often happens they came to refill the minibar on the second day and had a list of items they said we consumed. We had not and informed them. The woman thought she had serviced the minibar before we checked in but couldn't remember. Please be accurate on this as it always embarrassing to have to argue about items the previous guest obviously took after they checked out. The last night the turn down service knocked on our door just as we were about to leave for dinner. I told her ""five minutes"". She handed me a piece of paper and never returned. Five minutes after we returned two hours later, (We put the ""do not disturb"" sign out because she was still in the hallway.) she put another note under the door saying ""please call when you are ready for turndown service"". Well, we were ready for the last two hours!",4,2013,06,07
200,Nice but Uptight,"We were really excited to book this hotel for our last night during our honeymoon.  The service is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel in that there are many bellmen to help get you and your luggage to your room, great furnishings and nice little perks like slippers in your room.  What disappointed both of us was the front desk.  We discussed how we were so excited to be spending this night with them and they could have cared less.  Other places (in which we spent significantly less) made sure our stay was wonderful with courteous staff and personable conversation.  Just because you spend more does not mean you get more.  We both wished we had spent our last honeymoon night somewhere else.",3,2013,06,06
200,"A world away, close to home","This hotel is definitely a treat for us, even though it's only a few miles from home.  Having stayed there on our wedding night, we just couldn't resist returning for our anniversary.

At the Merrion is that everything is done properly.  The rooms are immaculate, the artworks original, the tea service silver and polished to a shine, and the staff are friendly, yet courteous to a fault.

Having worked for many years in hotels, I often find myself having a bit of a busman's holiday and watching the staff when I should be relaxing.   It is refreshing to stay somewhere that has service of such a high standard, that even an old insider like myself can manage to switch off and not be distracted by staff comings and goings.

It takes an enthusiastic army to maintain composure and run such a quality establishment, and that doesn't come cheap.  The Merrion may be expensive, but for what you get, it is excellent value.",5,2013,06,06
200,A wonderful Accident,"After reading the reviews of Trip Advisor for two hotels in Dublin,decided on the ""other""one.
Fortunately for us our dates could not be accommodated.We would have missed an experience of a lifetime.Front desk reception is so important and Magdalena S.did not disappoint.She addressed our concerns and reassured us convincingly.The beauty and proximity of the hotel to everything has been addressed before,however the impressive staff from the doormen,concierge and anyone else you come in contact with are there only to make your stay memorable.They truly succeed.
Treat yourself,experience Patrick Guilbaud's award winning restaurant,you won't regret it.
Dublin is on our ""return""list.We have already chosen the hotel!!!",5,2013,06,05
200,Very comfortable,"A great hotel, and we enjoyed our stay very much, but the reason I haven't given the full 5 rating is that the room was too hot (and the aircon didn't work well enough to cool it).

Gym was good but not excellent.  The rowing machine could do with a service.",4,2013,06,03
200,A fantastic hotel in the heart of Dublin,"From the moment you check in to check out you are treated like royalty. This wonderful hotel decorated in a fashion that allows you to experience the luxuries of times gone by.
We stayed for the just the one night and wish it could have been longer to make better use of all the hotel has to offer. We also got a deal of 150 euro for 2 people B&B Sunday night only which was great value when you consider the amazing spread they put on for breakfast. 
the only flaw was the sheets were old and in need of replacement which was disappointing and surprising in such a classy hotel.",5,2013,06,01
200,"Nice hotel, not our style though","Lovely hotel but a bit on the elitist side for my taste. The staff were quite nice and helpful...but I felt the hotel and it's guests to be a bit pretentious ... I presume to justify the high cost of staying there.  The restaurants in the hotel are also pricey.  I just did not get the sense of being in Dublin that I had hoped to get.  In the future, I will stay closer to the actual center.  We simply felt out of place at the Merrion....although it is a nice hotel. Sizable rooms for a European hotel, large bathrooms, hair dryer, coffee/tea supplies in room, etc. were all nice but the hotel was too hushed, too rich for our style.",4,2013,06,01
200,A true 5 star hotel,"The hotel is just about perfect.  The location is ideal, right in the center of the city and easy to access anything.  The service was beyond belief extraordinary - anything you want, any time, no problem.  

   Actually it is hard to write a review other then to say if you want the best in Dublin this is it.",5,2013,05,31
200,A 5 star experience from start to finish.,"We had booked the hotel as a special treat to mark a significant birthday. We stayed on the ""Dream and Dine"" package, what excellent value and superb staff. The Cellar Restaurant is excellent. We can't wait to go back. ",5,2013,05,29
200,Old world elegance,"If you are looking for a sleek ultra modern hotel, then the Merrion is not for you.  But if you want old world elegance with all the comforts of a sleek modern hotel, then the Merrion is for you.  Staying at the Merrion is like moving into someone's home for a few days.  There is always a fire burning in the fireplace with the smell of peat filling the air.  The rooms have all the comforts you would expect and mine was very quiet.  The bathroom was again spacious and well appointed.

But the one thing that truly sets the Merrion apart from other hotels I have stayed in is the staff.  The staff are always there if you need them but never in your way.  Always on hand to help and recommend.  Super friendly always.  The bar staff assisted me in learning about Irish Whiskey and actually seemed to enjoy doing so.

I would also recommend the Cellar restaurant and the Cellar Bar.  Breakfast was excellent and again very pleasant staff.

I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2013,05,29
200,Simply the best,"The Merrion Hotel is a rare treat for us.  It is without doubt the No 1 hotel in Dublin - every aspect of this hotel is exceptional and faultless. The atmosphere is of understated elegance throughout. The bedroom and bathroom were luxurious; my husband said the bed was so big, it was like we in different countries! We had a wonderful stay and we hope to return someday.",5,2013,05,29
200,tranquility in the heart of Dublin,"beautiful old building steeped in history with tea rooms and lounges whispering of times gone by. Perfect retreat after a long day exploring the fabulous city, free wi fi and coffee, Live music playing every evening in local pubs, no need for a car easy walking to shops restaurants etc. Tour on open top bus to really learn the local history",5,2013,05,28
200,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,"We spent 2 nights in the Merrion in April...It is centrally located and not far from their Parliament.
The staff are absolutely the best; always there for you and willing to help in any way.  They go out of their way to make you feel at home.
The Hotel itself is beautiful....tastefully decorated, a lovely setting room for tea with an inviting fireplace.  The rooms are lovely; beds are so comfortable.
The restaurant there was excellent and the service very accomodating and helpful in case you weren't sure of what you were ordering!",5,2013,05,28
200,Loved it!!,"Stayed at The Merrion Hotel in October, and it was fantastic!  Service was amazing and everyone made me feel very welcome.  The room was great, very spacious.  I stayed in a deluxe room at the Main House, and it was quite spacious, with a nice sitting area.  I took advantage of the Cellar Bar downstairs, which was great and the menu had quite a lot of variety.  The Drawing Room was quite nice as well, and enjoyed some nice drinks there :)  The hotel was well located and I could walk to everything - including a rugby game at Aviva Stadium.  Great hotel and recommend it to everyone staying in Dublin.",5,2013,05,28
200,"Centrally Located, Nice rooms and Great service","The Merrion Hotel located in the center of Dublin is a grand old structure. Though the entrance to the hotel is relatively small and uneventful, The rooms are nice and big and gives you a feeling of space. It has a 24 hour bar which is very convenient and the staff is very warm and helpful, one can enjoy from Irish beers to nice whisky and malts. The Concierge was particularly very helpful and suggested some great Indian vegetarian restaurants around Dublin.",4,2013,05,28
200,Excellent,"I stayed at the Merrion hotel for the first time and this will be my hotel of choice in the future.
I could not fault a single thing, from check in to check out. Lovely comfortable bright rooms, excellent freshly cooked breakfast,( no buffet of tired bacon and sausages or overcooked scrambled egg) and service with a smile. You felt nothing was too much for the excellent staff.
There is also lovely garden where you can have meals, weather permitting.
The location is  perfect, minutes from Stephen's green.",5,2013,05,28
200,Garden Wing no View,"A lovely hotel if a bit expensive,but the garden wing room we booked had a view of a side street and a brick wall not the garden as expected.  The garden when we walked through it was lovely but we could not see it from our room.",4,2013,05,28
200,Rated #1 - No Surprise,"I only had lunch in this hotel recently - it deserves a review just on that alone.  

The service and food was just excellent and very friendly.  Will certainly go back and I look forward to it.

It is a treat to have lunch in such a lovely place and to feel comfortable - not a 'stuffy' feel.  Little on the expensive side but to be expected I guess.

Just one little piece of feedback for my next visit please .... please have PIMMS (was surprised for the hotel rating that you did not have it)

Thank you to the friendly staff - lovely experience",5,2013,05,27
200,Oasis in the City,"We stayed at the Merrion for the Heineken Cup Final and found it a beautiful, luxurious hotel that was in a quiet area and an oasis in a bustling City.
From the minute we stepped out of our taxi and the friendly doorman greeted us, the service was second to none with all staff who we came into contact with using our name and treating us as welcome guests and not a disturbance to their day.  Nothing was too much trouble for them to help us enjoy our stay. 
Our room was beautiful (king size superior in the Garden wing) and had everything one could need - including a magnificent bed where we had 3 wonderful nights of peaceful, totally comfortable sleep. 
Reference has been made to the hotel being busy at breakfast - of course it was, it was full and on this type of weekend one expects to have to wait.  Our (rather clever) idea was to take breakfast in our room which arrived on a big trolley and was set up unobtrusively by the charming waiter into a delightful table where everything was exactly as it would be in the restaurant.  Hot food was contained in a hot cupboard and was perfect - a tip to share if you visit again!   We were then able to spend a relaxing late-ish morning in the room and had no hassle whatsoever before we went exploring the City. 
We would have no hesitation in recommending the Merrion to anyone - it is a tranquil, elegant beautifully appointed oasis in the city of Dublin and worth every penny we paid for our 3 night stay.   A big thank you again to the management and staff - we will be back so don't change a thing!!",5,2013,05,27
200,Truly Worthy of Five Stars,"We have traveled extensively and stayed at many five star hotels, but this one truly merits its five stars. What makes such a hotel special is its level of service and the Merrion Hotel has truly extraordinary service. From the check in where they make you feel special, to taking you to your room on arrival we knew we were in for a great stay. We booked a room on the third floor overlooking the gardens, it was a great view and very quiet. We took advantage of the hotel facilities, eating breakfast in the living room in front of the fire, where you could spend hours just relaxing with tea or coffee. They also have a nice tea service there later in the day. We ate at the Cellar which was quite nice for dinner. The spa was also convenient with a very nice large swimming pool. But the truly memorable addition to this hotel is its bar, which is open 24 hours a day and serves everything from signature cocktails to fine Irish whiskey. The service at the bar was better than just about anywhere we have been, with Stuart and Conner in particular educating us about the history of Irish whiskey. The bar alone is worth a stop and many locals come by after work, when the bar can get quite busy. The location is also convenient, near to several fine restaurants (try Uncorn and Matt the Thresher and Hugos) and a short walk to Grafton Street with its pedestrian mall and many shops. Overall this hotel ranks among the best I have ever stayed at in Europe or the Us.",5,2013,05,27
200,The perfect experience!,"From the moment we arrived at this hotel after a lengthy flight the professionalism of staff and the wonderful heritage building was a knockout.  After flying for 21 hours the front reception staff ensured we were able to access our room (285) early and promptly.  The room we had is large, comfortable, clean and quiet over looking a beautiful court yard.  The room decor and furnishings are excellent, heavy drapes blocking light, a large king size bed that was so comfortable and the bathroom being a good size and everything in it, bath, shower, illuminated makeup mirror for my wife, heated towel rails and large plush bath sheets.  There is well stocked minibar, safe and large tv to compliment a lovely room.  The gymnasium is the best gym I have found in a hotel, treadmills, numerous workout machines and a large selection of free weights.  The location of this hotel is 10 minutes walk from the Temple Bar area and is free of the music and humdrum that abounds in most areas closer to Temple Bar.  Our stay was thoroughly enjoyed and will return again.  Well done to management and staff!",5,2013,05,25
200,Dublin's best hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion Hotel during the weekend of the Amlin-Heineken Cup. My sister always stays here when in Dublin, so the hotel came highly recommended. The location is excellent as it's only a short walk from the heart of the city and it's also very close to some good restaurants. From the moment I booked, I found the hotel staff very attentive and customer service focused. As it was a busy weekend, the hotel didn't have a superior king room available, but Attila in reservations kept in contact with me and assured me the week before we were due to arrive that we would be looked after. The hotel then upgraded us to a junior suite in the original building. The room was absolutely fabulous, with high ornate ceilings, a super king bed and a living room area overlooking leinster house. The door porters gave us a very nice Irish welcome, parked the car and took our luggage up to the room, which was a very nice touch. The girl on reception was excellent also with a very friendly manner, and she brought us up to our room on arrival. We then received some fresh cherries and creme brulee to our room as a welcome to the hotel. Dublin's best shopping street is only a few minutes walk away, so I enjoyed some afternoon shopping. I also tried the swimming pool and this hotel has the clearest water I have ever experienced, which made it really enjoyable. I also had a fresh glass of orange juice afterwards, which was another nice touch. The only slight disappointment of the weekend was the cellar bar restaurant. We had booked a table for 3 so as we wouldn't have to leave the hotel. However, the main course prices were quite high (€42 for black sole and €29 for rack of lamb), and this didn't include potatoe and vegetables or salad. We often eat in 5* hotels, and we found these prices very high for just the meat and a small portion of spinach. The rack of lamb was also very disappointing. It was just one piece of meat with 1 bone, instead of a rack. It was quite condense and tough, and a little salty, instead of being a tender and juicy rack. I didn't want to complain because we were treating a relative to dinner and I didn't want to ruin the atmosphere at the time. Also I found the house sauvignon quite sharp and acidic, instead of being soft and slightly fruity. I would definitely recommend that the hotel replace this wine. I had 2 glasses during my stay and I couldn't drink the second. We returned to the cellar bar restaurant the next morning for breakfast and this was one of the best breakfast meals I have enjoyed. The selection of fruit, yogurts and fresh pastries was simply gorgeous, along with a traditional Irish breakfast. Once again, each member of staff that we encountered was excellent, friendly and courteous at all times. We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Merrion hotel and we will definitely return to stay in this hotel. If you are considering somewhere to stay in Dublin, this is definitely the right place.",5,2013,05,25
200,Best Hotel in Ireland,"The Merrion Hotel is centrally located in the heart of Georgian Dublin a few blocks away the cultural attractions, business and shopping districts.  A vast number of restaurant options are available within the hotel and in the area itself.  The hotel matches history and the modern world, where you are as likely to enjoy afternoon tea as you would a business meeting.",5,2013,05,24
200,Very nice hotel and good location,"Our stay at the Merrion was very nice.  The room was spacious and clean.  We ate dinner and breakfast there, both of which were very good.  The lobby and buildings themselves were sophisticated and the patio garden was lovely.  Overall, everything you would expect from a top tier hotel.  Nothing extraordinary or surprising, but everything expected for the price.

The staff overall was very helpful and gracious, with one exception.  We were given a sigh and a little bit of a hard time about taking advantage of our late check out.

I would stay at the Merrion again.",4,2013,05,22
200,Love this Hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion for 3 days in May. It was lovely. Location (1/2 a block from St. Stephen's Green), superb staff, beautiful and beautifully maintained property...couldn't be better.
Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2013,05,22
200,Four and a half stars really - but benefit of doubt given!,"Stayed here for 4 nights over the Amlin-Heineken Cup Final weekend as it is our long weekend away with friends and away from the kids. We have a once a year ""blow out"" - so we had high hopes. Generally, all very, very good. One small fly in the ointment.

It is the little things that make a good hotel a great hotel. Conversely it is the little things that make a great hotel a mediocre hotel. There are plenty of positives.

- The location is great. 5 mins walk into town but on a quietish street. We had no road noise/crowd noise which is nice for a city centre location. Also, the tour busses stop 50 yards away which is good if you buy a hop-on/hop-off tour pass.
- The little touches were nice e.g. the bags are taken form the car and magically appear in the room,  the receptionist took you through check in and personally showed you around, nice bathroom with light-in shaving mirror, (girls - you don't need to take a hair-dryer as they have stand alone hair-dryers), really friendly & professional staff, pool/sauna small but more than adequate, gym looked good as walked by, fresh slippers delivered every night (cashmere bedsocks available on request), fresh bottled water every day, every night we had not only water for the room but a bucket of ice and his-and-hers bedside water, clothes are all folded up and put away, spotless, comfy bed, great night sleep (apart from the rugby late nights but cannot blame the hotel for that), fresh pots of coffee brought without asking at breakfast, freshly squeezed juice brought and replenished without asking etc.
- The breakfast was very good with a great selection. Just ask for any extra sausage, bacon, eggs, balck pud etc - not a problem. 
- One example of the extra effort & service. I had some cheese for breakfast and it blew me away. Fantastic! Red rind but like a cheddar-come-parmesan. I asked what it was. Anna, our waitress, not only found out what is was called (Coolattin Cheddar - absolutely wonderful if you are interested) but also managed to speak to Concierge and find out the name, address and telephone number of the local cheesemonger and directions from the hotel. That summed up the service. 

- The only downside (a minus 0.75 stars) was Saturday breakfast. We had a note through the door to say that weekend breakfast is busy between 10.00-11.00. OK, I would have thought more staff to help would sort out the problem. But we had to wait 5-10 minutes at the restaurant to get a table. A big queue. Then, most of the continental breakfast needed replacing and a lot of items had disappeared completely. Staff were working flat out and it showed. Spoons missing, eggshells in the fried eggs (the next table sent their back, we cruched away), not the level of attention you expected or were used to - there were spare tables but not the people getting them ready or re-stocking the help-yourself items until asked. Someone needs to resolve the matter, not just slip a note under the door saying it is busy (it wasn't even that busy to be honest).

So, is it fair to finish on a negative. No. Absolutely not. Would we stay there again....more than likely.

- Sun Transfers from airport to hotel and return were really good, would recommend - spot on time and reliable.
- Get the DART 10 mins down the road to Howth for fantastic fishing village and seafood.",5,2013,05,20
200,"Fabulous place, really enjoyed the top notch service","We have Irish roots, and wanted to spend a long weekend just visiting Dublin.  We chose The Merrion over The Shelbourne, after some long TripAdvisor research.  Here are our comments after the real life experience.

The Merrion is well situated, similar to The Shelbourne, but The Merrion is very quiet and relaxing.  We often ended our day with a glass of wine in one of the living rooms by a fireplace.  The Shelbourne has a bustling ambiance.

We chose the old part of the hotel, and I can verify other contributors that is likely not worth the extra 20% or so.  The newer addition is so well done, it's almost seemless.

The great service is representative of the Irish.  We eventually relaxed so much: sleeping in and eating a late breakfast.  Highly recommend The Merrion in Dubin!",5,2013,05,19
200,Top notch hotel in all aspects,"A weekend in Dublin, hotel booked a long time in advance, we expected a lot, it more than delivered. This is a quite superb hotel from start to finish. Initial greeting by liveried doormen, very friendly check in, rooms well furnished and equipped, with space to relax. At all times the staff were friendly and keen to assist. Service of food and drink  throughout the day in the lounge. Breakfast in the cellar bar about as good as it gets, very fresh ingredients, very wide selection. Gym is small, but contains all the equipment one needs. There is also a pool. Oh that all hotels were as good as this. This is not a cheap stay, but the value for what we paid was excellent.",5,2013,05,19
200,Absolutely the right choice,"I cannot rate The Merrion highly enough. Booked a one night seven star steal package (includes dinner at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud) for my husband's thirtieth. When we booked in we were told we had been upgraded to a suite - which was absolutely gorgeous and bigger than our flat. Champagne arrived shortly thereafter together with a lovely little cake with a happy birthday message, a very nice touch. We did a bit of sight seeing (including a trip to the queen of tarts cafe which was recommended by a member of staff - definitely worth a visit). 

We tried out the pool and steam room which was a great way to relax before dinner. The surprise four course tasting menu was divine and the wine list reasonably priced for a two star restaurant. Afterwards we enjoyed a drink at the cellar bar which was a great end to the evening. 

The bed was very comfortable, and huge. Breakfast the next morning in our suite was opulent, and after checking out we took a tour around the hotel and garden to see the artwork dotted about - armed with a helpful book on what we were looking at which was supplied by reception.

We could not fault The Merrion in any way. The staff are all superb and we left feeling completely pampered and very happy. Incredible value for money considering what the deal included. Would definitely go again!!!",5,2013,05,19
200,Burst bubble,"Myself and a pal went for art afternoon tea and I was sooooo dissapointed egg roll, beef finger sandwich, cucumber finger sandwich salmon on brown bread.. Sounds ok!!! But none of the above had any taste whatsoever. They were pre-made and left in the fridge without being covered so the top of the bread was hard.They all were on shop bought pan white or brown bread no imagination at all....not the standard I expected from the merrion at all because I do love it. Then came what I thought would be the wow factor 3 pre choosen cakes!!!! (none of which I would of picked myself)...... One very fruity, wet, overcoloured sponge..... One over geletined rassberry tart and an apple macaroon (which I would consider a biscuit) not impressed one bit.....in fact just a taste of each left alot to be desired...so much so I left them!!!!! The tea pot was also was also left on another table so we couldn't help ourselves so it constantly went cold and then almost felt bad asking it to be refilled..... 72 euro for 2 people is not cheap and the least I expected was fresh bread hot tea. So I'm not giving 5 stars to the Merrion for this ""low tea"". ",3,2013,05,17
200,heavenly,"This is a magical quiet low key elegant  hotel beautifully serene and beautiful.  Set  in a stunning location central to everything. It is quite unique, Dublins version of The  Connaught, Claridges of London or indeed, The Carlisle in New York .  Unlike its flamboyant competitors in the city, there are no buses whizzing past,  people wanting to be seen. Famous people yes, but those that like to be quiet and enjoy life like everyone else.  The  gentle quiet pace of the city, coupled by a sense that there might be some fun just around the corner. Most importantly the merrion boasts one of the most intelligent eclectic art collections in the city. And it is just fun to sit and enjoy the fact that art is and always will be the best part of visiting ireland.",5,2013,05,16
200,"Fascinating hotel: from outside ""blah"" but inside: WOOHOO","Bizarre/interesting/great hotel: VERY unassuming (ugly?) from the street, but once you're in the door: woohoo!
- Great location near Park
- Mediocre shower pressure (although colleague had better so it might be room dependant)
- crap view from window (ground level)
- great pub in basement
- beautiful/original/cozy/idiosyncratic lobby/lounge with fireplace and nice old furniture
- great service/staff
- great pillows
- very good climate control
- charming/huge garden

My local colleagues gasped in horror when I said it looked like council/social housing from the street (""it's heritage-protected! Edwardian classic!"") but once you're in door it's really impressive.",5,2013,05,16
200,Super hotel,"My husband and I stayed here and it was really good, the room was really nice and the bed was huge. The mini bar was really well stocked and reasonably priced. They had a turn down service which was lovely. We had breakfast delivered and it was very good. The cellar bar is a really nice bar with very good food. The staff from all over the hotel where very friendly and helpful, will most certainly stay here again.",5,2013,05,15
200,"Excellent Location, Fine Hotel, Excellent Service","The Merrion Hotel is in a perfect Dublin location. It is a 5-15 minute walk to nearly every site you'd want to see there - Grafton Street, Guinness Store, Trinity College, Temple Bar area and tons more. The concierge, bell and front desk staff at the hotel are top notch. The rooms are fairly standard but well equipped. Wi-Fi is free. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the tea room off the lobby was quaint and welcoming. The fitness center had a nice pool, steam room and excellent locker room facilities (Bath products, Shave Products, robes, slippers lockers - all free to use).

My company paid for the room so I'm not sure of the cost, I'd guess it isn't cheap. I recommend this spot for a romantic or business trip.",5,2013,05,15
200,Lovely but $510 euros?,"The Merrion is a lovely hotel. However, it is ridiculously overpriced. The rooms are adequate. The staff is half delightful and half snobby and there is a lack of warmth that permeates. The best way to describe the feeling is that I am doing them a favor by staying here.  Nothing overt, but an underlying snobbism. Let's face it, at 510 euros a night, I want to be included in the snobby feel. Instead, I have step-child syndrome. Not a great feeling at top euro. ",4,2013,05,13
200,Quite perfect,"From the moment we stepped up to the entrance, we were greeted by friendly staff throughout the hotel at all times.  Our room was beautiful.  Decor is traditional, which I prefer to the stark, cold contemporary design found in so many hotels now. Every detail was thought of, down to the robes, slippers, turn-downs, quality of bath amenities, and even a ""hot box"" to keep room service food warm.  Also, the elevators were prompt and never more than a minute's wait.  We enjoyed two dinners at The Cellar Resturant.  Grace was our server both times and we so enjoyed her subtle Irish wit!  The location is good, within walking distance to Grafton Street and Nassau Street for shopping, as well as several beautiful parks and good pubs and restaurants.",5,2013,05,13
200,Great hotel with a personal touch,"Just stayed at the Merrion and it is a really nice hotel in a great location, with very attentive staff.

We were however unlucky when eating a seafood platter in the cellar bar. My crab mayonnaise salad had shell in it and I broke my tooth, ending up at a dentist Saturday night instead of an evening out. Ruined the weekend a bit of course but the hotel staff really made an effort trying to make me feel better. They reduced the price with the same cost as the dentist bill (160 Euros) meaning that they removed the dinner bill + another 60 Euro. However, it did become an experience that did affect my stay quite badly and on top of that quite expensive since I still have to pay a new dentist coming back to Sweden (the Dublin dentist only made a temporary fix) a few hundred Euros more so it leaves me with a strange after taste.  

I do recommend the hotel though since it is a great place and being unlucky sometimes happen...",4,2013,05,12
200,An absolute gem,"We recently returned from a trip to the UK and Ireland. We were fortunate to have chosen The Merrion Hotel to stay in while in Dublin for 2 days although other properties had been recommended. This was by far the finest hotel we stayed in during our trip. The hotel is very centrally located. The hotel, rooms and all facilities were in excellent condition. Our room was large, comfortable and spotless, and the people were friendly, helpful, professional and overall fantastic.  I would not stay anywhere else on a return to Dublin.",5,2013,05,11
200,God help you if you are trying to book some rooms,"Trying to book 3 rooms for next Tuesday night, receptionist told me she could not do this and put me through to a central call centre, I had to wait about 7 minutes to be spoken to. Then the man on the other end of the phone couldn't understand the name of the hotel and asked me to spell it, then he got the dates wrong then he couldn't access any corporate rate. 5 star hotels do NOT have reservation services like this. I was hoping to bring quite a bit of buisness there way......bad luck you guys.
I'll go somewhere else thanks.

200,A Place to Recover,"Sadly I had caught a flu before I arrived at The Merrion so I could not enjoy all its pleasures. However the rooms where wonderful, and the room service great, it is a long time since I actually had a moving table bought to my room. Staff where great and I would love to return when i was well.",5,2013,05,10
200,top class hotel,"his is a top class hotel in a great location. It feels different from chain 5 stars as it feels more personable. I loved the great artwork around the hotel.

The rooms were lovely. It is right beside a Michelin starred restaurant which i would recommend for lunch. 

The hotel is expensive would i would recommend if you want a 5 star experience in Dublin.",5,2013,05,10
200,Not cheap but well worth the money,"My wife and I decided to add a few days in Dublin to our European trip and selected The Merrion Hotel based on the pictures, location and reviews.

The hotel is first rate, very relaxing and quiet (despite the central location).

The biggest plus is the staff - they are all very professional, helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for them, they were so keen and it is so good being able to talk to professionals!

We were in the ""cheap"" rooms with a street view at the side of the hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable - not really ""luxury"" but perfectly adequate. You wouldn't mind spending a whole day in the room. 

The restaurant is very good. We loved the breakfast - make sure you go for the ""Irish"" option and try the soda bread.

There are several nice lounges on the ground floor with comfy seats and log fires - even in summer (I am told).

The only negatives relate to some of the fixtures and fittings. The TVs are from Y2000 (they are tiny are belong in a museum), the gym has an odd collection of machines which were cheap when new and age has not been kind to them and the changing room in the spa is also very 3* mid 1990's. 

So in a wrap, it isn't umber luxury but it is a nice nice hotel and I would stay there again.",4,2013,05,08
200,Lovely hotel but be wary,"This will have been our third time to stay here and while I would refer you to our previous very positive review of the hotel. Please make sure to stay away from room 181. It may be offered to you as an upgrade as it is in the original end of the hotel, but it has a terrible view, its decor is poor and overall is well short of what they can give you as a five star hotel. It is also below another room which has very poor soundproofing between them and is above a private dining room in the restaurant. The same I suspect may apply to room 180 which is in the location but looks out onto the main street which will be better than the roof tops.",3,2013,05,07
200,In a class of its own,"This was booked for my wife's 40th birthday almost 9 months before. I booked the 'Shop in Style' package. Communication with Martin in the Reservations Department reassured me that all was going to be well from the outset.

When we arrived at check-in, we were told we were going to be upgraded and the room on the first floor we were shown to was amazing - from the huge bed to the sofa and armchairs and the equally large bathroom. It was understated luxury and we were always made to feel special by every member of staff. 

Nothing was too much trouble, and after a busy day shopping on Saturday and making use of our voucher for Brown Thomas, we returned and telephoned room service for some mince pies and hot chocolate. But never before have we been served hot chocolate from a silver pot and the mini mince pies were delicious. Even the roses in the tray dressings were so perfect we didn't think they were real. If you did want afternoon tea, they looked amazing, but suggest you book in advance as we were advised they get really popular. 

The breakfast on the first morning was very impressive and everything was cooked to perfection especially the poached eggs. Dinner in the Cellar Restaurant was disappointing average and perhaps a little overpriced. Breakfast on the Sunday morning was chaotic to put it mildly and long queues to be seated. We can only advise people to go for breakfast earlier than 9.30am (we were advised of this in a note in our room), but who wants to get up early on a Sunday morning... Perhaps room service is the answer.

But each night our bed was turned down, pillows angled on the mattress and a towel and slippers placed on the floor ready for you to retire.

We made use of the swimming pool, sauna and steam room and had it to ourselves for almost a good hour on the Saturday afternoon.

Yes, there were a few niggles but nothing worth complaining about and overall this was a majestic hotel and if we were ever to return to Dublin, this would without question, be the only hotel we would stay in.",5,2013,05,06
200,Simply The Best,"Where to start ?? Was it the valet parking, the Suite we were upgraded to, the food or was it the service?? From start to finish this hotel had it all, a standard that other hotels in the same star rating only dream of aspiring to. I have no words that can describe the sheer bliss while staying here. The staff of the Merrion should be an example to all on how to treat guests they were so professional courteous and went above and beyond in making this the best weekend in Dublin we have ever had. A special thank you to Matthew The Sales Director ""your the Man"" and thank you to all the staff especially the room attendants your turn down service is outstanding. When in Dublin there is only one place to stay and that's at The Merrion simply the Best Hotel in Ireland.",5,2013,05,06
200,A model for all other hotels!,"My wife and I stayed for two nights last weekend, and we wished it could have been more. From the moment we stood on the first step to the entrance to the moment we left was to experience service at its best. Friendly (but not familiar), polite (but not servile), helpful (whenever asked) and smiling (but not forced) are descriptions which aren't usually attributable to all the staff of a hotel. But they were here!

Added to welcoming public rooms, a splendid bedroom, a relaxing garden and an excellent Cellar Restaurant (for breakfast and dinner), this makes the Merrion the hotel where we have felt most ""at home"".

Organisations often proclaim ""People are our greatest asset"", and when you are in contact with them you wonder! At the Merrion they don't make that claim. But they should - and teach others how to do it!!

It may be more expensive than many other hotels in Dublin - but it certainly gives value for money.",5,2013,05,06
200,Treated like a queen - incredible service!,"Stayed here on my own for a few days in Dublin and couldn't have been more pleased.  I truly was ""treated like a queen"".The service was outstanding - in every instance the staff went above and beyond to be helpful, and in some cases anticipated my needs before i even knew what i needed.  Especially loved coming back to a room that was not only completely spotless at the end of the day, but also had  clothes that i had left out in a heap on a chair neatly folded and/or hung in their proper place!  Breakfast was also wonderful, the gardens were beautiful - just loved this place!  Also, 2 star Michelin restaurant, Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, right next door for an additional treat!",5,2013,05,05
200,"Merrion Hotel, 5 stars and more!","Just back from another short break at the Merrion Hotel Dublin and again am so impressived by everything in this hotel.  We checked in, getting the usual warm welcome and were upgraded to a suite which was super, overlooking the garden, only slighttly marred by the nosie of wedding guests spilling out into the grounds from Patrick Guillbaud's restaurant.  All the staff are incredibly helpfu, really make you feel as if you are a valued customer and the chambermaids are superb, tidying up during their night turn down service so you come back to a room in our case far more organised that what we left!  Dinner in the Cellar Restauarnt is good and not overly expensive by Dublin standards  as is breakfast. My only complaint with breakfast is that so many options are extra, e.g pancakes €16, which when paying so much in the first place for the stay is a bit much, particularly as I find as standard in so many other 4 let alone 5 start hotels.  The spa treatments are also good though as usual with all five star hotels, over priced.  My only slight whinge is that though tea and coffee making facilities are provided they consist of only basic bewleys instant coffee and tea, with no biscuits, again unusual as even in three star Irish hotels now you stand a chance of getting Earl Gray and herbal teas and in some rooms in for instance the Radisson Group might even get a Nespresso machine!  But if you have a few euro to spare and even if you can only afford a night, the Merrion is worth it as you come away relaxed and feeling special!",5,2013,05,05
200,Really worth visiting,"While in Dublin last year I wanted to try something new and stayed at the Merrion.  I was not disappointed.  A great treat indeed.  The staff were friendly, the service spot on and food and drinks mighty!  I stayed in a suite and it was very nicely appointed with a huge bathroom and great amenities.  Great location and very well managed and run.  It is very classy.",5,2013,05,04
200,Costly but well worth it,"We spent three nights at the Merrion in April and were fortunate that the famous Irish rain was not too bad during our stay.

The flight in arrived early and we were glad to be able to drop off our luggage and have a coffee in the hotel lounge before going out sight seeing.  The wifi which we accessed while having our coffee was also a bonus, as we managed to log on when the July anniversary games tickets went on sale just after we arrived and were lucky enough to get tickets.  I noticed later on that they sold out in 75 minutes.

We then walked towards Trinity College to get our bearings before getting the 2 day City bus tour tickets and we jumped on close to the College, so we could get an idea of the location of some of the attractions.  This eventually brought us back to Merrion Square where we decided to try the Cellar bar for lunch.  The Cellar bar is quite quirky and we had a very good snack lunch before going up to reception to complete checking in.

We were fortunate to be upgraded and had a very nice garden view junior suite which we were shown to by one of the many efficient and friendly staff, which seemed to be the norm for all those at the hotel. The bed was nice and firm as we like it and the room was very comfortable and relaxing.

We spent a couple of evenings in No 23 having a very pleasant snack and a few drinks.

The Cellar restaurant was the venue for breakfast and I decided to go for the Full Irish.  This was well cooked and the buffet area was well stocked and presented.  

On the last evening we ate in the Cellar restaurant and had a very nice meal, with a very good atmosphere as the restaurant was reasonably busy for a Sunday evening.

We managed to leave our I-pad in the hotel room and were very pleased that the Hotel found this and organised its return to us in the UK. 

Overall we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is not cheap, but the quality makes it well worth spending a little extra for a special occasion.",5,2013,05,04

“The best luxury hotel in the world”

5 of 5 stars Reviewed May 2, 2013 NEW  

Was this review helpful? Yes 

We have all been to hotels rated five stars, and while some may rise to that designation, others do not. The Merrion is in my opinion the one against which all others should be compared.

This is our second stay at the Merrion, the first for two nights, this one for eight. We had a beautiful rook which felt like home with two adjoining bedrooms and a living room between. They were comfy and warm. The staff is incredible, responding to some requests on the phone in 30 seconds. Housekeeping was wonderful, they kept the beds made and the place clean while being very unobtrusive.

Service is above and beyond. I ran out of business cards except for one, which I gave to the front desk and asked them to copy for me. I got back a strip of paper the height of the card, with the front and back copied right next to each other, in color, with 30 copies, in about two hours. It saved the trip for me.

The porters helped me get heavy pieces of gear up to the room from the front door, every day, sometimes beating be to the room though I walked right to the elevators. There are two wonderful restaurants, and in the less formal one, breakfast is served, with hot muffins, chocolate and cinnamon, made in the bakery there every morning. They never run out and constantly refill the serving platter. The hot food is what you might make at home, fresh juice, fruit, yougort, smoked salmon, everything you could think of. That same restaurant serves a delicious candle lit dinner at night. The food at the barside restaurant is from the same kitchen, through a different door! Room service is promt and the food is prepared exactly as ordered.

Laundry and cleaning came back the same day, the staff was polite and responded to every request with civility and sensitivity. I really can't say enough about the Merrion, and was pleased to be able to stay there for over a week to enjoy all that they have to offer a weary traveler. I've stayed in some great places around the world, but this hotel is the best.",5,2013,05,04
200,Amazing experience!,"Myself and my partner stayed here at the end of April for his birthday and our anniversary. From start to finish everything was perfect! We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms in the main house looking out at the government buildings and it was absolutely beautiful, even the smell in the room was gorgeous. We had some cocktails in the No 23 bar which were given to us as complimentary for our anniversary, nice touch! We then had the afternoon tea with champagne in front of the fire which was a real treat. Again another complimentary cake for our anniversary at the end! We also had dinner in The Cellar restaurant and the food was amazing. 

I would also like to mention Attila who dealt with our reservation. He was extremely helpful and polite in arranging everything for us. 

All in all, The Merrion is the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I cannot wait to come back.",5,2013,05,03
200,Quite a treat in Dublin,The high tea is an experience by far the largest I've ever had. Our room was perfect for 4 people we reserved the 2 bedroom suite. The view was not much but room was great. Bed a little hard for my likes but its always a challenge in European countries as far as softness is concerned. The bartenders we great did a bang up job on the classics. The food at the hotel is AMAZING. Breakfast was something we looked forward to in the Cellar. The staff was attentive. I don't really have any complaints maybe a suggestion. Music in the little bar would be pleasant. It was a Lil uncomfortable without it everyone listening to each others conversations. ,5,2013,05,02
200,This is a real Five Star Luxury Hotel,"My wife and I finished off our European vacation here in Dublin and Ireland.  Words can't express how kind the Irish people are and how wonderful this hotel is.  Location is perfect and the ambiance and attention to detail is amazing.

The room down to is warming and relaxing.  The classical music coming from the TV establishes the mood, level of sophistication, and relaxation for the hotel guest.

Food, bed comfort, and fire place in large lobby is truly inspiring to come back another vacation.

We were met with a big smile from the elderly bellman and gentleman who greeted us with a wonderful warm Irish salutation. The concierge manager was very kind and helpful. The staff that checked us in was so helpful. Even the bell boy who brought in converters for 110 volt plugs greeted me with very kind words.

Words can't express how much we appreciate coming to Dublin and experiencing the wonderful Irish culture seen in the words and actions of this very sincere hotel staff.
Thank you Merrion Hotel.",5,2013,05,01
200,Excellent Hotel,"This is the best hotel in Dublin.  The location is perfect, staff very helpful and friendly; and the rooms comfortable and plush.  The art work in the hotel is superb.  We would have loved to stay longer and take advantage of more of the hotel services.  The hotel is near some outstanding restaurants and pubs.  The Concierge went above and beyond getting us reservations.  This is definitely the hotel to book in Dublin...we will stay there again.",5,2013,05,01
200,"Merrion Hotel, Dublin - very nice","We stayed there with my father and my sister for 3 nights. Lovely hotel in the middle of Dublin, good location for exploring around town and coming from airport, very helpful staff! Beautiful architecture and ambience, very comfortable stay. To be recommended.",5,2013,04,30
200,Met all Expectations,"This trip was for my birthday and our wedding anniversary - we were delighted when we got to our room to see two beautiful chocolate cakes with Happy Birthday on one and Happy Anniversary on the other - a beautiful and thoughtful touch!!

Staff was friendly and efficient.

The spa was nice (... but loose tile in the steam room) and the spa showers had beautifully scented shampoo, conditioner and shower gel.

Our bedroom was a nice size with a lovely view of the garden.  The bed was so comfortable - best hotel bed I have ever slept on.

We popped into the Cellar Bar for a pre-dinner drink - really interesting atmosphere and surroundings.  Beautiful architecture and ambience.

We both had a wonderful memorable stay in Dublin and would definitely recommend the Merrion Hotel.",5,2013,04,23
200,Excellent hotel but a bit pricey,"Positives:
- great location
- amazing restaurants and bar (cellar)
- fantastc afternoon tea (drawing room). 
- the best spa treatment 
- attentive staff
- can be mistaken for an art gallery as the walls are filled with priceless paintings from the collection of the owner
- overall clean 

Negatives:
- corridor noise can travel through the room door.
- the cleaning lady starts knocking at the door from early morning (9am) and continues to knock after regular intervals",5,2013,04,23
200,amazing,"I couldn't say it any better than the last few reviews.  The service was impeccable, the staff formal, but somehow friendly and accessible at the same time.  We too had to wait for our room after a transatlantic flight but that's the chance you take if you don't reserve for the night before.  While waiting we had a lovely breakfast in front of the fire and the staff made our wait as pleasant as possible.  We stayed for a week and there were no missteps-remarkable in my experience.  The only small downside is the tiny fitness area...understandable given the space restraints in an old building but not the place if you must do serious workouts while on vacation.  Truly, though, we couldn't have asked for more.",5,2013,04,22
200,Yup..it's that good!,"This hotel deserves its 5 star rating.  Delightful inner courtyard leads to a peaceful feeling even in the heart of Dublin.  Staff is perfect and pleasant, although a bit tip-happy (even better would be declining tips, in my view!).  The exercise room is less than optimal--bike was missing it's pedal straps, but otherwise Ok for a small place.  The pool is great as is the steam room.  The locker rooms are a bit sparse but workable for a smaller space.  Nice touch of fruit in the exercise area lounge.  
The rooms are lovely and the bed superb.  The bath is fine although the shower a bit small and simple.  While pricey, this hotel earns its kudos and is a relaxing and wonderful place, I hope to return again and again.",5,2013,04,20
200,"Worthy of five starrs, perhaps the best hotel in ireland","The Merrion deserves it's first place on TripAdvisor status. The downside is that when you pick a hotel that is a top choice, it's likely to be crowded and that leads to less flexibility. I thought about this a lot while I attempted to sleep in the common area when we flew in from the U.S. midweek and arrived at the full hotel at 8:00 A.M...there were no rooms available to check in and snooze early. Having said that, the staff did everything they could to get a room ready and when the room was available it was gorgeous. Everything about the place is first class. The art collection is amazing. the service superior. The spa small but really nice with a wonderful pool. Congrats Merrion for the warm welcome we received on our recent trip to IRE.",5,2013,04,18
200,The Finest Hotel In Dublin,"When we asked the taxi driver to take us to The Merrion from the airport he said "" well you are staying at the finest hotel in Dublin"" He could not have been more correct.  The Merrion is a magnificent Georgian hotel which is elegant, formal and as warm and comfortable as home. 
Upon returning at the end of the day you are welcomed back by a staff that truly cared about your day. The magic of this hotel is the way they make formal luxury so comfy and appealing. 
The public rooms have a fire going all day and evening, the perfect place for a drink or cup of tea while sitting in their supremely lush upholstery and enjoying their magnificent world class art collection. 
The rooms are beautifully decorated and luxuriously comfortable. A perfect nights sleep is guaranteed.  
Every person we came in contact with was trained to do their job with excellence and charm, they 
were so happy to please and did so in a most delightful manner. 
Clare was our concierge and she was wonderful in giving us all the help we needed to make the most of our time in Dublin. She got concert and theatre tickets for us, amazing seats and reservations for delicious dinners. She also knew about tours that meet our needs for areas away from Dublin. 
The Merrion is perfect in every way and I would be so happy to go back again and again. 

ipleasing their guest was l",5,2013,04,17
200,Fabulous,"Really lovely and while luxurious, friendly and unassuming which is a combo that I love. Concierge, front desk, restaurant were just the best. Upgraded, early check in, first rate bath products, comfy bed, huge room. I loved this hotel and tried to rebook for another night and couldn't. And convenient with short walk to Grafton Street.",5,2013,04,17
200,Old times in contemporary qualioty,"The Merrion Hotel is perfecly located next to the downtown and the house gives a nice feeling of old times without compromising comfort at all. The staff is friendly and helpful, rooms spatious and comfortable. Compared to german or american hotels, the breakfast selection could be wider.",5,2013,04,17
200,Lovely stay,"We stayed at the Merrion for an overnight stay in January as a Christmas treat to each other. We were upgraded to a fabulous large room in the main house. It didn’t have a view but that didn’t matter as it was freezing outside so we were keeping the curtains closed to keep the cold out (the old windows are still in the Georgian part of the house). 

From start to end the experience in the Merrion is always fantastic. The doormen, the receptionist, the wait staff – everyone is very friendly and extremely helpful.  

We went to the Cellar Bar to watch a Leinster game, it’s a great pub with a relaxed atmosphere. We then went to dinner in Patrick Guillbaud’s which was AMAZING from start to finish. 

Drinks in the Residence Bar and Breakfast were all a treat and I will most certainly be back. It’s not cheap but you get what you pay for. 

We only spent 24 hours in the hotel but it felt a lot longer – a proper break from reality!  Being from Dublin this is the only hotel I would bother paying for and staying in in my city.",5,2013,04,17
200,Simply the Best!,"I have stayed here twice in three years. I have never had a better hotel experience anywhere. They know how to do everything right. You can walk to Trinity College, Temple bar and all the downtown sites. The hop on, hop off tour bus has a stop at the end of the block. You are across the street from Ireland's "" White House"" which is stunning. We were upgraded the second time to a huge King room in the older/ original part of the hotel. It was pure luxury. Baths are large with marbled walls and floors with large separate shower and soaking tub. From the doormen to housekeeping, the staff is the friendliest you will find. Breakfast was included and the black pudding is the best in Europe. Had one dinner in the restaraunt and it was wonderful. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2013,04,16
200,As close to perfection as any hotel I have visited,"Every time I go to the Merrion I am impressed all over again.

It is not at all surprising that this hotel is the automatic choice for world leaders and Hollywood's A-List when they are visiting Dublin.

Perhaps the most impressive thing is that the guests every need is met without fuss or drama. Truly world class service.",5,2013,04,11
200,Lovely hotel but overpriced and snobby,I love 5 star hotels but I don't like stuffiness or snobbery.  I felt this hotel had both.  The room was quaint and spacious but left me dissappointed.  The bed was huge and very comfy.  The restaurant food was fantastic but lacked atmosphere.  Overall it was a hotel I had always wanted to visit but it is a hotel I will never return to.,4,2013,04,11
200,"Wonderful hotel, great service!","We loved this hotel. From the moment we arrived until we departed the staff were superb. They were all so welcoming and friendly and available whenever you might need them without being in your way at all. The afternoon tea is very artistic and fun. The breakfast was lovely. A morning swim followed by freshly squeezed orange juice was such a treat. Handy location as well, just steps from the National Gallery and Natural History Museum and opposite Government Buildings, a short stroll to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. This hotel is great on service, with warm welcoming staff adding to the experience.",5,2013,04,09
200,5 Star Service / Staff,"Have stayed in Merrion a few times now. Staff very friendly always say hello and hold doors.
Check-in was pleasant, prompt and efficient: our receptionist then brought us to our room in the Garden Wing. Rooms lovely.Breakfast is good but full irish could be improved.Staff for breaskfast service are quite young and distracted. Would not recommened Cellar restaurant alot nicer restauants nearby.
5 star service and rooms but not 5 star food tho.",5,2013,04,09
200,Nice,"We stayed here over the st. paddies day weekend and it was nice.  Not overwhelming - but nice.  One definite positive was that all the staff were great to deal with.  Slightly uncomfortable mattress (but these things are always subjective).

Overall a nice place to stay.",4,2013,04,08
200,It was nice....,"Merrion Hotel is one of the boutique hotels in Dublin. It was OK, we were NOT impressed with the dining room and the food.  Sorry to say it, but really wasn't up to standards, particularly the steak/beef entrees at dinner.",4,2013,04,07
200,Nice base,We loved it here..it was our first stop on our trip to Ireland and we were very happy with our experience here. staff were friendly and efficient. A good base for exploring dublin. Would recommend to a friend!,5,2013,04,05
200,Five Star Service,"My wife and I had to attend a function in Dublin and we stayed overnight, on B&B basis, in The Merrion. Check-in was pleasant, prompt and efficient: our receptionist then brought us to our room in the Garden Wing (guests have to walk through the Drawing Rooms to access this area).
The room was smaller than we expected (it reminded me of a room in a French hotel) but was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The TV sat on top of a well-stocked mini-bar. I found the view from the window interesting: opposite was a row of Georgian houses. 
The marble bathroom was spacious and clean, although the marble floor tiles were tarnished in places (soap damage?). Robes, slippers and toiletries were provided.
In the afternoon my wife decided to try the Afternoon Tea. There was the usual selection of scones, pastries, cakes and sandwiches. Some of the cakes were themed on surrounding paintings. Her tea was served in a silver pot and replenished when her server thought that it might have gone cold. Service was superb but my wife felt that some of the items were not freshly made: I tired a sliver of a sandwich and the bread had been exposed to the air for some time as it was beginning to harden.
We enjoyed a warm and comfortable sleep.
Breakfast was served in the Cellar Restaurant. Guests could choose from a variety of cereals, fruits, pastries etc. from a central table while hot food was cooked to order. (I was asked how I liked my poached eggs cooked!) Freshly brewed tea and coffee were served in silver pots, with paper heat protectors on the handles. The quality of service was exceptional. 
After breakfast we spent some time in the Drawing Room, in front of a real log fire, reading the daily newspapers.
We did not avail of parking facilities, or the spa.
Our stay in The Merrion Hotel was most enjoyable and memorable. We found it thoroughly relaxing and didn’t want to leave. While the surroundings are classically elegant we appreciated the staff, who made our stay so relaxing. They were warm, friendly, knowledgeable and professional. To them all, we say, “Thank you”.",5,2013,04,05
200,This is truly a great hotel,"From the doorman to the front desk to the housekeeping staff this hotel exceeds expectations. Since I was traveling with my teenage daughter and we both wanted space I chose a two bedroom suite. When we walked through the door of the suite accompanied by one of the young ladies from the front desk my daughter exclaimed that this was the best room that she had ever seen! I agreed with her. The decor was beautiful, the rooms well laid out and quiet and the bathrooms were stunning. The gardens in the center of the hotel were also beautiful but since the weather did not cooperate we did not opt to explore them. The location of the hotel makes it very convenient to the shopping along Grafton Street and just generally walking around exploring Dublin. Lovely place to stay.",5,2013,04,04
200,Setting standards others cannot match,"We returned to The Merrion recently with our two young children and had a superb stay. Many good hotels claim to be child friendly but the emphasis seems to be on the marketing and not the delivery, this is not he case here. As always all the staff were wonderful, particularly with our son and daughter, the level of friendliness, courtesy and the overall emphasis on delivering customer satisfaction help to set the hotel apart. Our room was wonderful, a suite with space for our children to explore and get lost in, the deputy manager promised my daughter cookies and sure enough when we returned from shopping the cookies were waiting, with lovely Merrion colouring/activity books, colouring pencils and helium filled balloons. There was also a good range of baby bathing products supplied and my little girl got a lovely kiddies robe and matching slippers for her stay. My children also thoroughly enjoyed the pool which was spotless and never too busy. We enjoyed food from the room service menu after getting he kids off to bed and my seafood platter was wonderful and enough for 2 people, my wife also thoroughly enjoyed her meal. The location is first rate being right at the heart of Dublin and within easy reach of excellent shops and restaurants. On Easter Sunday the Hotel had arranged a special visitor, the Easter Bunny made an appearance. The garden was festooned with balloons and my daughter joined other excited children for an Egg hunt. She loved it and was delighted with her egg haul and meeting Mr Rabbit. The hotel also handed out lovely hand painted chocolate hens to the kids. The experience added a touch of magic to Easter for my children and capped off another wonderful stay. In short there are many hotels in Dublin and then there is The Merrion. It is quite simply in a class of its own.",5,2013,04,03
200,Rest and relaxation guaranteed.,The Merrion Hotel is the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we stayed in many hotels around the world..rest n relaxation guaranteed though also within walking distance of shopping and night life in Dublin. I highly recommend The Merrion.,5,2013,04,03
200,Just perfect!,"From the minute we arrived the service was fantastic....the car was parked for us , our junior suite was immaculately prepared to a level that the Duke of Wellington would have approved.
Even when we went to dinner the evening room service had arrived and serviced the room...the level of detail in tidying was unbelievable....food was great....and access to a swimming pool & spa in central Dublin was unusual and very handy....no wonder it is no 1 in Dublin on Tripadvisor",5,2013,04,02
200,Over rated for a 5* hotel,"Stayed here recently on a mid week break and have to say we were disappointed with the hotel overall.  The positives were that we did get to check into our room early and were really delighted to be told that we had been upgraded from the room we had originally booked.  I had stayed in the Merrion on a previous visit to Dublin and was allocated a standard room on that visit and the room that we were upgraded to on this visit was, in my opinion, not much different.  we had a light lunch in NO. 23 which was ok- food was really nothing special but the service was fairly good.   We had dinner in the Cellar restaurant and found the food to be just average.  It was well presented and the service was good but the standard of food was average enough- the meal was unmemorable.  
We retired early for a well earned sleep and the hope of a sleep-in- this is where we were really disappointed.  We had a room to the front of the hotel and the noise from the street really disturbed our sleep.  Our own home is on a busy main street and we have put a second layer of window in our bedrooms to block out the traffic noise (our home is definitely not 5 Star!) so we couldn't believe that we had to deal with the street noise in our bedroom.  We eventually slept but were awoken from 6:30 am with other guest leaving their bedrooms.  The banging of bedroom doors is unbelieveable!!  I would really encourage the hotel manager or the accommodation manager to sleep in one of the rooms for a night to listen to the noises that guests have to listen to.  There are self closers on the doors to each room and these really need to be adjusted- the absolutely unforgivable noise from these doors banging is just horrendous.  We didn't get a wink of sleep from 6:30am- so much for our well earned sleep in!!   
As i couldn't sleep in I decided to have a bath-  my pet hate in any hotel is to find that the bath and toilet share the same space.  The toilet should have a separate confined space so that when a guest is relaxing in the bath they should not have to view the toilet.  The bathroom is certainly big enough to facilitate this.  On the plus side the soap and other necessities provided are of an excellent quality.  

Breakfast is again nothing special and we have certainly tasted better in other hotels.  
The hotel is definitely very well located and with it's old world charm we can easily see how it gets such good reviews but the bedrooms really need to be updated and those banging doors really need to be sorted out.  The management really need to spend a night is one of the rooms in each corridor to see what guests experience.   We were very disappointed and will be in no hurry to return to the Merrion.",3,2013,04,01
200,An wonderful hotel in a great location in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed in The Merrion Hotel in Dublin in mid February and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From arrival at the hotel the staff were very courteous, friendly, attentive  and highly efficient. We arrived mid morning and were shown to our room more than 4 hours before the regular check-in time. Following lunch in the unique Cellar Bar we relaxed in one of the magnificent drawing rooms, with their interesting collection of art, sitting in front of a wood fire. Following a shopping trip to nearby Grafton Street we returned to The Merrion and spent some time in the magnificent swimming pool. Prior to dinner in the Cellar Restaurant we enjoyed a cocktail sitting by the fire in No. 23, had an excellent dinner served by a delightful and attentive staff  and enjoyed our desserts in one of the drawing rooms in front of the fire. It was a memorable visit which we considered great value as we had  selected one of the packages offered on the hotel web site",5,2013,04,01
200,Great service and good style,"Spent two days in the Marrion hotel, and will definitively stay there next time. Been to dublin a few times but this is the best hotel in my mind. Staff was extremely helpful and good. Loved the entrance floor with its cozy sofas and the three fireplaces. All in all a surprisingly positive experience, since the exterior looks a bit dull. Comfy and silent rooms also adds to the experience. Only negative is the location of the breakfast in the cellar. Have a wonderful garden why not enjoy views for breakfast.",5,2013,04,01
200,Real Irish Charm,"After checking in to this hotel you are led past two wonderful reception rooms with sofas and fires burning making you immediately want to relax and order a drink, morning coffee or afternoon tea, whatever suits you and the time of day. The rooms are very comfortable and in our case a spacious and well appointed bathroom. Breakfast is served in the basement or cellar of the hotel and though the Irish breakfast is more than adequate in terms of quantity the quality was a little disappointing, the following morning I had kippers which were superb and with a plate piled high with them more than I could eat. We had a busy weekend and so passing through the two reception rooms on our way in and out of the hotel made the idea of relaxing in these rooms more of a distant hope rather than a reality but we had a cancellation in our schedule and took advantage of the spare time and ordered afternoon tea. Be warned if you are planning dinner later, the tea is more than generous with sandwiches, scones, and cakes. Luckily we decided to share ours and only ordered the food for one, not that we had any idea beforehand but simply because my partner wasn't that hungry. Nevertheless this proved a wise choice, the generous and appetizing amounts meant that my partner couldn't resist the odd nibble and between us we finished a very substantial and delicious afternoon tea. An added delight or unwanted novelty depending on your mood is the cakes that are themed to the art that hangs on the walls around the hotel.( Pity the poor waitress who has to explain each little cake with its attached picture, but in our case she did it with grace and humour that you almost forgot they were there to be eaten.) These paintings are really interesting and offer a much better ambiance than the usual bland and anonymous prints etc that adorn so many hotels. That being said, after such a substantial tea I didn't feel too hungry for the dinner which was to follow, fortunately it wasn't for several hours later so I did have time to work up an appetite by going out for a walk. 

We stayed a weekend and all in all had a very pleasant stay made more so by the very efficient and friendly staff. We had tried to book in the restaurant attached to the hotel but left it a little too late so missed out, however you could so easily get by in this hotel with the breakfast and afternoon tea. A wonderful and relaxing stay with real Irish charm.",4,2013,03,31
200,Breakfast blunder,"We stayed @ The Merrion for 2 nights on Sunday 24th,check in was very satisfactory lovely friendly staff and we were shown to our room (definetely without a view!!) overlooking some back yards, not really what you would expect from a 5*hotel. A little disappointed that The Cellar restaurant was closed on the sunday night. Had a drink in No.23 found it lacked atmosphere, a little quiet but we were served by a very friendly member of staff. Breakfast on both mornings of our stay is what really annoyed me, as i declined the ""full"" irish @ a charge of 29 euro in favour of pancakes and then the french toast on morning no. 2 i thought a supplement of 6 euro each was really over the top.We have stayed in other 5* hotels in Ireland and have never encountered this before!",4,2013,03,29
200,Not a grand facade but a wonderful hotel,"We stayed at The Merrion for a long weekend and whilst the weather wasn't memorable the Hotel , and in particular the staff, were. 

From the moment we arrived all the staff are courteous with nothing too much trouble.... In keeping with a hotel of this calibre. 

We stayed in one of the rooms overlooking the garden. The garden didn't look it's best but then I assume that's due to the time of the year. There was however dead ivy on the walls which doesn't look the best. Our room was well proportioned although it had no iron or ironing board which you can request from reception. When we did this they informed us that all the irons had been borrowed however they would press our clothes free of charge. They were duly collected, pressed and returned better than I could have!

The room itself, whilst clean, was showing signs of age but this didn't detract from the charm of hotel and the overall experience.

The hotel is well situated so nothing is too far away.

If we visit Dublin again we'd definitely stay again",5,2013,03,25
200,Fantastic.,"Having stayed in some of the best hotels all over the world, this is one to rival the best. 

my girlfriend and I stayed here for a weekend break in the city and were very happy with our choice of hotel. 

The staff at the merrion are attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and worth their weight in gold. 

The building it's self is wonderful and the food also worth mentioning its quality. 

Every taxi we got in, the driver was keen to talk about the Merrion as it clearly has a name around the city for being brilliant. 

Dublin has a real gem here. 100% Worth a stay if in town. ",5,2013,03,24
200,Faded Elegance,"This hotel is apparently the best in Dublin. So far I have been unimpressed . Asked for an early check in after a long flight for a king size room but even after wading through the check out scrum at noon I was initially told to wait until 15:00. After speaking with someone else did get a twin room on the ground floor after a 15 min wait. Room furnishings and carpet are very ,very worn and tired. TV reception is spotty for some channels. Bathroom appointments good but overall room temp on a ground floor room is cold with no change from thermostat . 
To be fair, front desk staff and housekeeping staff are great, friendly and obviously well trained. Concierge staff a little standoffish/snobby. I may have just had a bad experience and haven't had the food or been to the cellar bar which is supposed to be good. But it seems this hotel is trading on its name and location . Probably needs a full remodel soon. ",3,2013,03,24
200,One word Class,"What a beautiful Hotel. We were fortunate to stay here on a short trip to Dublin and this Hotel just does not disappoint. From entering we were me as you would expect by polite, friendly and discreet staff and were dealt with immediately. We inquired why there was a press gang outside the door and were told we were expected which seemed like a very polite way of saying ""sorry I can't say!"". We found out later we shared the Hotel with Bruce Springsteen but try getting someone from the Hotel to tell you that. The rooms were spacious, spotless, bright and stocked with everything you may have forgotten when you packed. The bars and restaurants were pricey but you wouldn't expect anything less. The breakfast is a must have I would recommend everything. This is a hotel for couples not really a family Hotel I don't mean kids wouldn't be welcomed but the atmosphere is so relaxed and reserved I wouldn't dream of disturbing it with my kids. All in all an expensive Hotel but worth every penny.",5,2013,03,23
200,Great Hotel,"We visited the Merrion in March, and despite the late availability of access to our room, the hotel staff were simply amazing, nothing was ever a problem and they exceeded expectations. The cellar bar a must to visit!",4,2013,03,23
200,Fabulous place to stay in Dublin,"Just back from a glorious one night stay in Dublin's number one hotel. From the warm welcome at check in, my wife was won over. She mentioned to the lady who showed us to our room that we were here for her birthday. Later in the afternoon an exquisite 'happy birthday' cake arrived at our room. The fantastic suite  we were allocated (Lord Antrim)over looking Government Buildings was fabulous. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff from them valet parking our car through to the lovely staff who served us breakfast. Can not wait to be back again!! ",5,2013,03,23
200,Afternoon Tea,"I had afternoon tea here recently which was very special, the room was like an old drawing room with a big open fire blazing.  The tea although expensive was substantial and I later learned that I could have bought just one tea and shared it rather than the two which was a little too much.  The staff packaged up the cakes for us to take home which was a nice touch.  I will return again.",5,2013,03,23
200,Couldn't have been better,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in March. We had two king rooms but because we booked through American Express we were upgraded to two junior suites in the main hotel. The rooms were beautiful and wanting for nothing. From the minute we arrived until the minute we left the service was extraordinary and everyone was very friendly. We had breakfast in the Cellar room as part of our package and it was a very nice buffet. And for anyone who is gluten free they offer gluten free toast as well. We also had dinner one night in the Cellar and the food was very good. The location is fantastic, walking distance to most of the sites and shopping, but it's on a side street so very quiet. I did not swim but the infinity pool looked very inviting. I really have nothing negative to stay. If I return to Dublin I will definitely stay there again.",5,2013,03,23
200,Simply Brilliant,"I've just returned from an overnight business trip to Dublin, having stayed at the Merrion, and this is quite simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The amenities, rooms and location are all very good (the Cellar Bar is great, and makes a decent vodka martini!), but the real clincher for me is the service level. Whilst it seems to be harder and harder to find hotels that truly live up to their star rating, the Merrion seems to go beyond 5 stars when it comes to service. Staff are all friendly, attentive and immaculate. A brief anecdote - I wandered up to the reception desk to enquire about breakfast. Whilst the receptionist was chatting with me he casually asked my room number and discreetly looked up my profile so that he could refer to me by name when I said goodbye. It's a very small gesture, but it speaks to the attention that the hotel management and all of its staff pay to making sure their guests are beyond satisfied.

There were other touches as well, such as my colleague and I being given a voucher for a free bottle of wine with dinner in the Cellar Restaurant, the old-school doorman running out into the rain to assist my colleague with her luggage, and so on. All in all, just a brilliant hotel - can't wait to come back to Dublin to stay here again. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!",5,2013,03,20
200,Quality lunch time & early evening dining in Dublin,"Twice in recent years I have lunched & dined at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. Not in the main restaurant but in the Cellar Bar & Restaurant located underneath the hotel with its separate entrance down a flight of stairs from the street.

You can reserve tables in the Cellar Restaurant which are located in alcoves off the Bar area & if with friends you can also reserve one of the two larger tables in the Bar area itself. 

The Cellar Bar has its own food menu which is ideal if you are solo or do not require the ambience & so forth of a more leisurely lunch or evening dining experience.

St Patrick's Day fell on Sunday March 17 & the Cellar Bar was specially opened until 8.00pm. Apparently it is not normally open for food on Sundays but you should check with the hotel first.

Having taken lunch solo at the Cellar Bar one April Saturday in 2011 I knew that on St Patrick's Day 2013 this would be the ideal place, if open, to take some friends for a quiet meal away from the crowds. 

We were not disappointed. I phoned ahead a few days earlier to check opening times & the hotel kindly arranged to reserve a table for my party of four in the Cellar Bar itself. Obviously the Bar area was busy but the service & food we received was first class.

No hesitation in recommending the Cellar Bar for informal lunch & evening meals.",5,2013,03,19
200,As good as it gets,This is a truly wonderful hotel.  The service is amazing.  The facilities are beautiful.  The spa and treatments are wonderful.  Location is wonderful.  Food excellent.  A special place I hope to return to.,5,2013,03,18
200,Paddy Day madness,"We visited Dublin this weekend for the Paddy Day celebrations. Fun was had by all and far to much Guinness was consumed! The atmosphere in the city was great and Dublin was awash with green for the whole weekend. We stayed at the Merrion and were all very happy with the choice. The hotel is one of the more pricey hotels in Dublin but you get what you pay for. The hotel itself has a very nice atmosphere, big log fires, big rooms with massive beds, lot's of interesting art, nice bars and restaurants and also plenty of relaxation spaces. All of the staff were excellent and in particular Tom in the Cellar Bar and Anna at breakfast. We ate in the Cellar restaurant on Friday evening and I can highly recommend the Venison main course, it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Once again the staff in the restaurant were extremely good. The meal itself was a tad on the pricey side but that was our fault for getting into the spirit of things with pre dinner drinks in the bar, aperitifs at the table, three bottles of fine wine and a bottle of Port!! Well it was Paddy's Weekend! Last night we decided to go for our final drink of the weekend at the Clarence( the hotel owned by Bono) as this had been our original choice of hotel but we were so disappointed with the ambiance and the tired looking bar that we didn't even stay for drinks. I think we had a lucky escape by choosing the Merrion. We loved our weekend but there is only so much of a good time one can take! I will be very happy not to see another pint of Guinness until next years Paddy's Day. Cheers...",5,2013,03,18
200,Lovely Hotel,"We had a weekend in Dublin and decided to stay here. Did not regret it. It was a lovely hotel.

The receptionist was very freidnly when she greated us, and showed us to the room. The room was a nice size with a large bed. Everything was clean and smart, as you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. When walking around any member of staff would smile and say hello, but not be too overbearing. It was a nice balance. We went for a drink in the cellar bar, which had a nice atmosphere.

The price was about €300 a night, so not cheap, but worth it for a treat. Breakfast was expensive, €29 for full Irish breakfast, and I wouldn't say it was worth it, it's better to get breakfast somewhere esle.

Would definitley stay here again if we returned to Dublin",4,2013,03,18
200,A Special Treat.,"We recently spent a Friday night at the Merrion in Dublin.  It was a special treat we had been looking forward to for nearly a year.  The reception area is a lovely Georgian area with a quiet and calm ambience.  We were greeted by the very charming concierge who took our car.  We felt that the gentlemen who work for the concierge service represent all that is good about the hotel.  They are warm and friendly without being nosey or invasive.  They look professional and provide an excellent service.  They are charming and knowledgeable, a great advert for Irish tourism.  We were checked in by a very friendly and professional receptionist who escorted us to our room.  The room was excellent and we were surprised to be greeted by a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates.  The room was faultless and very comfortable.  The public areas of the hotel are charming and add to the experience of staying in a luxury hotel.  The swimming pool and gym area are small but excellent and add extra value to the experience in a city centre location.  It is also a great spot for people watching, especially being opposite the Dail (the Irish parliament).  Justin Bieber was staying in the hotel while we were there and there was also a rather exclusive wedding taking place too, which we enjoyed watching although all parties seemed to have complete privacy within the hotel.  However, when we went down for breakfast in the morning the lady who served us totally confused us.  She gave us the menus and continued to explain that as we were on a 'package' so we could only order certain items from the menu with prices.  We were using a blue voucher we had been given as a gift to pay for the stay.  We did not feel that it was necessary to point out that we were on a 'package' at breakfast and it made us feel uncomfortable which is surely not the aim in a 5 star hotel.  Similarly, when we were checking out we asked could we leave our car in the car park as we were returning for afternoon tea and the receptionist was not very helpful.  Initially she said no as we were checking out and to be honest we were just going to cancel the rather expensive afternoon tea but the concierge offered to look after our car.   Although, overall it was a wonderful experience and we hope to return in the future.  It is a five star hotel and we have only removed a star from our overall rating because of the confusion at breakfast and the fuss about the car.",4,2013,03,17
200,Love it!,"Just stayed here for my second time. Very attentive staff, nice warm rooms, pleasant pool. Nice food in restaurant. Location is second to none. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short city centre stay.",5,2013,03,16
200,Not blarney..,"Spent a night here last summer,2012. Got a good deal only a day or two beforehand, as far as I can remember by booking direct.
Given a magnificent room with very comfy beds though this one lacked a decent view, but perfect to come back and change/sleep in after enjoying the City. Bathroom goodies by Asprey - no diamonds within though. Still, the name looks good in my bathroom too! Sorry, how naff! For a brief stay it is ideally placed - just off the beautiful Merrion Square and opposite the impressive Government buildings. Museums and Galleries close by and the main railway station is within walking distance - the other side of the  Liffey.
Wonderful public rooms, great for people watching, sipping cocktails and taking tea. Room service impressive too. Uniformed doormen to fetch and carry...
The hotel is actually made up of two or three Georgian townhouses, much extended to the rear, one of which has a blue plaque proclaiming it as the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington - yes, that one.  
Much acclaimed smart restaurant, but as I was paying for the meal we settled for the The Cellar Restaurant - clearly very popular with Dubliners and with good reason. Still quite pricey and worthy of dressing up.
Didn't have a chance to sample the spa..",5,2013,03,15
200,Superb Hotel,"The Merrion gets everything right.  As expected: the rooms are extremely comfortable and well equipped, everything is well maintained, the bar has a wide range of good wines as well as interesting cocktails, the breakfast is scrummy and the spa and pool inviting.  But the real joy is the warm atmosphere.  Faultless and friendly service, the smell of the turf fires, the tasteful furniture and outstanding art collection all combine to make it nearly impossible to leave.  Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2013,03,14
200,Exceeded Expectations,A true 5 star experience.  We arrived early and were upgraded to a junior suite! The service was impeccable; the room very well equipped and had everything we needed. There was always a member of staff available if we needed anything.  Recommend the Cellar Bar for food and great service. Spa was perfect after a day’s shopping and site seeing. Looking forward to going back.,5,2013,03,13
200,Faultless!,"We treat ourselves to a stay in Dublin city every now and then and this was our first time staying in The Merrion.. From the valet parking to the reception to the comfortable quiet rooms( not to mention location/open fires...).I would highly recommend... All staff are so professional and courteous and as it was my husbands birthday(although he only mentioned it in passing)there was a little birthday treat in the room for him...its the little things that make a hotel stand apart from the rest(Not to mention Danny De Vito and Michael Flatley staying the same night!)and we will definately be back,hopefully for longer next time!",5,2013,03,13
200,Excellent hotel,"This a an excellent hotel with a very relaxing atmosphere. I bet the best in Dublin. Room quality and comfort are of a superior category. So was breakfast, up to the top standard of the hotel. Needless to say that all the staff is very professional and courteous. Very convenient location.",5,2013,03,10
200,A 3rd Visit to the Merrion,"My son and I stayed at the Merrion for 7 days recently. This was our third time. They were good
enough to give us a double bedded room at the single bed rate. It had been about 16 months
since our last stay.  There has been quite a change in personnel, which is sad when you had
such a good time previously. The new people were just as friendly as always, however things
seemed a little more disorganized. One thing, they had our days which were to have
breakfast completely messed up. But I am sure things will get straightened out. The service and atmosphere is way above all the other hotels we've have stayed at.  They are always ready to help and answer questions. Fortunately, David, a lounge server is still at Merrion. It is so nice to
be able to come in at 2 AM and have a leisurely snack and drinks in the lounge, and in front of
a Fireplace.That cannot be equaled with any place I have stayed at. I will stay there again when
in Dublin.",5,2013,03,10
200,50th Birthday,"Stayed at the Merrion for my 50th birthday last weekend for 3 nights with my family, what a great time we had, we ate in the cellar bar the first night, the food was like michelin star and very reasonable too, on the 3rd night we ate in the cellar restaurant, a bit more expensive but equally as nice. I've stayed in many hotels in Dublin but the Merrion is by far the best, it really earns its 5 stars, the staff are so nice and friendly, I had an Indian head massage €55 for 30 minutes was very nice, the pool and steam room was also lovely, the bedrooms are really luxurious, we had 2 rooms interconnecting overlooking the garden, I really love this hotel and will definitely be staying here again.",5,2013,03,08
200,The Merrion is Fantastic!,"My children -- ages 12 & 10 -- and I stayed for 4 nights at the Merrion in mid-February. We stayed in a two bedroom garden suite.  Everything about our stay  was wonderful, from start to finish. The staff is amazing.  Courteous, helpful, great with children, acomodating -- anything you  needed you got right away with a smile. The suite was beautiful -- huge rooms, comfortable beds, great turn down service. quiet and of course the building itself is beautiful. We had breakfast in our room everyday -- the food was delicious. Location is right in the heart of Dublin -- you can walk to many places of interest. Every great review of this place is true. This is a world class hotel without a doubt. I will be back next time I am in Dublin-- I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.",5,2013,03,07
200,Expensive but the best !,"Excellent staff / Excellent location / Excellent room. 
Could not have been happier. 
Maybe a lower bill but a real treat. 
Porters great fun !! It is the best in Dublin by far. Busy too 
so the recession must be over !",5,2013,03,07
200,Great place & Superb Cellar Bar,"Business trip to Dublin.  High standard hotel with good internet access.  Staff professional but given that I frequently travel to Dublin and this was my first stay at the Hotel did not make an extra effort to convince me that they wanted me as a repeat customer.  Maybe the quality of the hotel means they do not need to!  I do recommend the stay here for the main reason that if you are travelling by yourself, they have a friendly & excellent Cellar Bar which serves one of the best steak & chips in Europe.  Definitely a hotel I would stay with my wife when I take her on my next trip to Dublin.",4,2013,03,07
200,"Perfect, Utterly Perfect","You know when people say you get what you pay for? Well, you really do at The Merrion.

You pay top dollar, but you get service,surroundings, luxury like no other.

I was there last March (2012) for a long weekend. Very quick review just to say everything everyone has told you is true. 
From the moment you pull up outside and a top-hatted and tail-coated gentleman takes your car away to park it somewhere discreet (i never did know where!) to the moment you leave when they pack your luggage back in the car for you, you are treated with the utmost elegance and care. 5 star the whole way

We ate in both the restaurant, and the library for High Tea. Our deal included one evening meal, one high tea and two breakfasts, and everything was perfect. Reception were fantastic, the conceirge was fantastic- everyone offers such a high standard of service you wonder why everywhere can't be like this!

We had champagne, flowers, fresh fruit and chocolate in our room when we arrived, and the suite was just devine. Overlooking the gardens. Huge, clean and Perfect

Love the turndown service, loved the breakfast , loved the elegance of the building. You are treated like a rock star form start to finish.

Definately book a high tea if you can. I've never eaten so much at 3pm in the afternoon before, but every morsel was utterly to die for

The service in the restaurant is faultless, the food great.

The location, of course, is also utterly perfect, right on Merrion Square, 1 mins walk from Oscar Wilde's home and memorial, 5mins to St Stephen's Green Park, Just down from the National Gallery, and 10 mins walk from Grafton Street.

Adored my stay here, i wish i could afford to go back more regularly!
 I coudl gush forever about it, but trust me, if you are dithering between the Merrion and another choice, take my advice and go the extra cost for the Merrion :)",5,2013,03,06
200,husbands birthday,"I treated my husband to a saturday night  stay in the Merrion in January. Staff made every effort to make his stay special. We were upgraded to a suite. A chocolate treat was in the room on arrival with happy birthday on it. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We had dinner in the cellar restaurant which was part of our overnight stay. Again when my husbands dessert arrived it had happy birthday written on the plate.
Overall a fantastic experience. Such a pity it was only for one night. Will definitely stay again.",5,2013,03,05
200,JUST SUPERB-DEFINITELY BEST IN DUBLIN !!,"As an Irish man who lives abroad -(and who has lived and worked in Hotels abroad for the last 20++ years and currently runs one of the best Hotels in China? and VP for a Hotel group there ) ) always nice to come home and this is my ""new home"" when I come to Dublin visiting friends and family etc. -used to stay in another property owned by a certain celebrity with Liffey views
but it has deteriorated over the years. Visited The Merrion just  before Christmas as had to be back ""home"" in China for Christmas -outstanding -Real Irish hospitality at the Merrion -from reservations to pre arrival to check in to room with nice touches and superb location -great breakfast -too salty bacon but maybe just my taste!! Concierge and doorman knowledgable and helpful -overall just world class -great and friendly receptionist -good to see Irish Hospitality at its best -thank you !!",5,2013,03,05
200,Fantastic,we stayed here last w/e for the second time and were not disappointed. The staff are highly trained and have wonderful manners. Nothing is to much trouble. we both has a wonderful massage in the Spa. My husband had a bad back and housekeeping provided a board to go under the mattress. We had a very cosy evening in our room watching a movie and had a delicious dinner served . Perfect.,5,2013,03,05
200,Outstanding hotel,"I stayed here whilst on business in Dublin. It is one of the best hotels I've been in. The rooms are fantastic with clean modern furniture and huge comfy beds and brilliant en suites. The staff are friendly and helpful. All this does come at a price and it is a big one! They even charge residents extra to park a vehicle on site which I thought unreasonable. A lovely hotel but to be honest, on the pricey side.",4,2013,03,05
200,Excellent service in a quality traditional hotel,Initially I was slightly underwhelmed by the hotel lobby until I understood the principal of the hotel decor. Its walls are a blank canvas painted in basic colours for the purpose of displaying many excellent quality paintings. The lounge and bar are cozy with a welcoming fire in each. The rooms and spa facilities are of a good standard but thought the pool temperature was a bit low. What stands out for this hotel is the level of quality service by the staff. All were very welcoming and knowledgable. Any queries were dealt with efficiently. The welcome and engagement by all staff including maintenace people and cleaners was genuine.,5,2013,03,04
200,mother and daughter,"As usual, brilliant.  The service is second to none, they can't do enough for you.  The room was amazing, and the bed was the size of a football pitch.  (well it felt that way).  If you want afternoon tea (another experience) you MUST book in advance or you will be disappointed.  The spa treatments are costly but well worth it. (again, you must book in advance).  The only niggle was the breakfast... a fabulous choice unless you happen to be a vegetarian.  I wish we had discussed this with the staff, as I am sure my daughter would have been spoilt.  Our 4th time here and certainly not the last.",5,2013,03,02
200,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic hotel .We have stayed in many hotels through out the world and this has got to be the best.
We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a junior suite,which was truly superb with a wonderful bathroom.
This hotel is beautifully run ,there are always plenty of staff around to cater for your every need.

The staff are excellent ,always friendly and ready to help without being at all condescending,always ready to go the extra mile.The front desk and concierge were always superb.
I could name many ,but Laura in the Cellar resturant stands out particularly .
The food in the Cellar Resturant is excellent and although the menu hardly changed over 3 days,there was plenty to choose from.We would recommend the prawn starter.
The hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin and is very convenient for all areas.We had a very enjoyable break here and will definately return when in Dublin again",5,2013,02,28
200,Great service,"Went in here for a drink, with some family, our waiter Conan was new, he was very pleasant and accommodating when the drinks we ordered were not available in the bar and facilitated us very well. Staff overall very friendly was very pleased with the service, beautiful hotel. ",5,2013,02,27
200,Simply Outstanding,"Firstly I travel extensively and have stayed in many hotels but the Merrion is one hotel you genuinely reget leaving and want to return to.

The service is out of the world!! 
I was fortunate to stay in a room in the main house overlooking the garden. Room was large and the bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.

The swimming pool is gorgeous as well.",5,2013,02,27
200,A very good experience,Found the Merrion a consistently good choice. Friendly staff. Laid back atmosphere and even a beautiful garden! Charming common space. We will be back! (But some trouble with the organisation of the breakfast offer).,5,2013,02,27
200,Beautiful historic hotel.,"This Is a great place to stay if in Dublin.
Great location, quieter area of the city.
It's an impressive hotel on the outside and this continues through the public areas.
Our room was beautiful, fireplace, huge bed, but the old bathroom lets it down.
The corridors to the pool and bedrooms outside of the main house are early 90's and show their age... If I was in the extension rooms then I would be very disappointed,this part of the hotel lacks the character and beauty of the main house.
The cosy bar and lounge areas were perfect for a cold winter evening in Dublin.",5,2013,02,26
200,will never stay anywhere else in Dublin...,"We had the luxury of spending 4 nights at this 5 star hotel in central Dublin.  It was beyond reproach on any level..exceptional across the board. We were upgraded at checkin to a room in the original building on the second floor with views of the gardens and the pool..just fabulous.
Service was exactly what one would expect from a 5 star and then just a little added in for good measure!!
My stays to Dublin will be easy from now on- there is only one place to stay and that is The Merrion.",5,2013,02,25
200,Charming,"I only stayed here for one night during a business trip but I will stay say how wonderful it was. Firstly the hotel is in a fantastic location in the centre of Dublin in close proximity to amenities and shops. Also the Georgian architecture is very beautiful which makes the hotel quite special before you have even entered. When I checked in the room was not ready but this was not a problem as I was able to have breakfast. The breakfast was delicious with a wide choice, well presented and great service. After breakfast I was told that my room was ready and they had also upgraded me to a garden room. I don't know what it was about the room but it was just so warm, welcoming and comfortable. It was furnished in the traditional style with plush neutral armchairs and sofa's that matched the deep carpet. The room obviously had a view of the garden which added to the grandeur. The hotel has quite a collection of art, and if you are interested in paintings like me, this is a highlight of the hotel. On the evening I made a reservation at the michelin starred Patrick Guilbaud restaurant (which is in the hotel) and it was just perfect. The fillet of Irish beef that was served for my main course was exquisite and will be hard to beat. For dessert I had the chocolate tart which was also incredible. In summary I would highly recommend choosing this hotel for a luxury stay in Dublin. It is a most tasteful establishment that offers beautiful rooms, art and food.",5,2013,02,25
200,Merrion Hotel,"Excellent hotel and facilities, located in the centre of the action in Dublin, food was wonderful, and staff were so polite and pleasant. Hotel has a wonderful collection of art. The bathrooms are huge and the room was well stocked.",5,2013,02,22
200,Very british!,"Excellent service, nice hotel room. Staff was very attentive. I asked for a small birthday greeting for my fiance when I booked the hotel and they even prepared a small mousse au chocolate birthday wishes written with chocolate on a white plate. Very very beautiful. They did not charge this extra service, which I found very nice.",5,2013,02,20
200,Easy to see why it is number 1.,"Excellent hotel. This is really on par with the top hotels in the world. We normally stay at the westbury but decided to try the Merrion. From a friendly and helpful concierge staff to a multilingual reception staff to a guided tour of hotel and room. Rooms are moderately sized for a city centre hotel but every conceivable extra. Even down to bottle warmer and bath foam for baby. Even the baby had his own bath robe (very posh indeed!!). Food in cellar restaurant is excellent and is moderately priced for fine food. Despite the fact that this hotel is expensively furnished the staff are very child friendly and tolerant and if my child is happy then I am happy. Stayed for one night but will be back. Only small gripe was the habit of reserving tables in the drawing room, certain tables should be kept free for residents. But despite that there are nice touches in this hotel.",5,2013,02,09
200,Still the best,"Had the pleasure of staying in The Merrion again two weeks ago.  This was our fourth visit in the last couple of years and it is without doubt one of the best hotels in the world.  The staff are extremely professional yet relaxed and friendly. The rooms are elegant, especially in the main house, and the beds are big and comfy.  Even our minor complaint about a noisy family above our room was dealt with perfectly.  As incurable foodies, the breakfast is always important to us and we were very impressed with the with a cooked breakfast that was perfectly cooked.  The chefs clearly using high quality ingredients and knowing what to do with them.  We were sorry to leave this beautiful and luxurious yet cosy haven and look forward to next time grandma takes the children for a sleepover so that we can race down to Dublin for another night at the Merrion.",5,2013,02,09
200,"Overexpected, underdelivered","Stayed here as a big pre-Christmas treat with my significant other - it's a hotel I always wanted to experience, and perhaps I was simply overexpecting, but the reality just didn't quite live up to it. Staff are faultless - they are truly 5*. And the bed was awesome - absolutely huge. But the room looked a bit tired round the edges, especially the bathroom (never mind the weighing scales which were about 4 kgs out - thankfully 4 kgs lower, not higher, otherwise I would have left the place screaming!). The biggest disappointment was the breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant. For a handsome €30-something you get a full Irish breakfast. I asked for a vegetarian full Irish, and was offered an additional tomato and a couple more mushrooms. Anything with a bit more creativity would have been welcome! We both ordered poached eggs - and they arrived almost cold. Toast wasn't offered but had to be ordered (that is SO part of a full Irish!) - but then no butter came with it, and the same happened to the lady on the next table (there wasn't any butter at the buffet either)! Good that they have a swimming pool but again I just imagined it to be a bit, well, posher, for the price paid. Overall - I will be spending my pre-Christmas splurges somewhere else in the future, I am sorry to say.",3,2013,02,07
200,NOT for families!!,"I have read the great reviews and was very excited to book two nights for our family of 5. We were quoted 310 Euro per night per room, with an additional 50 Euros for the pleasure of being offered a pull out bed for one of my young adult children (over 12), as they have no triple rooms.  Are they out of their minds?  I actually thought they were so I wrote back for clarification!  They responded offering me a new option of booking 3 rooms! Doesn't that sound like a great way to spend a FAMILY vacation, and a great value too! Please understand that I have not been to the Merrion, I am sure it is wonderful... but don't waste your time if you are traveling with your family. By the way, unlike many other beautiful hotels in Dublin, the Merrion does not have interconnected rooms either!",1,2013,02,04
200,5* service!,"Everything about this hotel is 5 star all the way! Rooms are beautiful and I can't fault any of the staff as their service goes above and beyond most hotels! Will be back very soon! We ate in the cellar restaurant while we were here, fantastic spot and the food was really tasty! ",5,2013,02,02
200,Lovely hotel but still awaiting reply to a complaint,"We booked this through whatahotel.com who offered complimentary perks one of which included lunch or dinner. When we arrived hotel said we had not booked the right room to avail of this offer even though the email confirming booking made no mention of this. Hotel did not honour this. I sent an email of complaint to both the website and the hotel and as yet have not received a reply from either. This is a lovely hotel and overall we were very impressed with amenities, room and service but not happy that our complaint wasn't even acknowledged. Pity, as otherwise I would have given this five out of five.",4,2013,02,01
200,"Fabulous experience, truly five star!","My husband and I recently stayed overnight in The Merrion  Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the surroundings and service were absolutely five star. The rooms were well appointed and very luxurious, the bar and common areas were welcoming and extremely comfortable. We ate in the Cellar restaurant where the food was excellent and the wine list had a fantastic selection to choose from. Breakfast was extremely plentiful and very tasty. We also enjoyed relaxing in the spa which was quiet when we were there. The location is excellent - within walking distance of St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Overall I would highly recommend the Merrion  and would most definitely stay there again!",5,2013,01,31
200,charming place with room for improvements,"Me and my boyfriend just returned from a three night stay at the Merrion. 
First of all it is in a fact a very charming place. The drawing room and the bar no 23 are cozy and inviting and we spend every evening some time there. 
The most of the staff are very friendly. 
But anyhow I would like to summarize shortly the Pros and Cons of our stay. 

Pro: 

- the cocktails at the drawing room. the drawing room is a pleasant location without noisy music or irritating people ( different to the bar at the Shelbourne!) 
- the staff is super friendly, especially the concierges and the doormen
- the location of the hotel
- room size 

Cons:

- the dated bathroom. this bathroom is worse than in the most cheap hotels. it was clean but the amenties were oldfashioned. The shower was too small, the bathtub tiny and the one sink for a five star hotel definitively a let down ( no Spa feeling here!). 
- the pool is a bad joke. it was not inviting at all and always very busy
- the food at the Cellar restaurant was awful. we had both steaks which were given with a bunch of fried onions and fries. normally you see this at snack bars.
- the breakfast is good, but overpriced. we were charged every extra. I wanted to have French Toast instead full Irish, I had to pay a certain amount more for it. this was just weird to us. Also the breakfast buffet did not offer any ham, salmon or such. Just muffins, croissants, bread, fruit and cereals 
- we booked long in advance two massages, but they just booked one. so we ended up discussing who can have the treatment from us and the other had to go back to the room. THIS should not happen! 

Overall we liked the hotel and our stay at the Merrion, but we are not sure if we would return since there were too many let downs.
-",3,2013,01,28
200,Old fashioned elegance meets modern sophistication,I have stayed at many of Dublins hotels but I always end up going back to the Merrion. I am normally on business but I really feel that this hotel caters to all travellers. I like the wonderful modern art pictures in the lobby and elsewhere in the hotel. I understand that the hotel owner is a collector. I like the staff who are efficient and courteous without being over the top. I adore the large drawing rooms where one can stretch out in front of a roaring fire over a fine tea and or an aperitif. The rooms are modern with good air con and extremely comfortable beds. The bathrooms are opulent and clad in wonderful streaked grey marble. The hotel has an excellent choice of eating establishments from their in-house two star Michelin restaurant which never fails to please to various other outlets including the Cellar Bar to The Terrace. In summary I really feel that I am staying at a characterful Irish hotel and not another five star block. Over a number of visits they have never let me down.,5,2013,01,27
200,"Excellent hotel, wonderful stay","We stayed here on our honeymoon and were delighted with the Lord Antrim Suite and the hotel in general. The suite was beautiful, and all the facilities and amenities exceeded our expectations. We ate at the Cellar Restaurant and found the food to be delicious and plentiful. We used the pool which was warm and relaxing. We enjoyed looking at the art work around the hotel and relaxing in the lounges. We found the hotel staff to be extremely helpful without being intrusive. We would highly recommend The Merrion.",5,2013,01,24
200,No complains,"We stayed one night at the Merrion after a round trip through Ireland and were pretty much pleased about the hotel. We would maybe have expected a bit more classier rooms, but all in all we were satisfied and would definitely go there again. The concierge and the crew were very forthcoming and friendly. Although we didn't use the SPA, it looked great and well maintained.",4,2013,01,22
200,You get what you pay for,"Top hotel in Dublin in my opinion. 

A beautiful hotel with a very welcoming staff. Certainly brightened an otherwise rainy Dublin day. 

Shown to the room and everything explained along the way. 

Spa looked great. Gym was ""functional"" but cramped. Let it down a little. 

Humorous staff for my early check out left me smiling and would be delighted to return. ",5,2013,01,18
200,Wonderful,"Arrived for a weekend break with the girls... Wow!!! Beautiful hotel, staff really helpful and gorgeous room. Didn't use the restaurant as quite expensive but plenty of places around to go instead. We stayed in the garden wing which was stunning to see in the winter so I imagine its fabulous in the summer months. We would definitely come back should we visit Dublin again... Can't go wrong :)",5,2013,01,17
200,Wonderful weekend,"I enjoyed a great short weekend break in Dublin at this fair hotel. From the second you arrive you are treated to the finest aspects of Irish hospitality with good well grounded hotel service. Quite traditional in character the well polished brass fittings might blind you after a while and it all adds to the charm of the place. Check out the warm drawing room with log fires and enjoy a ""23"" from the menu. The rooms are well finished to a high standard with excellent fittings and provided amenities. My bed was perhaps a little soft but the black gold of Dublin meant i possible wasn't as sensitive to the bed as normal. The onsite restaurants look great, although we only checked out the breakfast facilities where the salmon and scrambled egg was top notch. 

The service cannot be beaten , really nice but lets be clear, this does have a € value attached to it.",5,2013,01,14
200,subtle elegance,"My wife and I spent one night recently at this hotel and enjoyed our stay very much. Location is excellent; right in the heart of Dublin; close to Trinity College and Grafton Street. The hotel is very comfortable with its tastefully furnished sitting rooms and restaurants. The room we had was very comfortable; much appreciated since it was our first night in Ireland and we needed a good sleep. The main dining room served excellent food for both dinner and breakfast and the staff were good. The only negative comment I have is for the staff at the reception desk were quite snooty and somewhat arrogant. Overall, I would recommend highly to stay here for both its location and very high quality standards.",4,2013,01,13
200,A very special birthday treat,"We spent six nights at The Merrion the week before Christmas. This was our first trip to Dublin and it certainly won't be our last. I can think of no reason whatsoever to think of staying anywhere else.

The Merron is old fashioned elegance and service at it's best. The hotel was spotless, beautifully decorated for the festive season, the room (standard) was large and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  During our stay we ate in the cellar bar and the cellar restaurant. We also used room service and were very happy with all three.

The hotel is very conveniently located for all the central Dublin sights, with a stop for the hop-on, hop-off bus just a few yards from the front door and an unofficial taxi rank. The nearest Dart Station is less than 10 minutes walk away which means if the weather is good and you fancy a change of scene you can be at the seaside within half an hour. It is also within walking distance of the Aviva Stadium.  

We're already planniing our return stay!",5,2013,01,11
200,Amazing Xmas!,"Booked this amazing hotel through whatahotel.com (which is also the best)....

we had a wonderful stay at the merrion which was especially beautiful in its xmas finery and detailing.

whatahotel.com secured a nice upgrade as well as a slew of other thoughtful ameneties (chocolates, chocolate puzzle (!) vase, etc...) for xmas and my daughter's birthday.

everything was spot on - from the tetra spa to the cellar bar (which was especially sharp, and i thought improved) to the excellent room service and (friendly) front desk staff. 

there were many a (cold!) morning that i looked at the brass ""leading hotels of the world"" plaque at your doorstep and thought that it would be tough to find any hotel with more right to that moniker...

i can't wait to visit again - VERY soon,",5,2013,01,10
200,"Dated rooms, some in horrible locations","The common areas of the hotel are lovely. The art amazing. Gardens are beautiful. The rooms are dated. There is no light when you come in, only lamps. Turning them on is a chore and housekeeping turns them off. So at 5:00 in January you come into a dark room and have to find the lamps, the switches on the plugs, and then the lamp switches. The room has a 1980s stereo with a CD/cassette player, no way to play an MP3 player. The television is small and the remote doesn't work. There were also housekeeping issues- they did not remove dirty glasses and the turn down service did not arrive until after 21:30- unacceptable. The worst issue was the room location. Room was on the ground floor by a large gate. Curtains had to remain closed as I was looking directly into an Itsu, or something similar, and foot traffic was only a few feet away. The dark room was only made worse by this. The gate closing and opening was loud. The worst part was that the room had a horrible patchouli smell, I assume from a treatment room directly next door. I would not stay here again.",3,2013,01,09
200,Worthy of its No.1 Spot !!,"Stayed here a while ago for my 40th birthday celebration and have to say it simply is a cut above.  What i liked about it most is the fact that this hotel has all the class of a top hotel but without the pretentiousness.  I found the staff to be very pleasant and more than helpful, the rooms were nice and in general I felt the whole experience was very relaxing and well worth the visit.  Congrats to all.",5,2013,01,09
200,Wonderful Hotel!,"if the Merrion Hotel could be used as a model for other hotels , the bar for excellence would be raised.
These people are truly professional in every way, from the people at the front desk to the waitress in the cellar...they
alll aim for perfection. 
Thank you Merrion hotel for making my business trip so totally enjoyable! I have to find out what pillows you use ...my night sleep eas amazing!!!!!
Thank you!

200,5 star? Really?,"Sheets and blankets. Separate hot and cold taps. Slightly dated yellow decor. No central lighting control took 5 mins to turn off all lights. Small room. Mysterious disappearing cot. Beautiful looking but bland tasting afternoon tea. 
I guess my expectations were high. Rated number one hotel in Dublin and some fabulous reviews on this very site. On the plus side i agree with everything said about the service - really superb and attentive. The reception rooms were wonderfully decorated warm and welvoming with some fabulous art. However the room was a big disappointment. Not big enough for a baby travel cot without removing the chairs. The decor felt really dated - classic i like - dated not. The bed ans sheets and blankets were aging. And the towels and robes were rock hard from a hundred different washes. Really in need of modernisation. Our travel cot arrived and then we popped out for the afternoon and by the time we had got back it had gone again. Booked two rooms for one of the nights of the stay as my parents were joining us. Thought reception would put us in rooms close together but sadly no such initiative deployed.... overall really disappointing. Will try rhe Shelbourne next time....",3,2013,01,08
200,"Perfect romantic overnight, couldn't have been better","Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Merrion on a rare return to my home town, in early December. Having stayed in a few Dublin hotels previously, I was skeptical as to whether the experience would live up to the star rating. But it was quite simply perfect, from the warm welcome at the entrance to the fond farewell the next day. I admit that our getting upgraded to a Junior Suite had a major bearing on our excitement, but even putting that to one side, the entire experience was laced with a class, elegance and understatement that I was proud to find in Dublin, having seen too much glitz, pretentiousness and faux charm on recent trips home. The room was immaculate, the bed a delight, the service personable and genuinely empathetic, and the quality of the food  superb.... the breakfast we had in our room was phenomenal and did not disappoint in any regard, which is something I haven't been able to say in other hotels. And our brief experience of the food in the cellar bar was positive. All in all, I cannot fault the hotel at all... ok, my girlfriend pointed out that the phone in the bathroom was a faded beige colour and carried the symbol of the now defunct Telecom Éireann... but really, that was like finding a blackhead on the face of the Mona Lisa. AND it was all so very affordable.... truly excellent value. Well done and thank you to the staff there. We can't wait to return.",5,2013,01,07
200,Loved this hotel,This was an amazing hotel in Dublin.  The staff are very friendly and courteous.  The rooms are classic in their design and furnishings.  I can't describe exactly why I loved my stay here so much but I had a feeling that I was home.  Great experience.,5,2013,01,06
200,Merrion Hotel - Best of All Worlds,"The four nights we spent at the Merrion Hotel in late December 2012 were nothing short of excellent.  The location, price, old Dublin feel, and modern conveniences came together to create the perfect experience. The people and service were great (very large staff).  The multiple bars and restaurants provided the full set of options.  And the afternoon tea, while difficult to get a reservation, was a perfect touch.  And the location adjacent to St Stephen's Green was close enough to all shopping, museums, and attractions without feeling like you were in the ""tourists"".",5,2013,01,06
200,Excellent!,"Stayed last week for one night on €270 five star steal. Makes it within reach of us ordinary mortals. Delighted I got to see Christmas decorations in hotel, lovely time of year to stay. Had a pre dinner cocktail included in package, wow it was fab!  Have no complaints, always find staff very professional and courteous. Everyone should try and stay at least one night here in their lifetime. It is my ambition that when all my children have grown up and flown the nest, I intend to stay over the Christmas period. Thanks for another lovely visit.",5,2013,01,06
200,Simply PERFECT,"I had the tremendous pleasure to stay at The Merion Hotel for one week. It is the best hotel experience I have ever had. The service at the hotel can simply be described as perfect. The staff did absolutely everything they could to make the stay as good as one could wish. The room I stayed at was spacious, facing the beautiful garden. The location of the hotel is centrally within walking distance of more places of interest, and the restaurant at the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud offers you outstanding classic French cuisine.
We will definitely visit Dublin within soon - if not for other reasons, then - to stay at this fantastic hotel.",5,2013,01,04
200,Best hotel in Dublin,"Stayed at the merrion for one night, what a fabulous place, pleasant staff , comfortable room, swimming pool is fab, we had a meal in the celllar bar which do a great fish & chips , over all the merrion is good for families, couples of business, hope to call back soon.",5,2013,01,02
200,Fantastic stay,"Stayed at The Merrion for three nights between Xmas and New Year. This is our third visit and, again, didn't disappoint. Wonderful friendly service. The afternoon tea in front of the fire is a must but book in advance. The staff couldn't do enough to assist and make our stay comfortable.Tried the Cellar Restaurant on the first night and enjoyed a lovely dinner with great service.

We couldn't recommend The Merrion highly enough and looking forward to a return in the near future.",5,2013,01,02
200,We stayed at the merrion for Christmas 2011 and it was fabulous,"We had a wonderful Christmas 2011 at the Merrion, everything were amazing. Santa came to see all the kids in the hotel and gave them presents. You feel warmth inn the hotel, the staff were amazing, the room service was great. We had Christmas dinner there and it was so good. We wish we went there  Christmas 2012 but we decided to have it at the four seasons and we were dissoaponted about the service and some staff there this time. Merrion hotel is great place for good service...",5,2013,01,01
200,lovely but noisy....,"stayed at the merrion for a couple of days break with family.Our room (the merrion suite 291) was fabulous.separate sitting room and bedroom with a massive bed.complimentary champagne on arrival too.Staff at check in where so helpful.The swimming pool is fabulous,so relaxing.We had a meal in the celllar bar the first evening and it was fantastic.Unfortunatly breakfast the following morning was very dissapointing. We were waiting over 30 mins for our cooked meal and when it arrived it was cold.given it costs 29 euro for a full irish you would expect it to be hot!
There is a problem with noise in the rooms with one of our party changing rooms on the second night due to really creaky floor boards in the room above us.The second night there was a wedding in the function room directly below our room and I didnt get any sleep till after 4am.
I did bring this to the attention of the staff and they were apologetic about it but it might be an idea to place wedding guests in the rooms above the function room and not familys.
Breakfast the second morning was a vast improvement.
we will hopefully come back soon.",4,2012,12,29
200,No doubt this is the hotel in Dublin,"The most  imortant things of this hotel are
1 Irish tea in front of the fireplace a thing to do
2.pleasant staff
3.rooms quiet soundproff and good night obscurity even for a nap
4.fantastic breakfast with Irish specialities
4. good for couples families or bussiness",5,2012,12,20
200,2 Night stay at the Merrion Hotel,"We recently had a two night stay in the Merrion Hotel Dublin and I have to say it was an amazing Hotel experience. The staff are really professional and very friendly always going out of their way to make guests feel welcome.  The room was really nice and wonderfully comfortable .  The hotel was decorated amazingly for Christmas (the best I've seen at home and abroad).  The check-in process was a dream, the concierge spotted me parked down the street, came over and managed to create a parking spot for me right outside the hotel, took my bags and car keys and from then on I had no more worries.  My arrival and check-in was just such a pleasure.
Location wise, this hotel has it all, its on a really nice street with great surrounding buildings, a short stroll from the main shopping area, Stephens green and all of the great galleries.  The Cellar Bar is fantastic, very peaceful during the day, serving really good food , drinks and coffee and always has a great buzz in the evening.  I'll definitely return to the Merrion Hotel. We normally travel abroad for our pre-Christmas buzz but after this experience I think we'll definitely stay local in the future and return to the Merrion because it has it all.  
""Thank you and Happy Christmas to all the staff of the Merrion Hotel for this wonderful experience""",5,2012,12,20
200,great Hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion Hotel for 3 days, perfect location, very friendly and efficient staff.  We stayed in the standard double (queen size bed), the room was well proportioned (30m2) including a bath and separate shower, only one sink though. The rooms are very clean, good quality bed linen and well equipped. 
The Hotel has open fires in two different lounges which in winter create a cosy intimate atmosphere. 
We did not get to use the hotel much as we were in late and up early. Would stay there again for sure.",4,2012,12,20
200,Photos on here don't give it justice,"I booked a room here on the back of tripadvisor but was nervous as the picture make the hotel look dated.

It is not. It is a fab hotel with amazing staff that can't do enough for you.

Great location round the corner from a lovely lil wine bar.

",5,2012,12,16
200,Loved this hotel!,"My first trip to Dublin was enchanting! 
I enjoyed it and can't wait to go back. 

The hotel is in a great location from great restaurants, shopping, bars and pubs. 
The suites are lovely, nice decor, cosy, traditional and modern. 
The bathroom was a good size and luxurious. Always a big plus for me. 

This hotel has a certain elegance and history. I enjoyed my stay very much and can't wait to go back. 

Good shops too! ",5,2012,12,15
200,Recent Stay at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin,"My girlfriend and I recently spent two nights at The Merrion Hotel in downtown Dublin and had a marvelous stay.
Our King bedded room was quite lovely with a large sitting area and a fireplace that was just ornamental.
The entire staff of the hotel were very accommodating' especially Patrick at the Concierge Desk.
We will definitely use it again if we return to Dublin in our travels.",5,2012,12,12
200,You won't want to stay anywhere else in Dublin!,"This was our second stay at the Merrion this year when ""home"" from Paris to visit family. There is just something about the whole tone at the Merrion that is appealing.  The service is friendly yet extemely professional and courteous. The atmosphere is cosy with lots of class: beautiful common areas where guests can enjoy a wonderful collection of art. Bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. Spa, pool & gym areas are extremely well equipped with attention to detail.  The location is second to none: a short stroll to Merrion Square and to some of Dublin's finest attractions: the National Gallery & Trinity College. The only problem....we no longer want to stay anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2012,12,12
200,Simply Wonderful,"Easily the best hotel I have stayed in, from the moment you arrive to the minute you leave your in the lap of luxury.

Staff absolutely brilliant, so charming and friendly restaurant fantastic food amazing.

We went for our friends 50th birthday, this hotel made it a weekend we will never forget.",5,2012,12,12
200,Elegance,"Had a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel this weekend. In Dublin we always stay at the Merrion or the Four Seasons.  We recently had our third baby and the Four Season were no longer interested in accommodating us with our small children.  Not so the Merrion and especially Sheila in reservations who couldn't do enough for us. Our Delux room in the Main House was elegant and comfortable with wonderful bathroom and everything you would expect in a five star.  But, like so many others have said, it is the professionalism and courtesy of the staff that make this a truely wonderful hotel. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2012,12,11
200,Beautiful Terrace,"The Merrion is beautiful. Unfortunately I did not stay at the Merrion, but I did go to tea there with my brother and uncle. They went mostly to appease me and sit down after walking around a lot. We had a gorgeous sunny day and the terrace area with the fountains was so relaxing. Although tea was not high on my brother or uncle's list of things to do, the experience ended up being a highlight of our trip to Dublin. The food, service and ambiance was incredible. I will definitely return.",5,2012,12,11
200,Consistently good,"Just back from a 2 night weekend break, and pleased to say we hope all going well to make a return visit.the staff are all so pleasant  especially the doormen , they do a really great job.
We used room service quite a lot this visit, and found it to be of a very high standard.
The staff who took our orders and the delivery staff were all so professional but very friendly at the same time, this can be difficult to achieve but no such issues here.
The spa area is lovely and very well maintained.
Can't wait for our next visit.",5,2012,12,09
200,Still fantastic,"I have stay at the Merrion many times over the years and it is still the BEST HOTEL anywhere.  The location is perfect.  It is beautiful.  The rooms are elegant and quiet with comfortable beds. And finally, the service is impeccable. I couldn't be happier.",5,2012,12,05
200,Disappointing,"Sorry to have to report that I awoke after 2 hours sleep freezing cold , not enough blankets on the bed. 
Which should have been anticipated due to my late arrival on a freezing November night.
Due to my flight I was a late arrival and never thought to check that I had enough blankets...",3,2012,12,04
200,Good but service needs to be addressed,"We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday. 
 Check in was quick but later we had to ask breakfast times etc as we were not 
informed. We asked to upgrade to a deluxe room but unfortunately there was no availability.
The room was very nice and a chocolate dessert was left for my husband which was a nice touch. The bathroom is very plain and needs to be modernised.
That evening we went to the Cellar Bar for a cocktail before dinner but we waited for 10 mins at the bar to be served and eventually left and went to O Donoghues. There seems to have been a few Christmas parties there that night and the bar staff were busy preparing trays of Baby Guinness for customers and totally ignored us. An acknowledgement that we were waiting would have sufficed.
The next morning after queuing for breakfast we eventually were seated but in a smaller room off the main breakfast room. The table was tiny and seating was uncomfortable. I asked three times for toast and by the time breakfast did arrive our tea and coffee was cold. It was amusing to watch some of the staff as they clearly had no idea what tables were waiting for tea/coffee/toast etc and the manager would have to swoop in and eventually deliver it to the correct table. 
I also cannot understand why the only thing you can order is the Traditional Breakfast. If you want pancakes or French toast etc there is a supplement! I have never seen that before and you are paying a large amount as it is.. Why would you pay extra for something different? The breakfast was very good but I was hoping for porridge from the buffet which was not available.
Service is not as good as I would have expected but there is a lot of staff. It is a very relaxing hotel so I would like to try it again to see if it deserves its No 1 spot on Tripadvisor...",4,2012,12,02
200,Fabulous hotel with great staff,"Brilliantly placed hotel with easy access to central Dublin and attractions. The Merrion is a lovely hotel, with all the luxuries you would expect of this standard of hotel. The staff are very welcoming and couldn't be more helpful. I would definately recommend this hotel and when heading back to Dublin will be where I will stay.",5,2012,12,02
200,Well worth the money,"We stayed at the Merrion recently and loved everything about the hotel.  The service was faultless, the food fantastic, decor very elegant and little touches in the room - like an ice filled bucket - were great. The location is excellent too.  When it rained on Saturday night, we had a swim, a nice drink in the lounge and a lovely meal in the atmospheric cellar bar.  It wasn't the cheapest hotel, but  I wouldn't want to stay in any other hotel in Dublin now I've experienced the Merrion.",5,2012,12,01
200,Fabulous,"We loved every aspect and detail of The Merrion. We stayed there for the last leg of a 2 week trip around Ireland, it could not of ended on a better note. The rooms, service , restaurant , decor, art collection plus everything else was just amazing.....we hope to return in the near future.....",5,2012,11,30
200,Gracious and elegant haven in Dublin,"I stayed at the Merrion for three days in October 2012 and couldn't recommend it more if you're looking for an elegant retreat in Dublin!

I stayed in a Merrion Suite in the Main House, which overlooked the garden. The suite was very spacious (it would have been comfortable to entertain in) and beautifully furnished.  I appreciated that the suite had all the modern conveniences you would expect in a luxury hotel while still incorporating a lot of charming Georgian period detail.  I especially liked that the room was decorated with many interesting antique engravings and prints (as is the rest of the hotel).  It's like an art gallery and hotel in one.

The hotel could not have a better location: it's steps from St. Stephen's Green and Merrion Square, Trinity College, many museums, as well as lots of restaurants and shops.  My companion and I were able to walk everywhere during our stay which really enhanced our trip.

I would recommend tea in the drawing room to anyone staying in the hotel, it was delicious and the setting couldn't have been lovelier.

The only real downside of the hotel is the high prices of the rooms.  But I did certainly feel it was worth the cost, as the hotel met my every expectation.",5,2012,11,30
200,Charm and heaven at the Merrion,"A much needed two day stay at the Merrion felt like two weeks.  Elegance, charm and an overall sense of calm and comfort prevailed.   The facilities are excellent, the staff from doorman to chambermaid, a total delight.  Our room was perfect with everything we needed and more, beautifully and tastefully decorated, as are all the areas in the hotel. Bathroom was just fabulous. This hotel creates a feeling of being in a family country hotel - in the middle of a gorgeous part of Dublin.  Wonderful food and maitre d (and staff) in the Celler Room.   What can we say - perfection all round.  We would have quite happily not stepped outside the door of the hotel!",5,2012,11,29
200,Charming hotel with fantastic service,"The Merrion is a lovely hotel, but the staff- from the doormen to the concierge to the front desk who went above and beyond- made the stay all the more pleasant.  I found the pros to be: (1) the charming Georgian style of the hotel, including the cozy spots for tea, (2) the fantastic bathroom, including a large soaking tub, bath robes and toiletries from Asprey London, (3) the small extras such as fresh orange juice, fruit & tea outside the gym, (4) complimentary wireless, and (5) the staff who were always welcoming, friendly and ever so helpful.  The only slight con was the gym was a bit dark and could be larger with better equipment- for such a beautiful and meticulous hotel, it should have a top notch gym (although it does have a gorgeous pool & spa).",5,2012,11,26
200,Heavenly hotel in delightful Dublin,"Our family just returned from a weekend in Dublin at The Merrion, and we can't say enough nice things about this hotel. For its friendly and welcoming staff, its immaculate service, the gorgeous public rooms, the completely elegant, beautifully decorated (and quiet!) rooms and suites, and its perfect location, this is THE hotel you should choose for your stay in Dublin.  Did I mention the friendly and welcoming staff???  They were lovely with our children, and wonderful with all of us, anticipating our every need and accommodating any request with grace; every service, from housekeeping to room service to the help of the wonderful concierges and doormen, was executed perfectly and discreetly.  Somehow, The Merrion strikes a perfect balance between sheer elegance and total lack of snobbery.  Highly, highly recommended - we will definitely be coming back.",5,2012,11,25
200,"I call this Hotel ""Mary Poppins Practically perfect in every way""","My wife and I stayed here for three days to celebrate my 60th. On arrival there was a chocolate cake in my room marked ""Happy Birthday"" with compliments.It was far to nice to do it justice in mere words.I mention this not only to wet your lips but as an example of the service you can expect.
The Merrion is not just another 5star hotel with rooms and food of a quality to match it is somewhere special and what makes it so is its staff. They are without doubt the friendliest and most helpful of any other hotel we have stayed in and make you feel very special indeed.
""Mary Poppins"" Has  sprinkled some of her magic over this hotel.",5,2012,11,25
200,I will never stay anywhere else in Dublin.,"This is the fourth time I have stayed at The Merrion.  I have tried other allegedly comparable hotels in Dublin but none matches The Merrion for its excellent facilities, total professionalism, fabulous staff and delicious food.  You get what you pay for and it is worth every Euro.  
I happened to mention that a good friend of mine who had stayed at the hotel in September, had fallen in love with the spiced grape chutney which was served with a cheese plate in the bar.  As the chutney was not available to buy, member of staff went to the trouble to fill a pot for me to take home to her! 
It's a very special place.",5,2012,11,23
200,Yet another excellent visit,"This hotel cannot be faulted. The situation is perfect, the bedrooms spacious and comfortable, the food top quality . However what makes this hotel the best place to stay in Dublin is the staff---always helpful and friendly. We are looking forward to our fourth visit next month.",5,2012,11,23
200,top class service in a top class hotel,located in the centre of dublin we had a memorable weekend at the Merrion Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had a wonderful room and enjoyed friendly and efficient servcie from all the staff. nothing was a problem! we would highly recommend a stay at the Merrion!,5,2012,11,23
200,Lovely luxury in central location,"I don't know Dublin well, but have stayed in some beautiful hotels worldwide, and the quality of service and the hotel itself were an absolute treat! We only stayed one night, but would definitely return and have already started recommending this to others looking for a bit of pampering and luxury in the centre of town. ",5,2012,11,23
200,Elegant and top class,"Overnighted with my wife after watching a rugby match. Graceful, elegant, quiet and excellent service. Lunch at Patrick Guilbaud's restaurant was world class. Breakfast downstairs in the Cellar a feast.",5,2012,11,22
200,Merrion,"Fantastic hotel.  Nice blend of old with modern touches.  Spacious comfortable rooms,  Peaceful.  Located directly across from St Stephens Green and walkable to main shopping thoroughfare.  Excellent value.",5,2012,11,20
200,Another great stay,"We have stayed at the Merrion Hotel on four seperate occasions over the past five years.  We keep coming back because we feel it is the best place to stay in Dublin.  The staff are very attentive and the service is impeccable.  The food in the Cellar restaurant is excellent.  The Merrion is well located, being located within walking distance of Trinity College, the Natural History Museum, the National Art Gallery, shopping and many pubs and restaurants.",5,2012,11,17
200,Well worth the cost of staying here!,"This was not the most expensicve hotel we have ever stayed at, The Merrion is definitely one of the very best hotels we have stayed at ever. Its location is perfect for walking to dinner, pubs, tourist sites, shopping, etc., and the Hop On Hop Off Bus stops almost in front of the door. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable with no amenity overlooked. Staff are all amazing.",5,2012,11,16
200,excellent,Excellent hotel.Friendly staff.Great rooms.Without doubt a great 5 star hotel.Would highly recommend it.Bar prices are on high side but that unfortunately  is the norm for 5 star hotels.Pool and gym are in the basement and there is no supplement charge.Can't wait to go back,5,2012,11,16
200,Great hotel,"We had a super time here, the hotel was very well appointed, service not too in-your-face and the pool was lovely. In fact i can't think of anything to complain about apart from there being too many sweets in the mini-bar!",5,2012,11,13
200,Worth every penny,"If your budget can stretch to stay at the Merrion you will not be dissapointed . From the moment you arrive you feel as  if  wrapped in cashmere , the ambiance , the service and the food . This is the yardstick by which city centre  hotels should be meseaured .",5,2012,11,13
200,not a 5 star hotel,"You have a lot of better 5 star hotels in Dublin then The Merrion  Hotel.
Service was more of a 3 star. Breakfast was more than 45 minutes after we placed are order.
 The room was a  disappointment small and old. Service from the bar to the front desk is slow and 
and not attendant .You pay for the Merrion Hotel reputation but I saw none of it.This was my second and last time for The Merrion Hotel",1,2012,11,13
200,A Wonderful Experience,"We have stayed in many deluxe hotels over the years.  The Merrion ranks among the finest in all the criteria we judge a hotel by --service, room size and quality and restaurant service and quality.  The size of the room, quality of the furnishings, closet space and bathroom fixtures were outstanding.  The concierge, reception and bell service were as good as they get -- the employees acted as if we were old and good friends for whom they were doing a favor.  Quite remarkable.  Breakfast was delicious and our drinks and dinner at the Cellar were memorable.  The Merrion is conveniently located in an upscale but unpretentious area.  There are good pubs right around the corner.",5,2012,11,12
200,Lovley staff,Stayed here last weekend very friendly and efficient staff make you feel very welcome. We ate in the cellar bar food was very nice.Breakfast once again service fantastic but to be honest the breakfast itself while very tasty was a little mean you wouldn't want to be starving. The only negative i have is that the rugby was on and after we had checked out we had planned to go do a bit of shopping on grafton street but we were not allowed leave our car in the car park so we ended up just going home spoilt the day a little. It felt a little like we have your money next please. I understand they were probably very busy but we checked out around 11 going by hotel policy check out is 12 after spending 300 plus you would think a couple of hours wouldn't have mattered considering check in is 3pm.,4,2012,11,12
200,Very good,"I think I must be just too picky. I DID enjoy this hotel and it is very handy for the shopping in grafting street, but I was a little disappointed in the room. We went for the superior room, and in my book there wasn't really anything superior about it. It WAS very nice, don't get me wrong, Maybe I just expect too much...

The bar staff can be a little inefficient, but guys who work out front are very friendly and work so hard. Great ambassadors for the hotel.",4,2012,11,11
200,Dublin Stay,"The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful - from check-in to check out and every aspect in-between.  We were treated like Royalty.  
This is one of the top three hotels in the City of Dublin.
I would definitely go back.",5,2012,11,08
200,My wonderful treat,"My daughters gave me a wonderful treat last weekend - lunch and two spa treatments in the Merrion Hotel (one of my favourite places).  It was cold and miserable on Friday but once we went through the doors of the Merrion it was warm, comfortableand welcoming.    Lunch on Friday was excellent - not just the food and service but the friendliness of the staff was second to none.   One of my daughters accompanied me and we both had a great time.
On Saturday I had the Hot Stone therepy and a facial.    For two and a quarter hours I felt I was in another world.   I have never had anything like the hot stone treatment - it was super.  the facial was wonderful and the advice I was freely given should make me look ten years younger!  Irene who look after me was excellent in every way and never once made a negative comment about the condition of skin etc.   I did purchase some creams but never once did I feel I had to.
I will definitely return - The Merrion is a special place where you are made feel so welcome.
Thank you to all who made my weekend great.",5,2012,11,08
200,"Excellent service, beautiful hotel","Great service. When I arrived early, they offered use of the spa and pool. 
Quality of whole experience was first class. Would definitely recommend highly. 
Hotel set in Georgian area near to museums and gallery. 

One very minor suggestion to hotel, improve curtains on windows as street light showed through.",5,2012,11,07
200,excellent customer service,"Just want to praise the excellent customer service I experienced from this hotel. I had been given a present of a voucher for the champagne weekend but , when about to make a reservation, I discovered to my horror that the voucher could not be found. My contact with the hotel was with Sheila Lacey and she was the essence of kindness and sensitivity and was prepared to do everything possible to remedy the situation. Fortunately the voucher turned up and we hope to visit the hotel very soon. If the service we get there is similar to Sheila's I have no doubt that we will have a wonderful time. I have just returned from a  trip to The Holy Lands where hotel staff could learn a lot from their Irish counterparts.",5,2012,11,06
200,"Great service, great location","We stayed for a night with the dine and dream package. The hotel bumped us up to an £800 euro 
Suite for free! The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful. Best staff of a hotel we have ever come across. Suite was enormous and we felt v spoilt. Location was fab as it was central but v quiet. My only criticism was the meal included in the deal. The dessert was rice pudding and was dry and had obviously been made far in advance. Also, the choice of wine was limited to two house wines. We chose the Shiraz which wasn't nice. I ended up getting another glass of another wine at £10 euro! Should have been better wines available with the deal. Would def go back again but will prob not eat there at night. The breakfast was v good however.",4,2012,11,06
200,Business only,"Stayed at The Merrion Hotel on a recent business trip and since I chose the same hotel as on my last trip it must be ok... And it's fine - rooms are spotless, the hotel itself modern and well-kept, good training facilities (for those inclined) and well situated. Good service. Maybe not for romantic couples (unless you're over eighty) or the younger cliental (bit stuffy) or families for that matter, but for business most appropriate. Especially if you want to impress a client. Only complaint (not about the hotel) is Irish taxis - why do they only take cash (although I understand from the cabbies' point of view...).",4,2012,11,06
200,Truly 5 Star,"Have just completed a 2 night stay at the Merrion 
this was one of the best hotels that we have stayed in and we are regular travellers.From the moment we arrived service was immaculate and friendly, environment relaxing and what you would expect from a hotel of this class Particularly like the outstanding art work that forms part of the decor The paintings are similar to those found in the Irish artists section of the National Gallery 
Location excellent for sightseeing and choice of restaurants Concierge particularly helpful 
looking forward to returning and would not consider staying anywhere else in Dublin. All food eaten excellent especially the orange juice at Breakfast",5,2012,11,03
200,Best Guest Service Ever,"During my years of traveling, I have been quite fortunate to be the reciepient of 5 star service: the Plaza in New York, the Hay Adams in Washington D.C. and  Windsor Court In New Orleans. These places offered great customer service, but the pinnacle of service had to be my stay at the Merrion where you are treated with with great respect and hospitality by all the staff.  

We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel several hours early.  While all the rooms were full, the front desk did a great job in getting us into our room as soon as possible. No matter, who you dealt with at the hotel - front desk, concierge, doorman or wait staff, your comfort was their top priority. 

The atmosphere at the hotel was truly exceptional.  The hotel had two beautiful sitting rooms,surrounded by gorgeous art, were you could have a coffee in the morning, sip afternoon tea or have a nightcap in front of the fireplace.

Our room was quite comfortable.  While it was not as modern as some you see in the States it was nevertheless a great place to relax.  The highlight of the room was the bathroom which was large with beautiful granite and featured a separate tub/shower.  Housekeeping was terrific. 

During our six day stay we only availed ourselves once in having breakfast in the hotel.  We found the food to be excellent along with the service. And if you looking for a quick or an informal bite to eat at night try the hotel's bar.  My wife had the fish and chips and I had the hamburger, both meals hit the spot. Special thanks to the hostess who squezzed us in that busy night (again great customer service).

Overall, we loved Dublin, but staying at Merrion made our trip even more special.

P.S. Across the street from the hotel is Foley's Pub. Its a great place to spend an evening or to just have a nightcap.  It is where the locals go and it has a great selection of beers and comfort food with music every night.",5,2012,11,02
200,ultimate in luxury!!!,"i visited this hotel on the 25th aug 2012,it was a surprise 50th birthday pressie from my boyfriend.Having taken him to Seaham Hall for his 50th in april of this year i did not think he would be able to outdo me..........I WAS WRONG!!.......The overall package is outstanding,the staff were more than helpful,the hotel has the wow factor as soon as you walk in after being greeted by the concierge who took out luggage to the room,we were shown up ,where the staff had placed a complimentary fruit plate with ""happy 50th"" on it,we had a meal booked in the hotel that night and i have to say that the food is the best ive eaten as was the breakfast.Cant wait to go back!Its not just the ambience of the hotel its the friendly staff and location too.",5,2012,11,01
200,Get Married at the Merrion!,"We got married at the Merrion in October 2012.  

I cannot recommend this hotel enough to have a wedding in. I do not have a single complaint about the Merrion, including both the wedding preparation and the wedding day itself. We live in Australia, so the vast majority of decisions were made by email. 

We were looking for a couple of things: a hotel that could handle all the finer details as we weren't around, a good meal (my husband is a food snob, and really wanted a restaurant wedding, but it wasn't practical for us), and somewhere that my young nieces and nephews (we had 15 young children at the wedding) would be made welcome.  

We investigated a number of hotels known to have good restaurants and found that the Merrion was by far the most service-driven.  Even in early conversations, when we were just enquiring, no amount of questioning was too much for them, the event manager answered all emails immediately and with great patience. The hotel was clearly very flexible about accommodating what we want, and very welcoming of children.  The most interesting thing was that they were the most reasonably priced too, when the whole package was considered. 

The things we were most pleased with:

1. Our Event Manager, Jana, was just superb. I was able to arrive in Ireland a few days before the wedding with everything organised, nothing was too much for her. I also particularly appreciated that she accommodated everything we wanted, but if I was totally wrong she said so!

2. The service of other staff beforehand, and on the day. All guests were treated wonderfully, on the day itself, nothing went wrong whatsoever. There was always a staff member around when any little thing arose. 

3. The flexibility of staff in e.g. allowing my father in law to use their wheelchair around Dublin. 

4. The complete lack of pretention of the staff. All staying guests were treated very warmly. 

5. The reliability of everything; if a staff member said they would do something, it happened exactly as promised. 

6. The wonderful food at the meal and throughout our stay, really consistently high quality. 

7. The kids had a wonderful time, and really enjoyed their dinner, and the cupcakes prepared by the pastry chef.

8. The accommodation quality; we were devastated to be leaving, we can't wait to stay there again.     

9. My in-laws used the spa the day before and said it was great. 

10. The bill. While it's obviously not cheap, it was not at all as expensive as we thought it might be; All prices were explained when we first enquired, there were no hidden costs at all.

It really was as good a wedding as we could have hoped for, what more can you ask for?",5,2012,11,01
200,Pulls out all the stops...... just fantastic,"Recently promoted at work, this was a treat for me, and for my wife for putting up with me through the late nights, early mornings and 7 day weeks!!  The hard work, it paid off and the reward of a luxury stay was also worth it.  Very centrally located near the shopping district of Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green, we arrived on the eve of the Dublin City Marathon.  The area near hotel was busy but bags taken and car parked by the concierge immediately took the pressure of worrying about parking and hauling bags.  Special mention to Ramona at reception, quickly completing our check-in and showing us personally to our room.  From the outset the level of personal attention given by the staff was amazing.  The room was luxurious, with all trimmings laid on, and a complimentary bottle of Champagne!!, the usual comfortable bed, extra pillows tea/coffee making, toiletries etc, and then some more, slippers, bath robes, umbrellas, mini bar, sweets, crisps, chocolate, turn down service, complimentary paper....... and on it goes.  Our stay included dinner and breakfast, both of which I recommend.  Even the A-La-Carte dinner menu was terrific.  Staff again in the restaurant were very professional and friendly.  No request would become an issue!!  Food was delicious, cooked to perfection.  I love my food and it was great to get a menu that had choices you would not see elsewhere.  Breakfast again was great with a cooked breakfast and buffet style both served.  Morning staff were again friendly and very professional.  We were fortunate to have Ramona deal with our check out.  Because of marathon we could not get our car out but the hotel were more than willing to assist later in the day when we came back from shopping.  Overall I would give The Merrion Hotel 100/10.  Yes 100/10!! ;-)  It is not just because of the hotel and facilities or location, but it was definitely made by the friendly, professional staff.  Mr. McCann, Manager, well done to you and your staff.",5,2012,10,29
200,Well worth the price,"From the moment of arrival, the service is impeccable and friendly.  When we had a question, the staff went out of their way to answer the question and, if necessary, walk us to where we needed to be.  The hotel is very well kept and rooms quiet--which is very important to us.  When we return to Dublin, and we intend to, this is definitely where we'll stay.   Forgot to add that service in the restaurant was just as attentitive.

Can't beat the location for walking around the city--just needed a taxi one day to get out to a site we wanted to visit.",5,2012,10,29
200,Great Experience,Had a one night stay to celebrate my wife's birthday. As mentioned in other reviews the staff were very professional but extremely friendly. Our package included dinner and breakfast both of which were excellent. In addition to this the afternoon Champagne (also included in our package) went down a treat! This was accompanied by two bunches of grapes with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. The same sentiments were again written in chocolate on my wife's desert during dinner. Great touches. It was just perfect! We will certainly be returning.,5,2012,10,28
200,We'll tell everyone about it,"We came here for a quality stay and to be close to the Dublin Marathon. We were extremely surprised to see our choice was the right one when we arrived. First class location, service and attention to detail from the doorman, concierge, reception staff and bellman. The room was extremely clean, comfortable and wished for only a kettle as I needed boiling water for a Lemsip. Room service were happy to oblige. The beds are comfortable, the quality throughout, attention to detail and high level of service. If you want to spoil yourself in Dublin, stay here. We'll return and tell everyone about it.",5,2012,10,28
200,Old style understated elegance,"Spent a night at the hotel in order to visit Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.  Stayed in a deluxe room which was spacious and beautifully appointed with a view overlooking the garden.  The room was equipped with a large tv and Bose radio, the sofa and chair were very comfortable. It was a lovely place to relax before dinner and after breakfast while reading the complimentary newspaper.  The bathroom was large and well equipped and to the standard one would expect for such a hotel.  Both bars in the hotel are pleasant places to relax, my own preference is the Cellar Bar which is exactly that-a cellar.  The spa has a good easily accessible swimming pool and steam room as well as a small gym.  The staff throughout were courteous and helpful and always on hand. As the title states, the hotel exudes old style understated elegance and we hope to visit again for another special treat.",5,2012,10,28
200,Great stay at The Merrion Hotel,"We spent two nights in October at the Merrion Hotel in a deluxe room in the main house. Our stay included breakfast.  The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. The bathroom while not huge, was of a comfortable size and was also very clean.   Our room had a sitting area and I felt comfortable sitting on all of the soft surfaces.  The food at breakfast was varied and good.  Our stay included a Friday and Saturday night stay and the hotel was quite busy.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2012,10,27
200,Disappointing five star in Dublin,"Myself and my wife stayed here for the weekend principally because we had booked to eat on site in guilbauds and there was an offer of five hundred euros for bed and breakfast for the two nights which we reckoned was good value for a five star in a great location
The restaurant experience was indeed excellent
The room we had was ok 
The decor looks a little dated and the aircon was also only just ok
The curtains do not provide blackout at night
We were on the top floor and the water pressure in the shower was not very high

The biggest problem we had was with the breakfast and had problems both days
On the first day the coffee brought to the table was cold and was of course replaced but not with an apology but rather with an inane comment about needing hot coffee in Dublin 
The second morning was even worse in that my wife's cooked breakfast was brought to the table while she was still eating her fruit
It was brought away but when brought back fifteen minutes later was cold
Clearly the same plate of food
On this occasion there was a profuse apology and a fresh breakfast was brought
The breakfast itself was good 
In summary the accommodation is fine but our experience was less good than we had expected
We will not be staying again",3,2012,10,22
200,Excellent,"Wonderful long weekend here. Would stay here again. Good choice of resturants, helpful staff and good central location. Spa and gym lovely and well worth a visit. Afternoon tea is well worth sampling.………………",5,2012,10,21
200,First-timer: One of my top 3 hotel stays-classy but not snobby and worth the splurge,"My husband and I had considered The Merrion as a splurge during our Dublin trip, but opted for the Shelbourne because of a discount website deal and location. When our flights were unexpectedly delayed a day, we booked The Merrion as a last minute treat. This hotel is possibly the classiest I have ever experienced. Every aspect of our stay was luxurious: the customer service (which upgraded our room without being asked and allowed us to stay in the more historic part of the hotel), the accommodations (comfortable and plush with huge rooms and comfortable bedding), the spa, and my personal favorite, the dining. The Cellar Bar was a treasure. My husband and I ate in complete privacy within a vault in the converted historic wine cellar. The food was fantastic, not your average pub fare. The entire experience was so rejuvenating that my husband stayed at the hotel several hours beyond me in the morning despite the separate cab fares to the airport. :)",5,2012,10,20
200,"Fantastic, lived up to expectations and more!","So normally, when something is reviewed well, I tend to be disapointed after all the anitcipation. This was not the case with the Merrion. 

After staying at other 5 star hotels while travelling in Ireland, this was by far, the best one. 

The best: the staff were amazing and not stuffy as others had been at other hotels. They were very friendly and helpful. Not once did I feel out of the place. The room was fantastic. The slippers were so comfortable and the turn down service was really nice. The bed and pillows are fabulous. The attention to detail was evident. We ordered room service breakfast two mornings in a row and it was out of this world. So much food and good and hot. The coffee was the best I had in our travels. The bathroom had a seperate bath and shower, and had towel warmers. I did not spend much time in the commom areas but they seemed clean and nice. The consierge was spot on and recommended a wonderful restaurant not far away. 

The good: The cellar bar had good pints. The food was just ok and the menu fairly limiting. The sheets were good but I have slept in better ones. 

The Merrion is just miles ahead of other 5 star hotels, not just in Ireland but in North America as well. Probably my favourite I have ever stayed in. If i win the lottery, I would be here on a regular basis.",5,2012,10,20
200,Best hotel in Dublin!,"I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin and this one is by far the best!!! 
The hotel is located very central and just few steps from the famous and animated Graffton street. Furthermore the hotel is just 2 mins walk from the Stephen's Green Park.

My room was very big, with a balcony and the view in the gardens.

We had a brunch and one dinner at the hotel and it was delicious.

The service at the hotel is beyond good.

The communal areas are extremely cosy and the hotel is full of pieces of art.

If you want to have a chic and memorable stay in Dublin please stay at the Merrion!!",5,2012,10,15
200,Another great stay at the Merrion,The Merrion is still the best hotel in Dublin in my view and it was very busy on Saturday so its proving very popular in difficult times in Ireland. We were upgraded to the main house which is where I would recommend staying if you have the option. The rooms are bigger with nice high ceilings. The room is great but my only problem was I couldn’t find any toothpaste in the room. The breakfast was really good but I have had better in five star hotels. The service is great and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Merrion will always be my first choice.,5,2012,10,15
200,Service and location,"They fall over themselves to take care of you.
Great location but be careful about walking distances. Truly excellent and engaged staff. Nice pampering touches worth of the pricey rate. A tad stuffy in the common areas. Terrific bathroom and room comforts. Breakfast pricey but plenty of local pubs.",4,2012,10,14
200,Do Not Disturb,"Myself and my fiancée were given a gift of a Blue Book voucher recently which we decided to redeem at the Merrion Hotel Saturday 13 Oct 2012.
We arrived to a pleasant reception, and were guided to our room (134) by a member of staff.
We had booked a standard queen room and were quite surprised to find a cot, amongst other baby paraphernalia (most unromantic) taking up a large section of our rather small room.
We requested that the cot be removed and after about 10 minutes a porter arrived to take the cot away, but not before first asking (repeatedly) are we sure we didn't order a cot. After a prolonged discussion about our lack of cot requirements he finally accepted that we had not ordered it and dragged the cot rather unceremoniously out of the room. With the cot gone we had the chance to view the room properly for the 1st time....and found it to be underwhelming to the extent that it appears more like a 2/3 star rather that the luxurious 5 star we had been looking forward to. The decor was old and dated, the lamps shades hung haphazardly on the lamps (attention to detail not a strong point) the clock radio did not function at all. The room and the corridor leading to the room were decorated very poorly (again like something out a 2 star), there was absolutely nothing about the room that indicated luxury, class or sophistication....it was in fact a complete and utter disappointment,,,,not worth a €100 let alone the €250 they charge for the room. The telephone had telecom eireann written across it which gives you an idea of when the room was last renovated.      
The next morning following breakfast, which was adequate (there was a good selection, however the bread and cheese was certainly not fresh) we returned to our room and placed the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door and perhaps naively assumed from there that we would not be disturbed. However this was not the case. Within 20 mins (approximately an hour before check-out) there was particularly aggressive knocking on the door, which I answered. A porter rather rudely asked to be let in to check the mini bar. Out of absolute shock I let him in, however I must say I have never before experienced this treatment in any hotel, let alone one claiming to be a 5 star. The usual treatment being where on check-out you would be asked did you use the mini-bar facilities (which we didn't in any case). I found the treatment invasive, unnecessary and frankly unprofessional...again something I would not expect to experience in a true 5 star hotel.

Overall it was a very disappointing experience and not only would I not recommend the hotel but I will be actively encouraging colleagues and friends to steer clear of the place. MOST DISAPPOINTING.",1,2012,10,14
200,Lovely,"Hotel in excellent location. Quiet but very near to good restaurants pubs ans shops
Garden superior room was lovely.
Staff very helpful
Breakfast excellent
Definitely would recommend the place 
Suggest foleyy pub for great music and night out",5,2012,10,14
200,An outstanding hotel,"We spent a week at the Merrion and loved every minute of it. The service was outstanding, we had a beautiful suite and hosted lunches for guests there during several days. The location is excellent and we felt very much "" at home"". It is top of the market price wise in Dublin, but in our view, worth the premium.",5,2012,10,13
200,Charming,"We stayed 6 nights at the Merrion Hotel.  The staff was attentive.  Service was impeccable.  The room was a nice size, quiet, and all was very very clean.  
The entrance is nondescript, leaving the feeling that you are entering a house instead of a 5 * hotel.  Something a little more formal would be nice.
We had a bed and breakfast package, and the food was super.  
I recommend hot chocolate in the morning, formal tea in the afternoon, and late night irish coffee.",5,2012,10,12
200,"Great hotel, great dining, wonderful staff!","This is one of the best-run hotels I have ever stayed at. In addition to a beautiful building (the birthplace of the Duke of Wellington, if memory serves) the hotel boasts several fantastic restaurants. What really stands out, however, is the service -- an understated attention to detail. Imagine a place with beautiful 18th century furnishings that is more than just kid-friendly: everyone practically doted on our (active) 3 yr old. All hotels should be run like this. It could be located in cinderblock towers and it would still be memorable. Luckily it's located in a gorgeous Georgian mansion. Expensive, yes, but a bargain.",5,2012,10,11
200,WONDERFUL!,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights starting September 20.
The hotel is redone wonderfully to depict the time period. The rooms were spacious and immaculately clean.
The bathroom was incrediblly done in marble, with a separate shower and tub.
The bed and pillow were the most comfortable that we had on our two week vacation that spanned 3 countries and 5 hotels!
The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Even arranged a private driver for the day- Patty- who was the most personable and competent tour guide we had!
The hotel is central and walking distance to most downtown attractions and restaurants etc.
I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,10,07
200,The most magical Anniversary Break,"What an amazing experience we had in this beautiful and stylish Hotel!!! The staff were amazing, the rooms were out of this world and the food was to die for, can't wait to go back definitely gonna be our little Anniversary treat to ourselves each year. Couldn't think of a more romantic way to spend it! x",5,2012,10,04
200,Five Stars across the Board,"The Merrion Hotel provided the best service I have ever encountered.  The staff went out of thier way to insure we had a lovely visit.  Every time we left our room, some sort of fairy came in tidied up the place  :-)  We noticed during the first night that the air conditioning unit was not working properly and when I called down to the front desk, the clerk said he would try to reset the system.  He told me to call back if things did not improve wihin 15 minutes.  Since it was late, we fell asleep and when we woke up and realized the air still was not working, I called down again.  The front desk immediately dispatched a maintenance worker who had things fixed within 30 minutes.  He apologized profusley that we had experienced an issue and asked us to call again if there were any further problems.

The room was a decent size with a comfy bed, flat screen tv and pants press.  The bathroom was opulent and included towel warmers.  The hotel itself showcases many fabulous paintngs to make sure to take a tour.  The high tea looked delicious with plates of small cakes and petit fors.  The garden was absolutely beautiful and I can understand why it was the site of two weddings during our stay.

From the outside the hotel is very non-descript and you must know that it's there or you'll miss it.  Our standard room was very expensive, but quite honestly, I cannot think of another hotel that can match the Merrion in regards to service and comfort.  We have been spoiled for all other hotels.",5,2012,10,04
200,Amazing place!,"Everything was amazing from Check In to Check Out, we received a free upgrade to the Royal Suite as it was our Anniversary, we had a Spa Treatment which was very relaxing, the room itself was stunning with two amazing bathrooms, Cannot fault it at all.",5,2012,10,01
200,A stately home in Dublin City,"The Merrion Hotel is located just across the road from the offices of the Irish Prime Minister. An appropriate setting given the regal nature of this hotel. When you arrive at the Merrion, you are greeted by an exceptionally friendly doorman (a Dubliner through and through) and ushered into an atrium which would not be out of place in an Irish stately home. There's an understated elegance about the entrance hall which is discretely accentuated by the marvelous paintings hanging on the walls.

I stopped there for six days as part of a Dublin ""staycation"". I had a room towards the back of the hotel overlooking the garden. It was great to wake up in the middle of the city of Dublin in the morning to be greeted solely by birdsong and that all pervasive sense of calm characteristic of the Merrion. It was an immensely restful place in which to stay. My bedroom was well appointed and the bathroom was of the highest calibre.

 If ordering room service in the Merrion, can I recommend a simple dish which I thought was really A1?  Whilst recovering from a hectic night of revelry, I ordered the chicken broth with pasta and accompanying brown bread (which really hit the spot given the delicacy of my stomach at that particular point in time). For those of you with less simple tastes, the Michelin-starred Patrick Guilbaud restaurant is located in the Merrion (though it can be difficult to get a table there on weekend nights).

On fine days, it's possible to have a couple of beers and a light meal in the garden of the hotel. I invited a few friends to join me there and it was a really relaxing way to spend an evening.The only downside being that it rains quite frequently in Dublin; so you really have to make the most of both the sunshine and the Merrion's garden facilities on the good weather days. All in all, this is great hotel. occasionally available for highly competitive rates in the Euro 200-240 price range.",5,2012,09,28
200,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"This hotel has great character and a good location.   The service is attentive, without being overbearing.   Room service was uncharacteristically interesting and varied.

For travelers from the U.S. arriving on morning flights:  please don't expect rooms to be available when you arrive at 10:00am.   The hotel is often fully booked and the official check-in time is not until 3:00pm.  I watched while several couples tried to bully the front desk into providing rooms that simply weren't available because they were still occupied.   Either arrive with a change of clothes and head out for a walk or pay for the previous night to ensure a room is available on the morning of your arrival.",5,2012,09,28
200,Merrion Hotel,"Spent our last two nights in Ireland at the Merrion Hotel.  We were two couples traveling together and I asked if they could place our rooms in the same area of the hotel.  This seemed to create a bit of a problem for the front desk and I appreciate the effort but after 10-15 minutes I was sorry I had asked.  They finally did make the arrangement and the rooms were very spacious, although I was uncomfortable using a handicapped accessible room when it might have been needed by someone else.  The bar/lounge is nice but I never felt completely comfortable.  The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful.",4,2012,09,26
200,Fabulous!,"The Merrion is a top-rate hotel. We stayed in a beautiful, large room in the old house, and nothing could be faulted. It's understated elegance at it's best. The service was also exceptional, very professional, friendly, and helpful. The food in the cellar restaurant was excellent, and the cellar bar is cozy and welcoming. (They used to offer a phenomenal wine selection by the glass, but they've recently cut way back.) Our favorite place to stay in Dublin!",5,2012,09,23
200,Finishing Third,"We recently stayed at the Corinthia, London, the Four Seasons, Hampshire, and the Merrion in Dublin. Perhaps because of the hotel's web site and because of the adulatory reviews  on TripAdvisor, we expected  a different experience from the one we encountered. Compared to the previously mentioned hotels, the Merrion ranks a distant third.Such comparisons may be unfair, but perhaps they are also inevitable.
   The disappointment is essentially centered on the rooms. I say plural, because we looked at several. Some of the rooms have little or no view, and natural light is limited.  Rooms up to the level of a junior suite  offer just  three drawers for your clothes. To repeat, three drawers in one of two closets. The rooms are large, the beds are quite comfortable. But the  recent redecoration--the Merrion is an old hotel--is , to be generous, odd. The furniture boasts a crackle finish (suggesting  something antique, I suppose) that is reminiscent of some mid-range motels in the U.S. The bathrooms have been swathed in marble. Instead of supplying a dignified feeling of swank, the result is confusing. It doesn't feel like what the Merrion should feel like.The hotel seems to  suffer from a sort of decorative schizophrenia.

This is emphasized by the progression a traveler goes through. You enter the hotel through a smallish door in a Georgian facade.  Pass the concierge desk, and ahead lies registration. To get to your room, you pass through  several public rooms, open and airy, furnished with comfortable sofas and armchairs. Here you can enjoy breakfast or tea or a drink from the bar nearby.  A fireplace burns wood and peat, thus providing an aromatic sense of Ireland's  glorious countryside. As you progress, you get a glimpse of the hotel's garden, which is lovely. You feel at that moment as though you are being welcomed into a country house hotel, not necessarily modern, but distinguished and cosseting. The staff does a wonderful job of supplying the latter, always cheerful and obliging. The art sprinkled throughout the hotel is wonderful. But the initial promise of a memorable experience  is severely jolted by what awaits when you enter your room.
I might very well stay here again. But my anticipation would be tempered by experience.",3,2012,09,23
200,excellent service,"excellent service from check in to check out. Rooms were spacious , and a large , very very comfortable bed. Very nice tea rooms.
Nevertheless, In my opinion, prices for the rooms are  a little too high for the value you get.",4,2012,09,22
200,Art Tea,We did not stay at the hotel but we did have their Art Tea and it was truly a special event. We received very attentive service and the tea was exquisite right down to the art-inspired desserts. The gardens were lovely and we enjoyed strolling around after the tea.,5,2012,09,22
200,A great hotel,"Some people think that 5 stars are for mints on pillows, rose petals in baths and towels made to look like swans.  Whilst this may be fine for honeymoons, I want something very different for 5 stars - a hotel that puts its customers at the centre of what it does and then delivers.  This the Merrion does.  The rooms are not that different to most 5 star rooms - marble bathroom, robes, Asprey toiletries, the usual bits and pieces - all there.  Big, serene rooms overlooking a delightful garden or the Irish Parliament building, etc.  Expensive but I did not begrudge it one bit.

What sets it apart is attention to detail.  Example - we had 4 relatively minor issues with our room, none of them deal-breakers but mentioned them to reception at 10 am as we went out.  We forgot our map and went back to our room 10 minutes later to find all four issues 100% sorted, including a note about why one of them had been sorted in a particular way.  Message on our phone when we got back some hours later:  were we satisfied with how our issues had been sorted, if not an extension to call.  Now that is what I call customer service!

Art tea - pure theatre and delicious, though far too much food!  Here again, attention to detail: extra food put in elegant doggy bag without being asked!

Ate at the hotel Cellar Bar twice - delicious food.  The first time I can recall asking for a medium-rare beefburger and getting EXACTLY that.

Could not imagine wanting to stay anywhere else if I return to Dublin.",5,2012,09,22
200,Nice hotel - disappointing breakfast and grumpy bar service,"Hotel facilities and rooms are nice, location can't be beaten. However, two items make me rate this with only 4 stars: breakfast: buffet minimal, fruit bland, ordered ham and cheese omelet came with some weird baked meat instead of ham, orange juice fresh but filtered (?). Second point: bar service grumpy, we do come and sit here for a pleasant moment so no need to be overly formal and never put a smile on your face as a waiter. Nice but I would rather stay at the Four Seasons.",4,2012,09,20
200,Our Honeymoon Stay,"We spent all 7 days of our honeymoon at The Merrion and it was an incredible experience. The hotel staff were very friendly, the hotel was remarkably beautiful, and our room was amazing. We would highly recommend The Merrion Hotel for anyone visiting Dublin or the surrounding area.",5,2012,09,18
200,Dublin delight,"An excellent hotel, with superb bedrooms. The staff are delightful and very helpful. The food and wine list are comprehensive and amazing. The courtyard of the hotel is an oasis of tranquility and very peaceful. Overall a truly great experience.",5,2012,09,16
200,Really lovely,"We had a lovely stay at the Merrion.  Our room was beautiful and the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The location is fantastic.  We also got there a bit early, and they were very accommodating.  Ditto on the way out when we needed to store our luggage during the day.  Up there with the best hotels in the world.",5,2012,09,14
200,A great hotel in a great part of Dublin city.,"This is a beautiful old first class hotel, well trained staff in a very nice and convenient part of Dublin City. The service was very good and the the doorman was a great help with directions. I will plan on going back here.",4,2012,09,14
200,Pure class!,"Myself and my wife and our 3 month old baby stayed here for a week prior to relocating to Asia from Dublin. Our house had been rented, and The Merrion was among the options we had to choose from. Having been a few times previously for drinks and dinner, I had no hesitation in booking. And we weren't disappointed. As somebody from Dublin, I felt very at home here. The locations is amazing and I would say is the prime Dublin location for a tourist. 

The Cellar Bar in the hotel definitely does Dublin's best value burger. And the Guinness isn't bad either. Rooms spacious and clean with a huge comfortable bed. Staff helpful and courteous. Wilst we were there, the weather was lovely for a few days and we sat out for coffee and drinks in the large courtyard. It was spectacular. 

I'm lucky to have stayed in some nice hotels over the years, but this one is up there with the best. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I'd be amazed if you can find many faults in this place on a trip to Dublin!",5,2012,09,12
200,Stylish without pretense.....,"The hotel is in quite a good location....feels private yet close to all....the hotel is quite stylish with its own personality and without feeling generic at all......the imperfections aesthetically such as various areas that appeared worn actually seemed correct or deliberate as if they should feel worn, similar to an old home or a classic boarding school from the early 20th century....the creaks in the floor, for instance, seemed correct.  The service is sensational....it is not intrusive, yet there isn't a request that is not fulfilled immediately and the staff is truly professional without being pretentious.  The quality of service and technique of this hotel should be studied and used as an example for other hotels to follow.
As for negatives, the decoration of the hallways in the new building felt a bit clinical.  In addition, the console tables in front of the elevators in this building were lacking decoration completely so this area felt neglected.  The shower stall within the bathroom of the room was quite small yet functional I suppose.  The general feel of the bathroom was lacking a bit in luxury.  The design of the swimming pool and gym area is quite basic and also does not feel luxurious....these areas actually feel generic similar to a budget chain hotel.  Further, the restaurant that served breakfast is located on the lower level and is without windows...it simply isn't appealing....would have been lovely to have some sort of a view....perhaps of the garden of the hotel......however, overall, the hotel gets very high marks.",4,2012,09,10
200,"One of the best in the world, not just Ireland","Just spend 4 nights here, and I can only say that there are few exclusive hotels in the world that I have enjoyed as much. Service is superior. Hotel common areas are warm and filled with artwork. The Cellar restaurant and bar are fantastic hideaways. I travel on business all too often, and this time I took my wife along. She enjoyed the spa, the pool, the superior staff that was attendant to very need. A true superior 5-star experience",5,2012,09,08
200,Exceptional,"6months have passed since I last stayed at the Merrion.On that occasion I wrote a review that was superlative.
It's probably not possible to improve on superlative but if it is the Merrion has to have done it.The way my laundry was returned.My freshly polished shoes were returned stuffed with and wrapped in tissue paper.
Last time I thought the quality of the Irish Coffee was so-so but without complaint it improved.
As I write this from one of the major Swiss cities I can only write""swisshospitality eat your heart out""The Merrion has my heart.",5,2012,09,06
200,Dublin Grandeur at its best,The Merrion is easily the classiest hotel in Dublin. It an old fashioned grandeur that is not found in any of the more recent pretenders. The location is excellent as well being only a short stroll to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. The food and service is always good and the rooms are excellent. It is pricey for a family but great for any other occassion.,5,2012,09,06
200,A Fabulous Place to Stay in Dublin,"The Merrion is a very impressive hotel.  From the moment you walk through the door, you know you are in a special place.  From the smell of peat burning fireplaces, to the amazing art collection, to the tranquil gardens, to the comfortable and well appointed rooms, to the best restaurant in Ireland (Patrick Guilbaud), to the convenient location, to the amazing staff – The Merrion does not disappoint.  

While visiting Dublin, I fell and broke my shoulder.  The staff at The Merrion went above and beyond all expectations to ensure that I was comfortable and continued to enjoy my trip.  A huge thank you to everyone at The Merrion for your concern and support.  It is times like this that hotels either impress or disappoint.  The Merrion did not disappoint.

My husband and I travel extensively and can honestly say that The Merrion is now one of our favourite hotels.  We will definitely be back.",5,2012,09,05
200,Great again.,"This was my second stay at The Merrion Hotel , what I call the only place to be when in Dublin.
It was a great to be recognized at a distance by the doorman approaching me outside as I walked toward the hotel with my luggage, a great smile . At check in Tina at the front desk was very welcoming and made me feel I had reached a familiar and warm place. She offered to try again for some restaurant reservation and she managed to get me a table at a great restaurant in town promptly.
Room was great a Deluxe with Garden View well appointed as usual with a chilled bottle of Champagne waiting ( it was part of my rate package).
Breakfast was included and it was fresh and tasty waiters were extremely professionals and mostly they all seem to remember your name ..that I find really amazing.
My 2 days at The Merrion went quickly but I felt really rewarded in terms or customer recognition , ambiance, service, relax . No words can describe the level of attention and service that you receive at this property. I am already looking forward to stay there soon. Thanks to all .",5,2012,09,04
200,Beautiful hotel in Dublin city centre,"The Merrion is a truly beautiful hotel.  It has gracious and dignified public rooms downstairs - a succession of 2 or 3 lounges, at least one of which had a fireplace.  On a recent stay in July, we stayed just one night but we were treated like royalty from the start.  Excellent bell captain who welcomed us courteously and took care of our bags promptly.  Check-in was excellent with a very capable receptionist who showed us to our room in the old part of the house (the nicest part - more expensive but worth it, as the rooms have more character and there are not the long  corridors in the new part). 

Our room was excellent - luxurious as you would expect, with a comfortable King Size bed and great bathroom.  Only drawback -we had no street view whereas on previous stays we have looked out on to Merrion Street.  On the other hand, we were on a bargain rate so...

We had room service on arrival and it was very prompt and served professionally.

On this occasion we did not go shopping or sightseeing as we were heading off to the countrside, but the Merrion is is a great location for shopping, gallery visits.  It is just beside two great parks: the busy and beautiful Stephen's Green and the quiet park in Merrion Square which is enchanting. 

The staff of this hotel are uniformly courteous, professional and friendly. There is a wonderful doorman/concierge called Patrick who recognized us the moment we walked in - and called us by name, even though we had not been back for a couple of years.  Amazing.  His colleagues are superb too, in all departments.  But he does stand out as the sort of staff you hope to find in Ireland.

We had guests to drinks and dinner on the evening of our stay.  We met them in the Lounge, strolled around the beautiful gardens and had a drink (beautifully served).  Then dinner next door about which we shall write a different review.  Next morning, we had a full Irish breakfast for two -this means you do not need anything to eat until dinner!  Then a short taxi ride to pick our rental car downtown.  Perfect experience at the Merrion. You can always tell - if you do not wince at the bill, it means you have got value for money.  if you leave with a smile on your face, as we did, it means the stay was special.  This was a wonderful way to begin our long weekend in Ireland.  We will be back!",5,2012,09,04
200,Breakfast problem,"WE stayed here for only one night and this may not be a fair review. I don't know what part of the hotel we were in, but the room was very nice and very modern with shades of gray everywhere.  We had only one issue and was the breakfast service.  The hotel was full, but they made no arrangement to get more staff for breakfast.  You had to wait for quite a long time and then when you got a table the buffet was basically empty.  We were also seated next to the buffet which was actually a very, very small buffet--the length of a long banquet table.  It was annoying to be constantly bumped and then to feel that you should be thankful you had a seat.
The main dishes came from the kitchen and were served quickly.  But we left the hotel with the view that it could have done better.  This was particularly annoying as we were told this is the most expensive hotel in Dublin.  We had stayed in the Shelbourne and they were much better organized.",4,2012,09,03
200,Amazing break away  with our young family,"We stayed for 3 nights in the Merrion Hotel in a deluxe room in the Main House. Room was excellent, spacious, immaculately clean, turn down service very good twice daily. We had our 2 children with us, age 3 and 11 month old, the hotel could not be more obliging and accommodating and welcoming. Very family orientated with kids menus, kids dressing gowns and slippers, balloons in the restaurant, lovely childrens delphware and crockery. Every member of staff was most courteous. Food is absolutely delicious, full irish full breakfast was a must and the continental buffet selection was also very inviting!! Lunch in the drawing room was also very good, you can reserve table if you prefer. Turf fires lovely feature. Decor was very sophisicated throughout hotel. The Cellar restaurant was excellent, good menu selection and wine menu. The Tetra Spa swimming pool is very good, kids loved it too. The pool was never busy or crowded. Lovely herbal teas, fruit and water available to spa/pool users/observers. Unbeatable location, 5minute walk to main shopping areas.  We absolutely loved it and will return again on our next trip to Dublin. ",5,2012,08,30
200,Expected better from a 5 star,"Firstly I should point out that I struggled over giving the 3 star rating as we did enjoy aspects of our weekend stay at The Merrion. However, when you book a 5 star hotel you should accept nothing less than 5 star quality. There is an expectation which any guest should have when staying in such a property. We booked a belated anniversary 2 night stay and arrived at the hotel to be greeted at reception by the very helpful Ramona. She advised that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room in the main house and promptly escorted us to our room. The room was fantastic and very large with a super king sized bed. No view to speak of but that didn't matter to us. There was a plate of chocolate covered strawberries on the table and a happy anniversary note from the manager. This was a much appreciated gesture. At about 11pm we got a very strong smell of cigarette smoke in our room. It appeared to be coming from the room directly opposite ours. I called reception to notify them and to check if the room opposite was a smoking or non smoking room.  I was advised that all rooms were non smoking but at times, and at the hotels discretion, they permitted smoking in certain rooms. The smell died down and we went back to bed only to get the same strong smell again at around midnight.  We called reception again and they offered to move us. We were moved to a much smaller room although I believe this was still the same category as the room we were vacating. My main problem here is that the management would rather move us, the innocent party, instead of either moving those causing the smell or indeed not permitting it in the first place. Our original room was located at one end of the main house where there is only one other room in the vicinity. It seems crazy to me to allow guests in one of these rooms to smoke as, was proven by us, the smoke will find its way into the room opposite. This is a big mistake by management and shows lack of respect to all guests as there is no question that non smokers will find the smell repulsive. We settled down in our new room although we missed the grandeur of the room we had previously.  It felt like our upgrade had been taken away from us.  The porter who brought us to our new room immediately recognised that the room was not as good but promised that it was still the same category.

At breakfast the next morning my wife ordered the pancakes with maple syrup. Her first pancake was fine but she got a strong taste of onions on the second one.  Not what you would expect of a 5 star breakfast.  We advised a waitress and we heard her entering the kitchen while very loudly telling the kitchen staff of the problem. It would have been much more polite to be discreet and not broadcast the issue especially from the hotels point of view I would have thought

There were no other problems other than a pigeon getting into our room one morning but we managed to get it out quickly

The general ambience of the hotel was good and the majority of the staff were excellent, however, we don't feel the smoking issue was handled well and the problem is the policy in the first place.  If you are going to have smoking rooms then fine, but keep them away from the non smoking rooms otherwise problems such as ours will arise

I really was disappointed with The Merrion on this ocassion. There are some things a 5 star hotel should never get wrong. One of those is it's smoking policy and I feel short changed because of our experience.  It should never be acceptable for a hotel to move guests because of an issue like this.  It totally disturbed our weekend and we didn't receive full value. I will recommend the Shelbourne over the Merrion to anyone that ever asks given our disappointment.  We stayed at The Shelbourne last year and were treated like 5 star guests from start to finish",3,2012,08,30
200,A 5 Star Hotel that offers 5 Star Experience,"Yes as a 5 star rated hotel it is expensive but if you want an experience in true luxury, fine dinning and world class service sometimes that's the cost you pay.

I went with my partner for my 30 and from the moment we checked in to our departure it was red carpet service all the way. The staff just cant do enough for you, the food is pure perfection I had the steak and it was like butter in my mouth. The rooms just oozes comfort and that feeling that you could juts live here permanently.

If I had to pick one negative it was the leisure club which seems to be unmanned a lot of the time.",5,2012,08,29
200,Amazing,"Absolutely beautiful hotel and wonderful service.  The Merrion is located in a central part of Dublin close to everything.  I would highly recommend, though doesn't appear to be tailored to young families. Cellars restaurant was very good.",5,2012,08,24
200,Best Dublin hotel,"We spent 2 nights there recently.  Absolutely beautiful hotel with great service.   Rooms are absolutely perfect and the common rooms are great.  Hotel's afternoon tea seemed very popular.  Also, highly recommend the Cellar bar for drinks.  Very cool space",5,2012,08,24
200,The Cellar Bar & The Terrace at the Merrion Hotel,"I stopped by this hotel to see what I had passed up by staying at the Four Seasons.  This was high on my list of places to stay at the beginning of my vacation and wish I had stayed here as opposed to my second hotel in Dublin at the end of my trip which was ranked in the top-3 at the time of booking.  I won't name the awful place within this review though.

Anyway, The Merrion looked great and I decided to sit in the Terrace area by the fountains in the back to have tea & scones.  It was beautiful, quiet & peaceful back there.  The service was excellent and I wish I could remember the name of my server because he was very attentive, polite, friendly and personable.  If the management reads this and wants to compliment their server, he had red hair & we talked about how the Merrion was the first and only place where I found a type of Assam tea that is very common in Japan.  He would hopefully remember that reference & be able to complete the type of tea I was happy to find.  He deserves some recognition as I spent quite a long time relaxing there so he brought me hot water & poured it for me a few times when I was about to do it myself.  

So, the Assam tea was a bonus find and then they had proper clotted cream which was also rare during my trip to Ireland.  People in Cork didn't even know what it was !?  A cafe owner with excellent scones said, ""I think it's like butter and a Welsh thing.""  I had no idea how to respond to that one.

On the down side, the scones were actually gross.  I couldn't even finish them because I used all of the clotted cream to cover the bland, dry taste.  I forced myself to eat a second one so my server wouldn't question me.  The whole experience was too close to perfection, I guess.  

I would have rated this review as ""average"" based on this disappointment alone but because of the server & atmosphere, I went with a ""very good"" rating.  Also. this is within the hotel guest reviews so I did not want to hurt their ranking based on their scones being nasty.  They were definitely the least delicious scones of my entire 16-day trip where I ate them almost a dozen times or more.  I was stumped by them.  (Dry, tasteless & the consistency wasn't right.  They were similar to stale bread.)  Luckily, I got cookies with the tea and those were very good so I enjoyed them instead.  Enough talk about the bad scones!

After my tea break, it was almost time for the Katy Taylor gold medal boxing match so my server found out that the fight would be on the TV's in The Cellar bar so I went downstairs for a couple pints of Guinness.  The atmosphere & service down there were just as great as The Terrace.  The servers weren't as friendly but they were distracted by the fight maybe.  I was too full to try any food after having 4 meals on my last day in Ireland so I only drank beer and watched the fight which was actually well before dinner time.  There was an American family near me and they raved about the bar food.  

Very cool atmosphere down in the Cellar Bar and Cellar restaurant so I will definitely go back when I am in Dublin for my next vacation.",4,2012,08,23
200,Do you want to stay with the hoy poloy? This is it.,"One of the grandest hotels in my experience. There are three doormen in top hat and tails at the front door, a concierge just within, and a very capable staff at the desk. Our room was a junior suite, and there was a bottle of brut French champagne there when we arrived. The sitting area had two full sofas facing one another, there was a writing desk, and a great bathroom and dressing area. 

Views were of the central courtyard, which is beautiful and fully landscaped. The hotel has a marvelous light dining restaurant within, and next door with an entrance through the hotel lobby is the only two star restaurant in Ireland. Really superb. Service is how a place gets a third star, and there were so many staff there that your empty plate seemed to be accompanied by the magical appearance of someone to clear it. But the pace of serving was just slow enough for digestion between courses. Of course, excellent but haughty French service and no one cracked a smile.

Breakfasts were included for us, and were incredible, whether a full Irish artery-clogging one, or fresh fruit, yougurt and homemade muffins, hot from the oven in the kitchen. Worth spending an hour there.

The lobby was full of business people and well dressed travelers, very pleasant and convenient to everything in central Dublin. I would look forward to the city just to know I was staying at the Merrion.",5,2012,08,22
200,My favorite hotel in Dublin!,"A delightful experience from start to finish. 
We arrived at the hotel directly from the airport, tired and jet lagged. It was going to be a while untill our room would be ready - since it was only mid morning - so we settled into the cozy drawing-room right off the reception area. We enjoyed a light repast of tea and sandwiches before strolling through the exquisite gardens. Before long, our room was ready.
Never did I pass a member of the staff in the hallway without being offered a cordial greeting. This is truly a distinguished 5 star hotel well deserving of accolades.",5,2012,08,22
200,Great hotel in fantastic central location,"This is a great hotel which lives up to the expectations of a five star hotel. Service, rooms, facilities etc are all excellent. The staff in particular are a real asset and nothing is too much trouble. I only walked through the front door for the second time and the concierge was greeting me by my name! The only meal we had in the hotel was breakfast which was good, although on our last morning it was busy and staff struggled to cope with so many tables and with keeping the buffet topped up. Breakfast can be slow since all hot food is A La Carte, so don't expect a speedy meal. Our daughters had room service one evening and said it was the best spaghetti bolognaise they had ever had. The pool is tranquil and the gym is well equipped despite being small. A much larger hotel than I had anticipated but with the personal feel of a smaller boutique hotel. Well worth visiting.",5,2012,08,20
200,Pure Class,"This is an excellent hotel from the minute you pull up outside you are looked after like a VIP. The concierge and reception staff are impeccably trained. The hotel is traditional in terms of staff dress & decor but that is what makes this hotel so special. Our room was clean, comfortable and spacious. Cocktails in the garden terrace are a must! The gardens are beautiful. This is a central hotel but has all the details and feeling of a country retreat.",5,2012,08,20
200,A touch of class,"We splashed out to stay at a special place while we were in Dublin in July. The price was actually very reasonable for the quality of the experience.

The most memorable thing was the experience as a whole. The hotel is four grand Georgian terraces jouned together. The lounges are quite grand with silver service, concierge with top hats etc. The nice thing was that the service was of a high level with absolutley no pretence. We felt very welcome.

The main lounge had a fire going (yes mid summer in Ireland!) where you could relax and have a coffee, wine, or as we had, a whole dinner in front of the fire.

The hotel is also well located in a nice area near St Stephens Green. We would stay here again

Oh, and a great pool",5,2012,08,19
200,If I could afford it I would be back.,"Spent one night here for wedding anniversary. 

Is truly a five star experience from the moment you arrive to have your car valet parked.

Confident, efficient, pleasant staff, unobtrusively ensuring everything  happens apparently effortlessly.
 
Everything is five star including the price, so do not expect any affordable deals, or not to spend while you are here. Even for the high quality I thought the price was a bit steep - but then I am a Scottish accountant. 

Public areas, room, breakfast , every member of staff we encountered - all impossible to fault.

One thing that (pleasantly) surprised me on the weekend night we stayed was that there were several (all very well behaved) children staying in the hotel - to be honest I would not have thought of taking our son kid here as would have not expected it to be family friendly, but it clearly is.

I knocked one star off overrall for value - which is probably harsh when discussing a 5 star hotel.......

 If I could afford it I would be back!",4,2012,08,17
200,Fine hotel,"This hotel just isn't my cup of tea! I've been told that it was recently renovated but I couldn't see where. Whilst my room was immaculately clean, the decor is old. The furniture is painted and there's a bedspead and woollen blanket on the bed. The bed was old and soft aswell. 
The staff were lovely and there's plenty of them. There was a mix up with my luggage on the first day which was very annoying and then they didn't offer me an upgrade although they did to my colleague in front of me. I thought this was very poor. There's no iron in the room and you have to request a tea service. 
This is in a great location although there are other great hotels in Dublin which are closer to the centre, Shelbourne, Wwestbury, Fitzwilliam, etc.",3,2012,08,15
200,great hotel,fun luxurious place to stay.   best hotel in Dublin by far.    bar is great and pool / spa is very well run.  cellar restaurant is superb.   highly recommended for business or family travel.  valets and doormen are a great help and very courteous.,5,2012,08,12
200,Simply the best,"This hotel has it all: friendly service, perfect location, beautiful rooms, good bathrooms, etc.  We ended every night with a cozy beverage in front of the fireplace in the drawing room. Also be sure to get a drink in the cellar bar. Excellent venue and top notch cocktails. Luxury and comfort all around. And it is possible to get a good deal so you don't have to pay luxury prices. ",5,2012,08,11
200,Unforgettable,"A friend and I stayed in The Merrion Hotel in July this year.  We booked the dine and dream package, which is really good value.  From beginning to end our stay was faultless, friendly courteous staff, fantastic food, very comfortable room, go on treat yourself",5,2012,08,11
200,Very disapointed,We were very disapointed with the Merrion Hotel. It was overpriced fro what you got. The staff were not friendly. The beds were very unconfortable. There was a lot of noise at night (when I complaned the staff did notting). The breakfast was not great. So over all I was very disapointed but my stay.,1,2012,08,11
200,In a class of its own!,"A genuine five star hotel in the very heart of the city. You could be put off if you looked at the headline rates but there are plenty of really good deals on offer. I would book directly with the hotel's own website and if you have any queries simply phone them. I did, and they couldn't have been more helpful.
Not only did I get an amazing deal at a fraction of the full price, including a bottle of champagne waiting in an ice bucket in the room on arrival! but also a three course meal with a lovely bottle of wine in the Cellar restaurant all in the price. And if that wasn't enough, on arrival they had taken note of the fact that we were celebrating our anniversary and upgraded us for free to a 'palace' of a room in the main house.Absolutely beautiful.
The staff are incredibly professional whilst still managing to be relaxed, a real credit to the hotel.
Even if you don't stay here I would try the Cellar Restaurant where the staff show great pride in and are very knowledgable of the food which they serve.
The ribeye steak was simply the best I have ever tasted!",5,2012,08,09
200,Life is Merry at The Merrion,"We stayed for one incredible night at The Merrion and I didn't want to leave.  From the moment our bags were wisked away from the car, to the fast and pleasant check-in, to the escorted walk to our room - I felt like I was living a fairy tale.  When I entered the room I knew the fairy tale had come to life.  The high ceilings, the chandeliers, the fireplace, the view of the street, the marble bathroom, the kingsize bed ... I could go on and on.  This was our last night in Ireland and the only thing I did not get to do was stay in a castle and The Merrion made my last wish come true!  The room was so amazing I didn't want to leave, even for dinner.  So we ordered room service and had the best steak dinner in the most fantastic setting.  We briefly left the room to tour the gardens (very elegant), the spa (wish we had longer to stay) and the restaurants.  I have stayed in many nice, upscale hotels but this was one of the best.  I highly recommend splurging, even if for one night.  You won't regret it!",5,2012,08,08
200,The Place to Stay,"Recently had a 5 night stay at the Merrion, the third time I have stayed there. Don't think that I would ever consider staying anywhere else in Dublin. From the moment you arrive, bags collected, pleasant check in, drinks in the bar and drawing rooms and through to check out, the staff are absolutely excellent.
Despite being 5 star there is no feeling of stuffiness that one sometimes encounters, you are made to feel at home and nothing is too much trouble. Had a lovely room overlooking the garden which was very nice.
Hotel location is great in a quiet spot but only a short walk to the centre and there are several very good testaurants less than 5 mins walk away.
We decided to splash out for our first time in the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant, which defintely needs a reservation due to popularity. It is expensive but well worth the cost and it was definitely a meal and experience to remember.
If you don't wish to have breakfast at the hotel then I can recommend Foley's just around the corner which is very good value and quality.
Already looking forward to my next stay at the Merrion.",5,2012,08,03
200,Delightful Hotel,"My partner and I  stayed here for just one night.  We so enjoyed our stay. The staff were so helpful and friendly.
Our room was so comfortable. We enjoyed an excellent breakfast. 
Hope to return  soon - perhaps before Christmas.",5,2012,08,03
200,The best hotel ever!!,"On our way from Paris, we stopped in Dublin for a 3 day visit--our first trip ever to Ireland.  We found the Merrion Hotel from other visitors that went there and posted their comments on Trip Advisor. We made the right choice. This hotel is perfect, everyone who works there is pleasant, helpful and makes you feel like a million dollars. The rooms are spacious, clean completely new. The concierge gave us suggestions prior to our arrival which helped us plan daily trips.  Oh, and the spa-had a Balinese massage and swam in the most beautiful pool.  Even my 16 year old daughter forgot about shopping for a moment to enjoy the spa! We recommend the hotel and will return there in the future.",5,2012,08,01
200,They have thought of everything,"From the staff, to the scrumptious food, the level of detail is superb. Nothing was too much trouble and all the small touches dropped by so many other hotels can be found from the sewing kit, umbrella for the rain (an essential in Ireland), complimentary newspaper hanging outside your bedroom door. Great city centre location but 2 streets away from the noise and bustle.",5,2012,07,30
200,Excellence!,Beautiful hotel. Wonderful service. Definitely five star experience. The rooms were spacious. The grounds beautiful. The food was wonderful. From check in to check out top notch service. Very impressed. Hope to stay there again someday. ,5,2012,07,29
200,Fantastic,"Just back from a great weekend in the Merrion, the hotel is beautiful and the staff outstanding (Thanks Katie for the upgrade!); the service is very attentive, and very friendly. Special thanks to the barmen in the Cellar bar. Our stay could not have been better, looking forward to going back.",5,2012,07,29
200,Traditional with modern comfort,"A great hotel to stay in. When first entering, it takes you back in time with nice sitting areas and open fire places, the perfect place to have a talk during the day or in the evening.
The central garden of the hotel is nice to just sit outside and enjoy the weather (if it is not raining that is) - we had a company BBQ there and the environment and food were excellent.
Rooms are big and have everything you need. Shower did not have a thermostatic faucet so you always have to look for the right temperature....
Breakfast buffet has plenty of choice - very friendly and helpfull staff. 
I did not go into the swimming pool, but it looked lovely !",4,2012,07,27
200,Affordable Style in centre of Dublin,"The Merrion used to be about the most exclusive and expensive hotel in Dublin but since the property crash of 2008 it has become much more reasonable. In fact the room prices are amongst the best value in the city. The hotel is located across from government buildings so is as central as you can get. Shops, restaurants and museums are all within 5 minutes stroll from the Georgian front door. The lounge is legendary in Dublin where you can spend the afternoon feasting on the 'Afternoon Tea' in front of a real fire ! The in house restaurant, 'Patrick Guilbaud' is a 2 Michelin star delight. Staff are a mixture of European and Irish. The Irish staff are far nicer than the eastern European girls who were unfriendly most of the time. This was the only downside to an otherwise perfect 3 day stay.",4,2012,07,26
200,"Striking the Perfect Balance Between Traditional, Five Star and Cozy","A perfect blend of traditional furnishings, old-world charm and a hip and friendly vibe.  The Merrion welcomes guests warmly and without the formality of the interior design.  It's like visiting your noble uncle's estate -- but smack dab in the heart of Dublin.  The staff in all areas was outstanding.  The pub in the basement is a cool, medieval retreat.  The food is healthy, fresh and local.  The only flaw was in the spa.  I had a wonderful hot stone massage which was ruined by the proximity of the room to the gym.  The rowing machine was literally on one of the walls of the massage room.  Guests working out in the exercise area were a foot or two away from the actual table I was on.  Please abandon that room!  I had an amazing, amazing facial in a quiet area and it made all the difference.  To make up for the noise, the generous front desk staff and my aesthetician gave me a 20 percent discount.  The Merrion -- I know why Bruce Springsteen always stays there -- just perfect!",5,2012,07,26
200,Can I Live Here?,"Seriously. I've never wanted to stay at a hotel more than here at the Merrion. The rooms are decorated in a slightly old fashioned, high class fashion. Bathroom — marble all the way. Toiletries? Asprey, natch. There is turndown service and slippers placed by your bed. The breakfast is unreal too. I can not wait to go back here. Also I saw the owner of the Standard Hotel, Andre Balazs, checking this place out while I was there. Good sign.",5,2012,07,26
200,Our 3rd visit...again fabulous!,"We love the location of this discreet and lovely hotel.  It is very close to all of the things you want to see in Dublin without the noise issues of the street and sidewalks.  As always the staff is friendly and very well trained.  Rooms are immaculate with all the amenities replenished daily. 
Breakfast is a feast with the most efficient servers and managers.  
Highly recommend this hotel...no glitches!",5,2012,07,26
200,Beautiful Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Merrion for four nights.  Beautiful hotel and very luxurious.  Our room was a little older and worn, but still very nice and clean.  The staff was very friendly.  I could see how previous reviewers could describe the staff and hotel as stuffy.  However, our experience was excellent and we would definitely stay there again.  My husband and I both slept better then we have in any other hotel.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet.",5,2012,07,25
200,First class - as always,"Having just returned from another fantastic visit I felt it worthwhile to note a review.

We have stayed in The Merrion every year for the past 12 years, sometimes on a number of occasions during the year. I cannot fault one aspect of this fantastic hotel which has an old world glamour but in an understated fashion. 
The staff are particularly welcoming, at all times and a special mention for Patrick the concierge who remembers my children by name each year which is so lovely. 
Food, accomodation, facilities are all first class and I would recommend The Merrion to everyone. We take interconnecting rooms and the space and layout really works for a family.",5,2012,07,25
200,Excellent staff but be careful what room you get,"We stayed here for three nights over the weekend and booke via Expedia at a great rate of £102 per night room only. The location is spot on by St Stephen's Green and it looks hugely impressive from the outside. We were originally allocated room #104 which is very dated and not at all to the standard we expected - all furnishings and carpets were very tired, the technology dated and the view was of a graffiti covered alleyway. To their credit, when I spoke to reception about our disappointment, we were moved to a room of the same category (#319) which had been refurbished and this was far better - new furnishings, Bose stereo and just far more up to date and light with a view of the gardens.
For me, the Garden Wing in general is in need of overall refurbishment and is a long way from the initial great first impressions of the hotel. We didn't try breakfast as it was an exorbitant €35 per person.
There is quite an odd atmosphere throughout the hotel - we found it almost stuffy and ended up walking straight out of the cocktail bar as it had a limited menu and was very quiet. From what we saw at the weekend, the clientele are largely golfers and the over-50s so this may be why it just didn't feel quite right for us - perhaps we're not the target demographic. If I came to Dublin again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here on business but for a weekend away, I suspect there may be better options.",4,2012,07,23
200,Great Experience,"We arrived early at 2pm for a one night stay. As soon as we stopped the car help was immediately on hand. We handed over the keys, our luggage was taken. we were guided through reception and taken to our room by a very informative receptionist who pointed out various features of the hotel. We were made feel so so welcome and felt no request would be any problem for them.
Our room was everything one would wish for... huge bed, bottles of water....fruit bowl etc. We were overlooking the beautiful gardens.  This was our first time staying here but can honestly say it has been one of our favorite places to stay at any time.  Apart from the convenience to the best restaurants shopping etc the hotel is wonderful for relaxing with the cosy timber... fires glowing in the drawing rooms even in July...all adding to the genuine warmth of the place.  The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful  making one feel you are there only guest.  Will be back ....soon I hope!!!",5,2012,07,22
200,Luxury Luxury Luxury!,"We has a very enjoyable night in The Merrion, when we stayed recently, attending the Bruce Springsteen show in Dublin. We had two rooms and they were both finished to a very high standard, and so so comfortable.

Due to the timing of the concert, we could only dine in the cellar bar, where the food was excellent, and the service top notch. We have just returned from holidays this week, where we stayed in some good hotels in London and the Caribbean, but none as good as The Merrion, which caters for your every need. Our only regret, was that we did not have more time to spend in the hotel, but hey, there is always the next time.

In summary, there is only one word to describe this hotel - Classy (with a capital C).",5,2012,07,21
200,WHAT A PLACE - BIG CHANGE,"I did not stay at the Merrion, I had coffee with two friends who work nearby - the coffee and home made biccies were really out of this world served by a waitor with good eye contact and humour. real wood fires and pure elegence

What suprises me most was the changes - the last time I was in the building, it housed the Land Commission, it was full of dust, creaky lino and ledgers with wizened gnomelike clerks who trundled around in shiny seated terralyne trousers and check sports jackets spending their time terrorising small farmers up and down the land. The writer Hugh Leonard started off his career as a boy clerk in the Land Commission.

The change is amazing, the place has the leathery feel of a good London Club.  I'll be back.",5,2012,07,20
200,Sheer Class,"Very tastefull and modern in a Georgian. Its discrete, its relaxed & staff are top notch, not overbearing/false and professionally relaxed.
Nice touch in 'remembering' to welcome one back + recognizing faces so as to let us through Bruce Springsteen paparazzzi.",5,2012,07,20
200,"Quaint, Quiet Georgian Refuge--Best Hotel In Dublin","We recently spent a few nights at the Merrion Hotel, a beautifully example of restored Georgian elegance at the heart of Dublin near Merrion Square.  The hotel's public rooms are elegant and well designed, with many nice details, nooks and crannies to explore and space to relax in by crackling wood fires in the fireplaces.  The hotel's Cellar Restaurant is a charming space with a friendly bar and outstanding wine cellar. 

The hotel staff was outstanding.  From initial reception to checkout, they anticipated our every need.  We were upgraded to one of the largest suites at the property, even though this was our first visit.  

The Merrion is within easy walking distance of Trinity College, Temple Bar, and many of the other main tourist sites in Dublin, and the nearby O'Donoghues Bar on Merrion Row is a cozy local pub that provides some of the best nightly traditional Irish music sessions in town.  The nearby Natural History Museum is also worth a visit and there are many houses of leading Irish literary and historial figures nearby, as well as canals to explore and the River Liffey is just North of the hotel.

For a short excursion out of town, hop on the DART train at nearby Pearse Station and head to Howth for a hike on the scenic seaside cliffs there.  The train ride is only half and hour and the cliffs are stunning, with beautiful plant and bird life, and great seafood restaurants in the pier area in Howth, including Ivan's and the famous King Sitric Fish Restaurant.

The hotel also has a spa complete with pool and gym and full spa services.  The center courtyard has a lovely garden and terrace space from which to enjoy the (somewhat rare) sunny days and tea service in the drawing rooms is outstanding.

We would gladly return to the Merrion, where we greatly enjoyed the quiet beauty of the place and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, which made us fell very much at home in this great city.",5,2012,07,19
200,Luxury like no other,"This was our second hotel in Dublin after The Westbury, and it was definitely way more expensive than The Westbury but the service was impeccable, the room luxurious and the entire hotel just made you feel entirely relaxed. My first impression was of a man in a top hat, who was jolly & friendly, taking in my 30-kilo bag like it was an everyday thing.

The housekeeping staff replenish your amenities twice a day (Aspen products, anyone?), and make you feel like a queen. The decorations are classic, the bathroom completely made from marble. Anywhere with a heated towel rack and incredibly fluffy bedroom slippers always wins part of my heart. However, note that the surrounding areas are quieter than if you were to stay in other hotels, so if you're the kind that likes to go out to the pub then this may not be the place for you. 

Breakfast wasn't as nice as I hoped it would be (in the cellar) as they offered you two basic options, with everything else needing extra $. The spread for the continental breakfast was quite limited.

Other than the breakfast though, this hotel is perfect in every way from the incredibly luxurious rooms to the impeccable service. The staff greet you in passing like you're part of their family, no matter who they are. An extra that we did not expect was a Happy Easter snack - which was delicious! Definitely stay here if you can afford it =)",5,2012,07,19
200,"Quiet, discrete, old school flavor with modern convenience",This was our first visit to dublin and I can't imagine staying anywhere else.   The rooms are beautifully decorated evoking the Edwardian past of the neighborhood with a thoroughly modern marble bathroom.  More than the physical aspects of the hotel the staff were very accommodating and efficient.  There were celebrities in residence and as guests we were not made to feel any less important then they.  It's pricey and the breakfast buffet not to my high standards but I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it.,5,2012,07,18
200,Up Tight,"Our driver told us the hotel was very nice. Personally, I was not impressed with the 'old style' decor and my first impression was that things were run-down...no, it was antique everything...including the carpeting.  Everyone whispered!  My husband, 2 adults sons and I were having a nightcap, discussing the adventures of the day and we were asked to quiet down by the 2 elderly ladies sipping their tea!  Great place for 'elderly' folks.  Very nice garden area with flowers and statues.  The rooms were not very impressive, either.  They were on the small side. Dining hall is unique, arched ceilings, beautiful.  Walk around to enjoy the art collection.  Basically the hotel was up tight, we enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere.",4,2012,07,17
200,Good Offer,"I got a good offer so i really did get the deal of the decade here. The place was well located, clean, friendly staff, superb rooms, great food. Utter bliss!!",5,2012,07,16
200,"Best hotel in Dublin, if also most expensive","We've stayed in the Merrion a number of times over the years and have just returned from another impromptu stop over in Dublin on Friday 13th July. There's just a comfortable feeling about the Merrion that genuinely makes it feel like a home from home, which of course is its marketing pitch. Staff are always friendly and easy and understand the guest's needs. It is expensive for casual drinks and the like, but the lounge area is worth it. You can come in off the street and leave the hustle and bustle of 'touristy' Dublin behind you and just chill in the lounge area. The steam room seems to have been improved since last we were there, as it certainly was more effective than I remember. Breakfast is also a treat, and it was nice to recognise our waitress - 'Grace from Banbridge' - who served us on a previous occasion. She was 'spot on'. (There does seem to be a significant turnover of staff, a feature my wife and I have noticed. There could be a simple explanation for this but maybe not....) One quibble is that the breakfast buffet seems to have been trimmed back slightly over time, and we've noticed no cold meats, for example, or smoked salmon, as was the case in the past.

Overall its very hard to overlook the Merrion for service, convenience and relaxed atmosphere. If you get a chance dine in Pearl Brasserie two doors down and ask for one of the 'caves' or private setting areas to dine in. Perfect for a family gathering.

Our daughter who was in another room was disturbed by a brother and sister argument in the next room - and it seems that they were old enough not to be at that carry on. But that can happy anywhere and she really ought to have rung reception and explained that she felt like she knew them intimately by the end of the argument!",5,2012,07,15
200,one of the best,"We felt welcome from the first moment we arrived by a very nice hotel staff. Our room wasn't ready but the desk clerk took us to the spa and gave us towels, washcloths and all items needed to freshen up. So friendly and helpful. One person in outr party was so tired and the hotel staff allowed her to nap on the sofa in the lounge. We had a terrific time in the bar area. lobby bathrooms very clean. Excellent food in the restaurant and champagne in our room chilled when we checked in:)",5,2012,07,12
200,A Great Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel in Dublin on the last night of our tour of Ireland with Ireland Chauffer Travel.  We checked in and then we were walked right up to our room which overlooked the garden in the middle.  The room was of a smaller size than some of the rooms on our tour but was nicely furnished.  We ate in ""The Cellars"" Restaurant for dinner and enjoyed our meal, although don't order a martini there because it will cost you19 euros.",5,2012,07,12
200,Amazing experience.,"We have just had the most amazing stay at the Merrion.  We have been lucky enough to sample most of the 5star hotels in Dublin and the Ritz Carlton in Wicklow, but the Merrion was exceptional.  The service was attentive without being overbearing.  Our room was stunning and super comfortable.  And dining was absolutely amazing.  The whole experience was utterly luxurious and a super treat.  Can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2012,07,12
200,One of best hotels ever,"Dublin was the first stop on a 10 day driving trip throught Ireland and the Hotel Merrion got us off to an amazing start. The vibe is upscale luxury but not stuffy at all. From the moment we arrived by cab in the rain all of our needs were anticipated and met. Very nice front door staff helped us out of the cab, covered us with an umbrella, took our bags and walked us in. Check in was very smooth and we were shown to our amazing room. I had let them know in advance that we were celebrating our honeymoon and they upgraded us to a larger room, where we were met with some delicious apricots on a plate which spelled out ""congratulations"" in chocolate script! The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in and I am very picky about beds. Bathroom was great--my only minor complaint is the hot and cold water come out of seperate faucets in the sink so you need to be careful not to freeze or burn your hands when washing up. We had dinner at the cellar bar the first night and it was one of the best meals we had on a trip filled with them (who knew the food in Ireland was so great!). Next morning we got some great suggestions of what to see in Dublin from the friendly conciere. The location of the hotel is great for sightseeing. Right near St Stephens Green and Trinity College, walking distance to Temple Bar and most everywhere, 2 min from a hop on hop off bus stop. Cannot recommend this hotel enough. My one regret is that we did not have time to get some drinks at the Cellar Bar which looked amazing, but we only had 2 nights in Dublin and just couldn't do everything we wanted!
In sum--don't think twice, stay at the Merrion. It is on the higher end price wise of the hotels in the city but absolutely worth it.",5,2012,07,09
200,"Great, but not perfect.","We stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights with our 5 month old son in June. 

For the most part the hotel was excellent, we had a very nice room on the 2nd floor, with a huge bathroom and massive bed. There was plenty of room for our travel cot and the blackout curtains meant that the baby slept as well as he does at home - we have discovered to our cost that this is not always the case. The room was very clean and had everything supplied as standard - including a bathrobe for the baby, very cute!
We ate room service the first night, which was very good and served beautifully on a pop-up trolley table, so we didn't have to eat on our lap - it was expensive, but then it's a 5* hotel, everything's expensive. The second night we ate at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, which I've reviewed separately - it was superb, well worth its 2 michelin stars.
We ate breakfast in the restaurant the first morning, which was the first negative we encountered - the staff were surly and quite rude, we had to ask for both coffee (rubbish, watery filter coffee) and toast - a 5* hotel should be providing quality coffee and you should not have it poured from a flask that had been made for goodness knows how long. We were shown to a table that had no cups, no butter and almost no milk left in the jug, so when the toast and coffee finally came, there was a faff while these things were replenished. The scrambled eggs and smoked salmon was unpleasant - both my husband and I ordered it and we were both of the opinion that the salmon was poor quality and the eggs were not cooked properly. 
The second morning we had breakfast in our room, which couldn't have been more different. The Irish breakfast I had was fantastic - possibly the best I've ever had and my husband had the Healthy Breakfast option, which he also raved about. It was well worth the tray charge and again was served on the heated trolley table, so was piping hot. 
Aside from the Cellar restaurant staff at breakfast, all of the other staff that we came across were first class and could not have been friendler or more helpful. They even remembered the baby's name and would talk to him if they saw us round the hotel - a really lovely touch.
The location of the hotel is perfect, easy walking distance to St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and most of the other Dublin attractions - for those wishing to take a tour, the tour buses all stop a very short walk from the hotel entrance.
We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Dublin, however would probably avoid breakfast in the restaurant.",4,2012,07,08
200,"Lovely hotel, but bad night sleep","A few years back, I stayed many times in The Merrion and considered it one of the best hotels in the world. It is still delightful, but looks a little more old fashioned now.

The lobby and bar as is very cosy and inviting, and the inner courtyard gives a feeling of peace and tranquility. The rooms are spacious, and the marble bathrooms wonderful, with both bathtubs and shower cubicles.

However, my stay was not perfect. I was checked into a ground floor room which was right next  to the very noisy heating system in the courtyard. Due to a fully booked hotel, they couldn't change my room, but provided earplugs after 2 reminders. I slept badly and woke up, whenever the earplugs fell out. When my neighbour had a shower in the morning, the plumbing sounded like a jet was taking off next to me at 6 am in the morning.

Unfortunately, I felt really knackered the next day and cannot give a better rating for this very reason. Avoid the ground floor at any cost and ask for a quiet room!",3,2012,07,08
200,"Just checked in, ate dinner and am in the room.","Staff was/is very courteous, both in the reception and in the restaurant. It was a nice touch that the woman who checked us in walked us to our room and gave us a tour - and asked if we wanted to tour, so as to not be pushy. I liked that touch. Bags came up quick.

The dinner was nice, and the staff was very friendly. I liked each one that I deal with, and I think we dealt with all but one. Appointments in the room are nice. In particular, the writing desk/materials are wonderful: linen stationary is awesome. My daughter is writing letters to family as I type this.

The chocolate covered strawberries and fruit plate was a nice touch as well.

Two drawbacks, neither of which is huge.

1. Couldn't upgrade. not a big deal, but I always feel mildly slighted if I can't get some sort of perk just for being me. :)

2. After dinner and desert, my daughter and I sat for quite a while waiting for anyone to come and check on us. After a good long while I got up and stood at the host station until (quickly) I was addressed. I understand why it happened - when we got there at 7:00, the place was deserted. By the time we left at 8:30, it was packed. Still, understanding does not mean acceptance, particularly as all we wanted to do at that point was to retire to our room and get the road off. :)

Over all, after about 4 hours here, I'd say I'm pleased. No stay is perfect, and they really did get pretty busy right about the time we were leaving.

I'll pin another review when we leave.

200,Fantastic gem in the heart of Dublin,"I can see why the Merrion is rated #1 on Tripadvisor. We booked through Expedia and snagged a good deal for peak travel (July). Booked a queen room. Arrived very early after our overnight flight from the US. We were promptly greeted at our taxi and our luggage whisked away. The front desk was very helpful. A room was not ready though, but I wasn't surprised. We were really early (9 AM). They were able to get us in just before 11 AM and had upgraded us to a king room with a garden view. 

The room was VERY large by European standards and very comfortable. Hubby says it was the best hotel bed he had been on in a long time. There were several comfy chairs and we even had a little balcony we could stand on that overlooked the garden. Bathroom was quite large with a separate shower and tub. Full amenities available (shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion). Bathrobe and slippers also there.

Stocked mini bar and snacks. Little pricey though. One free bottle of water (they laughed when we asked how much. Nothing is free in the US!). 

The garden area is beautiful and great for relaxing in the evening. There are two drawing rooms with fires burning (with peat logs!). So quaint.

Within 5 minutes walking of Merrion Square and St. Stephen's. 10 minutes from Grafton Street. 25 minutes from St. Patrick's/Christ Church. A little less to Temple Bar. I walked everywhere!

Cost of taxi from the airport to hotel on a Saturday AM was 35 euro (including tip) and on Sunday AM was 30 euro (to car rental).

We would stay here again in a heartbeat and wished we had more than one night.",5,2012,07,08
200,"Very good, but...","My husband and I stayed in the Merrion Hotel for two nights.  There were many positive things about the hotel...restaurant, concierge and location.  However, upon check in we were extremely jet lagged and our room was not ready.  Rather then switch our room they told us to go get something to eat and afterwards the room would be ready.  Second problem, wi-fi did not work from our room.  We NEVER got a signal!  The staff knew and did not care.  Next, we enjoyed our spa treatments, but the changing area was a mess and never cleaned.  Finally, we ordered a cup of icecream in the lounge and it cost 9 euros, which is absolutely absurd.",4,2012,07,04
200,Fantastic as Usual,"Was lucky enough to again stay in the fabulous Merrion Hotel. It really is the best hotel in Dublin. Got a great deal on Hotels.com for a Friday night stay. Its the little touches that separate this hotel from others. The friendly (not fake) staff, the little bottle of water beside your bed when you return from a night out, the updates in your room regarding the weather, local events, traffic disruptions (updated daily) & other little touches all add up. 

It is a little pricer than other hotels but shop around for a deal and you might be lucky enough to get one. However if you do end up paying a little more it is more than worth it. 

Looking forward to my next visit. 

I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2012,07,04
200,Best luxury hotel in Dublin,"We arrived at the Merrion Hotel after being awake for about 30 hours due to flight delays and the flight from the U.S.  We were so tired, but as soon as you arrive, they make you instantly feel better.  It starts with the doorman who typifies what you think of as an ideal doorman, especially at a 5* hotel in Ireland.  The front desk staff are extremely polite and professional.  I cannot say enough for the concierge staff.  I had a brand-new GPS device and was having trouble getting the maps for Ireland to work properly and was in a bit of a panic.  One of the younger concierge's, who I believe may have just advanced from a trainee or was still a trainee couldn't have been more helpful, all while he had such a calm, relaxing and supportive approach.  He was able to fix my GPS and I am in his debt.
We were upgraded from the standard room to a room in the main part of the hotel.  The room and bathroom area were huge and just so elegantly appointed.    The beds are very comfortable and we slept very well there.   The rooms are very quiet and we never heard the housekeeping staff or people in neighboring rooms or people walking in the hallway.
Will definitely return to the Merrion if we are ever in Dublin again.",5,2012,07,04
200,Almost Excellent,"This hotel has a great reputation and was certainly a very nice place to stay, but for us, it wasn't the best we've experienced in Dublin.  Location is good, but not on the park.  We had a good, but not special room on the 2nd floor overlooking the beautiful courtyard.  Our dinner and breakfast in The Cellar were fine, but not memorable.  Service was uniformly excellent.  One thing that sticks with me:  I came into the sitting rooms early one morning looking for a quick cuppa and saw that there was a sidebar set up for coffee service.  A nice young lady poured one for me - and then handed me a bill for seven euro.  At this end of the price range, that should have been complimentary.",4,2012,07,03

The staff treat you as if you are the only guest in the hotel and are wonderful with children, with lovely little treats for them.
We usually opt for a room in the old house, but this visit we had a room in the newer part as we availed of their dine and dream package, and the rooms in old house are not included.
We were not disappointed, and the package is great value for money.
The pool area is lovely and is a great addition to have in a city hotel.
We are looking forward to a return visit and would highly recommend.",5,2012,07,03
200,Expensive but worth it,I travel a lot (partly for work and party for vacation) and have stayed in great hotels around the world. This has to be one of the most enjoyable stays. The bed was probably the most comfortable of any hotel (even better than my own bed at home) and the room was so quiet. Great bathrooms with enormous bathtubs. Fantastic public areas with turn-of-the-century salon ambiance. Outstanding restaurants. Wonderful location around the corner from one of the best pubs for traditional music (O'Donoghue's) and great cafes and restaurants and other shops within a short walk. I was in Dublin to attend a conference at the Convention Centre -- about a mile away -- and my colleagues who stayed closer to the conference were jealous of our location and fantastic hotel. This is the loveliest part of Dublin and the hotel is worth the extra cost.,5,2012,06,27
200,"Lovely hotel, great location","Had a lovely stay in the Merrion, found the staff to be very helpful and the location was perfect for touring the city centre.  Only complaints were the room we were given was on the ground floor looking into another building and was very dark.  Also, we had a meal in the Cellar Restaurant and found the food and service very poor.  When we complained to the Restaurant Manager he dealt with the matter as best he could, but I wouldn't be inclined to eat there again.",4,2012,06,26
200,Dublin Jewel,"A five star hotel that lives up to its grading.  Situated ideally within a short walking distance to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green shopping centre for those shopping enthusiasts and of course the more historical sites such as government buildings, Trinity College etc.  You can become so relaxed in either of their two drawing rooms with their fantastic art collection hanging on all the walls of the hotel and the open log fires that you can become completly oblivious to the hustle and bustle happening in the city outside.  The room itself was very tastefully furnished and had a up-to-date television, which unfortunately can be lacking in some hotels.  Great to see also that they had a proper ironing board in case you need to give the clothes a quick going over and there was even a starch spray for the cotton shirts.  Overall the facilities in the room were exceptional as was the friendly service by all the staff that we met in the hotel over our stay.  Food in the Cellar Bar restaurant was very good and very reasonably priced for a five star hotel and even the food in the main restaurant was very keenly priced at €20 for two courses from the lunch menu.  Although there wasn't a huge variety to choose from.  Great selection of food available at the breakfast though which sustained us for the few hours on our journey home.  Hoping to spend another night or two here in the not too distant future to explore Dublin further.",5,2012,06,26
200,True 5 star class,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel. From the moment we arrived we felt treated with sincere warmth and courtesy. Service is simply excellent and delivered with an smile by everyone. The room is bright and large. We didn't have time to try the afternoon tea at the drawing room, we'll try next time. All in all excellent, it exceeded our expectations . All 5 star hotels should be like this one.",5,2012,06,26
200,Great 5 Star Hotel,"The staff makes this place 5 stars.  Great service the entire time we were there.  They had the best food of any place we stayed in Ireland, but, it is Ireland, so don't expect too much.  Their smoked salmon was great!!",5,2012,06,25
200,Lovely Hotel,"I was only able to spend one night in Dublin on our recent trip to Ireland and I'm glad it was at the Merrion.  The hotel is in a great location (although a bit difficult to locate if you are driving yourself, as the signage does not stand out) if you want to walk around the city.  Our room was large, clean, comfortable and well appointed.  All of the staff  I came into contact with during my short stay were welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again if I am fortunate enough to return to this wonderful city.",5,2012,06,25
200,Gorgeous.,"Excellent, beautiful, and a perfect ending to our Irish excursion. Everything was impeccable. Truly treated us like royalty.",5,2012,06,25
200,Merrion Dublin - Great Hotel,"Loved this hotel. The location can't be beat.  Close to everything, yet quiet.  Beautiful swimming pool/spa.  The Wine Cellar Bar had great food and wonderful atmosphere.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.",5,2012,06,25
200,Wonderful Hotel.,Excellent friendly staff.Comfortable and clean rooms.Lovely food and wine.,5,2012,06,23
200,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Arrived in Dublin for two night stay. Had two rooms booked - check in was very quick and easy. We got room 182 which was amazing facing the road which I was afraid it would be noisy but heard nothing. Food at the cellar for breakfast and dinner was good.  My only complaint was the bed linens, wish they were more comfy.  Location was great and staff friendly ",5,2012,06,22
200,Merrion Dublin - great hotel,"From arrival to departure, the professional staff at the Merrion are there to give you the most special of Irish welcomes. The hotel is in a beautiful historic neighborhood within walking distance to the canal, cafes, shops, parks, and great history of Dublin (I'm an architect). The tea / sitting room was a great place to have a drink and meal after a day of touring up to Newgrange and then walking around Dublin. The room was spacious, secure, and quiet. I would certainly recommend this hotel to the one night traveller (as we were) or for the long-term stay in Dublin. The only note is that high quality of service and deluxe accommodations come with the comparable expense - however, this hotel is worth every cent.",5,2012,06,20
200,Afternoon tea,"A group of friends and myself recently visited Dublin for a weekend break, as it was one of the groups 40th birthdays we thought we would do something a 'bit special' to celebrate and after much deliberation decided on afternoon tea at the Merrion. We didn't book and called on the off chance that there would be a table available. The staff were very accomodating and found us a table in the bar area however the experience was completely ruined by the lady that met us on arrival and asked us in the most condescending fashion ""Do you know what afternoon tea is?"" The answer is Madam ...Yes we do and on our next visit to Dublin we will be taking it at the Westbury!!!!  Afternoon Tea itself was wonderful.",5,2012,06,15
200,Fantastic Hotel,"Absolutely lovely hotel. The minute we arrived we knew we had made the right choice.

The hotel is in a perfect spot, it is close enough to be a short walk from the busy part of the city (Temple Bar area and shopping areas etc) but it is far enough away to be nice and quiet.

The staff are VERY helpful and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The concierge and the receptionists were very good in telling us various places we should visit etc as we were tourists looking to do day trips.

The room was lovely, nice and big, lovely bathroom with roll-top bath and seperate shower.

The only downside for me personally was the price of the breakfast. It was around £35 for a cooked breakfast which I think is very poor value. Apart from this I couldnt fault the hotel at all.",5,2012,06,15
200,"Elegant Hotel, next to Taoiseach, Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green","Spent 4 nights here at the Merrion Hotel with my mom (she's 70,I'm 40). Book through Virtuoso, so we were upgraded to a large room in the main house with two twin beds overlooking the Department of Taoiseach and Upper Merrion Road. Also, got a bottle of Champagne included. Also, our Irish Breakfast for 2 was included as well.

Room was great and we were in Ireland during the late May summer of 2012, where temps were probably in the mid 70s and there weren't clouds in the sky. Unfortunately, I don't think the A/C in our room was working (at all) so the first two nights were rather hot and toasty. Stupidly, we thought that somehow this would work itself out on its own, but we should have contacted the front desk immediately. They tried to fix the A/C, but couldn't they gave us a portable A/C unit and opened the large windows for us.

The courtyard in the back is very nice, the pool in the basement is gorgeous. However, there are a few items that make this a 4.5 star review (thus the 4 star review) and not 5 star.

1. We had Irish breakfast included. Irish breakfast's are for carnivores. If you wanted to change the breakfast from Irish to something else, there was an upcharge of 6 euro.
2. Charging 1 euro / minute for local calls seems a bit much.
3. The warm/hot rooms. 

They have sitting/tea rooms would have been nice if they had some complimentary drinks/snacks instead of a menu with prices on it.

Would I stay here again? Probably, though I might try another place such as the Four Seasons, which unfortunately is farther away from town, or another hotel closer to St. Stephen's Green or Trinity College.",4,2012,06,13
200,Lived up to high expectations!!,"No wonder this hotel is ranked as the No 1 hotel on TripAdvisor for Dublin, it deserves to be!
The hotel is a gorgeous building in a great location.
The service I received was excellent- concierge, check in, restaurant- all fantastic but not OTT or fake.
Pool was great, gym sufficient if a little small but does the job if you are after a quick workout!
The Spa was a little tricky to get booked into as there were very limited appointment times available but the treatment I had was excellent.
Room was spacious and comfortable, I was surprised there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but realised the next day you just had to call reception to request this and it would be supplied complimentary- I was only there for one night though so by the time I realised this it was time to check out!
Breakfast was good, although I would say there was not a huge choice included in the continental breakfast buffet.",4,2012,06,12
200,Elegance in the Heart of Dublin,"The Merrion is a gorgeous old hotel property in the City of Dublin.  The drawing rooms and bedrooms were gorgeous, reminiscent to me of the old Ritz Carlton in Boston. High tea ( it looked amazing) is served daily,there is a warm and wonderful bar, and adjacent restaurant.  For less formal fare try one of the pubs around the corner, very walkable.  The architectural details of the property and gardens were a joy to behold for this designer/ traveler.  The turn down service was incomparable...a special thank you to our maid who was from Brazil. She did a wonderful service for us, with attention to every detail one would require at bedtime!  The carrera marble bathroom was sumptuous and the soaking tub was divine.  Although full of guests, the garden was quiet and birdsong filled the air. The flowers were specimens, and the trees manicured and all seemed very happily growing together in this fair city.  It was grand-like!   My only negative was our massages. We, by accident booked a short and perfunctory ""back and shoulder rub"" instead of a full body, and it left us wanting more.  Go for the full massage. The Spa changing area was small, and no private resting area for men and women...and without the usual lounges and blankets, soft music, etc found in most spas.  You just kind of ""wait"" in an upright chair near the spa check in area, in your robe, next to people in street clothes.  Felt a bit odd.  For such a grand hotel, I would recommend creating a resting area that is private and more Spa-like.  Otherwise, we were thrilled with the Merrion! And highly recommend it!",5,2012,06,11
200,very comfortable stay.,"A very comfortable, if slightly austere, hotel. We were here for three nights on a bed and breakfast rate and the service and quality of food at breakfast was without fault.

We stayed in a front facing suite overlooking the main road and there was some slight early morning noise from the passing traffic.

Just an additional point. My husband (who is the most rational and down to earth person) swore he saw a ghost wandering around our bedroom during the night - however this wouldn't put us off stopping here again though!!!",4,2012,06,08
200,"Lovely, comfortable, luxury hotel","Rooms were very nice. Not geared for business travellers, better for romantic or quiet stays. Swimming pool is nice. General atmosphere is very relaxed. Recommended",5,2012,06,08
200,"The Cellar Restaurant, Merrion Hotel Dublin","Fabulous dining experience in the Cellar Restaurant, Merrion Hotel, Dublin. First time in the restaurant for lunch to day 7th June 2012. The Cellar is in a great location and part of the Merrion Hotel. The staff were really friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food was lovely and the wine complimented the lunch very nicely. The price was reasonable and we would hope to return again soon.",4,2012,06,07
200,Great Experience,"We booked the Merrion after seeing it rated as #1 on Trip Advisor.  It was a fortunate choice.  The hotel website shows a room rate which is fairly high, but then, if you scroll down, you can find offers for room plus breakfast and dinner for only an additional 20 Euros.  Too good to pass up.
Everything at the Merrion is absolutely first class from the friendly reception, to the beautiful rooms, the indoor pool and the outstanding food and drink.  Everyone on staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. I'm not sure when we're returning to Dublin, but when we do, the Merrion will be our first choice.",5,2012,06,06
200,Wonderful Hotel,"I have stayed a number at times at The Merrion over the past ten years and am always without exception, hugely impressed by the staff and management of this hotel. Nothing is ever too much trouble and the sense of welcome is second to none.
The product itself is exceptionnal and reminds me of the Hotel Bristol in Paris, another outstanding hotel. The art in the hotel is nothing short of breathtaking and the time and effort put into the design and attention to detail is what putsthis hotel above the rest in Dublin.
We had rooms service breakfast, which has to be the best way to start a weekend morning.Wed did not eat in the restaurant this time round, but I have to say that I have never had anything other than a great experience there and in the Cellar Bar, one of the most amospehric places to enjoy a pint of the black stuff. well done to all at the Merrion and Thanks.",5,2012,06,06
200,Lovely genteel feel of old georgian splendour as we reclined on sofas by the fire on a wet summers day .,"great atmosphere,attentive staff,open fire and great food.",5,2012,06,05
200,fantastic and classy!,"We stayed here last night as a treat for my wife  as it was her birthday. I had booked a queen size room and when we arrived we were up graded to an executive suite which was fantastic, the staff are all professional and friendly and have a very high standard of hospitality,the location is in the middle of Dublin so its very easy to get around to the sights of this beautiful  city, When we got back to the hotel in the afternoon we had a lovely suprise waiting in our room a complimentry bottle of champane and choclate on a plate with happy birthday written on the plate  for my wife, we were delighted and very impressed and would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. We had dinner in the  Cellar restaurant and it was so tasty and plentiful and again the staff were fantastic, It is brilliant hotel and well worth the money so go on and spoil yourself in this gem of a hotel you wont be dissapointed!",5,2012,06,05
200,Afternoon 'Art' Tea - Unbelievable!,"My mum and I decided to stop here for the Merrion Afternoon 'Art' Tea. We have been to quite a few afternoon teas and this is by far the best and most interesting!

When we first arrived our table was laid out for us, with three small picture cards. The girl who greeted us explained that the tea would be served in two courses - firstly the 3-tiered cake tray filled with sandwiches, cakes and scones and then a serving of 3 miniture desserts based on the 3 pictures we had on the table.

When the first course arrived I couldnt believe the amount of food there was for just the two of us..there were 5 sandwiches each, three small scones each and 4 cakes each..all accompanied by raspberry jam, clotted cream and lemon curd, and of course our own choice of tea. The staff were great..we got a pot of each and the staff ensured our cups were never emtpy! We couldnt manage to eat all the scones and cakes and the staff packaged them up in a lovely 'Merrion Pantry' bag for us to take home. 

The second course was amazing..we got 3 small desserts each on a lovely decorated tray. The guy who presented the dessert for us explained each of the desserts and how they represent the artwork. It looked too good to eat lol!! And even though we were extremely full up from the first course, we did manage the desserts and they were absolutely delicious!! They were so full of flavour and were the perfect ending to the meal.

Overall the staff were fantastic! The food was out of this world! and the setting in the Drawing Rooms was perfect. I would definitely go back here. We were told the 'art' desserts change each day so it would always be a new surprise!",5,2012,06,04
200,it just the best,"The Merrion is a lovely experience from beginning to end. The hotel looks lovely, like a townhouse from the outside and there is a central courtyard so the choice of views from the rooms are all very positive. You don't feel you are in the centre of Dublin. It is more like a country house where you are a pampered guest. The service is excellent without ever being pretentious. The restaurant is fabulous and an experience in itself. Breakfast has a great menu variety. The only slight criticism is that the spa is tacked on with too little space devoted to the area. The staff are brilliant and the pool lovely-there just seems a lack of space to relax in meaning you tend to use the spa services and leave. Its a small quibble about the most lovely hotel which never disappoints.",5,2012,06,03
200,Cellar Restaurant,"Recently my family and i had lunch in the Cellar Restaurant in the Merrion Hotel. The minute we got to the Hotel we were treated extremely well, we were served by Andrew, he was very welcoming and made us feel at home which is something i always feel i don't get in other Hotels. I was very impressed with his job knowledge he chose my three courses which were amazing. The atmosphere in the whole hotel is very good my family and i really enjoyed our time there and will be back for sure.",5,2012,06,01
200,Five Star Class,"The perfect way to end our wonderful stay in Ireland! 
The Merrion  has got to be one of the best hotels in the world. 
We can only reaffirm what everyone else has written and can't wait to return.",5,2012,05,31
200,Georgian Splendour,Beautifully run and maintained historical hotel. Professional and friendly staff. There is no task too hard or too difficult.,5,2012,05,31
200,Afternoon art tea at the Merrion,"Afternoon tea at the Merrion Hotel is a great way to experience the history, art, service and ambience of the hotel. Service is attentive and gracious. It's not cheap (36 euros per person) but it's a well-rounded experience and will be the height of any afternoon tea experience I know I'll ever have. I highly recommend it for a peek inside Dublin history, artwork, and a taste of how Dublin nobility once lived.

The decor and your surroundings takes you back in Dublin history which was their intention.  My hubby and I ordered the art tea for two, and the tea and the delicacies were delicious.  While we waited for them to serve our first course, we took in the whole ambience, decor and artwork that surrounded us. The second course are the cakes that represent three of the artworks that are displayed in this hotel.  Take your time, absorb your surroundings, and most importantly, enjoy the food!",5,2012,05,30
200,Very Disappointed,"Just returned from a long weekend at The Merrion. First I have to say that the rooms were clean, the food was good and most of the staff were pleasant. Unfortunately I now have to say that the views from the rooms were terrible: we had a room in the Garden Suite which overlooked a brick wall and my Daughter and her Partner's view wasn't much better. The prices are way too high even for a city hotel and I have stayed in many during my time. There is very little 'atmosphere' in the hotel and it 'comes across' as frumpy and austere.
However I would have put up with all of this if the following incident hadn't occurred
When we checked in I was asked for my credit card, usual practice so that they can take a portion of cash from you to cover expenses during the stay. They took just 200 euros which was a bit silly when you consider that a round of drinks could set you back by 64 euros! Anyway I had no problem with this as it's done in almost all hotels.
The PROBLEM was that when I returned to my room on the evening before departure I had a message to contact reception. When I called reception I was told that we had exceeded the 200 euro's that I paid on check in and that I had to pay more money immediately to cover the excess!!! I was livid, I have stayed in 5 star hotels all around the world and without exception have exceeded the initial ammount paid at check in. There is never any problem because you just pay the excess when you check out. I recently stayed at The Four Seasons and and exceeded the check in ammount by over £1000 but this was of cause paid when I checked out
I felt that they didn't think I could afford to pay and this made me so angry...in fact I'm still 'steaming'. How incredibly rude! Why would I stay anywhere if I couldn't afford it, I had already paid £2,500 for the hotel booking and flights.
We were just a normal family, hoping to enjoy a long weekend in pleasant surroundings and with good food...this could have been the case if not for this insult.
All things considered I would never recommend this hotel, stay at The Sherbourne it is much much better",2,2012,05,30
200,we'll be back for more!,"I can only agree with previous reviews.  This was our second weekend break here and we'll be back for more!  The valet parking, the welcome, the staff - all superb.  The attention to detail is fantastic.  I went to the spa on the first evening (book well in advance) and had a wonderful relaxing experience.  Breakfast next morning was superb as usual. On the Sunday morning we had breakfast in our room and I know we've never had such a fantastic breakfast for room service.  The fresh fruit alone was worth it and the cooked breakfast was kept warm in the heated trolley.  This is not normally the case with room service cooked breakfasts!The hotel is so well located for Stephen's Green and the Gaiety Theatre and we love the Cellar Bar for meeting friends - such a great ambience.  Pricey hotel but worth every penny!",5,2012,05,30
200,Pure unadulterated luxury,"I stayed at the hotel for a birthday treat with my partner.  From start to finish every detail was just perfect.  The building is a composed of a number of Georgian townhouse with the most stunning interior which makes for a very opulent feeling to the hotel, however this is no celtic tiger cub with naff brass and marble adoration at every opportunity rather an excercise in elegance and restraint.  

What also marks the hotel out from a multitude of others is the magnificent collection of Irish art hung throughout the hotel- this is one of the distinct differences of the hotel.  There is an authenticity to the spaces rather than standard plastic pastiche found in so many hotels that have sprouted in Ireland over the last number of years.  

But beyond the beautiful surroundings is the key to the place which lies with the excellence of the staff.  They are friendly and professional and have an ability to make guests feel at ease at every opportunity.  The hotel is a five star affair but without a snotty attitude rather excellence in the pursuit of true hospitality.",5,2012,05,30
200,The best hotel in Dublin by far,"We went for an overnight stay at The Merrion as a treat with no children.  We checked in and left our luggage, went for a wander around the city then back for spa treatments before having lunch in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.
We had drinks in the bar after a swim down in the spa and there was an Opera performance in the gardens which was lovely.  The staff were absolutely excellent, we had room service dinner which we couldn't fault either.
Definitely the best hotel in the city by a mile!",5,2012,05,30
200,"The ultimate destination for a special
Occassion","I took my sister for the dine and dream package to
The merrion for her birthday on the 5 th of may. From the mOment we arrived everything was perfect. We were met by the door staff who valet parked our car and took our luggage. Reception welcomed me back to the merrion, a nice touch to acknowledge returning customers. 

We were up graded to the Georgian part of the house to a junior suite.the hotel has a book of truffles and cup cakes on a plate with happy birthday written on it waiting in the room.the champagne that was part of the package was chilling in the room.

We had a cocktail before dinner and a wander around the beautiful terrace. Dinner was in the cellar restaurant. My sister loved everything she ordered. My quail starter was excellent. The rib eye steak that I chose was a little fatty. 

We then retired to bar 23 to met 20 of my sisters friends. The staff really looked after us for the night to make it very memorable.

I look forward to going back to
This wonderful hotel
",5,2012,05,28
200,fantastic hotel,"Stayed on an overnight in Dublin. Fantastic staff, spacious room, great dinner and breakfast. Wish we could visit more often. The rooom had everything you could possibly want. The inner courtyard with its water feature is so calming, you wouldn't think you were in the middle of a city and the paintings hanging all aroud the public areas are not to be missed. PURE LUXURY",5,2012,05,25
200,"Had business meeting, my engagement dinner and wedding here.","From business to weddings, the Merrion is incredible.  The hotel is beautiful and the artwork something else.  The food is no slouch either!  However, it is the STAFF that makes this hotel what it is.  The service is highly professional yet genuinely friendly and welcoming with an easygoing twist. You feel so welcome here. Other top hotels take note!! No wonder it is Dublin's number one 5* hotel.  I arranged a business meeting for my husband (then boyfriend) there some years ago and we were so impressed that we'd no doubt where our wedding was going to take place.

The events staff are the loveliest girls, so professional yet down to earth.  I'd my engagement dinner in the Cellar restaurant which was just divine.  Our wedding reception (Mar 2011) was a dream come true.  The food and wine were our focal points.  (Pheasant and Venison - very gamey!!).

When at the Merrion, you have to sample their sommelier's favourite wine, Givry 1er Cru (Domaine du Moutton).  It is just the perfect wine.

Cannot recommend this hotel enough.

Yet to sample their Art Tea though!",5,2012,05,24
200,Loved The Merrion!,"As soon as we pulled up, the Valet said, ""Welcome, to The Merrion, we'll take care of everything.""  At the front desk, the Clerk was so welcoming & gave us a tour of the entire property.  Our room was not quite ready, so we sat in the garden / courtyard area (which is beautiful) and had a drink & a snack.  Our room was ready a short time later, and our luggage was promptly delivered.  We stayed in the Garden Wing.  The room was clean, beautifully decorated, and a great view of the garden.  The bed was SO comfortable.  One night, we sat in the lobby /drawing room area, and had drinks, tea, and desert.  This area has a fireplace and is so comfortable - a perfect place to relax.  The location of the hotel is great, and the staff is just wonderful!",5,2012,05,23
200,No wonder it's number one in Dublin,"We stayed for our anniversary and want to go back next year!  The hotel is an elegant Georgian house in the city centre, close to Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  Service is charming, genuinely warm and friendly and guests' names are used at all time.  We relaxed in the spacious and well decorated room, overlooking a beautiful courtyard.  The bed was wide and comfortable with lots of squashy pillows and a big cosy duvet.  After a night out on the town we returned to room service sandwiches and chips (delicious).  We used the pool and steam room in the morning, fantastic way to start the day, and after an extensive Irish breakfast were more than ready to start the day.  The Merrion has old world charm, roaring peat fires and unobtrusive yet attentive service.  We will definitely return and would recommend.",5,2012,05,21
200,Wonderful - an art gallery and hotel,"Excellent hotel - service, comfort, dining, ambiance. The staff were uniformly pleasant and responsive; the in-room and dining room meals were very good; and the room was clean and comfortable, though a bit small. 
I would say that dinner at the Merrion's neighbour (and linked through a joining door) Patrick Guillard restaurant wasn't as great as its 2 Michelin stars might imply - costly and coasting perhaps. 
Overall a really lovely place to spend a weekend.",4,2012,05,20
200,Afternoon Tea at the Merrion - A great afternoon,"I have had afternoon tea at the Merrion on 2 separate occasions this year and each time thoroughly enjoyed the day.  The service is exceptional - you do not have to even look for your tea to be topped up! It comes in 2 courses - a tray of sandwiches, cakes, scones, madeira cake etc first and then the 2nd course is the dessert based on the art work of the hotel.  Please leave room for the 2nd course as it is divine!! A lovely treat for someone as a gift too",5,2012,05,19
200,Wonderful old-world charm,Staying at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin was like visiting a rich aunt and being pampered by family retainers!   The staff were more than helpful in arranging limo pickup at the airport and a private tour of the city.  The public rooms of the hotel have a comfortable understated elegance and the service is superb.  Our room was spacious and well appointed.  The location is within walking distance of Grafton Street for shopping and restaurants.  Truly a five-star experience.,5,2012,05,17
200,An elegant hotel in a beautiful location,"We stayed in the Merrion Hotel for a special birthday last weekend. Beautiful hotel, attentive staff, the hotel is extremely well presented, with gorgeous design and a lot of character too! 

The location of the hotel is wonderful, all the main attractions and Graton Street are within easy walking distance. 

I will definitely come back again; everyone in the hotel seems to work very hard to make guests happy! The complementary bottle of champagne was wonderful. Thank you to everyone there who made my birthday remarkable and enjoyable.",5,2012,05,17
200,Impressed with the Service,"I just want to give a shout out to Clare, a member of the Merrion Hotel's concierge team! I can't wait to meet her when we arrive next month. My husband and I want to visit Newgrange and the Hill of Tara on a Saturday morning while our kids are arriving from the states and getting settled.  Clare helped me with lots of suggestions on how to do this-group tour, renting a car, public transportation...we finally settled on renting a care for 1/2 day and driving ourselves. She set up the car rental and is having the car delivered to the hotel and we'll return it to the hotel when we're finished with our little trip.  She has been amazing and has made me feel so special and important.  She was quick to respond to my requests and emails. I haven't stayed at The Merrion yet, but I'm really looking forward to our experience. If it's anything like the service from Clare, I'll be writing another 5 star review! It's just nice to see someone go above and beyond when asked the simplest questions. I feel so well taken care of and I can't wait to meet Clare in person when we arrive. I'm really impressed!",5,2012,05,16
200,The Art Tea,"The Art Tea, an innovative and creative take on the traditional afternoon tea was a most enjoyable experience and a treat to both the eyes and the palate! 

With two courses presented (1 extra since the last time I had afternoon tea), the enjoyment was endless. The array of hand crafted cakes, breads, delicate sandwiches and mini scones (my favourite) were followed later with a plate of what could only be described as 'edible art'. 

The desserts were explained to us in detail by the pastry chef himself (Paul Kelly), who paid us a visit and explained how they were representations of some of the paintings housed at The Merrion.My guest and myself thought this was a lovely touch. Mini versions of the paintings were cleverly displayed on the table when we walked in, the connection to The Art Tea was a delightful surprise.

Altogether it was a very relaxed afternoon, full of surprises and delight. It was a true indulgence but I reckon we all deserve this once in a while!",5,2012,05,16
200,Lovely night away.,"We received a gift of a night away in this hotel which was a lovely treat as it was minus the kids. On arrival we were very well looked after, our room wasn't ready but our luggage was taken from us so we could either head to the bar for a drink or head into the city. We decided to do both and by the time we had been out for a couple of hours our room was ready on our return. 

The rooms are gorgeous! Fabulous decor. We ended up having a nap as we were heading out that night and when we woke to get ready we had no power. It was getting dark at that point and having a shower was not an option as the bathroom was pitch black, also I couldn't dry my hair or even see properly to apply my make up. We phoned reception numerous times to be told it would be back on 'soon' or 'in 10 minutes'.  In the end we had to just go out as we had dinner reservations. It was a bit annoying as it was our wedding anniversary and I felt like I couldn't get dressed up properly. 

We had a good night out anyway and returned to the hotel for a few nightcaps, the staff again were very friendly. 

Had a comfortable sleep and woke to our breakfast (we ordered it t o be delivered to our room). Breakfast was gorgeous! 

I did email the hotel about our complaint only just to let them know and I got a reply offering a free meal, which I never took them up on.",5,2012,05,14
200,Simply Amazing....absolutely recommend.,"Booked this hotel for a surprise for my partners birthday, neither of us had visited Dublin before so was unsure of what to expect, but wanted the trip to be perfect......and it was thanks to the Merrion and the staff. At the last minute I upgraded to a kingsize room in the main hotel. 

The hotel has a very understated frontage, but when you walk through the enterance doors the simple beauty and elegance of the hotel is very evident. Despite arriving ridiculously early due to the flight, we were welcomed in a very warm yet professional manner. Staff seem primed to excell your expectations before you even know what they are!!! 

We dropped our bags off and headed out to see what Dublin had to offer. The location of the hotel is superb, all the main attractions within easy striking distance, although the hotel is so comfortable its quite tempting just to stay put. The national gallery is just round the corner as are a street lined with local artists. The main shopping precinct is just a ten minute stroll as are some very authentic and non touristy bars.

When we returned to our the hotel for afternoon tea (an absolute must), and were shown to the room. For European standards the room sizes are exceptionally large, the bed was huge, the soft furnishings classic and very tasteful. The same for the period inspired marble clad bathroom. Our room backed onto the garden, where the hotel was hosting a small operatic event, which we listened and watched through our bedroom window. I had mentioned in the upgrade email to the hotel that it was my partners birthday, when we arrived in the room the hotel had supplied champagne and cakes with happy birthday written on the plate in chocolate. A superb, very much appreciated and unexpected touch. 

Throughout our visit staff went the extra mile, whether it was from personally showing us to the restaurant or talking about the various works of art that are displayed around the hotel.  The staff to client ratio is superb, and service from absolutely every member that was came across was warm, friendly, helpfull and professional. Not once did i come across anyone who was stuffy or pompous which is often the case in hotels of this standard. 

Breakfast was also served in the cellar restaurant, plenty of choice, fresh stewed fruits delicate pastries etc to full irish breakfast. 

We had dinner in the cellar restaurant, part of our package. The choice was good and the wine chosen to accompany the meal was very pleasant. We paid 410 euros for a king deluxe in the main building, which included breakfast,dinner and wine in the cellar restaurant. As far as I am concerened it was an absolute bargain for such perrsonal attentive service.

We will be back, we loved the laid back and friendly vibe of Dublin, but it would not matter where this hotel was situated we would return, the management must be commended for achieving the levels of service we experienced.

200,A Regal Home Away from Home,"After a very disappointing stay in Mexico, we decided to splurge on this trip and chose the hotel rated #1 on Tripadvisor.  We spent 9 days touring Dublin and the surrounding area, and were always happy to return ""home"" at the end of the day.  Our room in the Garden Wing was extremely quiet, considering our stay included the oft-rowdy St. Patrick's Day weekend.  

We were a bit concerned about a ""smart casual"" dress code, as described in the hotel's welcome book.  The majority of our clothes were denim/casual for exploring historic Dublin pubs!  But the hotel's staff were always extremely pleasant, and never hinted that we were dressed inappropriately.

We appreciated our Concierge, Patrick, who knew our names after the 2nd day of our stay and greeted us warmly every time we passed by.  

Since we'd blown the majority of our budget on travel and accommodations we didn't avail ourselves to meals at the Merrion, with the exception of a couple of trips to the Cellar Bar.  We loved the atmosphere, cloistered in an 18th Century wine vault.  The food and service were excellent.

We'd return to Dublin again, having found it a very friendly city.  And we'd have to stay in the Merrion, because it's a jewel on the Emerald Isle.",5,2012,05,13
200,Simply an amazing hotel.  Five Stars!,"The room was perfect.  Large bathroom, sitting area, comforable bed.   Service was impeccable.  Nice gym, bar and restaurant.   Excellent location.   Close to all major areas.   Highly reccomended.",5,2012,05,11
200,Confirmed as Best 5* Hotel in Dublin- Exceptional Staff & Service,"My wife and I stayed in The Merrion , having last stayed there and reviewed it nearly 2 years ago as exceptional.Following our stay over the Public Holiday weekend  I am again according it the very highest of ratings,as it quite simply does everything that a 5* hotel should do and does it to an exceptionally high standard:-

-On arrival outside, beaming and friendly welcomes from two immaculately dressed front of house/concierge staff- our luggage immediately whisked inside , and our car driven away for parking
-Upgraded at reception to an even more luxurious room than we had already booked,ever so friendly staff,brought up to our room , luggage arrived almost instantly
-Bottle of champagne chilling on ice;beautifully appointed room with all the expected 5* extras-bathrobes, slippers, fine toiletries
-Cellar Bar pre-dinner drinks and dinner in Cellar Restaurant exceptionally good-real fine dining with a wonderful casual but upmarket ambience
-Complimentary newspaper delivered to our room the following morning
-Exceptionally good 'full Irish ' breakfast(served until 11am)
-On checkout, luggage taken to our car,and  we were asked if we wanted to leave our car with them for the day(as we wanted to walk to Grafton Street and poke about in the shops)-which we did, at no extra charge
-On return to the hotel, car taken up from the garage and brought out for us at front of the hotel

A truly 5* establishment in every respect, and if I had to find any negative it would be a very small point relating to a lack of soundproofing arising from a locked connecting door to an adjacent room, where voices were quite audible every now and then -no issues arose, but one could imagine a situation where they might!

Well done, Merrion , we had a fabulous stay- the service, ambience, staff (all friendly and smiling and with a greeting  without exception  during our stay , no matter what role or where we met them in the hotel). The art collection there is a gallery in itself and it is  a delight to walk around and look at these masterpieces located throughout the hotel.We did not use the Spa-but had a lo0ok at it and I have every reason to believe that this is as good as every other service in the hotel -fantastic pool!

No wonder that this hotel is ranked No1 in Dublin by reviewers- we again add our voice and opinion  to this well-deserved ranking.",5,2012,05,08
200,Best city hotel,"Fantastic three day stay at The Merrion.
Every member of the staff are fantastic and so courteous. 
Our first time, but there will be no debate as to our choice of hotel, next time we visit Dublin.

Grab a cocktail in The Shelbourne round the corner - great buzzy and classy bar.
Pearl Brasserie, right next door to The Merrion, is one of the best restaurants I've visited.",5,2012,05,07
200,Excellent,"This is a Beautiful Georgian building with a very grand appearance however I Found the reception and concierge particularly pretentious and somewhat dissmissive however the staff were pleasant throughout the hotel.
the restaurant served good quality seasonal cuisine and the breakfast was faultless,
I would recomend the eggs benedict!..
the room was comfortable however not as luxurious or spacious as I would have imagined afer seeing the rest of the hotel,  
All in all a very enjoyable stay, great food, wine, cocktails in a lovely surroundings.",5,2012,05,07
200,Beautiful courtyard,Loved our stay at the Merrion! One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.,5,2012,05,04
200,wonderful surprise,"Recently surprised with a weekend in this hotel for a romantic getaway, I was not disappointed.  The hotel is beautifully decorated, reception for both check in and check out was a dream, staff were all so friendly and helpful.  We ate in Patrick Guilbald's for one of our evening meals, it was fantastic, beyond expectation and defiantly an experience I will be repeating.  We had relaxing drinks in The Cellar bar before hitting the town and with everything round the corner there was no need for taxis.   The room was very comfortable and fresh.  We had room service one of the mornings, which was a delightful experience both food and service.  The young English gentleman (jamel I think) was very friendly and professional, he made getting out of bed a little more bearable!!!!!!! Overall I will defiantly return to this hotel, I had a fantastic weekend and have never been as impressed with overall service before.",5,2012,05,03
200,The best family hotel,"Originally booked for my wife and I, we decided to take our 5 year old son at the last minute. I would never have expected the Merrion to be particularly child friendly but I was wrong! Their website does mention they welcome children and they do. Best of all they treated him as a valued guest and he loved it! The staff were excellent - genuinely friendly to adults and children alike - the best I have come accross in any hotel. Perfect location for visiting National Gallery, Natural History Museum, St Stephen's Green, etc",5,2012,05,02
200,Almost Perfect,"This beautiful hotel in the heart of Georgian Dublin is one of the great hostelries of the world. The bedrooms, as one would expect in a 5-star hotel, are comparatively spacious, immaculately serviced, well equipped and very comfortable. The staff are friendly, professional and extremely helpful; the cuisine is of a very high standard and the food at the in-house 2-star Michelin Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is to die for!

My only disappointment with the hotel is, I'm afraid, a consequence of its own excellence: an influx of non-residents at lunchtime and in the evening often fills up the bars and public rooms and leaves nowhere for residents to sit when they want a light lunch or relaxed, pre-dinner drink. I have raised this point with the management and they have said that they will see what they can do to address the problem.

With a dedicated residents' lounge bar the Merrion would be 100%",5,2012,05,01
200,Just Right,"Beyond the unassuming, but beautiful Georgian façade, lies a gem of a hotel. Flowing through the reception and the elegant lounges with their warm open fires is a glass walkway through to the wings housing the beautifully designed bedrooms. Our third floor room looked out onto the well-manicured gardens and was extremely peaceful. It had just been refurbished and was equipped to a very high standard. The Cellar Restaurant, served excellent breakfasts and dinner in the evening. The cuisine was of a high standard with excellent service at both meal times. A walk past the swimming pool gave me a conscience every time following our meals, and in younger years I would have been more than tempted. Nowadays only an observation as to “high nice it looked”. Service from all at the Merrion was excellent at all times and in all areas. All in all well worth a stay in this well located first class hotel.",5,2012,04,27
200,Getting tired,"I love the Merrion and would always make it my number 1 choice for visitng Dublin

However, the service is slipping and the rooms are in a desparate need for refurbishment. 

The drawing room is still one of the best of any hotel in the world and it is always very relaxing.

With a little bit of TLC - it could be so much better",3,2012,04,27
200,Afternoon tea treat!,"As a treat we had afternoon tea at The Merrion and it was a treat!! 
We were leaving Dublin later in the day, the hotel were happy to look after our luggage (despite the fact we had not stayed here) until we came back for our tea. 
We arrived around 30 minutes early and not surprisingly our table was not ready! However the staff made us comfortable and accommodated us anyway.
The food looked and tasted great!",4,2012,04,26
200,Really one of the best,"There are many hotels in Dublin selling their wares as either modern box type outlets or as olde worlde charm establishments. This hotel is one of the latter and in my opinion the best of the type I have stayed in for many's a year.

The Georgian Facade and the underplayed Reception area (like a family lounge) are a harbinger of things to come on arrival. The hotel, despite having quite a few rooms is eager to convey the impressions of an old family country house. 

The rooms are absolutely top notch - old fashioned style but spotless, large and fitted with everything that one could want. IT access was FFF - fine, fast and free. 

Restaurants and bar were really excellent, both in terms of decor and food, even if the Cellar Restaurant is a bit of an acquired taste, being just what it says it is, a cellar. Afternoon tea in the large drawing room is something that should not be missed. I am told there is also an excellent Spa but because my wife and I both had doses of the 'flu, we didn't try this.

The staff - all of them without exception - are the best I can ever remember - anywhere - and thats saying something when I am comparing them with the top Asian hotels, Shangri La, Peninsula, etc. They are friendly and ultra helpful - an amazing thing for Ireland where the quality of hotel staff is not a strong point.

Its not cheap but you would not expect it to be - you pay for what you get - our room was Euro 260 per night and the one night stay including dinner, wine, breakfast and afternoon tea was Euro 450 in total including 20% VAT but there are cheaper room options.

It within walking distance of the city centre shops - far enough away to be peaceful and quiet but near enough for easy walking access.

Thanks for my stay, Merrion - we will be back again and again.",5,2012,04,25
200,classical hotel,"i stayed here for a night on a short business trip to Dublin. I checked in late after a long day - early flight - full meetings and was pleasantly advised I had been upgraded to a suite.

The suite was as you'd expect from this kind of hotel i.e. all of top standard with only one fault i could point out and that being I didn't have a view of the fabulous gardens. 

Breakfast in my room was very well done and there were nice touches like my boarding pass being printed and delivered to my room without me asking - that's good service.",5,2012,04,25
200,Wonderful Hotel in great location,"We have just returned from a wonderful three night romantic stay.  The hotel's exterior is subtle but the foyer and drawing rooms are superb.  The atrium down to the room was lovely and the room was very comfortable with all the touches you would expect at a 5 star hotel.    The staff were mostly great and could not help you enough.  All in all a great hotel but there were some very very minor drawbacks and it is the little things in a hotel that take it to the next level.

The service in No.23 Bar was great the first night, however the second night the female member staff lacked accomodability.  I had asked for crisps as I do not like nuts and I was served them on the first night however the second night she refsued, stating that she would charge us and was not flexible on the matter.  Given the style and class of the hotel, a little charm would not have gone a miss,  

The Spa is quite small and lacking a Sauna and Jacuzzi, however the pool is of a adequate size and the steam room is excellent.  

And finally the price of food.  Alcohol in the bars etc was reasonably priced but the food was out of this world.  Now I have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, but even their prices weren't close to this hotel.  30 euros for a pizza in the room does seem excessive.  

But apart from these little trifles, the hotel was superb and I will return if we ever go back to Dublin.",4,2012,04,24
200,The treat of a lifetime!,"I'm rather late with this review - we stayed at the Merrion over Christmas 2011 during the Big Freeze!
I'd love to say we'll be back but it will take a lot of saving or a lottery win to repeat our glorious time there. It was our first Christmas away from home, husband, son & I. I feared missing all the rest of the family & especially our grandchildren, but truth to tell it was so wonderful I managed to immerse myself in the special atmosphere & let everything else fade away!
Our room overlooked the frozen courtyard, magical in the ice & snow. The public rooms & foyer were beautifully decorated with trees...the one in the foyer rose above the fabulous staircase to the second floor.
We had room service breakfasts to die for, lunches & dinners worthy of Michelin chefs, everything was perfection!
Best of all were the staff - it was so pleasing to be in one of Ireland's top hotels & find such friendly, efficient people. Not at all like so many other hotels where the staff take themselves so seriously as to be haughty & cold. Three cheers for Irish hospitality! Thank heaven the hotel was so amazing, we were unable to leave during our three day stay due to the frozen conditions in the city, but I can honestly say I probably wouldn't have gone outside at any rate....why would I when all we ever dreamed of was in the Merrion!",5,2012,04,23
200,Total recharge. It was like a 2 week holiday,"We were welcomed when we arrived, welcomed back when we left. The Merrion delivered for us exactly what we needed. It was a one night stressfree recharge away from the kids that felt like a 2 week holiday. The cellar bar serves a great selection of wines by the glass, the food in the restaurant was excellent and the breakfast in the room was superb. The service is warm and considering the high standards the place is great value. Thank you Merrion for a wonderful stay.",5,2012,04,23
200,definitely worth a stay,"superb service, coupled with a convenient location opposite the government buildings and close to two parks, plus the Graffton street shopping.  the people definitely make the difference, but don't overlook the art collection and the gardens in the courtyard.  as well, having drinks in the drawing rooms by the fireplace after a chilly day is the perfect way to end the day.",5,2012,04,22
200,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed with a young family in 2 interconnecting rooms. Staff made it a great stay - as did the location and the pool.

Location is the best in Dublin. As per other reviews, the service and staff are outstanding. True 5 star +. Hotel open areas very very luxurious. Food excellent.  Rooms are good, but perhaps not 5 star +. Definitely among the most enjoyable hotel stays we've had.",5,2012,04,21
200,Top notch service in a beautiful setting,"Since it was my two son's first trip to Europe from New York I was a little worried how they would react to the long plane ride and the jet lag.  We arrived in Dublin shortly after 7am and we were driving up to the Merrion Hotel by 8:30.  My first impression of the hotel was that it was tasteful and discreet.  It is housed in a row of Georgian period houses what have great character and curb appeal.  My family was greeted very warmly by several bellmen in coattails who not only unloaded our luggage but assisted us in every way imaginable.  We were asked our surname and quided to the front check in desk.  Staff were plentiful and we were told that one of our 2 rooms was ready for occupancy.  I was relieved as i could tell at least one son wanted to grab a nap otherwise we would have to set out for the city until the rooms were available.  Staff gave us a quick tour of the grand parlors that were beautifully decorated on our way to our room.  We also passed a lovely interior garden on the way to the room as well.

The room was large and well appointed and the luggage arrived almost instantaneously.  Nice furnishings were accented by beautiful drapes as well as other luxurious touches.  The bathroom was quite large and very clean. We were offered a tour of the room but declined as we knew we needed a little quiet time.  Approximately two hours later we got a call from the desk that our second room was also available.  My wife and older son wanted some more rest so myself and my younger son were off to explore.

I had been to Dublin once prior so had a fair understanding of the layout of the city.  I took my son down to glance at the indoor pool which i knew we could be visiting later.  The pool is beautiful for an inner city hotel as most look like they were built as an afterthought.  Nicely proportioned and extremely clean.  We made our way back to the main entrance and were greeted by name, asked if we needed maps, taxis, etc.  Staff were just so attentive.

We stayed 3 nights in total experiencing a majority of the offering that the hotel had to give.  Breakfast is very well done and service is in line with every part of the hotel.  We travel often with our boys who are 9 and 11 and they were treated extremely well.  Sometimes when staying at a hotel of this caliber they can tend to forget children.  I would definitely suggest staying here for anyone who wants to stay at a top European hotel.  I look forward to coming back.",5,2012,04,20
200,Excellent,"Stay fairly reguarly and service is always spot on. Some rooms are a little on the 'compact' size but still luxorious. Just one very small criticism - as a female I cannot sit at the deak and see myself in the mirror to dry my hair - rooms probably designed by a man ! However, I get the feeling that if I mention it at my next visit they might even move it for me!
You will not be disappointed with a stay here.",5,2012,04,20
200,"The best hotel I've stayed in, full stop.","The Merrion is all about service. 
I have been in many hotels with good and even sometimes fantastic service but so far, non has matched the Merrion. I will try to explain why.
1. Consistence. I stay regularly at the Merrion. Not once have I been disappointed. People are very nice, really welcoming and always going the extra yard to make things as good as possible. When dealing with service, consistence is the real scale. 
2.   The right mix. If you travel in the US you can often feel that you get good service because staff rely on tips. If you travel to Asia, you get great service but really unpersonalized. In the Merrion, the staff has found the exact right mix between courtesy and friendliness. Very polite but not obsequious; interested in your visit to Dublin/Ireland but not too friendly either. 
3. Attention to detail. I honestly don't know how they do it. The first time I stayed there, the doorman greeted me by my family name and offered me an umbrella when leaving for a walk the day after checking in. They doorman had only heard my name once when I checked in the day before! He is the doorman, not the concierge! The whole front desk is also very likely to greet you by your name which always amazes me. 
4. Cosiness. Cup of tea or pint of Guinness, there is always a nice open fire in the sitting rooms downstairs. The cocktails are great (try the fantastic Basil smash!). Here again, fantastic service. 
5. Restaurant. First class Irish food with a twist of modernity at the downstairs restaurant. 
6. Spacious rooms. Unlike most hotels, the Merrion has kept nice rooms with a lot of space. 

Overall, I would never stay in any other hotel than the Merrion while in Dublin. I have stayed at the Shelbourne but they lack consistence and do not come close to what the Merrion offers both in terms of rooms and service.",5,2012,04,19
200,Must be the best hotel in Dublin,"I can't imagine a better one.  Impeccable service, superb amenities, beautiful rooms.  Great food, good bars, many lovely fireplaces.  Tremendous pool, perfect location, gorgeous gardens.  Really, it's perfect.  Of course, it is not cheap, but I'd charge a fortune if I were them, too.  This place is the only place to stay in Dublin if you can afford it.",5,2012,04,18
200,We were treated like royals,"My son and I had two nights here, and they were of service before we even arrived. I left my camera battery charger behind, and I emailed the concierge with a description of what I needed two days before I got to the Merrion. They had one waiting for me! We were surprised with a bottle of champagne and birthday cake in our room, as they knew the real purpose of the trip was to celebrate my son's 16th. It is central to Trinity, Grafton Street and Temple Bar. If you want an upscale, city center, luxury hotel, you can't go wrong.",5,2012,04,15
200,luxury hotel,"this hotel is lovely very well located in the centre of the city,
 also very private and very luxurious,
 also very expensive the staff in general were very helpfull all be it one comment on arrivall by a receptionist was a bit offish, 1st my  home address was commented on as being very near ?then i was told that i  can see you wont be  needing  an early call for breakfeast  indicating that i was there for something else, we were very surprised  with that comment ?  wow",4,2012,04,15
200,Perfect,"My second time at The Merrion, after having spent a night there with my wife and daughter last year. Everything was simply perfect, and I can't wait to be back. This time also had a snack delivered after I checked in late at night, the quality of which was another expression of the attention that is put in everything they do.",5,2012,04,15
200,"Elegant, classy and cool!","This was a real find, I guess the rates were lower for the season so we decided to stay for a few days.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful, John at the door made us feel like we were arriving home, excellent, fantastic staff, can't say enough about how wonderful the atmosphere at this cozy and beautifully decorated hotel is.  Our room was so comfortable, warm fluffy towels, really comfy bed, spacious, tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean.  Would love to stay there next time we go to Dublin.  Highly recommend and good value for money.  Best of all is it's bang smack in the center of Dublin, you just walk out the door and walk a couple of minutes and you hit all the stores and attractions.",5,2012,04,14
200,One of my favourite hotels in the world,"I have stayed at the Merrion Hotel several times and from the moment I enter the hotel, I know I will be able to relax with exquisite service and wonderful food. The staff are attentive and helpful and it is such a pleasure to stay there. My husband and I dined in the Cellar and the food was superb. This is a wonderful hotel and it is a peaceful haven in the middle of a fun and vibrant city. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I am in Dublin.",5,2012,04,13
200,an oasis of calm,"a quiet elegant retreat in the heart of Dublin! we joined four friends for an overnight stay at The Merrion that included champagne on arrival, dinner, bed and breakfast. What impressed from the outset was the courtesy of the staff, always present and pleasant but never intrusive. This style of service was evident everywhere in the hotel. The surroundings are elegant Georgian Dublin town house with comfortable furnishings, complemented by an extensive and important collection of Irish Art. The rooms were spacious with lots of extra comforts supplied.
Dinner and breakfast were in the Cellar Restaurant. Dinner was excellent and service exemplary. Breakfast was cooked to order to perfection. Overall a wonderful stay.",5,2012,04,12
200,Luxury with warmth,"Stayed for two nights--the night before my wedding and the wedding night itself. The welcome was very warm and of course I appreciated the upgrade given upon check in. The lobby, gardens and rooms are decorated very well, Georgian in style but with a fresh feel. The lobby has a relaxing vibe (not stiff at all), which is probably why it's always crowded for afternoon tea. Aesthetics aside, I really like their approach to service: they were attentive but never obtrusive. Noticed this especially when my bridesmaids and I were taking photos around the hotel. The food was also great, both room service and in the Cellar Bar where we had our wedding nightcap. All in all, The Merrion may not be crowned the most luxurious hotel in the world, but it is definitely an elegant place punctuated with professional as well as personal service.",5,2012,04,11
200,Always predictably excellent!,"I always stay in the Merrion when visiting Dublin.  On this occasion it was a business trip and it was nice to return to a relaxing evening in a comfortable hotel.  A friend joined me for drinks in the lobby followed by dinner in the Cellar.  Staff friendly without being OTT, my room was very recently renovated.  For me, whether traveling alone or with my husband from County Cork, I have yet to find a better spot for rest and relaxation.",5,2012,04,11
200,Fantastic Weekend,"Myself, husband & toddler stayed in this beautiful hotel over the Easter weekend and had a fabulous experience. The suite was stunning and so comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a facial in the Spa and felt re-energised after it. On Easter Sunday, we went to the Egg Hunt in the gardens - my toddler loved the excitement. The Lindt Easter bunny was a lovely touch. Also the complimentary hot chocolate was very welcome. We had dinner in the Cellar restaurant and it was devine. The waiters were extremely attentive and the food & wine was top notch. Breakfast was very good also. We will definitely return next year.",5,2012,04,11
200,Would come back again no problem,"We attended a wedding here and stayed overnight.  Obsolutely fantastic experience, staff couldn't have been more helpful and the food was superb.",5,2012,04,11
200,Enjoyable drinks at the Cellar Bar,"Went to the Cellar bar with colleagues for some after-work drinks. Nice place to meet up, didn't feel over crowded or noisy, it had a good selection of drinks, was ideally located with the staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2012,04,10
200,mini break in dublin,"We stayed in the Merrion for one night.  We are a couple with young children living in Dublin celebrating a significant birthday and enjoying a night off from childcare!  We left the children at home.  Everything was great - my only hesitations were: room was in old house which was great but a little old fashioned: no ipod dock, power in shower was very low.  These things didn't bother us too much but might bother someone else.  Also we ate in the cellar restaurant, which was good except for dessert - we both had different desserts and neither were good.  And we are not fussy about desserts usually!! They were poor.  The rest of the meal was great though and we had a great bottle of wine.  We were on a deal booked through the hotel website: B&B, champagne on arrival and dinner in the cellar restaurant, and car parking.  We thought this was very good value.",5,2012,04,10
200,#1 For a reason,"Stayed here over a weekend recently and it's a stunning hotel run as a 5 star hotel should be, with the appropriate facilities and and excellent breakfast. We also sampled Patrick Guilbaud's excellent restaurant on the Saturday night which is pretty much a peerless dining experience in Dublin.

The Cellar bar is also very nice and offers a good contrast to the No. 23 bar.",5,2012,04,09
200,Afternoon Tea-delightful,"Whilst we did not stay at The Merrion, my partner and I had the pleasure of taking afternoon tea there on Good Friday.

Firstly the waiter explained to us how it would be presented and served (in two courses with the tea as and when we requested it) and politely chatted to us about our plans for the time in Dublin.

When the first course came, again it was explained in detail what flavours where present and why the batten-burg was bright pink and blue! The food itself tasted delicious and we really had to force ourselves to eat slowly and not fill up too quick. 

The second course is the 'art' part of the package. Three generous sized deserts based on paintings from the hotel were placed in front of us and the waiter invited us to guess the flavours and paintings on which the deserts are based (which we viewed on a set of playing cards-a very fun touch!).

It is the above mixture of fun and the beautiful grand setting of the hotel that made it such a delightful experience. The staff are very welcoming and even recommended other afternoon tea experiences we may enjoy (in particular a 'fashion' afternoon tea in Paris, that a waitress mentioned, sounded very good!) and made us feel very at ease.

The cost of the afternoon tea is 36euro a head but I cannot stress enough how well this represents good value for money. The quality and quantity of the food is very good and the service received very attentive.

We hope to return next year in order to treat ourselves to a night away.",5,2012,04,09
200,Natural and friendly,"We stayed one night in a standard room to break our journey from the west to the north. The decor is old Georgian Dublin, while not ' bright and shiny new' is quite beautiful. The staff are proably the best I have ever encountered in any hotel in 30 years of travelling. They manage to be very attentive and friendly without being obsequious. The room was comfortable and big enough. I loved the marble in the bathrooms. The beautiful little garden a real gem in the city centre. Food and drink are very pricey but I expected this.",4,2012,04,09
200,Exceptional Hotel!,"Rooms, staff, service & food are fantastic! We really enjoyed our stay here, the little extras are what make the difference!",5,2012,04,08
200,Always a good choice,"Stayed for one night in one of the rooms in the main house. Excellent hotel with loads of character and an extremly good art collection. 

We always buy ourselves one of the packages at Christmas - for 2 persons B&B with tasting menu dinner in Patrick Guilbaud's restauraunt. Over the years the price has gone up from €300 to €325 and now €350 for the same deal. Overall it is an excellent package provided it stays at this rate.

The staff are very helpful but a slight 'attitude' issue from the girl on the front desk over me only having an email version of the voucher left me a little cold. We also had an annoyingly loud water gurgling issue in the room (bathroom radiator) which we reported during the evening and while at dinner it was to be checked out. While a note was left saying it was fixed - well it wasn't! Please just leave a note saying that you checked it out but couldn't resolve at present... better then a pre printed note saying it was fixed! However these are only very small issues for a hotel that overall does a very good job and has a very good product.

Its not cheap but it is extreemly well located smack in the middle of town and there are loads of spots around to visit or eat at. It is not near as busy a spot as the Shelbourne Hotel, that is nearby, but it is a totally different character hotel and is much quieter

Breakfast as always here is very good with a great choice and all freshly cooked.

Provided they stay on track, we will be back.",5,2012,04,02
200,relaxing and enjoyable,"Stayed over night with 2 children in an inter connecting room. Very pleasant atmospere-welcoming but not stuffy. Swimming pool is lovely and refreshing, well worth the visit- also the breakfast was excellent. Its worth trying the house speciality cocktails in the bar and the staff there are very helpful and courteous . It was our second family visit , as you can park the car and stroll around the city without worry ing about parking.A lovely central hotel.",5,2012,04,01
200,"Great hotel, wonderful staff","The hotel staff were very friendly. They go out of their way to make sure you're happy. Service was too notch. I never came across a rude staff member. 
    Have afternoon tea, very nice. It's a little pricey but worth it. 
     Hotel is close to restaurants, shops, attractions and the ""hop on, hop off bus.""
     Room was nice, but some of marble tiles around tub were falling off wall. 
     I'd definitely would stay there again!!",5,2012,04,01

200,You get what you pay for,Great location! Don't miss afternoon high tea. Very accommodating staff. Always addressed by name. All around impressive.,5,2012,03,31
200,"Very nice hotel, a few issues","I found the Merrion to be a great hotel for my stay in Dublin.  The room was large (by European standards) with great amenities and plenty of closet storage - with more than enough hangers.  The hotel staff were without exception polite and helpful.  There are a couple of reasons I gave 4 stars.  1.  I had asked multiple times about parking costs and never received an email response addressing this.  I saw on the website under amenities complimentary parking, so I did not worry.  On checkout I was charged 20 euro per day for parking which was an unpleasant surprise.  2.  I would say the housekeeping/turndown service was somewhat intrusive.  When I placed the do not disturb sign, they actually knocked not once but twice that day to make sure I really didn't need anything.  3.  There is a hole in the security in that there is no way to completely lock the door.  My last night I had pushed in what I believed to be the lock, only to have someone enter my room after 9 pm turning on the light and coming around the corner to the bed area before seeming to realize the room was occupied.  I brought this to the attention of the staff on checkout and received feedback that this was the housekeeper coming for turndown service.  My issue with this is - I want to know that I am secure in my hotel room.  There should be a chain or bar that I can employ.  Also, 9 pm is fairly late to be entering a room for turndown ( I had a very early flight and thus went to bed around 8pm).  It was alarming.  

Overall, this is a charming hotel in a convenient area with pleasant and helpful staff.  If they address the security issue, I will recommend them without hesitation.",4,2012,03,29
200,"Wonderful stay, but avoid the extras","Our hotel stay itself was wonderful.  The room was gorgeous and huge, decorated in blue and gold, with a large marble bathroom.  We were upgraded to a junior suite.  The junior suite was so perfect I wouldn't bother to get an executive suite even if I had the money.  The champagne that came with our package wasn't cheap stuff, either.  Very good.

Now for the extras....  I would NOT recommend either the art tea or the Tethra Spa.  The art tea is very heavy on the sweets.  I've had better pastries elsewhere.  I recommend getting tea there, but order ala carte.  The tea itself is top-notch, and some of the food is good, but you'll want to pick and choose in order to not go into diabetic shock.  The spa is....pretty bad.  The locker room has almost no amenities, there's no hot tub and the massages themselves are....not good.  Mine was okay.  My husband's was just plain bad.  Like, Burke-Williams bad.  Like, you can't get your masseuse to use more pressure for more than a minute, so the rub-down makes you restless instead of relaxing you or fixing any knots you have.  Believe me, the Swedish Massage is the litmus test of any spa, and if they can't even do a good one, avoid it in the future.",4,2012,03,28
200,"Delightful hotel, warm and caring staff","Dublin on business. Staff were extremely helpful and showed a genuine interest in making life easier for people, including me, during their stay. Breakfast was excellent. Room was comfortable and quiet with a courtyard view. Only staying one night was a shame, but heading back in May. Great central location.",5,2012,03,23
200,Little bit tired but still a classic,"With only one night as a group of 3 friends wanting our own rooms, we were struggling between cost and oppulance. We decided on the Merrion after either not getting into our first choice of hotel due to availability, cost or bad reviews on other options. The Merrion seemed to tick the boxes in terms of location (quiet but within easy walking distance of the centre of town), fair reviews and value for money. It is looking a bit tired but, strangely, that seemed almost fitting for the classical decor and faded charm. The art work is astounding. The staff were more than friendly (had to be beyond the norm when 3 sligthly worse for wear guests turn up at 4:30 am asking for drinks) so I'm a bit surprised by some of the most recent postings. We didn't eat at the restaurant but it looked lovely. I'd recommend with a modicum of forewarning. If you want contemporary and smart then probably not the hotel for you but if you want character and charm, then no issues.",4,2012,03,19
200,This is no Four Seasons !!!,The Four Seasons was fully booked so I thought this would be comparable. It wasn't even close. The doorman was great so it all started fine. Our bags were sent straight up another plus. The hotel and rooms are tired and need refreshing. The lobby and salon carpets are so tattered and stained you can't even make out if they had a pattern at one time. We met up with family and had cocktails in our room. I had just bought some newgrange martini glasses and made the drinks myself. We went for dinner downstairs in the Cellar restaurant which was great. Came back late and tired so we just went to bed. The blanket was so thin it really was just a sheet and the bed was uncomfortable. We went sightseeing the next day and when we returned our room had been cleaned and my martini glasses gone. After numerous calls to housekeeping and finally management I was told they found my glasses but they had fallen off a tray and had all broken. Someone came to the room with an apology and a bottle of cheap champagne. They took the empty box and explained they would find replacements which they did the next day. They also let anyone reserve tables in the salons and bars so if you come back to your hotel and want to have a mid afternoon bite you can't because every seat and table is reseved. Aren't you supposed to take care of your guests first. I'm sorry when you stay at a hotel that is supposed to be five star things like this just shouldn't happen,3,2012,03,18
200,Enjoyable stay,"My husband and I just had a brief one night stay here and we really enjoyed it.  Contrary to the previous reviewer I found the receptionist very pleasant and helpful.  The room was fine, nothing spectacular but overall we found the staff exceptionally pleasant and helpful and they were always willing to offer assistance.  The staff were the best part of this hotel!  One gripe I had was that I incurred an additional charge for eggs benedict at breakfast (which wasn't worth it!!) while my husband's full Irish breakfast looked much more appetising and was included in our B&B rate!! But that was just one very small complaint during what was overall, a very enjoyable stay.",4,2012,03,12
200,So so very disappointing! Dirty Hotel.,"When will hotels and hotel staff realise you need more than a decent location to equate to 5 stars?!?

Dirty, tired in desperate need of a good scrub and refurbishment, The Merrion Hotel is definitely not somewhere I would recommend to a friend.

Genuinely shocked by my other trip adviser member reviews of this hotel ( sincerely feel they may not be genuine)
Unfortunately the experience my husband and I had was not a positive one.

Reception staff were loud, rude and could not have been more unwelcoming. 
We had the unfortunate experience of being checked in by Kye, awfully unfriendly and unpersonable for a front of house staff member.

I have to say though that this unwelcoming nature is certainly not representative of Ireland and Dublin specifically. I am irish myself and was in Dublin for a short stay, we were expecting a pleasant stay similar to what we have had in the Sherbourne Hotel or The Westbury Hotel.

So if you overlook the rude reception staff, the disappointment continues.
We booked a street view suite, and as one of their supposed 'better' rooms,  I was disgusted to see how shabby and dirty it was!! The carpet looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks...perhaps ever! 
 The soft chairs had rips that would be impressive for an unsupervised Alsatian dog to make! Truly disgraceful for what claims to be a 5 star hotel. The comforter on the bed had better days if you know what I mean! A lot of discolouration in general to the soft furnishings.

The lift smelled like fish from the day we arrived to the day we departed-unsure why.

Breakfast, again disappointing. Hot breakfast was ironically-cold.

Unlike almost any other hotel in Dublin city, this hotel has No atmosphere at all. I guess the staf have something to do with creating a positive buzzy atmosphere in a hotel, and so this probably explains the lack of...
Only redeeming feature was the friendly porters and concierge. Unfortunately u really only come across them when leaving and arriving..... In between u have to pass the dreadfully unhappy and creepy reception staff.

Most importantly;
This hotel is Not a 5 star!
Don't be fooled, perhaps if you get a good deal then book it, as the location is good, not as good as the shelbourne and westbury but good if you get a deal, otherwise don't book it, you will be disappointed and regret it.",1,2012,03,09
200,"Ready for the next visit, 2012","This will be the 6th yearly treat to the Merrion.  Last time we stayed we were upgraded to a suite as we were regular visitors. Wow.......overlooking the government buildings, we could watch for celebs driving up. (You almost always see at least 2 celebs here).
It's an absolute must for a special pampering. you really are looked after like royalty. Everyone is so friendly though. No pomp or ceremony at all. x",5,2012,03,09
200,My memorable 60th birthday surprise from Jennifer Mark & Simon,Had a wonderful weekend in the Merrion Hotel on the 2nd & 3rd March 2012. The service & been made feel so special for the weekend will leave an everlasting memory of my stay in this unique hotel. Helene,5,2012,03,07
200,A dream weekend!!!,"We have literally just returned from our stay at the merrion hotel and it was amazing.  The staff are fabulous - absolutely nothing is too much trouble.  We had our toddler with us and on arriving in our room discovered his travel cot complete with full size baby bath products and a bottle warmer - so thoughtful.  In addition to this, he also had his own slippers and mini bath robe which was so cute!
The following afternoon, there was a knock at the door and one o the staff arrived with a tray full of small toys and a balloon to keep our son entertained - another fab treat.
On our second day, we also used the pool facilities which are lovely however I would say that for small children, the pool is cold!! We couldnt stay in long with him as he was chittering!!  Spa stuff are lovely and very interested!!
We didnt have any food in our hotel - mainly because we were unsure how our son would cope!!  We would of loved to have had afternoon tea but again the drawing room etc are very ornate!  This is no fault of the hotels!!
One small gripe was that our room was a standard room in the garden wing which claims on the website to have city views - ours was not city but an old disused building complete with grafetti.  We werent in our room much and when we were we just kept the curtains closed!  We also had no coffee tea facilities in our room and although these were available if you asked for them.
The hotel itself is very central - about ten minutes from the action!! Grafton shop is great for some retail therapy and stephens green was a great place to visit with children.  We also spent the day at Dublin Zoo which was great too!
Looking forward to going back!!",5,2012,03,06
200,Wonderful,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend at the Merrion.   I hope very much that we will return again soon.

The staff are friendly and helpful but not intrusive.   Everyone has a smile and a welcome from the doormen to reception to housekeeping.  We genuinely felt that nothing was too much trouble and that the doormen really did care if we had had a good day or not!

The hotel is comprised of four Georgian town houses and you can see the slightly different styles between the houses reflected in the reception rooms.  The reception rooms are beautifully appointed with open peat fires.  Lunch and afternoon tea are served in the two sitting rooms and looked spectacular although we ate so well we did not manage to sample either.  The bar at 23 is a delightful place to have a nightcap.

The Spa facilities are very good and there is a small gym.    

We ate at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant on our first night and it was exceptional.  We chose the four course tasting menu but with the pre appetisers and pre desserts etc it felt more like a ten course meal!  They also have a fabulous wine list.

Our room overlooked the beautiful gardens and was very comfortable.   

The hotel is in a great location with bars and restuarants nearby.  I would recommend a trip to O'Donoghues to hear the live music in the evening, it is just round the corner.

We had a lovely time here and I would not hesitate to recommend The Merrion to my friends.",5,2012,03,05
200,"Merrion Hotel, Dublin",Great place to stay whilst visiting Dublin City. Excellent spa facilities.,5,2012,03,04
200,Just love this hotel,"Every time I travel to Dublin I stay here. It is simply perfect, the attentiveness of the staff is simply outstanding, the service wonderful and teh facilities simply first class. This is a true ""home from home"". It is isn't cheap but then top notch quality service comes at a price and Eur199 per night isn't that expensive in my honest opinion.

The bedrooms I can only describe as serene; the restaurant in the basement is of very good quality, excellent food!! The swimming pool also is simply great, a good place to unwind.

If you want ot grab a drink in the bar area, it is very peaceful. Should you decide to have ""high tea"" you cannot put a foot wrong. They bring you a very complete tea with sandwiches, cakes etc.

I have been stayed here inthe past and will definitely be coming back! In fact a friend of mine was expatriated to Ireland about 9 months ago. He stayed at various hotels in Dublin and when he came across this hotel, at my recommendation, he just couldn't get over how good it was! In the end he ""lived here"" for over 3 months!!",5,2012,03,01
200,Amazing,Loved this hotel and definetly the best 5* I have stayed in and certaintly the best in Ireland. Rooms are stunning and the service is fabulous without being too intrusive. it has a old world feel to it.,5,2012,02,28
200,Calm Oasis in Dublin City Centre,"Pro's: 
- Great location in Dublin city centre only a few minutes stroll from Stephens Green. 
- Wonderful service from all staff members without exception. Polite and polished in all cases.
- Beautiful drawing rooms with elaborate floral displays for drinks or afternoon tea. 
- Extensive drinks menu in the residents bar with lovely complimentary nuts and olives. 
- Nice toilitries available in the bathroom. Decent size and good quality. 

Con's: 
- Long wait for breakfast.
- Room was nice but not very luxurious. Some new, more luxurious bed linen could improve this. All other facilities in the room were great though. 
- Expensive so keep an eye out for good deals on the website.",5,2012,02,27
200,Excellent Service,"We were delighted to have an opportunity to stay at The Merrion while on a recent business trip to Dublin. Overall, we were very pleased with our short stay. The service and the food were the highlights and the package on offer represented very good value. 

From the moment we arrived the service was just excellent.  Friendly and efficient staff took care of car, bags and check in with the utmost professionalism and good humour.  Any requests that we had were taken care of with impressive speed and attention to detail. 

Our only disappointments related to our room.  While beautifully appointed and perfectly clean, we were disappointed to find that we overlooked an alley way and a disused red brick building, complete with graffiti.  We had assumed from the website that a Garden Wing Room would afford some view of the garden - this was our own misunderstanding that this is not automatically the case. When we looked back at our booking, it did describe the room as having a ""City View"", in this case however, it wasn't one of the more pleasant city-scapes and certainly not one that featured in the photographs on the website.  Given that we had engagements outside the hotel and would not be returning until later that evening, we closed the curtains and ignored the view. 

Our further disappointment relating to the room occurred at about 12:40 am, when we were awakened by extremely loud and persistent plumbing noises. One of our neighbours (above or next door?) was taking a shower.  Thankfully it ended after about 15 minutes, just as we were about to call reception.  It didn't last too long, but it did put an end to a good night's sleep.  We did mention this at check out, but were not sure how this feedback would be handled and what efforts would be made to ensure that future occupants of this room would  avoid the same fate. Given that our overall experience was otherwise very good, we would like to think that this was a one off but we're not so sure!

Overall, the service, food and facilities in the main hotel made for a very agreeable stay. The location is excellent and allowed us to walk wherever we needed to get to on this trip.  We would return, but would ensure that we selected a different room.",4,2012,02,24
200,"Absolutely fantastic, cannot fault this hotel","My boyfriend booked this hotel as a surprise valentines weekend and i can honestly say it is a stunning hotel.  From the moment we arrived the service was amazing. It is a fantastic hotel and it completely deserves its five stars. We stayed in the Lord Monck suite which is absolutely stunning and is huge. The staff are wonderful and cannot do enough to help the service was faultless. The spa was lovely and it has a beautiful swimming pool. The breakfast was gorgeous and although we only stayed for the weekend i can honestly say i don't think another hotel will ever live up to the expectations i have after staying here. Wonderful hotel, fantastic staff especially the concierge and very highly recommended. 10/10",5,2012,02,22
200,luxury,"As other reviews have said, pure bliss. Stayed on the five star steal again, which really does not cost much more than a lot of basic enough hotels around Dublin, when everything is taken into account. The hotel is understated elegance, staff are very friendly and helpful. I love it and cant wait to get to stay again soon!",5,2012,02,21
200,24 hours of bliss!,"We returned to The Merrion for an overnight stay this weekend.  A Christmas present from our children , we have since told them they need never wonder what to buy us again more of the same would be lovely!!  It's hard to describe why this hotel ticks so many boxes in so many ways but personally I feel its a quiet confidence that it exudes. The decor is spot on .  the lounges are cosy and inviting while at the same time being luxurious,  The service is prompt and pleasant.  Rooms are superb...we were lucky enough to be upgraded this time and were uninclined to leave our suite such was the comfort and decadence of it all. Breakfast was lovely with a really wide choice all of which was fresh and appetizing.  It's absolutely beyond me why any one would opt for any of the other 5 Star hotels in the vicinity when the Merrion is there and that is said having had overnight stays in two others very close by!",5,2012,02,20
200,Great location,"I would recommend this hotel. The staff were excellent on customer service and the overall experience was fantastic.
If I was to be picky I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities automatically placed in our room without having to ask for them and also for the standard of the hotel I was surprised not to have an iron or ironing board.
But my lasting memory is fantastic city, good times, great food and make sure you visit Temple Bar at night to experience the fantastic bands that are playing.",4,2012,02,19
200,First Class Luxury at reasonable rates,"My son and I stayed at the Merrion in Dublin, November of 2011 for
the second time.  The ambience, the attention to detail was the same.
They have several plush lounges where you are served food and drink
24 hrs. a day.  The servers are great.They and the front desk people make you feel like royalty. There is a quiet, genteel feeling in the lounges where there is never any rudeness, but instead a feeling 
of aristocracy without being pretentious.  I would highly recommend this establishment above any other hotel in Ireland. Right next door is
the excellent restaurant, Pearl Brasserie. It's also close to St. Stephen's Green for excellent shopping.",5,2012,02,15
200,Great weekend break - almost,Top Hotel with a great location for the City Centre. Gourmet food excelllent (about Euros140 per head with wine) but rather lacking in ambience. Cellar pub better for fun. Breakfast at Euros 30 per head not worth it. Nice spa.,4,2012,02,13
200,True Class in the heart of Dublin,"Traveling over 150 nights a year can make hotels all blend into one chorus of yes sir no sir and where shall we send the bill sir.  Not so at The Merrion.  My wife and I spent a night here on a recent, and rare, night away from it all in Dublin.  Staff, to a man and woman, were excellent.  The room, in the original part of the hotel, was really superb.  A short walk to Grafton Street and then back for dinner.  Late breakfast in the cellar and off by 12.  It was the most relaxing night away we have enjoyed in ages.  I have since recommended to a few business friends traveling and they have all raved about it.  Excellent stuff Merrion, well done for being the best you can be, we will definitely be back for work or play.",5,2012,02,12
200,Beautifully Restored Georgian Architecture,"I stayed here during an overnight business trip. I arrived after dark and left early the next morning but despite my short visit, I was impressed the the beautifically restored combination of 4 old townhouses and the attached garden wing. The public rooms and guest rooms are all very nicely layed out. I liked the private club atmosphere of the Bar 23 and the nearby drawing rooms. 

I had a room in the more modern garden wing overlooking the garden area and its fountains. The room was comfortable with a modern, white marble bathroom with both a tub and shower. Free wifi was provided in the room.

The service was very attentive. I was in the Bar 23, asked for directions to the Cellar restaurant and was personally led down the hall and right to the elevator. All the service staff were equally courteous and responsive in every way.

I had dinner at the Cellar Restuarant (in an old wine cellar). Food was delicious, service great.

Walked by a beuatiful looking spa with what apeared to be a large pool.",5,2012,02,12
200,Nice weekend at the Merrion,"My partner and I spent two nights at the Merrion in late January and would happily return.  We stayed in the original part of the hotel which is definitely the nicer section.  There is a newer section and those rooms are quite average in comparison (we had massages and my treatment room was in the newer section of the hotel)...we chose a deluxe junior suite which while a bit pricey was worth it...the room was gigantic with a seating area, king bed and 15 foot+ high ceilings.  The marble bathroom was great with separate shower and tub (though the shower was more like a small phone booth.  There is a Michelin star restaurant (which we didn't have the pleasure of trying, Dublin's only two-star restaurant I think) and a more casual restaurant which was pretty mediocre.  But we did enjoy high tea in the bar (you have to reserve in advance to enjoy tea in the parlor rooms which are nice and with fireplaces) which was great fun.  The location is great and the staff very friendly.  We would definitely return.",4,2012,02,11
200,When in Dublin - stay at the Merrion!,"Favourite hotel in Dublin. Staff are courteous, attentive, friendly and yet discreet. Main lounge area is beautiful, subtle and understated and full of art  to admire. Very convenient (5 minutes walk from Grafton Street) to best shopping and entertainment in Dublin. Thoroughly recommend. Have spent several very enjoyable, relaxing weekend breaks in Merrion and will continue to return.",5,2012,02,09
200,An Irishman in Dublin,"There is something very special about staying and relaxing in grand ancient and luxurious rooms of a true Old Dublin Residence.  Restored so gracefully, American visitors will tell you in detail about this fantastic experience but really its a pleasure us Irish should avail of more.  The Merrion offers all that is wonderful about Dublin hospitality.",5,2012,02,09
200,Irish hospitality at its best,"For 25 years I stayed yearly at the Shelborne Hotel Dublin.A few years ago an American chain took over management of the Shelborne and I decided to change my allegiance.
How glad I was that I found the Merrion for this hotel not only fulfills my present wishes and wants but maintains that irish feel which is so special.The accents may be more East European than Irish but the service and friendliness remain.I have had 2 6 night stays at The Merrion in the last year and I would go back for more next week.Make sure you have the irish breakfast!!",5,2012,02,07
200,Wonderful experience all around,"Traveled to Dublin on a family vacation late December 2011.  There were 18 of us total!  I found The Merrion absolutely delightful and really can't think of anything I didn't like.  Felt very comfortable away.  Literally, we arrived off a very early flight and had to wait a short amount of time for a room to be ready so my husband and I sat on a couch in one of the common rooms and I instantly fell asleep in front of a warm, crackling fire.

You can order tea, hot chocolate, scones and such in the common rooms and they were very tasty.  We ate our first dinner in the hotels main restaurant and I enjoyed every bite!  There's also a cellar bar downstairs that looked fun but we never made it there.  Breakfast each morning was delicious and filling.

The staff was great there.  Our room was always immaculate when we returned from being out.  Clothes folded, water refreshed, everything tidied up.  

Also, it's a great location!  Just a short walk to much of the action such as Grafton St, St Stephens Green and Trinity College.  Also, just around the corner is a wonderful pub, O'donoghues.

I definitely don't think this hotel would ever disappoint :)",5,2012,02,04
200,Second visit,"This was our second stay at The Merrion. The staff are great, the common rooms comfortable and relaxing; the Cellar Bar a treat. This time we had lunch in the Cellar bar, it was small but very tasty! The cocktail bar is relaxing but has limited seating. As you would expect, drink prices are very high….

Our luggage awaited us in our bedroom, which was well appointed. No tea/coffee facilities unless you requested them. That same ‘city view’ of a brick wall was present. Comfortable bed, with turn down service at night. Big bathroom with shower and bath.

This time we got to avail of the spa. The pool is lovely, but the whole spa is quite small with less facilities than other hotels. The gym is small but satisfactory. The spa staff are pleasant and helpful.

Breakfast had a good selection, but when you see the price of the full Irish on the menu it’s extortionate!! Also, a lot of items come with supplements, which was disappointing. Eggs Benedict had a 6 euro supplement; I have often eaten this in other hotels as part of our B&B package with no extra charge.

There was no acknowledgment of the birthday we were celebrating which was a letdown to be honest, but it didn’t ruin our night away. 

This hotel is gorgeous and we had a great time. I am really only marking it down on no personal touch i.e. not even a note in the room wishing you a happy birthday, and honestly, in this day and age how can you justify charging 30+ euros for a full Irish???",4,2012,02,02
200,Ambiance and Luxury,"Amazing hotel. After a very long and disrupted flight it was really great to enter the Merrion Hotel. The staff is probably one the best I have ever encountered so far in hotels around the world. They always politely offer their help and advice, they are able to engage in a conversation in a very polite and sincere manner...really amazing.
My room was a standard facing a side street but it was nicely appointed and of a good size , it has all you might need . Bathroom and Asprey amenities were great.
Concierge was of a great help in sorting restaurant reservations at last moment in the nearby 2 star Michelin restaurant and in giving excellent advices. 
Sitting in front of the fireplace for a drink or tea is a must .. I did in the morning Tea and freshly baked scones ...by the fireplace. 
This is really the place to stay. Location is excellent and Dublin is not a big city and you can pretty much walk from the hotel to anywhere you might need to go.",5,2012,02,02
200,New Year in Dublin at the Merrion,"The Merrion has the best reviews and best reputation locally and so we chose this and it does not disappoint on any level.  Subtle yet attentive service, two great restaurants (one with a Michelin star was closed over new year sadly) a lively cellar bar and a dlightful sitting room/tea area/lobby all make for a perfect mix.  Add to that the location near shops and bars and pubs and you get an unbeatable mix.  We absolutely loved the place and would strongly recommend to anyone.",5,2012,02,01
200,Pure luxury,After been upgraded to a suite in main house our stay could not go wrong.everything fabalous .We dined in cellar restaurant and was very good.Breakfast was wonderful. Dover sole was fable in cellar restaurant .We will be back please God,5,2012,01,30
200,Pure Luxury,"A stay at The Merrion is an experience worth the money although it really is very pricey. 
Ireland, especially Dublin isn´t exactly an inexpensive place anyway and this hotel belongs to the ""Leading Hotels of the World"" so expect to pay a high price.
We chose one of the smaller rooms, and the size of the room and bathroom was REALLY small - other than that no complaints. 
Dinner, breakfast, High Tea and snacks were all wonderful, and sitting by the fire was cozy. 
You could literally ""smell"" style and tradition here - loved that.
Great location, impressive building, beautifully decorated, and walking distance to city centre.
I highly recommend their restaurant ""The Cellar"".",5,2012,01,30
200,Almost excellent hotel for a family break,"We stayed here on the Family Fun break which consisted of a king and twin interconnecting, comp cocktails (and mocktails!) and children under 12 ate free in the Cellar restaurant. The hotel itself is brilliantly located just off St Stephens Green. Valet parking is almost a must for central Dublin as its so hard (and expensive) to park there. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were huge and had a great view over the courtyard garden. There were two plates of fruit and smoothies waiting for us as well as a slice of beautiful cake (it was my birthday).
We went out straight away - wandered along Grafton St and took in the Wax Museum, which was a great experience. When we came back we just relaxed in the room. I had been told that 5.30 was the only reservation we could have in the restaurant as it was so busy, so I hadnt pre booked as that was a bit early. At 6 we got a call to tell us our table was ready which was a bit odd and didnt say much for the communication prior to arrival (I had emailed to say we didnt want the 5.30 reservation and would make other plans). We popped down to the bar for the cocktails at 6.30, passing the restaurant, which was empty. Even though we had been told it was booked out and that 5.30 had been the only time we could have. I suspect the restaurant are not keen on having children in on a busy night, but this was so obviously not busy. I was a bit put out at that.
Anyway, the cocktails were nice and then we had room service, which was excellent.
We had a great sleep, its a very quiet hotel. Before breakfast, we went to the pool which was really nice, but doesnt have a shallow end so not the best for a non swimming child.
Breakfast was ok, the buffet was great, varied and fresh. Our cooked breakfasts took quite some time to come out. When we were leaving, there was a big queue for tables, which I thought was not great for a high class hotel. They were obviously busy that morning.
Check out was efficient and our car was brought right to the door, We then headed off for a very rainy, but fantastic, trip to the zoo.
Overall, this is a lovely central hotel. I was slightly annoyed about the dinner arrangements but that was just a small part of what was a good experience in a lovely city.",4,2012,01,30
200,Warm elegant and a real 5 star treat,"We stayed for just one 'memorable' night in this wonderful hotel, we had actually won the stay on Lyric Radio.  From the moment we made contact - a week before our stay we were dealing with the most friendly and efficient staff - nothing was a problem and every request dealt with immediately.  We wanted to make the most of our one night so decided to arrive for lunch - all sorted by the efficient Lena who also arranged an early car park space. We were met by the valet as we pulled up outside the hotel who took possession of our car and bags, the reception staff greeted us warmly and had us checked in very fast - out room was not ready but our bags were taken for storage and we were escorted over to the cellar restaurant, with the drawing rooms and spa pointed out to us along the way.  Our lunch was fabulous with some very well presented food, our waiter steered me towards a nice red to compliment my steak, I was so glad I took his advice it was yum and the perfect accompaniment to my meal - the lunch offered great value 2 courses 20 euro or 3 for 23 - the water still or sparkling and tea or coffee free - there was ample choice too.  After taking our time over lunch it was off to check out our room - we were supposed to be in a standard garden suite room but were very surprised to me escorted to a main house garden view room!  The room itself was so elegant and very spacious with one of the biggest bathrooms we have ever seen in a hotel - it rivalled the famous Sacher Hotel! - the toiletries were Asprey and a very decent size, there is a heated towel rail, separate bath and shower in a very elegant marble setting with ample soft fluffy towels.  The bed was King size and very comfortable, there was a beautiful sitting area and full length windows overlooking the beautiful gardens. Each room has it's own climate control system - which works very well!  We took ourselves off to the spa which has a gym area, beautiful pool and steam room and some very helpful cheerful staff, there was a good range of treatments available but alas I did not have time to sample any!  The changing area was roomy and very clean with ample towels and robes.  We enjoyed an hours leisure here before we had to go get ready for the Opera (part of our prize).  When we came back that night there had been a turn-down service and our room was now bathed in soft lamplight, fresh slippers had been placed by our beds and fresh bottled water placed on each bedside table.  We went downstairs to sit by the fire in one of the beautiful drawing rooms where we ordered a light supper - the number 23 - small soup, small sandwiches and a little sweet treat - perfect for a light supper - we also ordered a bottle of the gorgeous Malbec suggested by our waiter at lunch.  We slept soundly with no noise interference and awoke to the sound of our breakfast in bed treat....a wonderful array of food selected the night before from an extensive menu - it was delicious and a great way to end our very short stay.  Checkout was very fast and when we enquired could we leave the car and wander over to the National Gallery for an hour that was no problem!  

A wonderful experience which I would have no hesitation in recommending!",5,2012,01,29
200,Dublin's best,"I've stayed in quite a few Dublin hotels and this is easily the best to date.

staff very helpful.
Rooms excellent.
a great night's sleep..quiet room
fab bathroom and amenities

location is great (depending on your needs)

price is a little high - i'd love to stay here regularly but price may prevent this",5,2012,01,28
200,A hotel for the SUPERSTARS,"Don't miss out on the wonderfull breakfast as you'd never know who you might see !

Just the the indoor pool and steam room toooooooooo.",5,2012,01,26
200,Style Matches Substance,I stayed at the Merrion on the 1st of January this year. I was half expecting the place to be exhausted from the big night before. It was quite the opposite. The staff were alert and excellent and the place looked immaculate. They manage to hit the balance between grandeur and warmth perfectly. Our room was large and spacious and the view into the courtyard was very relaxing. I loved the large bathroom too. Separate bath and shower with ample toiletries. The location is ideal for experiencing Dublin and the staff were very helpful in directing us. Although I was only there for one night I was able to appreciate how well the hotel was run. My favorite hotel in Dublin so far.,5,2012,01,25
200,Elegant Georgian splendour in Dublin,"A wonderful long weekend, our first time in the Emerald Isle, was enhanced by our stay at The Merrion.  A milestone birthday for my husband, we arranged to meet four friends for dinner as a surprise for him, and all the arrangements were taken care of by the hotel, including making sure we were staying in a different wing of the hotel to avoid bumping in to our friends before the surprise reveal!

A warm welcome awaited us from the moment we stepped through the door and our bags were whisked away to our suite, which was beautifully furnished and tastefully decorated.  Personal service was of an exceptional level, but always unintrusive; the sign of an excellent hotel.

The lounge bar was warm and welcoming and the perfect place to enjoy pre-dinner drinks and nibbles.  Dinner itself, in the Michelin-starred restaurant, was everything you would expect - exemplary service in a very romantic setting.

Everything is within touching distance, and the sightseeing bus stops right outside the hotel (well worth doing this if you are in Dublin for a couple of days).  Visit the cathedrals; they are stunning.

In summary, this is a great hotel, top price bracket but worth it.  An SLH hotel, but check out other websites for the best deals.",5,2012,01,24
200,Best service I've ever had,"Amazing hotel with excellent service. The location is excellent close to Graffton St and bars/restos...etc

Spa/Pool is huge and very relaxing",5,2012,01,24
200,Class of its own!,"We stayed here as a special treat on our first trip to Dublin. Very unassuming from the outside, this is a beautiful property. Tasteful decor, and a vast art collection. Staff always very charming and very helpful. We ate at the Cellar Restaurant one night and the food was perfect - no complaints. The cocktails made my José at bar No.23 are fab - try the Basil Smash! And for an extra treat, dinner at Patrick Guilbauds is exceptional. Hotel also is in a very good location - no more than 30mins walk (approx!!!) to all the main areas you would want to visit. Would love to go back one day. Once the wallet has recovered a bit! :)",5,2012,01,24
200,Brings me back to the days of Yeats and Maud Gone,I went here with my friend for tea and hot chocolate and the surroundings are great especially the open fire!! the hot chocolate i chose a caramel flavour drink it tasted lovely but wasn't hot so I just drank it quickly before any remaining heat left. the cream cooled it down too much but we got little cakes to go with it. its nice and quite in there if you wanted to go in there alone.,5,2012,01,23
200,"Cunningly disguised, but found it none the less!","A one night stay, but the quality of this hotel stands out a mile! I had some trouble finding the place initially. Despite the GPS indicating that I was right outside it, all I could see was a row of Georgian houses. It was only when the doorman stepped outside that I figured out that I was in the right place (I then noticed the sign next to the door). The car was whisked away, suitcase delivered to the room and, following a speedy check-in, I was escorted to the room. The service was excellent!

Once again opportunities to look around were limited, but what I saw was magnificent. The bedroom was spacious, with high ceilings and an enormous king-size bed. Downstairs there were several sitting rooms with original features and peat fires. Breakfast was served in the new part of the hotel. The place is a bit of a warren, so finding the breakfast room was tricky, but once found the service was, once again, excellent. 

The hotel is well situated, with a number of bars and restaurants in the surrounding streets. Now that I know where it is I hope to visit again at some point to sample more of its delights.",4,2012,01,23
200,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Enjoyed a relaxing afternoon sipping tea & coffee accompanied by a wonderful selection of sweet & savoury treats. Staff are attentive and we were kept topped up with tea & coffee for three hours. At €36 it may seem expensive, but the portions are generous and we felt well fed. The second course of desserts inspired by the hotel's art collection is exquisite. Highly recommended as a special treat - but remember to book in advance as it is very popular.",5,2012,01,20
200,Merrion - old skool charm,"Dublin's best hotel without question. All the old school charm you'd expect from this type of establishment. Drinks & nibbles in the lounge is a must as is a visit to their Michelin starred restaurant. Make sure you have desert in front of the outside fireplace, very romantic. Just around the corner from the hotel is Baggot St. with one of Dublin's best pubs, Toners.",5,2012,01,19
200,Best Hotel in Dublin I've stayed in,"When staying at such a quality establishment ones expectations are going to be high so I was expecting great things - I was impressed

I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin but this has easily been the best. Arguably the best I have stayed in Ireland too. 

I stayed here as part of a surprise birthday weekend put on by my wife(serious brownie points earned). The service from start to finish was amazing from start to finish without being intrusive. The rooms were very well appointed and the bed big and comfy. 

The hotel had a bottle of champers and a birthday cake surprise in the room when we arrived. We ate in the Cellar restaurant that evening and again it was top notch. The breakfast the next morning was beautiful. 

All in all it does not surprise me that this hotel is No1 on TripAdvisor for Dublin. We will be back.",5,2012,01,19
200,Lovely Tea at the Merrion,"My husband and I took tea with our guide from “City of a Thousand Welcomes” at the Merrion Hotel one rainy evening in October. We were seated in a warm, cozy, beautiful sitting room, in a comfortable area with ornate tables and comfortable over-stuffed sofas and chairs. The Merrion itself is brilliant and historic with lovely décor and paintings throughout. The tea and sandwiches were delicious, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. If you are in Dublin, the Merrion is worth a stop in, even if just for tea.",5,2012,01,17
200,great helpful hotel,this is one of the best hotels in Dublin - the staff are very very helpful and the food is great - try the cellar reatuarant in the evening ! Have stayed here a number of occassions and have always loved it - the spa is also worth a try !,5,2012,01,11
200,Wonderful New Year at the Merrion,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion and truly celebrated the New Year in style. There was a warm welcome at reception, efficient, courteous check in, a free upgrade which was a lovely surprise, champagne and the most heavenly confectionary in our room. We dined in the Cellar Restaurant. The food and service was second to none. Overall, the welcome and care we received at the Merrion was of the highest standard. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. Hospitality at its best.",5,2012,01,10
200,"Amazing service, wonderful hotel","We arrived at about 10am, and were warmly welcomed by the consierge and reception staff. Although our room wasn't quite ready (we were hours before standard check-in time) our bags were taken and we were given a complimentary room upgrade.

The hotel is opposite the government buildings and very close to the National Gallery, Trinity college (home to the book of Kells) and the National Archeology and history Museum so there was plenty to occupy us for a couple of hours.

There are some renovations going on in the hotel and it was quite noisy on Friday afternoon in the room, I called reception to find out what time it would be finishing and we headed off to explore the spa and gym.

After a very relaxing swim in the gorgeous spa area we returned to our room to a complimentary bottle of champagne and the offer to move rooms if we wished. As the work finished at 5pm on Friday and wasn't starting again until 11am Monday we stayed in our room, but the offer was appreciated.

All in all we had a wonderful experience, the hotel is exquisite, the service was faultless and the location is perfect.",5,2012,01,09
200,One of the best in the world.,"Top quality from the minute you arrive at the door,door staff outstanding,nothing is too much trouble...you pay for what you get...you can get hotel rooms for 50-60 euros a night cheaper but they are sadly lacking in service and the style of the merrion.
Aidan Brady",5,2012,01,09
200,Woow,"Excellent, we walked everywhere except one restaurant which was why out in the sticks. Perfect for a weekend away where I popped the question and she said yes.",5,2012,01,09
200,Gorgeous hotel - but a few staffing problems,"Gorgeous room, great hotel, amazing breakfast, fantastic location - but be prepared to pay for it. This hotel is not cheap. 

Our one downside was arriving on New Year's Day for 1 night and the staff at Reception couldn't cope with all the hotel guests and my dad was left waiting for his room for over 3 hours - well past the 3pm deadline. He eventually had to speak to the Duty Manager to push things along. This should not happen in a 5 star hotel. 

Despite that, we have a lovely time in the Merrion, as always. We dined in the Cellar Restaurant and the food was magnificent. But, I'll say it again, the Merrion is very pricey.",5,2012,01,05
200,"Excellent hotel, cellar restaurant not great","We stayed here just before christmas for a weekend.  We really enjoyed our stay and the staff here were excellent particularly the doormen who really made us feel welcome.  The hotel is beautifully appointed and the artwork on display is fabulous.  The gym is not great with limited choice of exercise machines but the pool is really nice and most of all, it's warm which is a big plus.  We had a garden view room.  It was really well appointed and very clean.  The gereral feel of this hotel is 5 star throughout and the location is excellent, close to the shops, pubs and restaurants of the city centre.  
We ate at the bar and in the cellar restaurant.  The cellar restaurant was not really that good and choice was limited.  The sauces for the meals were quite heavy, and when your on a fitness program, butter sauce doesn't really cut it.  Needless to say, I had my meal dry.  Also, additional charges for items other than a full Irish breakfast seemed unreasonable.  Reserved tables were also very annoying as there were empty seats in the bar and reception rooms but nowhere to sit. 
Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2012,01,03
200,"Great, loved the Merrion","I travelled here for business in December 2011. I loved the Merrion. The public rooms were very homely and welcoming and the staff front of house and at the bar were extremely friendly. My room was nicely furnished and the bathroom was great. 

The hotel was only a short walk from some very nice restaurants and it felt like a safe and interesting area of Dublin to stay in.

This is the best hotel I have stayed in in Ireland so far.",5,2012,01,01
200,very nice hotel,"arrived on a fri afternoon and parking was chaotic, nobody came to assist so had to abandon car in traffic which was a bad start to the stay. reception area is quite small so things didnt improve until we checked in.

service in general was hit or miss and not what you would expect for 5 star hotel with long delays for food or drinks.

on the plus side, the drawing rooms are beautiful with art and open fires and comfortable furniture and one of the highlights is to sit in the evening in front of the fire with a cocktail, 
room itself was a good size and had a great bed.
breakfast was decent although get there early as there was queues.

Great location within 5 mins of St Stephens Green
Overall enjoyed stay and would recommend highly although it is expensive",4,2012,01,01
200,"Outstanding, pure luxury, Dublin at its best!","Pure indulgence!

This establishment takes service to a new level. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The hotel is breath taking, clean and welcoming.

From start to finish, the real stars of the whole thing were the fantastically well trained and friendly staff. Management must be very proud of the sunny outlook and professionalism of the Merrion team.

A real must when visiting this hotel is Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud and the ""No 23"" cocktail bar. Excellent food, service and a wonderful atmosphere. All the staff were professional and very helpful.

Breakfast was nothing short of sumptuous and delivered with precision and a certain quality of service that you don't often experience. All the food was beautifully prepared.

I have to thoroughly recommend the Merrion.",5,2011,12,30
200,Excellent location for an overnight stay.,Very enjoyable stay. Excellent location. Great service. Good value for a Friday overnight stay on a pre Christmas trip to the city in December. Only fault we could find was that manual check out process was cumbersome and outdated. Service excellent overall. Would recommend and hope to return again soon. ,4,2011,12,29
200,Excellent Staff,"I stayed in the hotel for four week days in mid-December 2011.

Pros:
Consistently friendly staff - Staff from the breakfast room, fitness area, concierge, and front desk were all very friendly and welcoming. The concierge was able to arrange a tour of Leinster House (where parliament meets) even though tours aren't always available this late in December.
Great breakfast - Lots of variety and of a very high standard.
Nice pool/fitness area - Indoor pool and steam room provide a relaxing respite from the wind, cold and rain of a Dublin winter.
Great art collection with a catalog of the major pieces in the hotel room.
Location -  Across from the government buildings and close to the National Gallery and Trinity College; the location enables the hotel to be much more quiet than most city center hotels, as it is probably a seven minute walk from the shopping of Grafton Street.

Cons:
No major issues; I found it a bit annoying that there wasn't an electrical plug in the bathroom and had to blow dry my hair in the bedroom. I also was surprised that the room didn't include tea-making facilities unless requested; I imagine this is to save space as the rooms aren't large, but I found that a bit strange for a five-star hotel.",5,2011,12,28
200,TOP !,"The Merrion Hotel is very well located, in the city center, 10 mn walk from shopping streets, 30 seconds from the Odonoghue pub, most famous in town. The Merrion is in nice old building, with very professional and smiling staff :-) It holds the biggest private collection of paintings in the country I think. We had very nice, big and conformable rooms (a suite and a room). We enjoyed the large swimming pool with warm water (excellent in november). We went two times to the hotel’s restaurant (the Cellar) where we, among others, had the best fish and ships ever !.",5,2011,12,12
200,Consistent Quality,"Started to use this hotel after many years of staying at the Shelbourne hotel. This hotel has better service, and better value for money in my opinion. To date no problems. ",5,2011,12,08
200,Highlight of Our Trip,"Fantastic hotel, incredible service, wonderful hospitality. The turf (peat) logs used for the fireplaces created a warm feeling that will always remind us of our time at the Merrion. Every step of the way they went out of our way to make sure that we were taken care of and had everything that we needed. The art tea was a wonderful experience and tea every evening in the drawing rooms was a wonderful experience. Food and drink at the hotel restaurants were equally wonderful. It was the end of our 2 week trip to the UK and we arrived early at 11am. They were able to get us into a room immediately and did everything they could to make sure that we were comfortable. I'd go back to Dublin just for the hotel, excellent.",5,2011,12,06
200,"Quite lovely public rooms, nice regular rooms",This hotel is close to everything in old-town Dublin and has very nice customer service. Sleeping rooms are good and have free wireless which is nice in a hotel of this type (compared to other properties in Europe where wireless charges can be 20Euros+ per day). Staff very friendly and helpful. Really delicious food from room service and in hotel restaurants (the quality of the room service was a surprise for me). Meeting rooms have the unique feature of being restored 1800s rooms with amazing architectural details. Nice property overall.,5,2011,12,03
200,Lovely weekend,"Spent the weekend (3nts) here with the wife and baby. This hotel may not have rooms as well appointed as the Westbury imo, but the feel of the place is more homely. It is focused on making you feel welcome and at home with touches like people remembering your name as you make your way around to the nice drawing room area. Cute touch with tiny dressing gown for the baby too.
Ate twice in the cellar and both times it was well worth it. Excellent staff there too. We also tried Hugo's around the corner for early meal and it was great value.
One minor point relates to equity. I had read in a previous review that the person got the car back from the hotel car park freshly valeted. As a result I was looking forward to seeing a polished car rolling up. Not so. Left me slightly dissapointed, perhaps unfairly. Had the wifes car as mine was being serviced. Guess a 3 series in not at the level to deserve a valet.
Anyway, I would highly recommed this hotel for the service and Irish style welcome that is sorely missed in other establishments in the country.",5,2011,11,28
200,Excellent Staff!! Great Deal!!,"Stayed on Friday 25th November 2011 for one night. The staff really made the experience to be honest, we arrived by car, when we pulled up outside the door man arranged for the car to be parked, we just walked away and left it with him. We were checked in quickly, and then the girl who checked us in walked us to our room. The room to be utterly honest was ""alright"". We have definitely stayed in nicer rooms, but, everything was spotless and shiny. The decor is a little dated and very much ""olde worlde!, but, as I've said already, clean.
The bar is certainly on the pricey side so I would recommend having your tipple in one of the many bars within a two minute walk.
The cliontelle are of a certain age also, but on the plus side there are definitely no lager louts or  stag parties.
We did get a great deal, we got one night, plus, a bottle of Presecco on arrival in our room, plus, Breakfast, plus Parking, all for €220.
SUMMARY:
It is a nice well maintained old world Hotel, five minute walk from Grafton Street, opposite Govt. Buildings in Dublin. The rooms, even if old fashioned, are clean.The staff are excellent.
I would recommend this Hotel however, ring up and ""GET A DEAL!!!!!!!""",4,2011,11,28
200,High Class,"Stayed at this hotel during december. The weather was the coldest in ages, but the Merrion kept its warm and cosy atmosphere. The staff are very welcoming, and not being used to VIP treatment it sometimes became owerwhelming. Rooms have everything you need, and more so. Breakfast was not included in our room, and is quite pricey. You can have breakfast in your room, and the menu looks very tempting. 

The hotel is located 10 minutes walk from the busiest shopping area, and there is a taxi-stop in front of the hotel. Around the hotels you find a lot of galleries and museums, and also one of Irelands best restaurants.",5,2011,11,22
200,"Enjoyable stay, but not 5-star...","The location is great, the afternoon tea delightful, the staff pleasant enough and the facilities good.
No major complaints, I'd consider staying here again.

That said, the little things and attention to detail that, in my mind, separate a 'good' hotel from a 5-star, were lacking.   Specifically, the morning paper we requested was not delivered and the concierge was not particularly knowledgeable about the area  (zero suggestions for a late night, post-theatre bite).   The maid was late in tidying (cleaning the room at 4pm; we vacated the room at 9am) and then gave me a bit of a hard time about leaving when I asked that she please come back and finish later (I needed to change for a tea reservation).

Again, I certainly wouldn't say it was a horrific experience by any stretch (indeed I'd consider returning), but for the rating/expense, I was a little disappointed.",4,2011,11,21
200,Great location.,I really appreciate the valet parking here. Location is perfect with great bars and resterants nearby. They could do with updating the tvs in the rooms. ,5,2011,11,20
200,Absolute first class,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is a beauiful, meticulously run, and friendly hotel in a country where good will and warmth cannot be understated.",5,2011,11,18
200,Great hotel in a good location,"I really enjoyed the Merrion I stayed here for a week on a combination of business and pleasure.  The staff were superb and really helpful.  The hotel itself was initially somewhat baffling as I wasn't sure how I felt about it -the layout was a bit strange- but once I got settled its charm won me over!
The rooms were huge as were the bathrooms and they had everything you could wish for from slippers and bathrobes to shoe shine and sewing kits.  Staff came in to turn down the bed at night and I was initially bemused by their 'tidying!!' which consisted of rearranging everything into size order and lining bottles up but on the upside it encouraged me to be more tidy and everything was easy to find!
Food was wonderful unbelievable quality and a willingness to tailor foods to customer tastes.
Location is brilliant just a short stroll to St Stephens green and around a 15min walk to O'Connell Street.
Whilst staying a number of celebrities who were appearing on Irish TV where also there which was a lovely novelty!!
Overall a wonderful treat and definitely my preferred choice of location for staying in Dublin.",5,2011,11,17
200,The only Dublin option,"Like many Americans, I dream of the quintessentially intimate, yet elegant, European hotel.  Where history and tradition are honored, but modern amenities and lifestyles are not overlooked.  In Dublin, that hotel is The Merrion.  From the architecture to the service to the location, The Merrion exceeds expectations.  After first visiting several years ago, we recently returned for a four-day stay.  And even during the frenetic atmosphere of the Dublin Marathon (which starts/ends right at Merrion Square), the hotel and the staff remained unflappable.  I've also stayed at the Conrad (could be anywhere) and the Shelbourne (too lively).  They're great hotels, but they're not The Merrion.  To me, it's the best hotel experience in Dublin.",5,2011,11,14
200,Wonderful stay - incredible staff,"This was the first time we have stayed at the Merrion - which truly knocked our socks off. The rooms are great, the lovely relaxing salons super - but what truly sets the hotel apart is the service, which was superb from start to finish. Friendly, professional, confident - your staff are truly a credit to you. Both of us travel very often and I can't say we have had a similar service elsewhere - none of this obseqious, grovelling stuff that 5 star hotels sometimes seem to think is wanted. This felt simply like being spoiled by some really lovely staff who clearly enjoyed interacting with guests. Top marks (as I have spent the rest of the weekend telling friends I was home to visit!)",5,2011,11,14
200,very relaxing,"Stayed here for a night on their Five Star Steal deal - 250 euro for dinner in Cellar restaurant, champagne and brekkie. After wine, carparking and drinks had little change out of 350, which is a lot of dosh in these recessionary times.
We had a lovely stay. The welcome was especially good. The room was lovely, if somewhat small and very warm. Opening a window took care of this. The present of cupcakes for hubby's birthday was a nice touch. I liked this hotel. Classy, comfortable and it's especially cosy in front of the open fires. Lovely bed, great bath and body products and complimentary water.
 A few wee grips. Waited nearly 20 minutes to get served in restaurant. Couple who walked in directly after us were on their starter by the time anyone asked what wine we would like or what food we had chosen! Also while the food in the Cellar restaurant is yummy and great value at 29.95 for three courses, felt there was too little choice of starters.
 I liked this hotel, but to tell the truth found the whole experience a bit underwhelming for the money involved.
I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it because our favourite hotel ever is Hayfield Manor in Cork and few hotels match up.
The Merrion a bit too pricey even for a top notch five star - a cup of coffee was Euro6.50 - madness in this day and age. Also we had to pay Euro20 for car parking which is an extra cost on top of your stay.
The staff at the Merrion are its real asset. They are friendly, without being overbearing and incredibly helpful. The location is brill with a great selection of nearby restaurants and pubs.
It was a nice experience overall, but think will stick with Hayfield in the future. It's better bang for your buck.",4,2011,11,12
200,Mostly great - but WIFI for a 5-star hotel is shocking...,"The rooms, service, location and feel of this hotel have earned The Merrion Hotel a hard earned and well deserved top spot amongst its peers. But what's this? In for a meeting to discover that the hotel has no automatic WIFI. It's connected to Bitbuzz, where you have to go through an annoying registration process to log in - even for members (and I'm one of them); the code is available at reception (queue) but what's worse is the connection only lasts with continuous use, so you're re-registering time and time again. GUYS - THIS IS A FIVE STAR HOTEL. You've GOT to do better than this: it's 2012!",3,2011,11,12
200,Amazing!!!,"This really is an incredible hotel.  Upon arrival, I was a little concerned that it would be somewhat stuffy given the elegance and the clientele, but we were received very warmly by the staff and immediately felt very comfortable.  The rooms are true luxury, and the hotel amenities are incredible.  Staff are top-notch, very friendly and very helpful.  Location was amazing as well -- we were able to walk everywhere and really got a great perspective on the city from where we were based.  I would also highly recommend the bar, for either an aperitif or a night-cap.  I will definitely look forward to returning next time in Dublin.",5,2011,11,05
200,Extra charges for breakfast marred our stay!,"This was our second stay in the Merrion for myself and my husband.  When staying in Dublin with our 3 children, we usally stay at the Four Seasons, but after a fantastic visit to the Merrion last year, we decided to stay here instead.

The hotel is a beautiful, elegant townhouse.  The drawing rooms with their open fires are gorgeous.  The worn look to the furniture all adds to the ambience of the hotel.  

We had interconnecting rooms booked which were spacious and clean.  The beds were very comfortable.  We used the spa quite alot during our stay.  The ladies changing rooms on our first day down were very grubby.  There were dirty tissues on the floor and alot of dirty towels lying about.  There was no water or orange juice left in the jugs, and on leaving an hour later, they still had not been replenished.  The pool however was a lovely pool to swim in.  Just the right temperature and depth.

Our biggest gripe with our stay was the extra charges for breakfast on our bill on check out.  We had been charged an extra 30euro per day for breakfast even though we were on a B&B rate. We all had pancakes for breakfast instead of the fully cooked breakfast, which we are just not into.  The pancakes are priced on the breakfast menu at 16 euro and the fully cooked breakfast is priced at 29.95euro.  Because we did not have the fully cooked breakfast we were charged a supplement of 6 euro per person.  I just do not get the logic of this!  It states on the menu that if you order pancakes IN ADDITION to the fully cooked breakfast that you will incur a charge of 6 euro.  I explained this to the receptionist on checkout that the pancakes were the only thing we all had, but she said our package only included the Irish fry and we couldn't have anything else without incurring a supplement.  

I have never come accross this in any other hotel and will definitely not stay here again!  I think it is a cheap way of getting extra charges from you!!  If this is the hotels policy, you should be informed on checkin.",4,2011,11,05
200,enjoyable,"Only stayed for a couple of days so I could not visit everything in the hotel and surounding area. However overall I had a comftable stay and a good night sleep. One of the better hotels I have stayed in, in dublin.",5,2011,11,03
200,What a Welcome!,"What a special way to celebrate our anniversary.  In September we began our Irish vacation at the Merrion Hotel.  It was early in the morning and even though our room was not ready they made every effort to make us comfortable.  We decided to have breakfast in the restuarant.  After a pot of tea and some delicious scones we spent the rest of the morning relaxing by the fire and reading the newspaper.  From the cozy fire to the smell of lavender in the garden, everything was perfect.  The bed in our room was very comfortable and the shower was huge.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2011,11,03
200,Quiet Comfort,"Indeed, all the staff members are helpful and friendly.  What we especially enjoyed, however, was not hearing any noise outside our room.   In addition, the room-darkening drapes and extremely comfortable bed were appreciated.  The easy access free WiFi was also nice as well as the Business Center for printing our boarding passes.  Overall, an above-average hotel near all main attractions.",5,2011,11,01
200,Old world charm in the heart of Dublin...,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion for just one night in October, 2011 BUT the service from the minute we arrived via taxi to the minute we departed to the airport, was top notch! The hotel is so elegant...very understated from the outside but very well appointed wiht so much history! We were shown to our room after checking in and our bags arrived shortly after. The room was lovely overlooking the courtyard! The bathroom was enormous with marble tile and wonderful bath products. The entire feel of the room was so comfortable with so many extra touches. The conceirge suggested a casual spot for lunch nearby which was perfect...Foley's. We had time to stroll down Grafton Street and relax a bit at The Merrion before opting to have dinner in the Drawing Room which was perfect. Great ambiance and wonderful service! The wine was excellent! We can't wait to return to the Merrion for a longer stay. Everything about the feel of this hotel is right up my alley, not to mention it's 5 star!",5,2011,11,01
200,Luxury with Irish character,"After staying in several top notch hotels in Dublin, my husband and I have concluded that the epitome of quiet elegance and Irish hospitality is most certainly on display at the Merrion.  The staff is impeccably professional, but not stuffy.  They are extremely congenial and attentive to all their guests needs.  The public rooms have a gently worn but comfortable feel, right down to the peat fires that are almost always burning.  The guest bedrooms are well appointed and squeaky clean, and the bathrooms are first rate.  The hotel is quieter than some of their competitors, but after a day in the city, a little quiet is a good thing.  The location is fabulous, within walking distance of all the major sites, pubs and restaurants.  Speaking of restaurants, the Cellar pub and restaurant downstairs in the hotel is great.  Our favorite place in all of Dublin for fish and chips.  Absolutely the best!!  And the wine list is also lovely. Really, there is not a bad thing to say about this hotel.  It is positively lovely.  We have already booked for another trip next May.",5,2011,10,31
200,Ridiculously Good,"The most fabulous service I've had at a hotel. A lovely room overlooking the courtyard, professional staff, great food in the restaurant and on coming back after a very long day on a business trip.. Wow! In my room, the bed had been turned down with the remote control, water, menu & slippers all ready on the bed for me. 

Gloriously comfy and impeccable service at all times. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here.",5,2011,10,31
200,Exceptional capital city hotel superbly merging past and present,"Very warm welcoming reception adjacent to historic Georgian 18th century drawing rooms is a superb introduction to hotel merging 18th century decor and furnishings with 21st century style and  hospitality.
Proximity to Stephens Green, Grafton Street and lively environs make it an ideal location for short or long  city break / vacation.
Cellar restaurant breakfast relaxing and appetizing. Added bonus is exceptional Art collection ( Roderic O Connor, Paul Henry and John Lavery to name but a selection ) unintrusively  blending into the intriguing furnishings. Fascinating hotel, unpretentious yet intriguing combination of style and charm",5,2011,10,31
200,Great Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion in September for two nights. We did the ""sterling package"" which proved to be good value. The lady who handled our booking couldn't have been more helpful.

 This was our third visit which I felt should have been aknowledged.This time we stayed in a suite in the old part of the house rathar than a standard room. The room was spacious and looked over the Irish parliment buildings which was lovely. The bed was the biggest we have ever slept in (including 5 star hotels in America) and very comfortable. But the suite of furniture was tired and not in a shabby chic way. The antique furniture was beautiful but the slighly worn carpets let the room down a little. 
The service was as always impecible. We had breakfast delivered to our for a fee of 5 Euro which was very resonable we felt. We didn't eat at the cellar as we had done on a previous visit. From memory it was an enjoyable meal. We did however eat breakfast there on the second  morning (full Irish) and I felt that it was overcooked but my husband was happy with his.
The door man at the hotel is particularly helpful and informative.
The location of the Merrion couldn't be more perfect. I know Dublin well but if I were visiting for the first time I would definitely stay here.

Finally when we checked out there was a 20 Euro charge added to our bill that we couldn't explain. When we asked what it was for the manager just removed it without question. However a week later we got an e-mail saying we had been undercharged and they had debited our credit card. It seemed they wanted to charge us for a CD that we had not had but had listened to becuase  it was in the cd player. The situation was eventually  resolved but it was a hassle.",4,2011,10,31
200,Casual and Attentive,"The Merrion is a lovely old-period hotel, with friendly staff and a casual environment.  It’s easy to feel at home at the Merrion, with its wood burning fireplaces, tea service and comfortable seating in the many intimate public areas.  The rooms are well appointed, but not stuffy and far from formal.  The Cellar restaurant is beautiful and you’ll be taken care of by the small army of friendly and attentive wait staff.",5,2011,10,29
200,The Hype v The Reality,"I've lived in Dublin for over a decade now and this hotel, the preferred choice of the likes of Bruce Springsteen and the uber rich (Noel Gallagher checked in behind us...or should I say was ushered straight to his room by waiting staff). We stayed here as my other half was working in town and part of his package included a room in the hotel, so we thought, why not. 

The hotel has a rather understated elegance inside - your bag is immediately taken off you by porters when you arrive and you are shown to the interior reception area. 

We were shown to our room by a member of their greeting team and our bags arrived a few minutes later. 

The room we stayed on, one the second floor overlooking the back street wasn't as plush as I'd expected. It was very old school, a comfortable bed, modest TV, big bathroom but none of the swagger I expected from a hotel of this reputation.

There was a small mini-bar - very well stocked with Champagne, red wine, various chocolates and nibbly treats ranging from €1.50 in price (Cadbury's Fruit & Nut) to €75 for a half bottle of Champagne.

The room service menu is also vast - and rather pricey - including caviar and vintage champagne.  

Breakfast was included in our package - at a very reasonable room service delivery charge of €5.00.

Their spa came highly recommended but we didn’t have time to visit on this trip. 

Also - looking at their prices I was very surprised to see how reasonable the room rates were. 

PROS
Very elegant reception and parlour. 
24 hour bar for residents and a 24 hour restaurant - service in the parlour.
24 hour room service. 
Robes & comfy slippers. 
Very comfortable beds. 

CONS
The street noise - you have to accept when you're staying in the City Centre that there's going to be a certain level of noise and while the windows appeared to be double glazed we needed to open them as the air conditioning was *extremely* loud and totally dried out the room.   Finally at 4am we had to close the window and turn the air conditioning back on as there were people shouting into he back alley at 4am - we woke up the next morning after a fitful night completely dehydrated and feeling like we'd been on the tear the night before. 

The hotel appears to have interior rooms facing the courtyard and I'd definitely recommend asking for one of these to get away from the noise. 
While room service delivery was cheap - everything on the menu is vastly expensive.

I'd certainly recommend the hotel but note the following - ask for an interior room and eat somewhere else.",4,2011,10,26
200,Understated Elegance,"We have stayed at the Merrion three or four times in the past few years.  We have returned to wonderful welcomes, even by our names!  We expect to return shortly and have always asked for the 3 for 2 deal for six nights for a room on the garden side on the first floor with a King size bed.  We have been there for  Easter as well as Christmas .  Christmas shopping is only a stones throw away.  The help is very attentive but not intrusive. We tend not to eat breakfast there but do go to the Cellar Bar as well as the restaurant.  It is truly a # 1 place to 
stay.",5,2011,10,15
200,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. We had lunch and breakfast there and the food was excellent.Our room was comfortable, and the bed wow! best nights sleep ever!

 However the Merrion's greatest asset is it's staff, polite, proffessional and friendly. Cant wait to visit again.",5,2011,10,13
200,Superb Hotel,"Great hotel in a very good location. Fast check-in. The bedrooms are very comfortable, large bed and very quiet for a good night's sleep. Room has all the amenities you could ask for including complimentary water, bathrobe and slippers. The bathroom is very clean with both bath and shower facilities. There is a fantastic restaurant for an evening meal and the breakfast choices are varied. The cooked breakfast is fantastic. The Cellar bar has a very good wine list in very relaxing and warm surroundings.",5,2011,10,10
200,Comfort Plus,"We stayed at this great hotel to start our trip to Ireland.  What a great choice.  It's a great location just a few short block to Grafton Street where most of the action is.  The hotel is elegant.  The lobby/drawing room is filled with comfortable couches and chairs.  The fireplace is always burning creating a nice smell/atmosphere throughout the area.  High tea is served in this area.  The staff is VERY helpful and accommodates all your wishes.  We stayed in room 101.  This room was very large with desk and two armchairs.  All amenities are first class.  The towels, bathrobes and slippers create a nice touch.  The turn down service is also nice at night.  I will definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin.  The have parking facilities for your car.  .",5,2011,10,04
200,Attentive staff with a cozy relaxing atmosphere,"Fabulous hotel. I was brought here as a surprise for my 30th birthday. Wonderful place to stay, huge room and bathroom with a lovely deep bath. We ate in the cellar restaurant which was delicious. The staff are excellent and attend to your every need. Excellent facilities with a fast wifi connection. All in all a 5 star experience ",5,2011,09,19
200,Lovely night away in the Merrion,"We spent last Saturday night in The Merrion and have to say it was just what we needed. We live in Dublin,so when my sister said she would take our three children (oldest is 5) for the weekend we decided not to spend the time travelling and just to enjoy our own city. Rather than spend two nights in an average hotel we decided to splash out and spend one night in luxury so where better than The Merrion. I have eaten there before and had drinks in the bar so was familiar with aspects of it.
We were allowed leave our car there early so got there by  11am and left our car and bag. We then wandered down to Grafton St and browsed the shops,had lunch,went for a drink(Can't remember the last time I had a glass of wine in the afternoon so that in itself was  a treat!). We gort back to the hotel late afternoon and checked into our room. We had booked the champagne one night getaway so there was a bottle of champagne in our room . Lovely big bathroom and big comfy bed. We ate out that night in a restaurant around the corner on Merrion Row called Il Segretto which I recommend. It was really busy so thats always a good sign.
We were tired then so went back to hotel for a nightcap before having a great nights sleep with no children to worry about.
Next morning the paper was hanging on our door so we read that before heading down to breakfast. Had a final wander around town and then back to collect car and go get kids-back to reality. 
There are of course cheaper hotels but really recommend it for a treat,especially with such a good location.",5,2011,09,17
200,Excellent a luxury experience,"The room, the hotel and the staff were 5 stars.  The concierge service was extremely helpful at sourcing the most difficult restaurant reservations as well as being able to tailor a very special experience in Dublin.  The front desk staff was very kind and extremely professional. The Merrion is a true luxury hotel.  One of the best I have stayed in Europe.",5,2011,09,17
200,Dublin's most luxurious and high end hotel,"Irish couple, early 30's

We stay in this hotel frequently. Beautiful interior. Very luxurious. Very sophisticated and not in your face. Great staff, rooms and spa. 
Great location centre of Dublin 
Magnificent michelin restaurant Patrick Guibauds attached.
Highly reccommend. Best hotel in Dublin ",5,2011,09,17
200,The Merrion. Standard of a 5 star,"From arrival to departure you seem to be the only guest they have to look after. A request is not met with a yes, but rather:""it's the least we can do for you"". Bright room with vaulted celing and so comfortable. The bar, the business center and all the staff all surpass your expectations. Location is second to none and sleep quality is excellent. Defines the standard for a 5 star hotel. Thank you for the hospitality Merrion.",5,2011,09,14
200,"Luxurious hotel, perfect location","What an beautiful hotel. We stayed on the first floor in a huge room with a gorgeous en suite. The robes make you feel like you are in a palace, the beds are worth never leaving the room for! We stayed in the hotel for one night, and got to enjoy the local attractions of food, shopping and museums all around. 
the hotel itself is behind the Dail, which is where the Irish government gather and make all the big decisions are made. They used to stop off for lunch and drinks here, before the recession it appears. Whilst staying here, i passed by a familiar City face.. Sarah Jessica Parker. She appears to stay here upon landing into Ireland before heading on to her irish holiday home. And what better way to start any holiday, a friendly old style porter, welcoming reception, and just steeped in history and luxury.
A big treat for anyone!",5,2011,09,12
200,Perfectly Situated Oasis in Dublin,"This a is a great hotel.  It is similar in a lot of ways to the Hotel de Russie in Rome but Irish.  The rooms in this hotel are large, well appointed and quiet.  No problem with connecting rooms for travel with children.  Lovely little garden in the back with beautiful tea room, good dining and workable health club.  Concierge is excellent and got us concert and sporting tickets at reasonable prices.  Loved it and would go back again.",5,2011,09,12
200,excellent but food a bit pricey,"This is the no1 hotel in dublin by a long shot, we stayed for 3 nights and it is a lovely treat, we found afternoon snacks a bit ott on price but the breakfast is just fantastic other than snack prices this no1 and we have stayed in most of the top 10 so we shoud know.",5,2011,09,12
200,Faultless and delightful,"The Merrion is a delight, from first reservation until checking out the Merrion team just do everything right.  It helps of course that it is beautiful - a collection of spectacular Georgian houses with high ceilings, big windows, elegant proportions and a sense of space.  It also helps that it is furnished with pieces that are not only elegant but also comfortable - hooray for feather cushions - and there are really good and interesting paintings on the walls; some modern some not but all good and interesting and in keeping.  And all this is true not just in the public areas but in the bedrooms too - although I'm sure that it helped that we were given a room upgrade when we arrived and enjoyed a room that was truly magnificent with a palatial bathroom and fabulous Asprey toiletries.  All of this is important but the effect would be spoiled if the staff were not just as impressive - smart, accomplished, friendly, with personalities but not intrusive or familiar; truly charming and we were truly charmed.  The delights don't end there because there was a fine spa and a pool comfortable warm and big enough to do decent laps and outside was a really delightful garden - places to wander, places to sit, nice sculptures, good planting - you could not ask for anything more.  Add to all that that it is located close to St Stephen's Green and just opposite the parliament building and you have a hotel that really does get everything right.",5,2011,09,11
200,"Expensive, but the best hotel in Dublin. By far.","You get what you pay for, and the Merrion delivers. Not cheap, but a superb hotel in the center of Dublin. Great staff, great Cellar restaurant and bar, and a great location. Five stars from a hotel snob. ",5,2011,09,09
200,a five star all round performance,All you would expect from a five star hotel and the location was impressive and close to the main shopping and entertaiment areas. The staff were exceptionally attentive and friendly from the moment you arrive until check out.Expensive but get what you pay for!,5,2011,09,05
200,Fantastic service and great value for money,"We were so impressed by the Merrion, especially considering what we paid and comparing to other recent hotels. From the moment we arrived staff helped us out of the taxi and by the time we turned around our bags were already inside. They instantly addressed us by name and knew the details of our booking. Check in was speedy and hassle free. We were then directed to our room and given an introduction to the facilities while concierge brought up our bags. 
The room was spacious with all the amenities we could need, including umbrellas, marble bathroom with fluffy towels, a huge and comfortable bed with extra long pillows to properly fit the bed, complimentary newspaper, and more. The decor was classy and luxurious and we liked the atmosphere of both the room and the common areas.
We did find the restaurant a bit too pricey which meant we didn't get to experience the meals and spend more time here, we would have loved to try the breakfast or high tea in front of the open fire place.
The cleaning staff were also a little too thorough for our liking. They rearranged clothes in my case and moved others to the cupboard as well as rearranging toiletries unnecessarily. This may be a positive thing for other guests but I found it quite invasive, however once I mentioned it to reception staff it was no longer an issue. 
Checkout was quick and easy, when I queried the cost of a local phone call they even waved this charge from my bill. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Merrion as well as Dublin itself. We would definitely recommend this hotel and are looking forward to returning one day.",5,2011,09,05
200,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here for a long weekend at the same time as the French Rugby team ! I can't express how great the hotel and staff were . We were only there for three nights but a great hotel and very central to all the places we were looking to visit ! We will definitely be back soon !,5,2011,09,02
200,Excellent - home away from home,"The Merrion Hotel can rightly claim to be a luxury, five star hotel. It located very centrally in Dublin and offers a wide range of high-quality services, as you would expect. But what really makes the difference is the staff and the level of service they provide - truely exceptional. It is hard to find its equal elsewhere, in Dublin or beyond.",5,2011,09,01
200,Above and Beyond,"I returned today from a marvelous stay at the elegant, inviting, charming Merrion Hotel. Many previous reviewers have extolled its virtues, and I couldn't agree more. It is unusual for a five star hotel to be both stunning and cozy, and yet The Merrion achieves the perfect balance. From roaring fires to gleaming teapots to delicious breakfast buffet, everything is presented with care and excellence.
Having to scramble for a flight home back to New York, due to hurricane Irene, I was concerned about room availability. The reception desk was most obliging, immediately letting me know that my stay would be extended. Furthermore, when I mentioned that I had not brought enough prescription medication for the unexpected additional days, I was told not to worry, and indeed, my needed  pills arrived the next morning. The Guest Relations Manager consistently went above and beyond for me, which was so appreciated.
What has struck me most, is the genuine kindness of the staff of the Merrion. 
This beautiful, historic hotel is a treat on every level.
If you have the opportunity to stay here, you will be delighted.",5,2011,08,30
200,Very lovely hotel... would like to return...,"Stayed at hotel on 29th August 2011.  My flight was early so was very pleased to have an early check in.  I was a bit surprised that the room was so small and basic, given what they charge but I guess the bathroom made up for it, it was fab.  The bathroom had a bath and shower and was made from beautiful marble.  

The hotel really attend to every detail and this was fabulous.  I would definitely return to this hotel and ask again for an upgrade.  Unfortunately the room I had was next to a Guiness store room and when I had a nap during the day the guinness chaps arrived to roll out about 200 barrels which did not impress me one bit.  After about 20 mins of sleep I wok up by a maid who kept slamming the next door - when I went out to see what was happening there was an american woman giving her a right telling off.  Yes I guess it was a bit much as people do need to relax but apart from that you cannot fault the Merrion.  The breakfast both in dining room and room service was just excellent.  The staff were superb.  I wish them every good luck.  See you all soon.   Stella X",5,2011,08,30
200,It's discreet and understated nothing is too much trouble and all the staff say hello when you see them,We have been here several times over the years and the standard never varies.It's a class act in all areas.,5,2011,08,29
200,Outstanding in Every Way,"We stayed at The Merrion for four nights in early August 2011 and I can see why it is #1 on Tripadvisor.  Everything about the hotel was first class, from the decor, the rooms, the service, the food and the location. We could not recommend it highly enough.",5,2011,08,28
200,Our favorite in Ireland!,"We stayed at The Merrion while traveling with another couple through Ireland and it was our favorite.  Not only was the hotel elegant and spacious but the service was top notch.  If we ever make it back to Dublin, The Merrion is where we will stay!",5,2011,08,26
200,Excellence,"Excellence in every detail.  They did go out of their way to provide the best service possible.  Great food choices and room service.  Afternoon tea is a must.  Rooms are clean and comfortable, impecable laundry and dry cleaning service.  Beautiful indoor pool and great spa.  I recommend it 100%.  Everyone at every post is most friendly and willing to provide a hospitable ambiance.",5,2011,08,26
200,Lovely hotel,Second visit in 3 years - only one night - upgraded to a suite so no complaints there.  The room(s) were so nice that we decided to stay in for the afternoon and save our walking round Dublin for the evening and the next day.  Lounges are very comfortable.  Service is great - quick and intelligent.,5,2011,08,25
200,Excellent hotel in heart of Dublin,"From the welcome to our departure, the staff, service, food and personal attention were truly super! And a terrific pool and changing rooms rounded out our very pleasant stay. Not to be missed when coming to Dublin.",5,2011,08,25
200,Fantastic with our young son!,"This hotel was lovely, but the best part for us was how welcoming they were of our 16-month-old son.  They provided a very comfortable crib in the room, baby toiletries, and they even had a tiny dressing gown for him to wear!  We also ate in their Cellar restaurant.  The food was excellent, and they had the most extensive children's menu I have ever seen!  It was the first time we've been able to take the baby out to a nice restaurant without some kind of scene.  Highly recommended.",5,2011,08,25
200,A superb oasis near the centre of Dublin,"Everything about the hotel, from the concierge, to check-in, to the room, exceeded expectations. Staff in the bar, drawing rooms and restaurants very efficient and friendly. Room was beautifully appointed and generous in size. Amenities excellent.",5,2011,08,24
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"I have stayed in other 5 star hotels in Dublin and have left feeling disappointed and ripped off, but the Merrion has always been fantastic. The rooms are worth the money and the service is first class.  The hotel is beautiful, classy, cosy, in a great location and the breafast is fantastic!",5,2011,08,23
200,Blissful retreat in a buzzing city,"We stayed here for a long weekend and Dublin was as usual busy and lively.  The Merrion is close to the centre but just off the main roads so provides a quiet and relaxing base.  The staff were friendly and helpful, but never intrusive; the peat fire in the lounge added to the  welcoming atmosphere.  Our room was comfortable and well-equipped, and looked out over the gardens.  We sampled two bars and the restaurant, and enjoyed them all.  There was a slight glitch with one dish at dinner but it was resolved immediately and efficiently, so did not spoil the experience.  The day we returned home my husband had to work, so I ate breakfast in the lounge, enjoying pastries and good coffee in front of a fire with a book - a delightful way to start the day!  The hotel is not cheap but a great deal of work goes into running it smoothly and its guests are able to enjoy the results.",5,2011,08,22
200,"Almost great, but.....","Ok we stayed here for 3 nights after touring the South of Ireland and let me say first that i am pickey so what i am complaining about might not bother others..
All of the staff did a great job and were very helpfull and friendly, they really tried to make you happy. The location is exellent as has been said by other reviewers. The room was clean and well appointed but...
we always request  the best rooms, don't complain about price and expect to be shown to that type room upon arrival, not to a lesser room and then let the shuffle begin! Well that is what happened here. First we were shown to a room on the first floor with the story that these rooms were the best because of the high ceilings! Well that was not going to work as the room looked out on to the roof tops of adjoining buildings. Ok if you got a room thru bargainrooms.com, but not when you are paying full price and requesting the best. Then we were moved to a second floor room that looked into the courtyard gardens and this is where we stayed. Did not want to continue the shuffle but i am sure that rooms on the front ot the building looking toward the street were better!
The lobby/drawing room and bar areas are quite nice and cozy.
We ate breakfast in the cellar restauant and it was nothing special but we did eat dinner in the French Restaurant and it was one of the best...see seperate review.
So...we would probably stay here again if visiting Dublin but would confirm the room in advance.",4,2011,08,21
200,First class hotel and food,Excecellent hotel - staff really nice and food great in all restaurants. Stayed with 2 teenage children who enjoyed the city and the experience. Spa good.,4,2011,08,21
200,Superb service; limited view,"The Merrion provided the best service of any hotel we ever visited.  They memorize your name upon entry and go out of their way to make your experience positive.  We dined in the Cellar restaurant when an electrical storm cut off power to the neighborhood, and they could not have been more gracious and accommodating during the wait for the emergency power to kick in.  We did however get a very good price on our weekend stay online, and as a result our 'garden' room had a 'view 'over an alley with garbage cans.  It was very quiet until Monday morning when the garbage trucks arrived.  The room itself was beautiful and there were many amenities.  This hotel is in an ideal location in the city of Dublin.",4,2011,08,19
200,Worth the money,"What can I say?  A beautiful hotel with perfect staff and a thick cloud of elegance in every room.  The art in the public rooms alone is quite stunning.  check out the restaurant next door.  None of it is cheap of course but it's not supposed to be.  Utterly lovely, I loved every minute of staying here.  I'm fussy about service and this place had it down pat.  My partner thought the rooms a little tired but I didn't.  I could get used to this kind of place.",5,2011,08,17
200,A one night stop ..,"In Dublin for a concert and wanted a little bit of luxury to lay our heads which we found in The Merrion. An understated entrance into a lovely hotel, nice comfortable lounges and outside space. We had a good size room with a litle balcony looking out over the gardens. When we got back to the hotel very late after our evening singing, we had just the best ever club sandwiches which were on the Special After Concert menu, a great touch. In the morning we made use of the pool which was empty so no complaints at all. Would certainly stay here again, centrally located, good service and nice ambiance.",5,2011,08,13
200,"Merrion Hotel - Gracious, Lovely - Look No further - Stay Here","The Merrion Hotel is as lovely as the most gracious Guest Home, with an excellent central location, and an attention to service and detail that is spectacular.  From the front desk, to the lounge and bar, and doorman, a wonderful team, and a great place to stay. 

A great stroll to all the sites as a vacationer,  great restaurants, and fun pubs also just a short hop, as well as the parks , and national museums and galleries etc.  

Spa location had a nice pool, which provided a nice bonus benefit for children.",5,2011,08,13
200,Is this the best hotel in Ireland?,There is no point trying to find fault with this delightful hotel: the friendly and helpful staff make this a special place to stay. Plenty of character in the ground floor drawing rooms and the Cellar bar where the food is just as good as the Cellar Restaurant. The inner courtyard is a quiet haven of pleasantly landscaped gardens and weather permitting a great place for a drink. One lasting memory: the quality of sleep thanks to an incredibly comfortable bed.,5,2011,08,13
200,Thought Dublin might be a bit of an anti-climax. We needn't have worried.,"The welcome at arrival was outstanding. My wife & I transferred from the K Club and thought Dublin might be a bit of an anti-climax. We needn't have worried. 
The front of house team were charming and even had upgraded us to a junior suite. Prior to arriving we had been contacted to arrange  our spa treatments (thank you Atiila), which were superb; I thoroughly recommend the aromatherapy massage (with Lisa?) who was tremendously skillful. 
The room was delightful, the internet was fast, the champagne was cold and delicious. The only slightly odd part was the peaty colored bathwater; peculiar rather than disconcerting. After a night out in Dublin with friends (music and beer at The Porterhouse), Jose in the bar introduced me to several new Irish malts (thanks mate - good to meet you in the whisky shop on Dawson St the following day - admirable dedication!) after which the bed was as comfortable a bed as it was possible to find. 
A full Irish breakfast with additional blueberry pancakes were the icing on the (very calorific) cake. Thank you to all, particularly including the professional and highly efficient concierge team; in the flaky tarnish of today's mediocre hospitality, the Merrion is a shining beacon of delight.",5,2011,08,11
200,A Class Act,"From the moment we pulled up in our rental car, we were enveloped in the grace and beauty of this quiet but grand city hotel.  There are no signs; the hotel is discreet.  It houses an award-winning restaurant as well as its own restaurant and function rooms.  Our suite was extremely large and comfortable.  The staff could not have been more pleasant.  The terrace garden (inside court) is beautiful.  The breakfast room inside was also top-notch.",5,2011,08,11
200,One of the Best,"Spent three nights at the Merrion with my wife and it was one of the best hotel stays ever.  That's saying a lot since I travel the world continuously.  Had booked a Jr. Suite that wasn't ready when I checked in.  I didn't say anything because it was 10:00am and check in time was 3:00pm.  I must ahve looked disappointed because the desk manager asked me if I ""would accept a complimentary upgrade to a full suite"" since my room was not ready.  The room was wonderful, the service was great, room service could not have been better.  Highly recommend the Merrion.",5,2011,08,10
200,"We were really disappointed, will never go back to the Merrion!",We spent there a long weekend in August.  The air conditioning was really noisy and won't let us sleep. Internet was not working most of the time... Pillows were also bad smelling. The electricity went down for a couple of hours and the lifts were out of order..Dinner at the Cellar restaurant was of poor quality. The spa was also disappointing. We were expecting a special weekend ( we spent a lot of money!) and we were very disappointed! We will never go back to the Merrion!,1,2011,08,08
200,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived in Dublin a day early and were looking for a place to stay for the night. The staff at the Merrion were happy to find us a room for the evening and made our stay a wonderful experience. It is a beautiful hotel with all the amenities you could wish for. We enjoyed it so much we extended our stay. We made liberal use of the bar and sitting room with a fireplace. The staff catered to our every need and were incredibly friendly and helpful. Definitely on the pricey side but if you can afford it, its a great treat and we think no better place to stay in Dublin. Special thanks to Ramona in reception and John at the concierge desk.",5,2011,08,07
200,"We loved this beautiful place, and the hospitality is one of a kind.....","I can't say enough about this beautiful hotel.  It is such a beautiful and inviting place to stay at.  The staff went way beyond any staff that we have ever encountered, and the food , drinks, and service was wonderful.... I highly recommend this hotel......Also, in walking distance to some great shopping and eating places......",5,2011,08,04
200,Retired American Visitors (and others)- spend elsewhere,"Ok. Here goes. 

I myself am from Dublin. I live here and i am well acquainted with its hotels, their location and their reputation. it is for however for my personal opinion that i wright this review.

I have stayed in some mediocre hotels in the past and some excellent ones in many parts of the world. I have paid obscene amounts for some and have been pleasantly surprised at the cost of others. This time however i was lucky enough to get a gift of two nights in the Merrion Hotel and to be honest i was  really looking forward to not only the break from the kids (little angels that they are) but the fact that i was staying at a Hotel that i was aware had a great reputation but also was close to home.

The hotel is familiar to me so i cannot explain what one would think about first impressions. It is situated right in the middle of one of  the 'poshest' parts of the city and as such it commands a price bracket to match. 

The staff are helpful and courteous and to be frankly honest the Irish staff in the hotel far outshine the foreign staff that are employed in the hotel. It appears to me that other hotels who see their objective as making money should take a leaf from this book and realise that foreign visitors to Irish Hotels love Irish staff. They just have that 'cead mile failte' vibe about them that Americans in particular love and that foreign staff while they may be just as good at their job, they just dont have the- ""you know yourself sir"" or ""agh go on out a that"" turn of phrase that makes an irish stay a different stay.

The foyer is sufficiently spacious and the greeting from the staff was warm. The hotel corridors and floors appear to be a bit of a maze. The hotel is made up of many georgian buildings which have been joined together to make the hotel. The floorboards creek a bit but this adds to the charm. The cellar restaurant to be honest is just that, a celler. It is in the basement of the hotel and totally cut off from the outside. Food was great but the place lacks any atmosphere at all. There is no link to the outside world as there are no windows and as such it feels a bit claustrophobic. 

The hotel gardens are fine, situated in the middle of the hotel and are overlooked by the rooms which surround it on all four sides. The bedroom also was lovely and had everything that one would need. I do however think that for a hotel that markets itself as 5 star that wifi should be a priority in this day and age, but was not available without a cost. The hotel pool is an exception. It is lovely and a pleasant break from the world outside. The gym is small but sufficient and on our visits was never used by many people.. That would bring me to the room service and bar prices. I mean i'm no scrooge but 20 euro a day to park a car at the hotel.? Sorry, you just charged me 500 euro to sleep here, the least you can do is find a place for my car. The other services are charged at a similar premium before tip. If you stay here you deserve to get charged for everything as you must be gullible.

in conclusion, If you are coming to Dublin and looking for a hotel at the higher end of the market, dont come here. I was astounded at the cost of the rooms at the rate that was charged. I had it for free as explained but if i had to pay the rate of 500 euro for a room per night in a city that has a lot better to offer i would have cried in my cornflakes. This is a rip off in any mans wallet. The staff are great , the location is great, its just minutes from the centre of Grafton street, but my god the place lacks any soul. 

It is aimed at mainly elderly American tourists that have a few dollars of retirement money to throw at a once in a lifetime trip to the oul sod, and judging by the amount of them there on my visit there are plenty of them.
Whatever age you are  and If you have the money and are coming to Dublin, please spend it more wisely . There are other hotels where you will get far better treatment, your money will go further, a place that will have a  better atmosphere and where you will not be cosseted away from the best that Dublin as a city has to offer. Even better advice- if you are under the age of 50 stay away at all costs or be bored to death at the lack of life that seems to have engulfed the entire hotel, its restaurants and it corridors and no I am not mistaking this for a relaxing visit. This place is boring, im sorry but yes that is my honest opinion. Dublin is one of the best cities in the world and if you stay here you deserve a hotel that will extenuate the visit. 

If you read this review and were sufficiently enlightened, please tick the YES box in the ""was this review helpful"" section at the bottom. It helps. Thanks and enjoy your trip to Dublin.  :-)",1,2011,08,02
200,We had a great stay at The Merrion.,"My wife and I stayed three nights at The Merrion during our tour of Ireland at the end of July, 2011.  Our room was immaculate and very comfortable, the customer service was phenomenal, and The Cellar Restaurant was excellent.  We were a little taken aback by how fancy The Merrion is.  There is a dress code that is only articulated in the guest information book in the room (no one said anything to us when we booked the room or on the website).  We ate at The Cellar Restaurant two of the three nights and both meals were very good.  I would also highly recommend The Cellar Bar, which is different than the restaurant; the atmosphere is quite nice.  Everyone at The Merrion was very attentive, kind, and eager to please.  If we are every back in Dublin, then we would absolutely stay a The Merrion again.",5,2011,08,01
200,Quality hotel,"Beautiful hotel in Georgian Dublin. As other posters have commented, it is expensive but in my view you pay for what you get. The staff are very friendly and professional whilst the bedrooms are a good size. The only issues we had were the noise from the plumbing from neighbouring rooms and as our room (152) had a view of a side road with bins, you could hear the bin-men early in the morning (this may be more a reflection of being a lighter sleeper).",4,2011,08,01
200,"Quiet opulence, friendly staff, sad garden pond","This is a row of Georgian houses combined and extended to make a five star hotel on the upper end of the scale. The hotel is opulent and has some history to it. It was the house in which the Duke of Wellington was born and is located close to Government Buildings. 

I stayed there briefly and at 260 Euro a night (website price) it wasn't exactly a bargain, until I was told that the full price was 460 Euro a night. The room was a bit small but it had some nice touches. For example there was a complimentary bottle of champagne in an ice-bucket.  It was nicely decorated and furnished. Best of all it was clean.

The bathroom had a walk-in shower which was a big help. There was a good sized bath and shower also in the bath. The towels had a lovely fresh feel to them. 

The bed was comfortable. Airconditioning at the touch of a button. The room was overlooking a side street and it was quiet at night. 

There is a quiet garden with, unfortunately, a central pond that hadn't been cleaned for some time. It was a bit of a shock to discover this. It looked so lifeless.

Having enjoyed coffee and a brandy I decided not to eat in the hotel as the price of even the most modest dish on the bar menu was a show stopper especially in these times of fiscal restraint, and I ate out at a nearby restaurant.

The hotel staff were friendly and efficient especially reception and the excellent concierge.",4,2011,07,31
200,The Best,"This is without doubt the finest hotel in Dublin.  The service is impeccable, the main house rooms are lovely, especially the suites.  We have stayed at the hotel several times and each time has been a joy.  We appreciate the garden and it's outdoor restaurant  in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Dublin. We come back to the hotel and find such peace and quiet in that lovely garden and can enjoy a meal there as well.",5,2011,07,28
200,Wonderful hotel within walking distance to city center!,"Loved The Merrion Hotel! Great location and staff willing to 'go the extra mile' for guests! Top notch in our book, and we will return on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2011,07,28
200,I'd Go Back to Dublin Just for The Merrion!,"One of my best friends and I spent a long weekend at The Merrion.  Our favorite part of the stay was the lovely garden that the hotel wraps around and the incredible common areas with the peat fires that others have mentioned.  It makes the hotel a great place to relax and unwind, and the amazing staff did everything they could to ensure we had a great weekend.  They are very attentive and friendly, not at all pretentious, which is a pet-peeve of mine in high-end hotels.

Our room was lovely -- very traditional styling which isn't my favorite, but beautiful nonetheless.  The bathroom was beautiful and had a huge bathtub that was great for soaking.  The bath products themselves are also a special treat.

I had a massage in the spa and can also recommend that part of the experience.  The staff was great and the services were in keeping.  We also had beautiful breakfasts each morning and enjoyed the restaurant.

The price tag is high, but well worth it if you want to treat yourself for a lovely weekend!",5,2011,07,27
200,Stay at the Shelbourne," We stayed here one night in Dublin and that was more than enough. Yes, it is luxurious, we stayed in the original side of the building which offered fabulous art in the hallways, the price of the hotel was outrageously high for what was offered. 

The rooms were nicely appointed, great linens but awful mattress. Most uncomfortable I had experienced in Ireland and I slept at a bar in Dingle one night. 
 The breakfast was average, don't pay for the breakfast go outside and save yourself a ton of money. 
 The biggest issue was valet. Our car was brought around but another brought out first was blocking valet and we couldn't leave. The tie up with the backlog of cars cost us an hour and resulted in a missed flight and 1500.00 to re book flights two days later. I was very upset that this occurred and would not stay here or recommend this hotel to anyone solely based on the inefficiency we experienced. ",2,2011,07,27
200,Very nice hotel,It is 4 historic Georgian townhouse made into a hotel.  We had a nice room overlooking the Parliament buildings.   The gardens in the back were lovely.  The common areas were very cozy where you could sit.  The hotel was within walking distance to a few attractions and the hop on hop off bus had a stop right by the hotel.  The employees were very friendly and helpful.,4,2011,07,25
200,A bit of Irish charm,"What I liked best about the Merrion were the charming peat fires in the drawing rooms.  I also found myself wondering if anyone having tea in the drawing rooms were from the parliament buildings across the street.  We found everyone very kind, which we found to be almost universal in our week here.  Patrick at the concierge desk was especially helpful.  One drawback is that the restaurant seemed to be filled with Americans on Friday evening.  The hotel can be expensive, but well worth the money.  I don't think you could ask for a better location in Dublin, or a better start on a trip to Dublin and Ireland.",5,2011,07,22
200,Lovely service!!! Beautiful interiors!,"stayed here with my BF over the weekend. Staff is INCREDIBALY helpful and friendly without being snobbish. The hotel is very beautiful- i loved the reception area and the bar next to the reception with fireplace and georgian style decor. Drinks are AMAZING. their Classic daiquiri is a must.
The outdoor garden i also very stylish and a little quiet place in busy and noisy Dublin.
Our room was good- bed and pillows were comfy.
Bathroom was HUGE! with lots of hangers, shelf space (all in marble of course) both shower and bath and really nice toiletries. 
Internet was working well and was complimentary- a BIG plus!
We were not bothered by noise from the corridor or the other rooms. 
House keeping did a good job.
You could chose NOT to have your towels and sheets changed every day- which i like. I think its a total wate to have it change every day and very non- eco friendly :-)
(many hotels dont respect that though)

the minuses:

-the room had no view and was a bit dark.... the window was a bit far away from the bed and it felt a tiiiiiny bit claustrophobic. I did ask the concierge/ reception is they had other rooms, but they were all booked (or at least so they said)
 
-room service and mini bar are REALLY expensive! 

-i wish thay had real comforters instead of the horrible blankets for sleeping. as we had nice weather we only slept with the sheets. but i would wish they would replace the blankets/ plaids.

- the gym is rather sparse- but has many tv screens which is nice.

- we inquired for a deal on a 6 week stay (business related, my BF was thinking of moving from the hotel he is staying at originally while in Dublin) and they offered us the same price as the one we found for a weekend 3 night stay ourselves online.... - about 200 euros.... So staying for long stays didnt qualify for a good deal, and my BF ended up staying at the other hotel.   

I have also been to the Shelbourne hotel- only for dinner though, and would love to try to stay there the next time, but will always come back again and again for the drinks at Merrion, and would also stay here in the future. 

PS- merrion is just net door to the 2 star rated Michelin restaurant Patrick Guilbaud which is the best food i have had in Dublin so far! (both lunch and dinner)",4,2011,07,22
200,"Wonderful hotel, excellent location and first class service","From the second you walk into this hotel you feel like nothing is too much trouble for the friendly and helpful staff. The decor is beautiful and our room was perfect, spotlessly clean with everything you could possible want there. We chose to dine at the cellar bar and the food was exceptional with a very varied wine list specialising in wine by the glass allowing guests to sample a wide range of the excellent wines on offer. The bar 23 was also good with great cocktails delivered with elegance and class. The hight of our stay had to be the infinity pool in the spa area which provided a tranquil and relaxing environment in the heart of such a bustling and exciting city. There is so much on offer in the hotel we did not leave from our check in time to check out the next day and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2011,07,20
200,Best hotel in Dublin,We really love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone going to Dublin and looking for more high end accommodation. We've stayed here a couple of times with our 1 year old and for a five star hotel they are very child friendly. The rooms are amazing and the beds are the best you will ever sleep in! Very friendly and helpful staff and great food. Special thanks to Caroline on reception for all your help.,5,2011,07,19
200,Exudes quality and authenticity. Highest levels of service.,"As I write this review, The Merrion is the highest rated Dublin Hotel on Tripadvisor. Within my experience of four Dublin 5-star hotels, The Merrion fully justifies it's top position.

We've just spent three nights in one of the standard rooms and for once, the standard room has few if any compromises. Our room even had a view over the Merrion's garden.

Room features included...
Free internet access
Tea/Coffee making (on request)
Both Shower & Bath
Bose Wave CD/Radio
Excellent Air Conditioning

All the guest areas of the main house have an authentic Georgian feel which is no surprise as these are Grade 1 listed buildings.

While the furniture and architectural features seem to be authentic to the Georgian period, the many artworks in the main building are a mix of modern Irish art and older pieces. They include artists of the calibre of Jack B Yeats, Roderic O'Connor and Paul Henry and even contemporary artists such as Sean Scully. In this setting, these more modern artworks really help to prevent the building feeling like a museum - it's a fantastic mix.

Members of staff at The Merrion provide a style of service that is courteous, friendly and helpful and yet also discrete. This level of service extends to all the hotel's reception, bars, restaurants, lounges - in fact everywhere! They have somehow managed to attain a consistency of service that I haven't experienced before and consistency like this does not happen by accident - they obviously have a 'best in class' training system in place.

The most gratifying thing is that the staff seem to take real pride in their own professionalism.

It's a masterclass in hotel service.",5,2011,07,15
200,Exceptional,"We were in Dublin for one night celebrating a big occasion.  The Merrion knew about this beforehand and could not have been nicer.  From the moment the taxi pulled up 
outside to the time we left the service could not have been better.  The rooms were lovely
and big, breakfast in our room (despite the early hour) was delivered bang on time.  The
hotel is very unassuming which adds to the experience.  My only regret was an early 
morning flight and therefore could not have a lazy morning in the Merrion.  Will definitely
return.",5,2011,07,06
200,Fantastic Hotel,Great location - in the centre of town but not on a noisy road.  Excellent service - staff couldn't be more attentive.  The hotel I have ever stayed in.  Highly recommended!,5,2011,07,06
200,Brilliant service,I travel a lot for business. This was the best room service I have ever had. We decided to have dinner in our room because the room was so nice. I have never before experience the hotel staff being so attentive to ensuring that the food was fresh and hot. They even rang to say that the chef was concerned that the soufflé we ordered would survive the trip to our room. It was superb. The food was great too!  Well done to all the staff.,5,2011,07,04
200,Brilliant,"Great location,excellent service,gorgeus food. All in all ,the best stay in any hotel around Dublin.Recommended",5,2011,06,30
200,OK hotel but overpriced for what you get,"The Merrion is a nice hotel but for 260 Euro for a room per night, which does not include breakfast, it simply does not live up to the expectations derived from staying at of other 5* hotels at this price.  Breakfast was about 30 Euro extra.  The room was just OK (nothing special).  The cellar bar was cosy but the food at this bar was poor.  I had a simple dish of fish and chips.  As a lone business traveller, I do not like sitting in the more upmarket restaurants in hotels on my own so I usually favour a good bar meal.  The fish's batter was thick and greasy.  The chips were lifeless.  This is such a great dish when done well with good fresh fish and thin crisp batter.  I have had much better at small pubs and expected more at a 5* hotel.

Staff were generally helpful but after sitting in the garden for 30 minutes waiting for a waitress to come over and see if I would like a coffee I gave up and left.",3,2011,06,27
200,Simply Exceptional,"It's hard to believe a hotel in Dublin could top the Merrion.  Its unassuming entry is a gateway to the perfect travel experience.  The staff is exceptionally courteous and helpful whether you are asking for additional pillows or reservations at one of the nearby restaurants.  Visitors to Dublin can worry about spending their Euros outside the hotel as the gratis WiFi access, bottled water in the rooms, and daily newspaper eliminate the oft-time small charges which have a habit of adding to a hotel bill.

At the end of a day's jaunt in the city, the Merrion's room is a fantastic respite and place to reenergize.  The beds are tremendously comfortable and the easy chairs in the rooms are perfect for reading the vacation novel or the guidebook for the following day's adventures.  The entire room is well-appointed and well-thought.  

Although there seems to be a great deal of business accomplished in the sitting areas and bars (it is across the street from the Irish Parliament), the tourist in Dublin is perfectly situated for striking out into the city.  There is a seemingly endless supply of great restaurants within blocks of the hotel entrance and the great shopping of Grafton Street is within five minutes.  

Likewise, the main tourist spots in southern Dublin are well-within walking distance.  The National Museum is essentially outside the Merrion's doorway and Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, and O'Connell Street, among others, are easily visited on foot.

Staying in shape at the Merrion is easy, as well.  The pool, fitness center, and steam bath are all adequate to maintain a visitor's level of fitness.  Runners will find the Merrion an excellent starting point and the central location a perfect spot to branch out in all directions of the city.

Our only less-than-perfect experience is what makes us ""The American Mark.""  One order of the multiple course sandwiches and pastries  at the Merrion's High Tea is more than adequate for a group of three.  My wife, daughter, and I would have been perfectly happy with one portion, rather than the three we mistakenly ordered.  So would my wallet.  Of course, it did make for lots of extra cake.  

In short, the Merrion is a perfect headquarters for a family stay in Dublin.",5,2011,06,23
200,Fell slightly short of perfection,"Our fourth stay here.  Was reluctant to criticise but after reading a previous review that mentioned the same problem I am concerned that the hotel are not listening.
Noisy, noisy, noisy. Loud whistling noise when water had run for a few minutes. Sounds like air in whole plumbing system. We could hear a loud whistling noise every time people beside or above us used their plumbing too. Could not even drown out the noise with the gentle hum of air con as this sounded like a freight train was approaching. Noisy service lift on the other side. Laughter and chat of staff started at 6.

On a positive note the concierge (esp Daniel) were faultlessly professional and really friendly.

Get the plumbing fixed and I will come back. And listen to guests when they point out faults because if you had then this problem would have been rectified earlier.",5,2011,06,19
200,One of the Greats,"An exceptional hotel, quiet, low key, wonderful service. It has pleasant friendliness of a small Inn. Beautiful garden, lovely art on almost every wall. Definitely a place to go back to.",5,2011,06,13
200,"decent hotel, great staff, shame about the food","We stayed here two nights before going on to a family wedding. We were given one of the rooms looking onto the Govt buidlings, which apparently are most in demand, but the traffic noise was too much for me so we were glad to have a much quiter - and nicer I thought -- room facing the garden but still in the old house  for the second night. The breakfast is copious, but free range/unprocessed/organic food doesn't seem to have reached much of Dublin and this hotel wasn't an exception. Same problem with a bar meal. Excellent front of house staff though.",4,2011,06,13
200,"Elegant, luxurious","Got the chance to stay here for a conference (even though I live in Dublin!)  - comfortably the best hotel in the city centre in my opinion.  Excellent friendly and warm service, really comfortable lounges and bars; food is to DIE for; leisure area is small-ish but maintained to the highest standard; location opposite government buildings, beside merrion square and the good bars of baggot street cannot be bettered. 

If you have just one night in Dublin, and are willing to spend money on one of the bigger chains (Westin, Hilton, Radisson etc.) spend it here instead - this place is the best!",5,2011,06,13
200,Top Notch if you can afford it,"This is a very nice hotel and you will pay for it. The service was extraordinary, the staff was so nice and helpful. The room was fantastic. The grounds were beautiful. You may also run into some politicos and celebs. But it comes with a price, this is 5 star. It is in Merrion square so a bit out of the way from the tourist areas, but something tells me he clientele here are not tourists.",4,2011,06,09
200,"An oasis of comfort, calm and elegance right in the middle of a bustling city","I live about an hour from Dublin & pass the Merrion regularly.  I’ve stopped in to the Cellar bar a few times and always enjoyed it.  I almost fell over once when I met the entire French rugby team exiting the front door.  I was aware of the illustrious guests it has accommodated so when I stayed this weekend for the first time I had very high expectations.  What surprised me most was that these were surpassed by miles.

Our stay started with a big smile from the doorman who took the bags which we next saw in the room and the car which we didn't have to worry about again until we left.  From that moment we were surrounded by the helpful and happy staff that made our stay perfect. We had a fabulous room in the main Georgian house with a wonderful view overlooking the beautiful buildings that house The Dáil.  There are also garden view rooms if you’re not an architecture/politics/history fan but I love these buildings. Lunch in the drawing room was a real treat with perfect silver service, divine food and immaculately served tea.  The garden is understated but full of surprises.  Gorgeous colours pop throughout.  The spa is wonderful.  I had the Lifesaving back treatment delivered by a truly expert therapist.  I haven’t felt my shoulders drop so low (relax) for a couple of years.  The Cellar bar & restaurant have a relaxed atmosphere which was quite an accomplishment from staff who were delivering virtual perfection at every moment.  My husband & I both ordered steak, his rare, mine medium, both were perfect – and the price was surprisingly reasonable. What I loved most about our stay was that every aspect of the service was of the highest possible standard but everything was so completely relaxed.

The Merrion has earned every one of its five stars in the loving care taken in the maintenance of the building and all of it’s beautiful rooms, in the attention and smiles of it’s staff not only where you’d expect on arrival and at reception but every time you encounter one of them in the corridors, in the wait staff that never intrude when you don’t need them but are there immediately when you do. There is not an ounce of bling or pretentiousness in this place.  It is comfortable and elegant – quality in the truest sense.

If you’re looking for a special place to stay – an oasis of comfort, calm and elegance right in the middle of a bustling city – the Merrion will not fail to deliver.",5,2011,06,05
200,"A lovely hotel, a great stay","What I liked best about the Merrion was the service. They actually try to anticipate your needs sometimes before you even think about it. Example: I was having a problem with my knee and needed to ice it. I called to have ice delivered telling them what it was for. They brought a bag full of ice as well as an ice bucket full letting me know I would need a lot of ice for icing my knee. They also knew to put it in a bag to make it easier. Example#2 we called for a wake up call and they asked if we needed a second one in 10minutes. Smart!!

Free Internet!! Hurrah!!

Our room was the King room over looking the garden. It was a very pretty room with a beautiful view. The bathroom was large. 

The gym is small but has all the right stuff for a work out at a hotel. The pool area is great. The pool is tiled and large and they have a nice steam room with a cold shower outside which is nice if you like to run in and out of the steam room. The locker rooms and showers are large and well equipped.

We ate  in the bar one evening and they have good wine  list and the food was excellent and very nicely presented. 

The only thing that surprised me was when asking the consierge for dining recommendations, he was not helpful. That was a huge surprise to us. They are usually the opitomy of knowledge and information. 

Beds were very nice but they could upgrade the pillows. I love down pillows but not down pillows that are under stuffed. They need more luxurious pillows.

Overall we very much enjoyed our stay at the Merrion and would go back again.",5,2011,06,04
200,First class all the way!,"I stayed here with my mother at the end of March to celebrate my 40th birthday and cannot provide enough superlatives about this hotel. Given our overnight translatlanic  flight, the staff still found us a room to ""sleep it off"". At any time during our visit the concierges and doorman made every attempt to make us welcome and see to our everuy need.  Upon waking that first day, we thoroughly enjoyed a breakfast in the Cellar. The hotel is located in the midst of the city, making every attraction walkable.  Not being experts in Irish art, we took in the National Gallery, and were floored to find 2 Jack B. Yeats originals in the hotel's lobby. Now that is what I call impressive!  But it is more important that every member of the staff did his/her best to make us comfortable during our 3-day stay. No task was too small or large.  We enjoyed a high ""art"" tea one day, and it was a highlight of our stay. Being part of a 40th-birthday celebration, I splurged on the cost, but it was completely worth every penny.  I can only fathom that any negative reviews on this site are from perpetual malcontents.... if something disagrees with you at this establishment, all you need to do is ask for an improvement and it will appear.  Thank you to all the staff!",5,2011,05,30
200,Just simply excellent,Afternoon tea great. Rooms large. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Great location.,5,2011,05,28
200,Having lots of staff does not make this a 5-Star!,"Our Saturday night stay at The Merrion, was a birthday treat for me - so I hadn't checked Tripadvisor reviews beforehand and was just looking forward to feeling pampered.  At Check-In we were told that we were being upgraded from a Standard Garden Room to a Superior Garden Room.   Great?!  Not really.    While we enjoyed our stay, we certainly felt cheated of that 5-star experience - and wonder if we had stayed in the same hotel as most other reviewers!  Why?  Was it because...

•	Our ""Superior"" room had very bland decor, faux French painted furniture, a painted plywood pelmet, plastic light switches, even plastic conduit for electrical/TV cables below the bedroom mirror.  We heard plumbing from other people's rooms and doors slamming down the hall.
•	We asked for tea/coffee-making facilities to our room - why do guests have to ask?? - which arrived without even the smallest biscuit and just the standard teas/instant coffee that you see in even the most basic of establishments.
•	The bathroom was large, but truly grim and looked more like a morgue in grey Carrera marble.  The (Mira) shower cubicle (2' x 3' =  60 cm x 90 cm) was lost in a corner.  Flushing the toilet would wake the dead (it was that noisy). 
•	At breakfast – not extensive, but of high quality – my porridge arrived somewhat cool (after a reminder to staff), made on water and without honey – perhaps subjectively, a faux-pas.
•	After a night at the theatre and afterwards, a wonderful dinner in Eden, we returned to The Merrion at 12.30am for a cocktail before bed.  But the No. 23 Cocktail Bar and Drawing Rooms were brightly lit and completely lacking in atmosphere – we counted just 12 people in all!  Compare that to the Shelbourne Hotel, as we passed by just moments earlier, which was buzzing with chatter and craic!  So we wandered around to look at the artwork and were met with a robust coldness from the 3 staff in the Front Hall.
And while we weren't expecting original 20th Century art works in our own bedroom, we have stayed in other less fabled hotels with more interesting wall coverings (of course, this is subjective).

Our disappointment stems not from any one of these niggles, because that’s all they really are, but cumulatively they were not outweighed by any wow factor, or any sense of feeling pampered.  When booking a room in this hotel, be aware that Garden view rooms are furnished in a period ""style"" – to me they look like they were built in the last 20 years.  Even some of the ""Main House"" facing the Garden seems new (certainly, new windows/shutters in the lounge leading to the garden).  The only Irish members of staff that we met were the gentleman at the front steps who took our luggage and the receptionist at Check-out - both of whom were genuinely warm.  

At check out, when asked, we said that we were disappointed and underwhelmed by our stay at The Merrion.  However, staff prevailed upon us to talk it over with Vanessa, the Guest Relations Manager - who was extremely charming and perhaps disappointed that we were not complaining of any particular incident, just of being underwhelmed.  Later that evening, I received a phone call from The Merrion offering us a night free of charge in the Main House of the hotel ""to restore our faith in the hotel"".  We declined their kind offer - because we felt that would be like comparing apples and oranges, by treating us to a far higher standard of room and of experience than the one which we felt our €250 rate would ordinarily receive.  We have benefited from many reviews on Tripadvisor and felt obliged to share our experience with other members.  The following day, we received an email from the General Manager reimbursing all payments incurred by us at The Merrion.

While the management's eagerness to address our dissatisfaction is commendable, one wonders about their determination to erase any negative commentary about their hotel.  We hope that other guests who stay in a Garden View room enjoy a higher standard of accommodation than we did and, moreover, the 5-Star treatment that is promised.",3,2011,05,25
200,Fantastic Hotel,"My partner and I and my parents stayed here at the beginning and end of a 2-week trip to Ireland.  The hotel is beautiful.  The gardens are stunning and the drawing rooms, spa, and Cellar Bar are all great spaces.  The swimming pool is stunning.  Rooms were large and very comfortably appointed.  We had Deluxe Garden Wing Rooms the first time and City View rooms in the main house at the 2nd part of the trip.  Although the Main House rooms are a larger (with a separate sitting area), the Garden Wing rooms are a much better value (and quieter).

The staff is excellent.  Very friendly and helpful.  Great products in the rooms.  A real taste of luxury and Irish hospitality.  

The food in the Cellar Restaurant (breakfast) is excellent.  We also at Patrick Guilbaud.  It is a beautiful restaurant, great service and the food is very good, but we had several other meals in Ireland that were as good or better (e.g., Thorntons in Dublin,  James Street South in Belfast, Gregan's Castle in the Burren) that were significantly less expenseive (e.g., 50%).",5,2011,05,24
200,"Great location and gorgeous, high-end feel","We loved our stay at The Merrion in Dublin as we celebrated our honeymoon.  The hotel was centrally located to many of the places we wanted to visit, and we particularly enjoyed being able to walk to restaurants and shops. One sunny afternoon, we picked up sandwiches and walked over to St. Stephens Green, where we enjoyed the park with many others who were soaking in the sun that day!  The concierge at The Merrion was extremely helpful in pointing us in the right direction regarding sites we wanted to visit, and he also recommended a nice restaurant for us within walking distance of the hotel. Overall, the hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We asked for tea service to be placed in our room, and it arrived in a matter of minutes.

The Merrion is absolutely gorgeous with an old-world feel--the hardwood floors and the antique furnishings create a sense of understated opulence. We visited the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail a couple of nights we were there, and we found the staff to be helpful and pleasant--the decor is also quite lovely (dark wood and the feel of a gentlemen's club).  The accommodations were lavish with what seemed to be larger than king sized bed and a luxurious marble bathroom. The garden view from our room was tranquil, and each night we would return to the room and enjoy the touch of turndown service.  We were particularly struck to return to our room on Good Friday to find a sweetly decorated egg carton filled with Easter treats (candies, cookies, confections) that was left along with a card signed by the hotel manager--what a thoughtful touch--one that speaks to the details that make The Merrion such a special place.  When we return to Dublin, we would be happy to stay here again.",5,2011,05,23
200,Very posh hotel but bring an extra large purse!,"Every detail meticulously thought out. Superb location in Dublin.  Although it was fabulous, it is far too expensive for the average traveler.  Only one complaint.. When we were given a ""tour"" of our room, we were told (twice) that we could have an electrical converter for FREE.  When we saw it on our bill upon checkout, we questioned it and was told we were wrong.  Was not happy about the dishonesty of the staff member that told us that.  Certainly didn't expect it at such a posh place.",5,2011,05,22
200,Great expereince at the spa,I visited the spa on a Sunday morning for a luxury pedicure. My therapist was Irene and she was fantastic. Warm and friendly but also allowed me time to relax. The foot massage was amazing and I could tell she would be a fantastic massuse. She spotted that my lex wax I had had done a few days earlier in a different hotel has not been done properly and rectified the problem for me as she knew I was going away on holiday. A great experience and excellent customer service. If you are booking a treatment make sure to ask for Irene!,5,2011,05,22
200,The perfect place to stay in Dublin 5*,"The perfect place to stay in Dublin, it has the great location with the 5* cosiness, Irish hospitality and service!! The only place to be when in Dublin, feels like a homely cosy place whilst being in the hustle and bustle of Dublin.....

The rooms are all clean and spotless, the beds some of the comfiest around. Is 5* but has a relaxed feel rather than pretentious ...

Highly recommended to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin, well worth the money.",5,2011,05,20
200,not quite as good as expected,"went with my wife for an overnight stay as we were attending a party in town and children could go for a sleepover.
Reception was efficient if a little cold and demanding of prepayment,what sort of guests do they get there? Route to the room past the gardens was very nice.
Champagne waiting on arrival was quickly take and on the whole the room was small and very nicely turned out.
Breakfast was very expensive E24 and extra if you wanted Eggs Benedict or kippers etc.
A pleasant stay was ruined by car valet service taking around half an hour to retrieve my car and giving it a new good long scratch while they were at it,",4,2011,05,19
200,Impeccable!,"Good service is to be expected in 5 star hotels, but the Merrion manages to combine great service with a genuine warmth. The best  hotel to stay in when visiting Dublin.",5,2011,05,17
200,Beautiful,Comfortable and stylish and the peat fire in the drawing room was so inviting and cosy.,5,2011,05,16
200,Great place to chill,"Unbelievably relaxing for a city hotel.We throughly enjoyed our stay and as ever left with our batteries recharged. Attentive staff, beautiful room, we can't wait to return.",5,2011,05,16
200,Authentic Luxury,"I'm smitten.  This hotel exceded all my expectations: cuisine, staff, ambiance, local character, art collection, gardens.  It is of the same quality as the Dorchester London or Carlyle NYC.  I have good things to say about every aspect of the hotel and imagine that anyone would feel welcomed and enjoy a stay here.

Of the world's top luxury hotels, this one must offer the best value.  The bottled water, wifi, and excellent full irish breakfast were all included in my rate--check out was a shock not because the bill was so much higher than expected, but because there were NO unexpected fees or charges.  My experience was simliar or superior to hotel stays that would cost 4-6 times as much in another city.  I can't wait to return.",5,2011,05,16
200,the best hotel in the world,"This is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world. You  are greeted by the friendliest doormen who know absolutely everything about Dublin. Nothing is too much trouble, a trait shared by the other staff. Because it located centrally , you can get around the City very easily. The hotel itself is stunningly elegant  with the most beautiful artwork everywhere. The rooms are good, but we managed to get an upgrade and that was extremely special. We moved into our suite and didn't want to ever leave. There is a great choice of restaurants in the hotel and the bar in the basement is great fun. And if you are into celebrity spotting, this hotel has them in bulk. The night we were there, we spotted Louis Walsh having dinner and a friend of ours on another occasion was in the bar beside Bruce Springstein. I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.",5,2011,05,13
200,Quiet oasis in bustling city,"Stayed here for six nights over the Easter break, with my husband and two boys, ages 11 and 13. The boys are at an age where we all enjoy our trip best if we can get connecting rooms - we all need a little privacy but they are still too young to be by themselves in a strange city. Finding such rooms is surprisingly difficult so I started shopping around early, but the first few hotels we tried in Dublin, either refused to guarantee the rooms or did not even bother to respond to my emails. I'd initially thought the Merrion would be too expensive, but emailed them on a whim. Their response was immediate and courteous, and they were able to give us a wonderful deal for the two rooms including breakfast that worked out to be quite reasonable. Since we were traveling overnight from the US and would be arriving at 6am, we arranged to hold the room from the night before so we could check in as soon as we arrived - some hotels refuse to let you do this,even if you are paying, but the Merrion had no problem with it at all and was very accommodating.
From the street, the hotel is just another row of Georgian townhouses, but inside it is quite beautiful. Our rooms were in the new garden wing, overlooking the lovely gardens - the kids got quite a kick checking to see if the hotel duck was in the garden pool every morning. The rooms were very nice, the beds very comfortable and the bathrooms had both a shower and a bathtub (ladies, beware, the water in Dublin is very soft so chose shampoo accordingly). There was a decent selection of TV channels, both Irish and from the UK. Room service will send up a mini kettle and a selection of teas if you call and bottles of spring water are replenished every day.
Breakfast is served in the Cellar restaurant - we had a choice of the buffet, which had a good selection, or of the Irish breakfast which was beautifully presented. You can also order from the menu at an extra charge. If you are feeling lazy, you can order breakfast to be delivered to your room for a minimal charge.
 We ate dinner at the Cellar restaurant once - the food was wonderful featuring a lot of local Irish produce, though service was a little slow. Warning - when guide books say call all restaurants for reservations, they mean it, even for pizzerias. And you should be aware that many restaurants in Dublin are closed on Sunday night - call before you go, we learned the hard way.
The Merrion also has a swimming pool and fitness center in the basement of the garden wing, which guests may use free of charge. The pool is quite lovely and it was very pleasant to be able to be able to take a dip after a long day of sightseeing. Families with small kids should be aware that there is no shallow end - it is all 5ft deep.
The hotel location is very convenient. It is about halfway between Merrion Square park and St. Stephen's Green, and two major museums are just down the block. There are plenty of pubs and restaurants within a few minutes walk, and although close to Grafton Street and the main shopping areas, it is well away from all the commercial hustle and bustle. If you want to get out of the city, it's about a ten minute walk to a major train station.
I would definitely consider staying there again - just wish we had had the time to sample their afternoon tea.",5,2011,05,06
200,Great Hotel,Stayed here for two night to celebrate my fiancé's 30th Birthday and it's a great place for a special occasion. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a great location. I'd recommend getting a room with a garden view if you're not staying in the old part of the hotel.,5,2011,05,06
200,Nice change of pace from modest hotels,"After 5 nights in the Jury's Inn in Galway, we decided to splurge on our last night before heading home from Dublin. We got a package deal and got a huge room, dinner, breakfast, and a great bottle of chilled real Champagne for about 260 Euros. The hotel was elegant with great service and its very pricey! Be prepared to bring a lot of money.Our room looked out onto their gorgeous garden and I think all rooms do. Very quiet, comfy beds. Bathroom was huge with every amenity you could ask for including heated towel bars. No place is perfect and our shower (separate from bath) had a door that was poorly hinged and I worried that it might fall off. We had to request a clock and the poor lady who brought it had no idea how to get it working properly. Also you have to request an ironing board. Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed the room. The evening dinner was a prix fix and the food was fantastic. Breakfast was a huge and glorious buffet, best buffet I have every enjoyed. There was a bar on the lower level that looked quite interesting with very pricey drinks. We were pretty wiped out from the Champagne so we didn't stay there- attracted a very young and hip crowd. Overall, I would welcome the chance to stay there again someday.",4,2011,05,01
200,"The fabuluos Merrion hotel, 5 star all the way!","We stayed at the Merrion hotel at easter for 3 nights and we had an amazing stay. From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We stayed in a suite in the main house which was fabuluos, italian marble bathroom and siiting room, it was complete elegance. During our stay easter eggs and cupcakes were left in our room which was a lovely touch. We had dinner in the Cellar restaurant and the food was top class. We also used the swimming pool and sauna which is an added bonus while staying in a city centre hotel. This hotel is 5 star and more, while staying in the merrion you dont feel that you are staying in the city centre because of the surroundings and tranquil gardens, we definitely hope to return.",5,2011,04,28
200,5 perfectly earned stars,"We chose The Merrion for our stay in Dublin as it seemed a nice mix of sophistication, location and casual elegance. It delivered. Any 5 star rating starts and ends with the staff. They have it down to a T here. Arrived on an overnight from the US at about 10am. Room ready about 12 they said. We slipped into a sitting room; in the midst of tea and scones reception came by and said our room was ready and bags were up.
We had room service on night one - perfect and ate in in the Cellar Bar on our last night- perfect.  We had our breakfasts in the drawing rooms each morning. Coffee and scones - perfect. You will not be disappointed here.",5,2011,04,27
200,Pitch Perfect,"We had a hard time selecting a hotel in Dublin as there seemed to be  trade offs among the top properties.  The jackpot was hit with the Merrion, which was lovely in every way.  The atmosphere was perfect - luxurious without going too formal and stuffy.  The staff was warm and professional and it was a pleasure to walk into the public rooms with a turf fire and cozy chairs waiting.  Our suite was in the garden wing and we found it quiet and well furnished.  The location of the hotel is ideal, on a quiet block a short walk from most of Dublin's attractions.

The only disappointment we had  was breakfast in the dining room, with the staff overwhelmed by the crowd and not able to provide attentive service, leaving us asking several times for coffee, water, a chance to order, etc.  We opted for room service the following day, which was excellent.",5,2011,04,26
200,Simply the best in Town!,"The trip was very last minute and we were so glad that we chose The Merrion to celebrate our Pearl wedding anniversary. The room upgrade was very much appreciated as was the chef’s happy anniversary cupcake, such a lovely thought.  Nothing was too much trouble and the staff responded in an efficient and reassuring manner which is a credit to the management. Even after we left our passports in the room safe on checkout The Merrion came good and delivered them to the airport and we made the flight with seconds to spare. Now we are back home we have had a chance to tell our parents just how good the hotel was and hope to come back with them in the near future. Once again our deepest thanks for a special holiday at the best hotel in Dublin.",5,2011,04,25
200,Simply Fabulous!,"We stayed at the Merrion for 2 nights at New Year. The service was fantastic, nothing too much for the staff. It was exactly what you would expect from a true 5 star hotel.

The food was very good, we had breakfast and dinner in the Hotel restaurant. We ate out in the City Centre the second night.

Tip - Book afternoon tea when you arrive. We wanted to have afternnon tea on our final day but unfortunately it was fully booked. We did not realise that we would need to book it. We went to a hotel close by for afternnon tea.",5,2011,04,24
200,The best....,"Overdue review - Stayed for 5 nights at this elegant hotel.  It was November 2010 and this hotel could not have been more luxurious and cozy.  Close proximity to sites. Helpful staff and delicious breakfasts.  Our suite was traditional, roomy, with my own dressing room and closet.  Large spacious bathrooms.
My husband and I attended 3 Michael Flatley - Lord of the Dance's shows at the O2 during our stay.  These shows, combined with this hotel, various galleries/museums we visited and restaurants we dined at, made our Dublin visit sublime in the chilly (all too short days) of November.",5,2011,04,21
200,First class venue,"We arrived here on Saturday just after lunch to be greeted a friendly porter, who took our car away to park it. Check in was very quick and we were very pleased to be upgraded to a bedroom in the main house. The room was beautiful and very spacious and the bathroom well equipped with “Asprey” toiletries, bathrobes and slippers. 
It was such a glorious day and we decided to explore the city. St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street were only a short stroll away.
We had our evening dinner in the Cellar Restaurant in the hotel. The menu was very well explained by our server Damian who was I believe the bar and restaurant manager. He was very knowledgeable and was great craic into the bargain. My wife had a goat’s cheese mousse for starter and she said it was one of the best she had ever eaten. I did not have a starter. For mains we had cod and a rib eye steak and again both of these were exceptional. Desserts were also very nice and everything was beautifully presented.
Breakfast the next morning was also of the highest quality.
I cannot finish without mentioning the staff. Each and every member of staff we encountered were extremely polite, courteous and well mannered. Service was superb and I know the manager Peter MacCann is very proud of them all and rightly so.
I look forward to returning in the not too distant future and I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,04,20
200,Wonderful!,Just arrived back from a lovely 3 night stay for my 40th birthday. This hotel is the nicest I've stayed in. My thoughts echo other reviews on here. Understated elegance would be my short description. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and a lot of other hotels could learn lessons in the way The Merrion is run. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and am already saving up to return!,5,2011,04,16
200,Best Hotel Stay..Ever!!!!,"We stayed for one night for our wedding anniversary.  The excellent service starts on arrival with the valet car parking service and welcome by the reception staff.  The hotel is elegant and understated, with beautiful drawing rooms and open fires. To our surprise, we were upgraded to one of the rooms in the main house, which made the entire stay extra special. We had booked a one night package which included champagne on arrival and dinner in the Cellar Restaurant. We were guided to our room by Tina who was exceptionally friendly and professional; like all of the other staff in the hotel. Quite simply we have never experienced service like this. The room was gorgeous, with a huge bed, a lovely bathroom, classical decor  and with a very relaxing atmosphere.  Cleanliness  throughout the hotel was exceptional.  Dinner and breakfast were both excellent. The staff and service at this hotel set it apart from all the others.  It is THE place to go for a special occasion.",5,2011,04,10
200,"Perfect location, elegant comfort and warm hospitality!","We had a fantastic 3 night stay at the The Merrion.  We were in a standard room (130) in the garden wing with a window on an alley.  We did not care about the view because everything in the room, hotel lobby, spa, basement Cellar Bar, breakfast room, and gardens was gorgeous.  The multiple lobby rooms were very popular, with people having a great time sharing tea or a drink in front of constantly burning fireplaces.  Our room was very comfortable, with bathrobes, morning paper, tea/coffee maker (you have to request it) and a good  queen bed.  From the friendly costumed doorman to the sweet waitress that brought us a drink in the amazingly beautiful lobby, the staff were all attentive and cheerful.  The location was a short walk to restaurants, parks, museums and most Dublin sights.  Perfect !  We thought the breakfast prices were too high (24 euro for continental), so we had a delicious breakfast around the corner at the Boulevard Cafe for much less.   We had a wonderful dinner at Fallon & Byrne, a wonderful brasserie, as well as the restaurant Balzac.  We would definitely recommend the Merrion and would stay there again.",5,2011,04,10
200,One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in!,"The service and the room at The Merrion were absolutely first rate! A superb experience from the time of arrival until departure. Fabulous and friendly staff, beautiful and well appointed room (recommend staying in the main house rather than the garden wing), and a very fine informal restaurant/bar in the basement (Michelin rated restaurant as well, but we had dined too well by the time we got to Dublin!).",5,2011,04,09
200,Cellar Bar,"Visited the hotel's Cellar bar. Great venue for lunch or dinner, comfortable and very cozy. The food is reasonably-priced and very well-executed...the bacon and cabbage is excelent as is the organic pork sausage. Service is unobtrusive, friendly and efficient. All in all, a good Dublin dining experience without needing a bail-out for the bill.",5,2011,04,06
200,Excellent hotel.,The service and surroundings at this hotel were wonderful. Housekeeping and the front desk did an excellent job-were friendly and helpful. Food at the onsite Cellar restaurant  was superb as was the service. I would highly recommend!!!!,5,2011,04,06
200,Best luxury hotel in Dublin,"This was my second stay in several years to this lovely hotel.  As before, service was excellent as well as the breakfast and room service.  I booked a facial at their renown Spa and came back for an unscheduled back message.  Even with the terrible downturn in the Irish economy, the hotel has maintained their level of excellence.  For this visit I again used the Executive computer services that were available and staff assisted me in printing out a vital travel document - a Visa- needed for my travel to the Arab world.  The hotel lounges, gardens and services are tucked away in a central location in Dublin with an easy short walk to the shopping area.  I knew that I would return to this hotel in Dublin and was not disappointed.  The pool, exercise facility and Spa were wonderful as were the people.  My business colleague dubbed this hotel the ""yes"" hotel, because there was no problem too great for them to address.  All travelers should note that it is worth it to say at least one night here no matter the cost!",5,2011,04,01
200,Perfect,"Wow! It was my first trip to Ireland and I was very excited! I didn't want to rent a car so I picked the Merrion because it's location is right in the middle of city center so I could just walk everywhere (or take a short cab ride). I have absolutely nothing negative to say. I arrived early for check-in so the doormen were quick to offer to lock-up my luggage while I roam around the neighborhood. Also, one of the front desk girls (I believe her name was Ramona) was the sweetest girl ever. She did everything she could to make sure my room would be ready as quickly as possible. Everyone was so kind- front desk, doormen, room service, restaurant/bar staff...etc.

It's not a HUGE hotel, so the staff were very personable and able to get to know me and why I was there, and therefore help me pick activities to spend my days. I brought my mom with as a mothers day present and they were able to give her plenty of choices for tours and sights and even set up the reservations for the hop-on/hop-off bus and the Wild Wicklow tour (both I highly recommend!).

It is pricey, however, the hotel was immaculately clean and had wonderful character from the lobby, to the drawing room for tea, the bar, and the gorgeous courtyard!...and, wonderully located. I highly recommend it. If you go, definitely check out my new favorite pub that's just kiddie corner from the hotel called O'Donoghue's. Lots of great 'craic' with locals and visitors, and wonderful live music!",5,2011,03,28
200,Very nice,"We stayed three nights in a Deluxe King room in the main house with an extra bed for our daughter. The room was very nice and clean. We had a large bathroom with all the amenities that one can wish for. The common rooms are beautiful and service is really five stars.
We had dinner at the Cellar restaurant once, it was good but not outstanding. We found several places in Dublin with higher quality for a lower price. Breakfast was perfect. The only downside was our first night, after going to bed we realised that the room temperature of the room was rather chilly and no matter what we did, we could not really get it up to a comfortable level. On top of that a guest came back in the middle of the night (around 2 o'clock in the morning) and started shouting and banging at a door somewhere down the hall
This only lasted for a few seconds but was repeated 3 or 4 times: Not the hotel's fault but still rather appalling! Next morning we asked for extra blankets and everything was fine and we really enjoyed our stay at the Merrion. We would definetly recommend this hotel.",4,2011,03,28
200,Magic,A wonderful find...first time to stay here and from the outset i realised why so many stars choose to stay here when in ireland....understated from the outside but opulent inside....everyone from the valets to the housestaff make you feel so welcome....best staff i've ever come across....wonder ful restaurant in the cellar..didn't make it to P.G.s  and a wonderful residents bar with a real fire...stay here..even if its only just once....you'll not regret it...,5,2011,03,21
200,The only place to stat,"The Merrion is truly one of the best hotels-anywhere.  The relaxed and friendly atmosphere makes it feel like you are staying at a well-to-do friends home with none of the drawbacks.  Beautiful surroundings, wonderful food in all the bars and restaurants and a perfect location in Dublin- I have stayed here more than 2 dozen times now and truly look forward to returning.

Secret:  look out for the ""Seven Star Steal""  which includes one night B&B and a special 4 course (which turns into 6!) tasting menu in 2 star Michelin Patrick Guilbaud...truly heavenly experience!",5,2011,03,21
200,Relaxed opulence at its best,"We have stayed at this wonderful hotel a few times now, and would not look past it when in Dublin. From the moment you walk up the front steps, you feel relaxed and looked after. The service is excellent but also discreet and not overpowering. Rooms are very comfortable. Highly recommended.",5,2011,03,21
200,"Absoultely fantastic experience, excellent customer service!!!!","I stayed with my partner for 2 nights at the end of February. It was the most enjoyable experience. As I work in the hotel industry myself i would have quite high customer expectations.  The staff were first class, very personal and so willing to help at all times.  I dont think over the period of our stay that we set eyes on the same member of staff twice.  Yet everyone used our name, it felt like we were the only couple in the hotel.  Cleanliness, Food and Spa facilities were impecable. Our check out was very efficient and friendly.  We had 3 concierge loading our car with luggage - first class service.",5,2011,03,15
200,"The Merrion, Dublin – surely now one of the World's great hotels.","I recently hosted a 60th birthday party at the Merrion. 40 international guests stayed over the weekend and without exception, were completely bowled over by the fabulous, low-key, yet attentive Irish hospitality offered by Peter MacCann and his staff. A private Georgian Buffet dinner in the Wellington room is highly recommended – the fastidious attention to detail was second to none. The reception staff were lovely and, importantly, added that magical ingredient – a sense of humour! This is now surely one of the World's great hotels.",5,2011,03,13
200,Fabulous and elegant!,"We stayed here on their Five Star Steal package and we loved it! We got upgraded to an enormous suite, the staff were fantastic and the Cellar Restaurant surpassed our expectations. Highly recommended!",5,2011,03,13
200,Best hotel I have stayed in - ever!,A beautiful hotel in a central location to visit Dublin city. This is what a five star hotel should be. Luxury rooms and fantastic service from the hotel staff. Would highly recommend it.,5,2011,03,10
200,So Fab,"Organised a friend's birthday night at the Merrion.   Great place to say because:
1. service - staff are ALL pleasent, curtious and responsive
2. food - was impressed with Cellar reataurant for dinner and breakfast, good choice, a little different, especially dinner menu, new things to try and they worked.
3. value for money - so amazing
4. location - so good....pop out to the snug in dohney for a quick guinness!!
5. hote - it is a relaxing hotel with a lovely mix of old and new, and lovely gardens in the centre of hotel
6. so easy for all to get to/from
FAB, FAB",5,2011,03,07
200,"Great service, lovely hotel","Stayed here on an overnight stay in Dublin - picked the Merrion on reputation and wasn't disappointed. The service was fantastic - the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The room was lovely, bright clean with a great bed. The bathroom was nice enough - spacious, separate shower and bath and marble everywhere - good sized towels too which is a rarity I find. Took breakfast in the room, can't fault the food or the service - it arrived on the dot of the ordered time. All in all The Merrion is a lovely hotel with good service and a good location - less than 10 mins walk from Grafton Street. I can't comment on either restaurant as we didn't eat there, but the breakfast was very good quality and afternoon tea looked fabulous too. It's not a cheap option, but I will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,03,06
200,Fabulous hotel!,We were only in Dublin overnight but wanted a central (ish) hotel to stay in. Hadn't stayed at the Merrion before but what a fantastic surprise it turned out to be. The service is as good as anywhere I've ever stayed. Nothing to is too much trouble for the friendly and efficient staff. The room was a decent size and the bed was really comfortable. We will stay their again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to people.,5,2011,03,02
200,was great but expected more,great stay but coming from a different continent did expect more from a European hotel ...can still recommend to others,4,2011,02,24
200,DUD!,"For a couple of years now my hubby has been going on about The Merrion about the who's who of staying there when he lived just down from it.  He said that it was pure grandeur with the art works second to the National Gallery.  Booking by phone - fine. Valet parking ok. have choice of being shown to room but declined. Room was nothing exceptional. I have had better in The Brookes in Dublin for less! Cost $240 with breakfast.  No recession busters here.  Bathroom was old and worn out with unsightly cracks in the floor that were not part of the decor!  Do get free Wi-Fi, however  I am sure nothing is for free at this place!  Gardens nice and will be wonderful in the spring and summer.  Service in bar was good.  Food - well I will do the review so look for it.
Next day had to do business on internet and waitresses attentive for coffee.  Did not have breakfast as was sick all night with upset stomach.  see food review.  
Called for assistance with bags and sat in room for over 20 minutes and still no one came so we dragged the bags to reception.  Check out fine. Car came back and lad left muck all in my car when had just cleaned it day before.  
Most of the staff here are mechanical.  Everything they say is robotic and without any charm or friendliness.  IT WAS A DUD in my BOOKS!",2,2011,02,20
200,Outstanding,"What a place. Great to see such good service and great hospitality. 
From the doorman to the cleaning staff they all make this hotel an special an amazing experience

Throughly enjoyed the stay

Would recommend it to anyone

Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating

Would give the hotel 6 stars! 5 is not enough!

Outstanding!",5,2011,02,20
200,My Favourite Hotel in Dublin,"My absolute favourite hotel in Dublin. walking distance from shops on Grafton St. Staff are wonderful, friendly & very attentive. Amazing breakfasts. Beautiful comfortable bedrooms. Big log fires lighting in the lounge areas, A real treat. I would highly recommend the Merrion Hotel. Loads of beautiful restaurants within walking distance, or eat in the Hotel for lovely food.",5,2011,02,17
200,Perfect for an overnight romantic getaway.,"I reserved a Superior King room in advance via the web to celebrate an anniversary with my girlfriend.  We live in Dublin, so to stay away for one night so close to home the hotel I picked had to be special.  They offered an excellent value during the low season.  As a frequent traveler (20+ countries per year) I can assure fellow readers the price paid was beyond excellent for this class of hotel.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite in the Main Wing upon arrival, but the room was not quite ready so we were treated to coffee and tea while we waited in the elegant No. 23 bar.   The room was beyond our expectations in terms of being romantic, elegant and cozy comfortable.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  The art collection is not be missed.

Our full Irish breakfast (included in the package) was equally elegant.  I'd say I had the best muffin I've ever eaten in Ireland, and my girlfriend commented she had the best granola ever in her entire life---which may seem trivial but a statement none the less.   I know this hotel can be rather expensive during normal times and high season, but times in Ireland are not ""normal"" at the moment, and this is a bit the low season so I think we just lucked into a great value.  I would have paid more if I had to, knowing the high standards that are practiced here.    So if you want a quick romantic getaway I'd highly recommend you consider staying here.  There are other hotels in Dublin that are quite nice, but this place is definitely a step above the rest no matter what price you pay.",5,2011,01,31
200,A touch of style,"Nothing like Georgian elegance to settle the weary traveller.  Add to that careful considerate service, real fires and spa treatments, freshly squeezed orange and you believe you should never go home.
Thank you Merrion - long may you prosper",5,2011,01,29
200,"fabulous, indulgence but homely at the same time","The Merrion hotel in Dublin is very expensive however unlike a lot of other expensive hotels - you definately get what you pay for at the Merrion.  Also because it is not part of a huge chain, it is intimate, personal and homely.  When you pick up the phone for reception, guest services, housekeeping, room service you are greeted by name and when room service says you order will be with you in five minutes - it is with you in five minutes. Northing is too much trouble.  If you can afford it the experience is definately worthwhile.",5,2011,01,20
200,The best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Quality of service, accomodation, facilities and food all exemplary. Really comfortable, quiet lounges with log fires and a beautiful garden for strolling round when the weather permitted. The artwork is varied and wonderful to look. The staff couldn't be more helpful and efficient. I really couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2011,01,19
200,Excellent Stay,"Classy, Elegant  and wonderfull stay. we went to Dublin for a vacation and decided to stay at the Merrion. It was a great choice we made. Rooms are fantastic, the staff is ok but nice. the prices are a bit high, but for havin no problems at all, we don't mind. I would suggest this hotel without any any doubt.",5,2011,01,19
200,Great Service,"We had a lovely stay at the Merrion and the service was excellent.  However, I personally felt that the hotel was ready for some refurbishment.  We were upgraded from a queen to a kingsized room that overlooked the gardens, but we were completely overlooked by an office block that was occupied.  I called to complain and we were changed to a room in the main house which was lovely, all be it a little old fashioned.  We ate in the cellar restaurant and the food and service was excellent.  The breakfast was also amazing and the attention to detail second to none.  We used the gym which was a bit small and old but had everything you needed, the pool was nice, a little dark and old fashioned, the steam room didn't appear too clean.  Overall, I think the hotel is very relaxing and the service and attention to detail second to none.  I cant say I will be going back as I didnt think much of Dublin itself, but the hotel made our stay.",4,2011,01,18
200,"Excellent, would recommend without a doubt.","I used this hotel on my first visit to Dublin, very impressed with the service and friendly staff who are all genuinely pleased to help. Rooms are very impressive and quite, all facilities catered for and free Wifi.

The food is excellent in both the restaurant and Cellar Bar. I have not used the spa facilities yet even though I have been back 3 times on business.",5,2011,01,14
200,Wonderful...,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights as a gift for our birthdays and what a gift to get!  We managed to check in early before enjoying a lovely lunch in their cellar restaurant.  All staff in the hotel were very friendly and happy to help, unobtrusive but very attentive.  We dined in restaurant Patrick Guilbald which was the highlight of our trip.  We also ordered their art afternoon tea to eat in our room which was amazing!  Breakfast was also lovely, though overpriced.  The only fault would be that it was really expensive and as there was no tea or coffee making facilities in our room, a pot of tea for 2 came to a total of 17 Euros!!!! The cocktail bar in the hotel was pleasant though the bartender could do with some more training!   Overall a great surprise and a total luxury.",5,2011,01,10
200,Fabulous first class hotel,"Beautiful hotel, charming bar, wonderful food but, most of all, excellent service.  Will absolutely stay here in the future when I return to beautiful Dublin.",5,2011,01,06
200,This is a classy 5 star hotel in a superb location,You have to experience this hotel for yourself to understand it's elegance and class.,5,2010,12,04
200,wonderful friendly service,"I stayed with 5 friends at this hotel during the first weekend in November. I picked it because of the recommendations on TripAdvisor. The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent . Sitting down in the evening on the very comfortable sofas in front of the roaring fires with a few drinks was the highlight of the day. The hotel is so close to the shopping  ,sights and theatres yet it is very quiet at night, We would certainly go again,
Rosemary Manchester",5,2010,11,27
200,Tired and cold,"This hotel is not worthy of 5 stars. The rooms are very tired, small and have low ceilings. Our air-conditioning unit did not provide any heat, but managed to emit a dripping sound the entire time we were there. The curtains and furniture in the room were stained and effectively ""unmodernised"". 

To get to the rooms we were allocated, (we tried to move to rooms in the main house but it was full) you have to walk through the only two reception rooms in the place (very disruptive if you are sitting there) and then out through a freezing cold glass box corridor to the ""garden' wing.

Admittedly, the staff are good, and the service in the reception rooms is fine. Although having only one log smouldering in each fireplace is a bit pointless. Unfortunately, the Merrion's competitors in a troubled Ireland are no longed offering a better experience, except maybe the Four Seasons.",3,2010,11,23
200,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at The Merrrion Hotel for a short weekend break in November.  The location is superb!  We arrived early and reception allowed us to check in our room at 7:45 a.m.  The room was large for European standards with an extremely large bathroom.  The smell of peat fires burning in the fireplaces was lovely.  We had some drinks and snacks at the warm and cosy Cellar Bar which where service was very attentive.  We did not use the indoor pool, however, it looked wonderful.  Would not stay anywhere else next time we are in Dublin.",5,2010,11,22
200,Exquisite,"The staff and service at the Merrion are the best I've come across in all my years of both business and leisure travel.  The food is fantastic, the pub warm and welcoming, our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable.   If you have an opportunity to stay at the Merrion, take some time to enjoy their extensive art collection.  My favorite was the James Joyce Ulysses sundial in the garden.  If time permits, the Art Tea was also very enjoyable.

An unsung hero in this hotel is the housekeeping staff.  They did a fantastic job organizing all of the odds and ends left around the room, provided ample bath amenities each day and the turn down service included bottled water on the night stands and slippers next to the bed. 

The only issue we had was with wi-fi access.  The hotel uses a service provider that allows a single device per room wi-fi connection.  The staff attended to this as best they could but it took about 30 minutes to resolve.  In a hotel as fabulous as the Merrion, this is a detail that needs attention.  I would think most business travelers have a laptop and a blackberry and that most couples have multiple phones.  Internet access should be seamless.",5,2010,11,16
200,Fabulous!,"What a lovely place. It's not cheap, but the value for money is very good. Staff are super friendly and come across genuine.  Spa, Gym, Pool all really nice and comfy. Our room was perfect facing the garden. It was quiet and spacious. Super bathroom all done with great care and lovely little touches. We would not hesitate to go back there. And after all. If it's good enough for Michael Parkinson (spotted him in the launch), it's good enough for us.",5,2010,11,09
200,Genuine hospitality,"My wife and I really enjoyed our extended weekend break at this lovely hotel. The room was filled with warmth - both colours and fabrics. The spa and pool area, the same. The lasting impression however was the staff - genuine, we felt that they really wanted our stay to be memorable.",5,2010,11,08
200,Great service but 3 nights of poor sleep quality!!,"I booked the Merrion for a week whilst on business in Dublin, my selection was as a result of some great reviews from this site however the hotel failed to meet my expectation and as a result of a couple of nights with very poor sleep I left early.
My room, 330,  was situated in the garden wing on the third floor, the room was nice but nothing special. When I arrived the room was far very warm so I turned on the rather decrepit air conditioning, left my bags and went for something to eat, on my return I managed to fall asleep with the air conditioning on, I guess more out of tiredness due to a long day.
My second night was much the same but i left the air conditioning on all day in the hope that this would cure the problem, on my turned I turned off the air conditioning, but awoke some time later due to the rising heat and was forced to turn it on again. I awoke tired due to a disrupted night.
My third night was even worse, I struggled to sleep because of the heat and noise of the fan and awoke exhausted, I complained to reception that morning and checked out later that afternoon, a day early, as i couldnt face another night of disruption.
The hotel is nice and the staff do give excellent service but overall I dont think this hotel warrants its ranking on tripadvisor and as a result I will not return. I recently stayed at the Westbury and also the Brooks hotel, I will favour either of these in future.",3,2010,11,05
200,Stayed to attend wedding,"Treated like Royals, Staff were great, polite, respectful, and helpful, all hotel staff country wide should treat guests the way staff do in the Merrion hotel. Top Class hotel, clean and professional yet the staff were extremely friendly. A little on the expensive side but you must expect that considering the location. The food was great, even though we both have restricted diets the staff had no problem attending to our needs. You certainly get what you pay for.",5,2010,11,04
200,Just Superb,"There's almost nothing more to say. This is the best hotel, best food and best service we've experienced anywhere. The breakfasts and the lounges are the most noteworthy, and the refreshing decent length pool the most relaxing, and the provision of umbrellas whenever we left the hotel the most thoughtful.

The only negative was my own fault - I didn't read the small print about the 3% charge associated with paying in sterling! I should have known never to accept such a tempting ""you'd like to pay in Sterling?"" offer.

I heartily recommend a few days at The Merrion.",5,2010,11,02
200,A perfect experience in all respects,"The Merion has to be one of Dublin's most cherished hotels. It contains all the old world charm one would expect from a hotel whose buildings are so steeped in history. The service and attention to detail we experienced was of the highest level, a factor not often seen in other 5 star hotels which concentrate more on appearances as opposed to substance. We would highly recommend this hotel to any visitors to Dublin.",5,2010,11,01
200,Unbelievably good - again!,"I have previously uploaded a very positive review of The Merrion Hotel to Trip Advisor and, having just returned from another two night stay, felt it only right to review once again.

This hotel again exceeded my every expectation (again!). Check-in staff were friendly and efficient, and our bags arrived at our room within two minutes of us entering it. The door men were courteous and professional, and always welcoming. Tips were gratefully received, and seemed genuinely unexpected. The drawing rooms, with the wonderful art work and peat fires, were so inviting, as was the Number 23 bar. The table service breakfast was lovely, as indeed it was on our previous visit. A wobbly table was fixed without asking by the attentive and friendly staff.

I should that Wi-fi is now free, in contrast to a previous review. It's also very simple to set up, and just needs re-logged in every 24 hours.

The cellar bar has a great atmosphere at the weekend, and the food was exceptional. Would recommend Hugo's for dinner, though it's a wine only restaurant, so beer lovers beware!

The spa was, I'm assured, absolutely wonderful. It certainly made for a very restful nights sleep for my partner!

There's really no need to totally rehash my previous, entirely positive review, so I shall end with this. Although expensive - cripplingly so, at times, at 6.50 euro for an Americano! - the hotel makes you feel so special that you'll return again and again. Every walk through the drawing rooms, every drink in the bar, every encounter with staff, is a wonderful occasion in and of itself. I hope to return again very soon.",5,2010,10,31
200,Staff will not stop until you are happy--rare indeed.,"This hotel is one of The Leading Hotel of the World group, but does not have the sometimes inbred ""too too"" feel. The staff quickly remembers your name on sight and the concierge and front desk staff are relentless in attempting to make your plans work!
If there is a downside, perhaps that attitude can go a tad too far--I had to move after extending my stay because someone had requested it in particular and by heavens they got it!
Not a bad downside to have.",5,2010,10,26
200,Best  5* Hotel in Dublin City Centre,"Understated luxury is the keynote in an elegant Georgian setting. All staff are impeccable , extremely attentive and friendly, and the service outstanding. Car whisked away at the entrance for parking , bags quiety taken to our room. We had a 'Garden view' room with kingsize bed-really nice. Top fittings and bathroom toiletries as one would expect.Half bottle of Baileys Irish cream and  handmade chocolates chocolates awaited us in the room.

Didnot use the spa, treatments or pool-but these looked fantastic too!

Spent time in the elegant bar on the Ground floor- comfy, crackling fires etc. We had a late, 'full Irish breakfast ' the next morning-cooked to perfection;freshly squeezed oranges etc. Lovely, lovely hotel.",5,2010,10,26
200,Excellent quality but expensive,"Stayed with my wife from 14 to 17 Oct 2010 in a garden room which only had a view of an outside street. The room was pleasant enough with a comfortable bed.
As it was our 25th anniversary, the Hotel gave us a butter cream fancy cake in our room on arrival!
The Hotel is elegant and regal with a fabulous swimming pool. But, for this, you pay a premium and to have dined there, we would have needed 5 balls to have come up on the lottery to cover the bill!",4,2010,10,24
200,"Excellent hotel, great location","Very welcoming hotel, not at all stuffy for a 5 star with very friendly and helpful staff. We had a room at the back overlooking the garden, which was very peaceful and quiet. Rooms are large and comfortable with all the facilities you would expect (although I personally find marble bathrooms a little old-fashioned). The drawing room is a lovely place to relax and have a drink, grand surroundings, very atmospheric and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent, particularly the pancakes - make sure you get up early enough to enjoy breakfast to the full! Great location in the centre of Dublin, all the sights are on your doorstep.",5,2010,10,22
200,Excellent Service and Care,"It was my first anniversary and staying overnight was a surprise. The relationship manager was kind enough to play along and showed us the entire hotel while telling the history and then showed us to the room and my wife was thrilled. This type of personalized service was simply great and made our day.

I had booked a very afffordable package online which included 3 course dinner for two, best room and a simply amazing breakfast.",5,2010,10,21
200,Luxury and great service but at the right price.,"As any Dublin taxi driver or tour bus driver will inform you, ""The Merrion"" is one of the iconic hotels in the city, so no surprise that the luxury ( and it really is luxury) commands a fair price. 
We stayed here from 11th-15th October for a splendid surprise splurge occasion organised by my partner for me (God bless her!), and we were allocated a perfect room in the rearmost section of the hotel overlooking the gardens and a statue of Yeats. This afforded us a quiet setting with sleep never a problem due in no small part to the terrific bed. 
We made use of the Cellar Bar, Cellar Restaurant, and Tethra Spa & Pool and all were excellent. 
Of particular note were: 
Staff - friendly, informative, professional, personable - across the board, from the doormen, waiters, waitresses, and chambermaids through to reception and management.
Food: Excellent breakfast selection, I recommend the Full Irish, and whilst  the Cellar Restaurant has a great menu, try the fish & chips in the Cellar Bar  - understood to have quite a cult following! 
Location: Directly opposite the Taoiseach Offices I imagine the hotel must see many of the political great & good as guests, but this shouldn't put you off.  Tour buses pass right by so travel into the centre for the foot-sore is so easy, not that the distance is too daunting anyway, and the journey passes by St Stephen Green, and there's so much in walking distance. 
We would certainly love to return, and would recommend it without hesitation.",5,2010,10,16
200,Elegance and Luxury,"Myself and my husband celebrated our wedding anniversary at the hotel, our room was absolutely fabulous and comfortable, and the staff were as friendly and helpful as always.  We had a gorgeous lunch at the great Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.  The drawing rooms had a great atmosphere with all the real fires lighting where we had some nice cocktails in Bar No23.  We could not fault the hotel at all and cannot wait to go back!  Best club sandwich in Dublin!",5,2010,10,13
200,Excellent hotel - the staff are wonderful,"Spent a night there at the weekend with my partner.  Great from moment of arrival - where our car was parked for us, to the receptionist...the nicest, friendliest I have ever encountered (I think she is french?) - all the staff were wonderful.  We got upgraded slightly to the main house which is more expensive than courtyard I think.  Room was nice, huge bed, nice toiletries.  As earlier mentioned the hotel has a wonderful art collection - nearly better than the Hugh Lane Gallery we visited, in which a lot of rooms were closed due to staff shortages!  Would recommend this hotel, offering good deals on their website at the moment.  Main advantages, cozy but not too posh, wonderful staff, location and artwork.",5,2010,10,11
200,Great Hotel in Dublin,Just returned from a week's stay in Ireland . The Merrion is centrally located to shops and restaurants . The rooms are quite nicely appointed . The breakfast was terrific and the gardens at the hotel are beautiful . The front desk staff were extremly helpful and left no stone unturned . We would definetly return to the Merrion .,5,2010,10,10
200,Lovely stay,The Merrion's location is great - close proximity to everything but on a quieter road.  I had a room overlooking the courtyard which provided both a nice view and an absence of street noise.  It was great to be able to open the French doors and to enjoy the fresh air without noise. The room itself was nicely decorated and a good side.  The bathroom was huge.  The staff were friendly and helpful and service was good.,5,2010,10,09
200,"Comfortable, but disappointed by Service","The hotel was in a great central location, comfortable and clean. The pool/gym was very nice and always empty. 

I was very disappointed with the staff - they were all quite rude, insincere and very unhelpful. I think the 5* had gone to their heads – as they were all little pretentious. Most of the guests were pretty rude too. We certainly weren’t made to feel very welcome.

I ordered room service for breakfast - the menu quoted 6 euros (for eggs) plus a service charge – when the bill came they had charged a total of 24 euros (so 18 euro service charge – a complete rip off!) suffice to say I didn’t order any more room service!.",3,2010,10,05
200,Favourite hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion is the best of the top hotels in Dublin in my opinion. Great location, nice warm feel to the drawing room, the smell of real fires, cosy little bar and nice spacious rooms.  Staff provide great service.  If you Dublin and not sure where to stay The Merrion is the place that I would recommend ever time.",5,2010,10,05
200,2nd time and still the best!!,"Can't rave enough about this hotel, had been hoping to get back there and finally managed it in July. We availed of the offer that included dinner in Guilbaud's and it was truly an amazing dining experience there. I was afraid the restaurant might be too stuffy but the staff couldn't have been nicer and considering my husband was a vegetarian they had a challenge set. It was just amazing from start to finish, each course was a surprise, they just asked us what we didn't like to eat and they planned the menu from there. Would highly recommedend this deal, think we paid 300 in total, obviously your wine is extra. 
The hotel itself is just lovely, location superb, staff are very helpful and friendly and breakfast was gorgeous. Can't wait for the next time we treat ourselves!!",5,2010,10,04
200,If only Wi-fi were accessible would have been perfection,"We spent three nights here last week. Everything was impeccable. Service attentive and pleasant- love bedside linen mats at bedtime.  Rooms homey and comfortable - we were in a large room in the main building with comfy sitting area.  The bathroom large but double vanities would be nice. 
Our only complaint was that in room Wifi had to be re-logged in every 24 hrs. And then only one user per room. The front desk provided a code for a second user but setting that up was like trying to break into Fort Knox!  Needs some work. 
Definitely a world class hotel. As long as the recession lasts, it's pretty good value.",4,2010,10,03
200,Numero Uno-Trip Advisor was right!,"This is a super hotel and was chosen because it is very highly rated on Trip Advisor.  This was an excellent choice as the hotel facilities, staff, bedrooms and food are all to a very high standard and it is an excellent place to stay with the bedrooms looking out over a very nice quiet landscaped courtyard area.

An additional bonus is the high quality art of different types throughout the hotel and reading about it in the booklet in the hotel room is most interesting and fascinating.

This is definitely a most lovely place to stay and warrants the rating given by loyal Trip Adviser fans including myself",5,2010,09,29
200,Perfection,"What a wonderful hotel.  Unparalleled service.  Lovely room.  Evening turndown service was a treat.  Great peat fires in the drawing rooms.  Truly central location, but on a peaceful street.  Very, very special place.  Didn't want to leave.  Already planning my return.",5,2010,09,28
200,lovely hotel excellent staff,"Just back from a weekend stay at the Merion. In the past have stayed at the Shelbourne, but decided to give The Merrion a try.
The staff are exceptional, from the front door to the housekeeping, they couldnt be better.
We had a little problem in The Cellar Restaurant, however it was handled very professionally and quickly ,so many thanks for that.
Our room was in the main house and was lovely and big for 3 of us, the bathroom was a little small but spotless and had everything we needed ,however I think all 5 star hotels should have double sinks!!!!... All in all a lovely stay great location we will be back.",5,2010,09,28
200,Perfection in Dublin,"Although it has 142 rooms and suites, The Merrion feels much smaller - on par with a high end boutique hotel. It does not have the hustle-bustle that many others do. There are two elegant and sedate drawing rooms and a very nice bar. The Cellar Restaurant was very good for dinner and breakfast. We also dined at a nearby restaurant, The Pig's Ear, which was excellent. 
We stayed in the main part of the hotel, not the garden wing. The room was very large with a sitting area and fire place and a beautiful bathroom. Toiletries were great as well! Although we were on the street side of the hotel, the triple glazing on the windows abated any noise. The courtyard garden was lovely but we did see any of the guest rooms in the garden wing. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Merrion and would love to return some day.",5,2010,09,27
200,"Wow, what a special hotel......","This was our first time to stay in The Merrion but have stayed in many of the other 5 star Dublin hotels. From arrival to departure we had a truely wonderful experience! the bricks and mortar are like any of the other 5 star hotels, what sets this hotel apart is the staff, amazingly the doormen, concierge, receptionists and restaurant staff at breakfast were ALL friendly and warm, yet efficient and professional, going that extra bit to make our stay special and memorable.
We will definitely be back and would unreservedly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to arrange a special stay in Dublin.As a departing gesture our car was brought to the front door fully valeted with compliments of the team! That gesture topped the experience and prompted me to take time to do this review!",5,2010,09,26
200,Couldn't fault it!,"We arrived to a lovely surprise upgrade.  The junior suite was gorgeous.  Very comfortable.  The staff couldnt have been nicer or more helpful.   Full Irish breakfast in bed was the best part!  It was beautifully served and warm.  We will definitely be back.
The only disappointment was that we wanted to eat at the",5,2010,09,22
200,Nice Hotel,"The Merrion is lovely, but it is a little tired in places for a 5 star hotel. The common rooms  really are superb and the art work on the walls is stunning, but our bedroom (standard Garden Wing) was, whilst being immaculately clean and perfectly comfortable, starting to look slightly past it. I certainly didn't open the door and find my jaw dropping. 
Likewise, the pool and spa area could probably do with a bit of updating but remain very nice facilities. The breakfast buffet was good; the cooked items rather bland. Nonetheless, the hotel is very pleasant, the staff were without exception absolutely excellent and the location is pretty perfect for exploring Dublin. I would be happy to go back, but next time I'm in Dublin I think I would try one of the other hotels to compare.",4,2010,09,20
200,A great hotel with great staff,"Stayed recently and had a fab time, staff are true pros nothing is to much trouble, if we were to be critical of anything it would be our room which while well above the norm felt dated but that said can't wAit to go again.",5,2010,09,19
200,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed for 5 nights at the Merrion in early September and it was a wonderful stay.  We had booked a Deluxe King in the main house and were upgraded to a Junior Suite.

The hotel is quite traditional in style and beautifully done.  The gardens between the main house and the other wing are beautiful and we walked through them multiple times just because they were so pretty and peaceful.  The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to most attractions.  We loved the Cellar Restaurant (where breakfast is served) and particularly liked the Cellar Bar; the food and ambiance in both were great.  We had breakfast through room service one day and that was fabulous as well.  We also used the spa and obviously enjoyed it as we made a second round of appointments almost immediately.

Prior reviews have indicated that the staff is snobby and we don’t agree.  They are professional, politely friendly and always happy to help.  The hotel went so far as to leave cupcakes and a balloon in our room on my birthday.  They really went the extra mile which was very thoughtful.

Our only complaint was that our room was on the second floor facing the front of the hotel and was right over the main entrance door.  As a result, it was rather loud at times.  However, we did ask the front desk if other rooms were available.  They were more than happy to offer another room and even offered to move our things.  Ultimately we were lazy and stayed, primarily because we liked the room we had better than the alternative.
We stayed in 5 hotels during this trip in Ireland, Scotland and England and though all were wonderful, upon reflection, we think the Merrion was the best taking all things into account.

We definitely recommend the Merrion and will stay there again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2010,09,17
200,run out of superlatives,"This hotel exceeds nearly every review I read.For warmth,service,attention to detail,old world charm combined with modernity it has to be experienced to be believed.The ethos of the staff from reception to chambermaid via bar service to the spa is that the guest has a right to the best of service at all times,combined with efficiency and Irish charm.PLEASE open a similar hotel in London-there are plenty of Georgian Sqaures!!!Il loved my stay and regreeted it was not longer than a w/e-shall definetly return",5,2010,09,13
200,WOW,"My boyfriend and I always treat ourselves to some fine dining on our birthdays. My boyfriend is a chef so he really wanted to eat in the 2 star michelan star restuarant Patrick Gubuilds ( I know more than likley that is spelt wrong) 
We arrived at the Merrion and were just amazed from the minute we arrived in the lobby. We had cocktails to start in the bar and I have never experienced service so good. Really the staff do not miss a thing and look after your every need without being intrusive.
We were called for dinner and went into the restaurant which was amazing, very  tastefully decorated (Think a modern Gentlemans club). We were showed to our seats and we decided to choose a few items from each course ( greedy I know but we just wanted to taste everything) ever single item on the menu looked fab and It was so hard to choose, we had seafood to start, I really cannot write down in words how good it was, re had a fresh pea raviolli which was so fresh and just melted in your mouth. I had the Lamb for main and Shane had the Fillet of beef. I was a little dissapointed that I did not choose the beef, How will i discribe the beef? Well firstly you did not need a steak knife to eat this steak it was so soft and the flavour was just fantastic, Lamb was really nice to but after I tasted the beef it really did not compare. We had so many diffeent petit fours and Amuse Bouche and dessert that I could go on forever. We had a lovely Sommelier who gave is a wine to go with each item on the menu, we do not know much about wine but wanted to experince everyhting and the wines really added to the meal. The staff were so lovely, I remeber at one stage I  excused myslef from the table and they pulled out my chair for me, opened doors for me, folded my napkin for me for when I returned. I have never felt like more of a VIP on my life. Some people may not like this style of service but it was right up my street. I am so sick of bad service in Irish restaurants so I was so impressed by the way they look after their clients. And the best thing is it did not break the bank!!!",5,2010,09,10
200,Excellent but ..,"Overall very nice and would come back.  We arrived early and were able to tAke a shower and clean up in the spa before getting the room.  Everything very nice throughout our 3 day stay except one day ""forgot"" to clean up our room.  After a busy dAy of sightseeing had to go to the bar (Guiness) to wait for our room to be cleaned (4pm).  Manager gave us some free cupcakes - very good.  It made an otherwise excellent experience in a beautiful location somewhat average.",3,2010,09,07
200,Afternoon tea at the Merrion,"I'm a big fan of afternoon tea at posh hotels.  The Merrion is so posh that there's no sign outside apart from a couple of very discreet, very shiny brass plaques and I nearly missed it.  All the staff, from the porters who greet you inside the front door through to reception staff and waiters, are friendly without being obsequious.  My brolly was stored away and I was shown through to the drawing room where my reserved table awaited.

The hotel currently serves 'The Art Tea' with elements of the food inspired by the hotels impressive art collection.  You have a choice of dozens of teas and coffee and the option of a glass of champage.  The basic tea is 38 euros, the cheapest champagne option 55 euros.  I had jasmine tea and a glass of fizz alongside a 3-tier cake stand of sandwiches, cakes and fresh scones with jam, clotted cream and divine home made lemon curd.  Another sign of the hotel's poshness is that I was never allowed to top up my teacup myself. 

The food was pretty and delicious but there were too many sweet offerings and not enough savoury for me: only four tiny sandwiches (smoked salmon on soda bread, chicken pesto in white, egg mayo in a bridge roll and cream cheese and cucumber in white) against three scones, fruit cake, two types of battenburg, lemon cake and three 'pastries' drawn from the artworks.  However, the leftovers were offered as a takeaway and returned in a very pretty Merrion bag.  The friends I visited later were very pleased!

A pleasant experience.",4,2010,09,01
200,"Forget the rest, THE best hotel in town","Be careful where you book in Dublin. Some hotels are a short walk into the City Centre. Alright if you're in sunny Barcelona but this is Dublin, expect it to rain. I'm a native, I should know! Avoid the Dylan (terrrible service) and the Four Seasons (overpriced). Nowhere matches the Merrion for a unique Dublin experience. Beautiful Georgian architecture, peat fires (even in the summer!), great staff and superb location make the Merrion top of everyone's list. As with all 5 stars, this part of the market is hurting so last minute bargains are available. Do yourself a favour, check out the rates and treat yourself to stay here.",5,2010,08,31
200,"Lovely, elegant hotel","We had a one night stay in The Merrion hotel recently. The package we booked was a 1 night B&B with one evening meal. 
Our car was taken from us on arrival – made us feel like royalty, and our check in went smoothly and quickly. Staff at front desk were very nice and helpful.
On walking through the hotel on the way to our room, we were in awe at the amazing sitting rooms and art. The garden is lovely and very unexpected, with a cozy seating area outside to enjoy it.
Our room was in the Garden wing and was very well presented. The bathroom was huge, with a shower and bath. The only thing that disappointed us was the view of a red brick wall with graffiti scrawled across it. The website promises a ‘magnificent city view’ so don’t be let down if you get this view instead! 
Some drinks in the Cellar bar proved to be lovely. The atmosphere and the design is unique and makes for a lovely relaxing evening.
We had dinner in the Cellar Restaurant as part of our ‘5 star Steal’ package. We were a little disappointed with the lack of choice on the menu we received, especially for starters and desserts. The main course was lovely and tasty. The Cellar Restaurant itself is a nice room and the staff are very attentive and helpful, constantly enquiring if they can do anything for you or get you anything else.
Breakfast the next morning was again in the Cellar Restaurant and this was a real treat. Lovely cooked to order breakfast with an amazing selection of muffins, pastries, cereals etc from the buffet. Again staff were lovely, always enquiring if we needed anything else.
Checkout went smoothly but we had to wait approximately 25 minutes for our car to be delivered. But on the plus side, when it was finally returned the member of staff had washed it for us!
Overall, posh hotel lives up to its name and reviews, but if you are staying in the cheaper rooms be prepared for no view!!!",4,2010,08,31
200,sheer bliss,"we stayed for 1 night at this hotel last saturday. I have only good things to say about the place. Arriving early at hotel staff were more than professional and friendly. Our room was in the main building and what a room, high ceilings,fantastic windows and window dressings, dressing room, very large bathroom...heaven.
As to the art work throughout the hotel it is stunning. We had dinner in Patrick Guilbauld's that evening and once again it was flawless.
Breakfast next morning served in the Cellar restaurant was probably the best buffet breakfast i have had. Yes, its an expensive hotel but worth every penny and i cant wait to go back.",5,2010,08,29
200,A classic hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel has many amenities but by far the best was the staff. Everyone from the front desk, to the concierge to the wait staff for tea were absolutely fabulous. We were traveling with our 8 month old for the first time and chose this hotel because of the reviews and were not disappointed. They were able to accommodate us very early after a long flight from the states and even upgraded us to a suite when we returned at the end of our trip. The old style elegance and modern art throughout the hotel and gardens just added to a wonderful stay.",5,2010,08,25
200,Very enjoyable stay.,"Very nice stay at the Merrion.  Terrific location, good staff, good rooms, nice restaurants.  Would especially recommend for business as it's quiet and unfussy.  Only downfall was truly lousy room service - definitely make the effort to enjoy the fabulous restaurants instead of staying in your room!",4,2010,08,24
200,Superb,"If you can stretch to staying here when you are in Dublin, do so. It is incomparable with other Dublin hotels.

Don't overlook the excellent hotel restaurant.

This was the last splurge after the property crash when I booked my wife in here after she had given birth to our last child. The staff were incredibly accommodating considering she had a 1 day old baby with her!",5,2010,08,19
200,"family friendly, with top class service","Stayed overnight here on a warm July day - would have stayed longer if our schedule allowed. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we pulled up at the front door, tired from our long drive from the coast. Reading some of the other recent reviews, we did not experience either snobbishness nor overcrowded/empty public areas that others encountered - not even when the doorman had to pick up piles of detritus-filled plastic bags that the car ends up with on long road trips! The lounges are beautiful and elegant, and if it isn't raining heavily, all guests should take a little walk in the courtyard gardens - a little piece of gorgeous landscaped serenity in the bustling city.

They gave us a large room in the Main Wing - they didn't mention this but I think it may have been an upgrade as it seemed a little larger than described when I booked. Even when my child was overexcited or had tantrums from being tired, they were patient and smiley and never looked disapproving. The room was very comfortable, airconditioned, beautifully furnished and quiet - we slept like logs! 

A brilliant plus (never seen in many 5 star or other hotels) is that the breakfast in your package can be served in your room at ANY time without extra charge - most others insist you trek down to the dining room even if you don't feel up to it.  The breakfast was delicious with a huge choice of items. We didn't have time to go to the pool but I was impressed that they allowed children in it. 

Dining at the Cellar restaurant was wonderful. They had colouring sets for my child and  kindly let us share our main courses (when I couldn't finish mine) with our friend and even giving him an extra portion of starter to go with his wine! Felt like you were dining in your friend's home - if your friend has starched linen and silver service! I agree there are many staff members who are European who are not native English speakers but this is actually a common situation in many 5 star hotels nowadays as EU workers move about freely to train and become hoteliers. (I actually think they were more easy going and enthusiastic than in many hotels staffed by locals where we sometimes encounter the attitude ""if you don't like how we do things in our culture and adhere to it, don't bother to visit our city"".)

The doormen were brilliant, helping us with directions to drive out of town and getting us taxis. The reception staff were helpful and efficient throughout. yes, it is not a cheap hotel (hence only 4 stars for value rather than 5) - but I think it is justified. I really couldn't fault anything in this hotel. We stayed here on a busy and packed Christmas Eve several years ago (with no child) and they were just as helpful and friendly then.",5,2010,08,19
200,Total luxury-great service-an escape from the real world.,"1st stay at The Merrion and loved it. We were looking for luxury for a special occassion and it certainly lived up to our expectations.Totally pampered for the weekend. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. Great attention to detail, great service and great food. We didn't want to leave.",5,2010,08,18
200,"Wonderful venue, fully attentive and relaxed service, brilliant people all around!","Family trip, 3 generations - just wonderful from arrival to departure.  Everyone felt superbly well taken care of all the way through - the lounges were a special treat with warm serives and delicious late night sandwiches after the theatre.  Wonderul - and can't wait until the next trip",5,2010,08,18
200,Quite possibly the world's most snobbish hotel,"During our tour of Ireland, my husband and I spent three nights at The Merrion in Dublin to conclude our vacation.  

First, the hotel is a series of historical Georgian townhomes which have been restored. The exterior and interior are understated elegance. I booked just a standard room in the Garden Wing with a ""street view."" The room was very disappointing and did not distinguish itself from any other chain hotel, save the marble bathroom which was large by European standards. The view was of a brick-walled building and the ""street view"" was a narrow alley running between. The size of the room was very small and the decor was boringly average, not 5-star. Did I mention how cramped the room was with its one small window overlooking a brick wall that let in no light? The staff member who led us to our room even mocked the view and sarcastically told us, ""You won't be getting a view. The standard rooms in this addition are like that.""

But I could have forgiven the room if my stay there had been pleasurable. The vast majority of staff are not Irish and I found them to be the rudest, least helpful staff I have ever encountered. If you are not a guest in one of the most expensive suites, expect complete condescension from the imported staff. Upon check-out, I was trying to explain a problem we had with being woken up several times by the room next door and the front desk clerk interrupted me mid-sentence and refused to allow me to speak. Then in his poor grasp of English, he asked me if we wanted to check-out the room next door and pay for their stay. (Yes, of course, that was my whole point in complaining about the disruptions next door, in order to pay them for keeping me up most of the night....insanity!)

This hotel also has a dress code, which wasn't an issue for me. I did take issue, however, for the couple of times I walked through the lobby with my camera strapped around my neck and got looked up-and-down by staff members with disgusted looks. Does it help to say that it is an expensive Canon dSLR? I did quite a bit of walking and sightseeing while in Dublin and had to pass through the lobby on the way to my room with my camera in tow and that was literally frowned upon.

The public rooms in the Main House are ghastly quiet. Ordinarily, a quiet hotel is a plus, but The Merrion just felt dead and oppressed. No one looked happy, neither the patrons nor the staff.

As our taxi driver drove us to the airport, I asked him his impressions of The Merrion and he had nothing favorable to say about the staff working there and how they treated him and other taxi drivers. 

Staying at The Merrion was the worst part of my trip to Ireland. There was nothing 5-star about my accommodations or experience. The staff was pretentious and unlike anything I have ever experienced at a nicer hotel. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and I would never choose to stay here again.",1,2010,08,14
200,My favorite hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion is simply the best. It's beautifully decorated, wonderful service, great food, perfect location. I've stayed here 3 times and always look forward to a trip back.",5,2010,08,13
200,Best hotel I stayed in for a long time,"An absolutely fantastic hotel. The service is amazing - very attentative and friendly, without being insistant. 

The location is great, there are plenty of nice bars and restaurants around the corner. But you might want to eat in you room - I have never had this good room service before!

The bar is also very pleasant with a fireplace and friendly staff and a good drink menu, and you can also sit in the garden.

The fitness centre is not great, but still OK - and there is a pool as well.

The romms are not the most modern ones, but still very nice. The cleaning is perfect.

I love this place!",5,2010,08,12
200,"Excellent, attentive service","Stayed 2 nights. From the front door to the hotel room and dinner in The Vault (think that's the name) all was excellent. Very attentive service. Peaceful in the city. I'd avoid the breakfast downstairs as it's the one meal overpriced and not up to quality of food elsewhere in hotel. Small cafe next door serves full b'fast for about 6 Euros.
Lunch at French restaurant (part of hotel) is excellent. And a great art collection in hotel",5,2010,08,11
200,Top Class Service,"We stayed in The Merrion on the Bank Holiday weekend. We received a gift voucher from a friend as a present for a stay in the hotel and it is rated as one of the top hotels in Dublin. It was a great gift choice. As a native of this beautiful city it is nice to see it from a tourists view occasionally. The 17th Century original buildings are very well decorated and furnished with a very small number of flaws. The whole Hotel is like a haven of Relaxation in the centre of a noisy city. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful which you expect from a Hotel of this class but don't always receive. 

Our room was fantastic and was large with big lounging chairs and the Breakfast in the room was well worth the experience. Everything you need is in the room and if think of something that is not there it says the staff will get it for you. There is a great selection of  restaurants nearby and as mentioned in a previous post they are all offering competitive deals as Dublin is quite expensive. 

This is a fantastic Hotel with great attention to detail and I would definitely recommend it and I will be back.",5,2010,08,06
200,Beautiful all-round.,"This is one great hotel and I would reccomend it to any of my friends, the staff are great and the first person you meet makes you feel so at home.",5,2010,08,05
200,Service is above and beyond...,"What sets the Merrion apart from many hotels in its class is the personal service. They really do go above and beyond. For example during a recent stay when I called to have a room service cart removed and the room service attendant asked if there was anything else she could do for me, I jokingly said ""get me the recipe for the red onion compote."" When she came to pick up the cart she gave me her handwritten notes of the conversation she had just had with the chef, setting forth the ingredients and the technique for making this chutney-like relish. Wow. 

Like many older hotels the Merrion could use some upgrades (our tub had a ring around it that probably couldn't be scrubbed out, or years of scrubbing had worn away the finish) but it is an extremely comfortable home-away-from-home with a great deal of charm.",5,2010,08,02
200,My Perfect Hotel,"I stay in quite a few hotels, both for business travel and family travel, and this is one of my favorite hotels in the world.

Here's why:

Classic, non-flashy and high quality decor. I found the furnishings to be perfect in nearly every way. The art collection was the best I have ever witnessed in a hotel and, according to my understanding, is considered a fairly important collection in Ireland.

Service was pitch perfect. The staff were attentive without being intrusive and every request was met with courtesy and fulfilled with efficiency. 

Child friendly. Normally, higher end hotels can be a bit of a drag for children, but the Marrion went out of their way to make sure my children weren't uncomfortable (ages 2 and 5). The hotel provides babysitting service and we used it three times. All three times my children adored the babysitter and my wife and I absolutely loved being able to enjoy a bit of Dublin. The pool is a big bonus for the children, too.

Decent food. There's a Michelin starred restaurant attached, which we didn't try, but is supposed to be phenomenal. The hotel restaurant was the same space for breakfast and dinner, but they did a good job of changing the ambiance. Breakfast was quite good, and they'll allow you to take your included breakfast in your room if you order the night before. We did this several times just to avoid having to wrestle two kids downstairs in the morning. However, a trip to the actual buffet is worth it. The table service at breakfast was a bit slow, but the hotel was full and the restaurant was completely occupied, so I can see how that would happen and it wasn't painful or anything. Dinner in the restaurant was very good, but with so many nice places to eat in Dublin, we only dined in the hotel one time.

A tip: Ireland suffering, as it is, from a terrible economic crisis has resulted in almost every restaurant in the city dropping their prices. There are early bird specials at almost every decent restaurant, and most are running other 2 and 3 course menu specials. This is a great opportunity to stretch out and dine well because I found Dublin and Ireland in general to be quite expensive compared to cities I travel to throughout the world and where I live in Vienna, Austria.

The hotel is a good value. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. I felt like, for the level of service and the quality of the property and furnishings, this hotel provides a good value for the Euro. Sure, it's not inexpensive, but when one spends a considerable amount of money for accommodation, one should feel it was worth the cost and, in the case of the Marrion, I left feeling it was money well spent. So if you can afford the rate here, go for it. I will also note that any hotel of four or five stars in Dublin is fairly expensive, so it's not as if one could choose between paying 100 Euros/night and 260 Euros/night and have relatively equivalent experience.

our room, which was in the new Garden Wing, was big enough, although I wouldn't say it was huge or anything. It had a large King-sized bed, a desk, tall windows looking out into the garden, and a couple of comfortable lounge chairs. There was a large, built-in wardrobe which was the largest I have seen in a hotel room of this size, and the bathroom was white tile, marble and stainless steel. The tub was old, but extremely clean, and the shower worked well (although it sometimes made a loud buzzing sound which was solved by rotating the ""massage"" lever a little bit). The air conditioning worked well, which was great considering it was quite humid during our time there. It was capable of freezing cold and moderate temperatures, which is rare in hotel A/C in Europe (A/C in Europe is usually ineffective or too powerful).

The location is really good. The hotel is very near the main museums of Dublin and a short walk from the long, pedestrianized shopping street of Grafton Street.  The Marrion Square, with a perfect Georgian facade all around, is a couple blocks away and a beautiful, peaceful little park. Saint Stephens Green, with a very nice playground and a lot of beautiful greenery, is pretty much across the street. Taxi ranks are everywhere, but the hotel will summon one whenever you wish. 

Finally, I would absolutely recommend partaking in the art tea (check the hotel's website for details).

My only grumble about the Marrion is that, overall, the food options were quite expensive and overly fussy. Being somewhat stranded, as one can be sometimes with small children, the room service and bar menu were a bit too much for snacks or casual dining. The children's menu was great, however, and my kids devoured their way through that over the course of the 8 days we stayed. It would have been nice if the adult fare on the various menus had an equivalent, less costly and decadent-seeming set of dishes.",5,2010,07,31
200,Luxurious and perfectly located in the city,"We spent 3 nights at the Merrion as the first stop on our vacation in Ireland.  After a long international flight, this was the perfect place to rest and explore Dublin.  We had connecting rooms in the main building.  Our rooms were large and well appointed and our children received welcome gifts and robes and slippers which they appreciated.  Breakfast was a delight and we also enjoyed the Art Tea in the Drawing Room.  It was very easy to walk to great restaurants, shops and the local parks from this Hotel.  The Hop On/Hop Off sightseeing bus stop is right outside the building.  Staff were professional and attentive and Sean at the Concierge's desk was especially helpful.  I am very picky about cleanliness in Hotels as my son suffers from dust allergies, and we were extremely comfortable at the Merrion.  Our rooms were very thoroughly cleaned, even at turndown, so thumbs up to all thte staff members who did such a good job.  I highly recommend the Merrion!",5,2010,07,28
200,Deserving of it's 5 stars! Would love to return,"The Merrion was absolutely flawless. Impeccable service, great location and a beautiful and comfortable room. We booked a deluxe room in the main house and was very pleased with it. It was very large and comfortable with a view of the lovely parliament buildings. The location is fabulous with the ""Hop on and Hop off bus"" nearly right outside the door. The shopping district and St.Stephen's green is within a 5 minute walk and there is a lot to see and do very close by. I would stay at The Merrion again in a heartbeat and would look forward to it very much. This hotel deserves it's 5 star rating in my opinion. P.S. The pool is a nice bonus.",5,2010,07,28
200,Great for a 'bit of posh' in Dublin,"We live in Dublin and wanted somewhere a little posh for a celebration but didn't want the hassle of having to drive anywhere, so the Merrion was our first choice.  We went for the package which included the tasting menu in Guilbauds (€175 per person per night) - this was a good combination for us as if we had gone for a full meal in Guilbauds it could well have cost us €100 per person anyway.

The hotel staff were great.  I was a little wary of the possibility of the staff being over the top, but they very definitely weren't.  We got upgraded on check-in to a huge room facing on to Merrion Row - looking right across to the Department of Finance and Government buildings.  Always remember the value of being in frequent stayers clubs like the Leaders Club.

The room itself was a little spartan - the overall impression was stripped-back rather than sumptuous.  I used to work in a similar Georgian property just around the corner which had been restored and I know how the rooms should have looked.  Not really a complaint about the room, but I guess it could do with a little more character.

Breakfast was great - primarily because I had taken the morning off work, the kids were with their grandparents and we could just sit and relax, read and eat with no pressure on.  One of the better hotel breakfasts I've had.

Another plus - they give a free copy of the Irish Times (a real newspaper . . .) to read and not the other one so frequently shoved under hotel doors.  There was a note on the desk in the room which indicated there was now free wireless - something to do with the end of some contractual obligation to charge.

One odd thing - even Express/Inn type hotels have free tea/coffee in the room.  In the Merrion you have to ask to have a set delivered to your room.  While dinner was winding down in Guilbauds I dropped out to reception and asked them to send up a set - which they did.  It's just odd that it's not in the rooms as standard.

I think we'll be back again next year to celebrate again - definitely worth returning to.",4,2010,07,21
200,I love the Merrion,"The Merrion might be my all time favorite hotel now!  We checked in and were upgraded to the Apsley Suite.  Ramona at the front desk was so great.  The suite was absolutely gorgeous as were all the amenities in our room.  We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks and then the concierge helped us find a great restaurant very close by.  The gardens are so beautiful and I have could have sat out there all day.  
I would only go back to Dublin if I could stay at the Merrion again!",5,2010,07,16
200,Simply outstanding service,"from arrival with the doorman, to the concierge, and the room clerks - they worked hard to ensure that we received their very best efforts at being hospitable. The room was magnificent, the food truly excellent in the Cellar restaurant, and the outside garden bar was a great place to enjoy drinks. Who would have thought a magnificent Magnolia tree grows wonderfully well in Ireland? It is right next to the outside garden drinks area along with many other great plants. great stay for us and I an sure the same awaits you.",5,2010,07,13
200,Heaven in Dublin,"After staying at an AWFUL hotel in noisy Temple Bar - we couldn't have been more thrilled to check into The Merrion!  Beautiful hotel with all of the comforts of home, even had a ""Flat - Iron"" for the girls' hair!  Ramona on the front desk was remarkable help and upgraded one of our rooms to a palatial suite!  Irene in the Spa is an incredible therapist! Concierge staff was amazing, shipped a souvenier umbrella back for me with incredible speed and for only 10 Euro!  This hotel is not to be missed if you want a quality, luxury, relaxing stay.",5,2010,07,12
200,Nice hotel but eat and drink elsewhere!,"Four of us stayed at the Merrion Hotel for 3 nights while on a 9 day tour of Ireland.

First the positives…

The hotel is centrally located in Dublin and is a short walk to almost anything.  The “Hop on Hop Off” bus stops right by the front door so all of Dublin is at your fingertips without the expense of Taxies. The service is excellent.

The hotel is somewhat old but very well maintained. It was created by combining 4 townhouses so getting from one place to another can be an issue. For example, to get from our room to the breakfast room we had to walk down two corridors, take an elevator to the ground floor, walk through the lobby, then through the 2 waiting rooms, outside through the garden (it is covered) and back into the hotel again, down another elevator and you are there.  Not a very big deal unless you have difficulty getting around.   The rooms are large by European standards but the bathroom has a small corner shower that I could not fit in.  The rooms were serviced in an excellent manner.

Dinner was included our first night so we gave it a try. The hotel has two restaurants The Cellar restaurant and the 2 star Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. Our reservation was in the Cellar.  We started with Martini’s (19.5 Euro which is $25 US) which were a rip off, especially when the fixed price dinner was 29.5 Euros!
Two of us ordered steaks and the rare one was cooked well done and sent back. Two of us ordered the fish special after discussing it with the server. We were assured the fish was a “non fishy” clear white fish. When it arrived it was a smelly piece of fish with both dark and white meat, somewhat like a northern US blue fish without the dark meat removed. We both sent it back.   This was not what we expected from a hotel that was very expensive.   They need to close the gap between this and the 2 star restaurant.",3,2010,07,10
200,My favourite Dublin Hotel,This is a lovely hotel tucked away on a quiet street in central Dublin yet only a few steps away from great pubs and restaurants. It is also located across from government buildings in an area steeped in Dublin history. We live in Dublin but stayed here as an anniversary treat and it is just that - a treat. I always liked this hotel to stop in for a drink or great bar food and it is now a favourite for a quick getaway.,5,2010,07,05
200,A home from home,"I have stayed at The Merrion at least 8 times over the last 3 years.  It is simply the best hotel.  When my husband and I walk in we feel it is a home from home.  We are not fancy people, my husband never wears a suit and tie and his idea of dressing up is wearing a long sleeve button down shirt with a clean pair of jeans!, but at The Merrion this is not an issue.  Everyone is treated with courtesy and true regard.  The food is wonderful in all the restaurants and the rooms are spacious and comfortable.  We have been in all types of room and even the standard room is top quality.  The rooms that are in the back my have no view (or even of a brick wall) but they are extremely quiet ensuring a wonderful nights sleep.  To us The Merrion is the top hotel in the world.  We are looking forward to our next trip there in August.",5,2010,07,03
200,Very Nice / Very Stuffy,"I can add my voice to the long list of people who have stayed here and experienced how beautiful this hotel is.  That said, I am NEVER impressed with a hotel that wants to be ""Upper Class (note my lip curled as I speak it) for the sake of it.  We have money, can stay anywhere we wish but see no need to be ""refined"" in a pretentious manner.  Sadly the hotel was full of such people and the staff, to some degree, reinforced this attitude.  When we arrive (in tee shirts and shorts) the look we got from the greeters was one of ""I'm sure they are not checking in.""  I am going to recommend the hotel because I have stayed other places in Dublin and for all its stuffiness it is still the best place to go.  Oh well.

OK, the room was very nice, very clean, very roomy.  The Cellar Restaurant was about as cool a place as I have ever been in.  I simply did not want to leave that cozy place after the meal.",5,2010,06,29
200,Another great stay.,"I have stayed at the Merrionn on numerous occasions and I can hoonestly say that I enjoy comming back. Why thats easy freindley greating little fuss and a great offer ie restaurent michelle star plus their own. I have tried others ""Shelbourne"" but alaways I come back to the Merrion as it ahs no false prententions.",5,2010,06,28
200,First time visit - WOW,"I booked online to stay at The Merrion for a weekend in June, I wanted to be spoilt and relax in a hotel with a spa facility.  This was our first visit to The Merrion and it is just fabulous, it has all you could want and more.  The staff were lovely, very professional but friendly and down to earth, I was worried it might be a bit stuffy but not at all.  The location is great, with it being so central and the added bonus of on site parking.  We had a great weekend and will definitely stay there again.

In summary, great location, food, staff, rooms, what more could you want.... and a SPA..  Enjoy.",5,2010,06,28
200,A 5 star hotel that is 5 star,"From the moment we stepped out of car the level of service was superb.  The doorman took the keys of the car and parked it for us and delivered it back with a complimentary carwash!

Our room was fabulous with a superking bed.  Everything was spotless and the Receptionist gave us a run down of all the facilities.  Her hospitality was warm and charming without going over the top.  We have our dinner in the Cellar Restaurant which was superb and would definitely go there again even just for  lunch if we were in Dublin just for day.  The waitress was very efficient and had great attention to detail without overpowering us.  We had our breakfast in our room and it was delicious.

The location is brilliant as you are just around the corner from Stephens Green and Grafton Street.   I would highly recommend this hotel and would hope to be going back there again.",5,2010,06,24
200,Happy to recommend,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is a very nice place to stay with a good location. The staff is extraordinary friendly, polite and helpful. The interior is charming and the garden in the backyard beautiful.
The breakfast in the beautiful Cellar Restaurant made my day - the staff there is absolutely fantastic, food is very good and the atmosphere is relaxed but courteous, no hurry anywhere. A good start for the day!
The Restaurant Patric Gilbaud on the contrary was a slight disappointment. The staff there was impersonal and food overpriced.
Will definitely come back when in Dublin!",5,2010,06,17
200,Seven Star Steal,"My husband and I stayed in the Merrion on the Seven Star Steal package which was one night B&B with a tasting menu in Patrick Guilbaud's restaurant. This really was a steal at €150 each.  The hotel is great from the moment you drive up and your car is valet parked for you.  Check in is seamless and we were brought directly to our room by a very helpful member of staff, with a mini tour and some helpful information about afternoon tea. breakfast, dinner, bar facilities on the way.  The rooms are a very good size but, after 10 years open, could do with a bit of updating.  However, our room was spotless so a dated decor didn't interfere with our enjoyment too much.  The bathrooms could also do with an update.  All that marble is very dated when compared to more contemporary hotels, granted newer ""shinier"" ones.  We had dinner in Guilbaud's which was fantastic. I haven't enough space here to justify it.  Definitely, the tasting menu is well recommended if the full MIchelin prices are a bit beyond reach, as is in our case!  As a special treat, everyone should go once.  Overall, the staff were a breath of fresh air, so polite and good at their jobs.  We loved it here.",5,2010,06,08
200,Wins every time,"I make a point to stay at the Merrion Hotel during each Dublin visit, after having experimented with some other top hotels in Dublin.  The Merrion wins by far.

I am pleased to report that the Merrion hotel has consistently given us top magic moments, the service is second to none.  

We tasted their ""art"" afternoon tea for the first time and I must say their afternoon tea kills all afternoon teas, so much so I will write a whole blog about it with pictures.",5,2010,05,14
200,"elegant, pricey, great artwork, helpful staff, wifi extra","My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights.  When people heard we were going to stay here they oohed and said it was great, Springsteen stays there, and all had glowing remarks on the hotel. So if you want to impress stay here.

The room is comfortable and very clean.  The bathroom were fantastic, very clean, and just great.  The turndown was done nicely and modestly.  The outdoor garden is great.  Loving bar food I left the hotel for day to eat lunch at the local pub's and dinner was at other restaurants I found in Dublin.  So I can not honestly say anything about the food.  

I liked it here as far as sleeping, but if you go to Dublin to experience Irish things, this isn't the place.  Rather stuffy, and if you travel light, like I do (read Rick Steves), than you will feel underdressed without your tie and jacket at the tea rooms, and other areas.  If I ever go to Ireland to impress anyone or to feel like taking my suits and ties, then I will head here.  But from now on, I will pick something different.

Internet access is not free, a bummer, since this was the most expensive hotel in Dublin.  I just hate to pay for internet access when I travel and I did  not.  

Great place for a honeymoon.  Not a place for spring break.",4,2010,05,03
200,Top Quality Weekend,"We stayed at the Merrion for a weekend and had really good time.
The hotel is well located within walking distance of excellent restaurants, shops and St Stephens Green.  The rooms were comfortable and the staff friendly.",5,2010,04,29
200,Sublime hotel,"We really enjoyed our recent stay at The Merrion, and in our experience it is by far the best hotel to stay at in Dublin. As soon as we entered, we were overcome by the elegance of the reception rooms, which are decorated with beautiful antiques and the most amazing collection of Irish art. As it was cold outside, all the fires were blazing with what were real turf and log fires, a wonderful welcome sight. What makes this hotel stand out also is the service, which we found to be fantastic throughout the hotel - from the front desk and the friendly concierge (who was exceptionally friendly and helpful, a true Irish welcome), to the drawing rooms, and also in the great Cellar Bar. The bedrooms are mostly in the newer wing, behind the beautiful Georgian main building - these are superbly comfortable and well appointed. The bathrooms are huge, and made out of marble. We would have preferred to stay in one of the rooms in the original Georgian building, yet these are super-expensive suites.
The location of the Merrion is also a real plus - right in the centre of the most elegant part of Dublin, we thought, with lots of lovely traditional pubs nearby - we especially enjoyed the Guinness at local O'Donoghues.
One drawback - the price of the breakfast room service was a bit of a shock, so be warned that that is not included in your room rate. Also the downstairs/underground dining room felt a little 'closed off', so we chose the eat dinner elsewhere - the staff were very helpful about recommending and booking nearby restaurants, of which there are many. 
For a relaxing, luxurious stay in the centre of historic Dublin, we found the Merrion to exceed our hopes and expectations - at a price!",5,2010,04,23
200,Best in Dublin,"The Merrion competes against the Four Seasons to be the best hotel in Dublin. For me, the Merrion edges out  the Four Seasons because of its understated charm and outstanding service.

Given that the hotel fronts the street as part of one of Dublin's fine Georgian terraces, the interior is unexpectedly spacious. This applies most notably to the bedrooms. Most are capacious with high ceilings and well-decorated in an understated yet unique and elegant style. The decor is more reserved than fussy and the furniture is entirely comfortable. The bedrooms simply have more chacter than the Four Seasons.

I found the bathroom attached to my bedroom less delightful. Nothing wrong with the fixtures and amenities. Just that the ubiquitous white marble with black streaks seemed at odds with the warmth of the bedroom furnishings.

The service is hospitable and unpretentious while being responsive and professional. The food quality in the main restaurant is equally terrific.

Room prices are currently very competitive , given the economic downturn, and certainly good value compared to comparable hotels in London. But the point is that the Merrion is not coparable. It has its own unique style and ambience which makes it all the better.",5,2010,04,22
200,"OK experience, let down by diabolical cooked breakfast... expected more!!","Myself and my partner stayed for one night in a garden room, check in was impeccable, very polite efficient staff we were taken to our room and were told the garden rooms were the more 'contemporary' rooms (maybe look up the meaning of contemporary), the rooms were adequate if a little old fashioned, the Bose sound system being the only 'contemporary' thing in the room. We were dining in Patrick Guilbaud Restaurant for lunch, great experience, We had the surprise menu, only hiccup, sommelier was giving us wine by the glass and his assistant poured a  wine from a different table (a Sancerre) into my partner's Chablis, overall though a great experience. Staff throughout the hotel could not be any more helpful. Next morning is where it fell apart, we went down to breakfast in the cellar restaurant, firstly I must say the cold buffet was extremely good. My partner had eggs Benedict which I have to say were probably the worst Benedict we have either ever tasted, the hollandaise (which I think may even have been bought in, by the colour of it) was badly curdled, under which lay almost raw eggs. I ordered the steak and eggs, was asked how I would like it cooked 'medium rare please' when it arrived it was rare but a badly done rare (stone cold in the middle, just straight out of the fridge and into the pan) the egg on top of the steak was burst, now I am sorry but a 5 star hotel can surely afford a few cents to recook an egg to make a dish look presentable!! I said nothing at the time simply to avoid embarrassment in front of my fiancé",4,2010,04,21
200,A truly world class hotel in Dublin,"We have stayed at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin many times where we find the accommodations, service, staff, ancillary facilities and location to be outstanding. We spent a most enjoyable night there in April staying in the Main House, dining with friends in the Cellar Restaurant where the food and wines were excellent and chatting into the early morning hours sitting by the fire in one of the drawing rooms - at all times the service was excellent and unobtrusive. The Merrion Hotel is a real gem in a great location in Dublin.",5,2010,04,13
200,Simply divine!,"Merrion Hotel is in an excellent location, quietly set across from the government buildings amongst the beautiful Georgian homes (and their famously colored doors). It's within walking distance of many attractions including Trinity college and steps from one of the hop-on-hop-off tour bus stops. The quality of everything was extremely high and did not disappoint. From the service to the food to the rooms - all wonderful! Treat yourself to this elegant and luxurious oasis within Dublin!",5,2010,04,11
200,Pure Luxury,My husband and I spent three nights in the hotel to celebrate our Golden Weddding Anniversary. We did not choose the hotel it was a gift from our family and they could not have chosen a better hotel. The staff were so  friendly and made us so welcome nothing was too much trouble for them. It certainly made our celebration top class.,5,2010,04,07
200,Excellent!,"From the moment we checked in for a one-night birthday treat  to the moment we checked out this place hit all the right notes!  We were asked by our lovely receptionist at check-in if we we were there for an occasion, which we duly told them about.  Having used the spa later in the afternoon we returned to our room to find that some birthday cupcakes had been left in our room!  Later on after dinner in the Cellar Restaurant my partner was given another birthday treat in the form of a mini birthday cake, this time accompanied by a candle!!  All nice touches, as was the complimentary car-wash!  The staff really can't do enough for you.  The Cellar Bar was closed during our stay but we thoroughly enjoyed having a few quiet drinks after dinner-excellent cocktails by the way-in the lovely drawing room area outside the residents bar.  All in all an excellent stay.  Good food, lovely rooms, great staff.  All you expect from a five-star experience.  Would definitely stay again!",5,2010,04,06
200,It was a significant birthday for my spouse and the Merrion made it special,"My spouse and I have dined in the Merrion Hotel many times in both its restaurants and enjoyed the rather special afternoon tea, so when it came to surprising my spouse for a significant birthday what could top a surprise overnight stay in the Hotel? Well to be honest nothing! from the doorman to the receptionists to the waiters in the restaurant it was five star service all the way!
A very minor glitch regarding our restaurant bill was dealt with swiftly ,with courtesy and efficiently. We will certainly be back and would recommend it to all our friends and associates  unreservedely. As we travel extensively we feel happy to give our own hotels a fair comparsion to other establishments around the world and certainly the Merrion Hotel is up there with the best! Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2010,04,01
200,100% Perfect In Every Way!!,"A remarkable stay in such an amazing hotel.  From the minute you pull up outside the door until the moment you leave - you are guaranteed VIP treatment by professional, courteous and charming staff.  A truly fantastic 5 star hotel with 5 star service throughout.  We will most definitely be returning soon.",5,2010,03,29
200,5 Star Service,"Booked the stay as part of the Five Star Deal. From start to finish we were treated to 5 star treatment. Beginning with the porter who took and parked my car, reception personnel and hotel staff who showed us to our room, we were treated like royalty! The room was nice but a little small, probably because we were on a special deal. We really liked the turndown service and the tidying of the room when we were out! The complementary shoe polish was a big bonus! Enjoyed the afternoon tea and the food in the Cellar restaurant was very good even though it was a limited menu. Breakfast was excellent and we had a great choice! All in all it was well worth paying a bit more for a special occassion and we will definitely be back soon!",5,2010,03,18
200,"Magnificent choice for any Dublin visitor--luxury, location, just lovely!","From the minute we arrived, the friendly doorman whisked us in, we checked in very easily and while waiting for our room (we were early) treated to a divine little tea service in their elegant, comfortable tea rooms. The rooms were beautiful there; all the little touches were observed, from complimentary slippers with turndown service, help with dinner reservations, and even a fabulous massage in the spa. We ate dinner one night in the wonderful Wine Cellar there, and if we'd stayed, doubtless we'd have done it again! One special thing: We asked the concierge to find us the best traditional Irish music pubs in Dublin, and he steered us to one local pub with really great music. So great, in face, that Dave Matthews and Stefan Lessard (of Dave Matthews Band) happened to be visiting it as well. We were absolutely delighted by every aspect of our stay and would select the Merrion again in a heartbeat.",5,2010,03,13
200,Fantastic stay at the Merrion in Dublin...,"Fantastic stay at the Merrion in Dublin.  Upon arrival, we were made to feel right at home.  Everyone from the doorman to the bellhops to the concierge was friendly and eager to help.  Our room was lovely, with fresh linens each day, towel warmer, large bath and nice view of the garden.  Most important, the location couldn't be beat.   Would stay again in a minute.  Thanks to everyone, loved it!",5,2010,03,11
200,Wonderful Stay,Had a wonderful stay recently at the Merrion Hotel.  Was welcomed back by reception staff when I arrived which is a lovely touch.  Room service is excellent (my neice asked for a hot water bottle and was provided!!).  The room was beautiful and the staff are exremely helpful.  Hope to stay again soon.,5,2010,03,09
200,Wonderful service and location,"Had a fabulous stay in the Merrion with my husband midweek.  Was part of the 'five star steal' from their own website and I felt it was good value.   It included dinner in the cellar restaurant, bed and breakfast in a large kingsize garden room.  The service from the moment we arrived to our departure was faultless.  Every member of staff we encountered was friendly, helpful and professional.  The room was clean and well presented.   It was also very quiet, we could hear no noise from the city as we lay in bed which was a change from one or two other Dublin hotels I've stayed in.  We could have been out in the middle of the country!  The food was very good in the cellar restaurant ,although the menu on the package was different to the normal menu.  We had after dinner drinks in the lounge which was like relaxing.  My only points where I feel it could be improved was the strength of the shower and the need for a duvet instead of blanket (I've a personal aversion to blankets!).  My husband has a massage in the spa and was impressed.  Unfortunately we didn't get to use the pool but it looked very tempting. The hotel sits opposite Leinster House and a two minute stroll from Stephen's Green - superb location.  Wonderful stay.  Thank you to everyone who looked after us so well.  We'll return next time we need a treat.",5,2010,03,05

As a surprise, I was taken to the Merrion Hotel for an evening and after a wonderful dinner, my partner got down on bended knee and produced the most beautiful ring I have ever seen. 
The Merrion was the ideal place- romantic, wonderful helpful staff. great location.

I can't wait to go back ... and wish I could get engaged again",5,2010,03,04
200,A delightful stay!,"I had the pleasure of staying 3 nights at The Merrion in Dublin.  It is a lovely hotel, with beautiful details throughout, excellent service, and luxurious rooms.  The Merrion exhibits a wonderful display of Irish art and has produced a book documenting the collection.  The lobby lounge is a great place for a cup of tea and conducive for nice conversation.  I particularly liked the wood burning fireplace.  Breakfast was delicious and the downstairs bar a gem.  I only regret not having the time to try the restaurant...Patrick Guillbaud with its 2 Michellin stars!",5,2010,03,02
200,"Discover the ""Standard of Excellence in Dublin City""","Wonderful, quiet retreat in the middle of Dublin City.  I arrived in Dublin after  a long flight suffering from jet-lag and looking for a way to pamper myself with the best treat ever, a stay in the Merrion Hotel.  One night in this oasis of calm, with elegant, friendly service from smiling Jim the Doorman to Bernie the efficient front desk manager, we were able to spend the next day totally refreshed.   Lots of energy the next morning  to hop on a private tour to Newgrange with Mary Gibbons and learn about the fascinating history of Ireland.  Only then did we discover that the Merrion Hotel has a very unique place in Dublin history.  Don't miss the original Jack Yeats art  in the lobby  and other famous artist throughout the hotel and the statue of Oscar in the Park.  Irish restaurants, pubs, music and what they call the craic (translated to the art of good conversation and nothing to do with drugs) can be found across the street or around the corner.  This is the place to stay in Dublin.   Peter McCann, the general manager takes the time to make sure all his guest are delighted with their stay.",5,2010,02,26
200,Charming staff & perfect location,"Stayed here for a 3 day break with our young family and the staff were wonderful.
From check in right through to check out we couldnt fault the way we were looked after and in such a lovely, welcoming, unobtrusive way. The suite we had was an amazing space and suited our needs perfectly. Centrally located for shopping, restaurants and St Stephens Green Park it meant we were able to pop into town for an hour or so and walk back to the hotel in a matter of minutes. Would highly recommend the Merrion for a relaxing city break.",5,2010,02,24
200,Perfect as usual,"We have stayed in the Merrion about five times, usually for a special occassion.  We do llve in Dublin. but enjoy going over for a night without the hassle of travelling for a bit of spoiling  It is always excellent.  The food, the service, the particularly lovely staff and the bedrooms.  We just couldn't fault it and the breakfast is beautiful.  We will continue to return for special occassions.    And we love the art, what a collection.  Well done to everyone at the Merrion",5,2010,02,24
200,good location and very pleasant,enjoyed one nights b&b at this hotel.  the room was very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable (very important).  Staff were lovely.  Whilst the breakfast was nice - the service was very poor on that day - had asked for poached egg - which arrived just as we had finished breakfast..  Otherwise will stay again as it has a nice friendly down-to-earth atmosphere.,4,2010,02,20
200,Fabulous,"The Merrion is a beautiful, old world hotel with first class service. Front desk staff were pleasant and accomodating. The rooms had both a shower and a bath, a huge cosy bed and chairs that are just begging you to curl up on with a book! Dinner in the cellar restaurant was fantastic with the small exception of the water cress salad which was a little boring. The treatments were enjoyable and the pool was lovely. The changing rooms, showers were a little dated and facilities limited (steam room only) compared to some 5 star hotels I've stayed in. The hotel is expensive (E5 room service espresso) but it's a treat.  The entire hotel has an air of understated elegance - it's perfect for a romantic break.",5,2010,02,16
200,What a wonderful hotel!,"Was here for three nights on a business trip.  Very impressed by the hospitality shown by every member of the staff from the moment I arrived.  Truly seemed like they wanted to make my stay as comfortable as possible.  Stayed in the ""new"" wing adjacent to the garden with a lovely view onto the garden and reflective pool.  The only food service I tried was in the lounge area of the main building.  Very comfortable, but just tried some basics like a BLT or a continental breakfast - and a late night mulled port, which was the perfect nightcap by the fireplace.  Of course they use turf in the fireplace, so expect the burning turf aroma in the hallways and perhaps on your clothes if you linger near the fireplace, as I did.  However, I found it actually very atmostpheric - in a positive way.

What really impressed me about the hotel was the amazing housekeeping in the rooms.  I wasn't always there, but I suspect they did at least three visits per day to the room.  I would go out for an hour, return and find the room had been touched up.  Constantly.  Once I was in the room working on the computer and the housekeeper knocked on the door - I said it was fine to work while I was in the room if she was comfortable with it.  Unless she was putting on an act for me, I've never seen such thorough cleaning of the room - lifting up beside lamps and radio to dust under them.  Dusting the molding around the window, etc.  

It's pricey, yes.  But I truly felt I got great bang for my Euro.  If I have to go to Dublin again, I'll certainly try to stay here.",5,2010,02,14
200,The Best in Dublin!,"The Merrion Hotel was the perfect  choice for our family in Dublin.  We came to Dublin on a quick Easter weekend getaway, and we can't wait to go back for a longer stay. The location was perfect and an easy walk to many restaurants and shopping.

Check in was friendly and easy, we were given our two connecting garden wing rooms immediately, even though we had arrived well before the check in time.  Rooms were spotless, traditional in decor, and very comfortable. Marble baths were very pretty,  the shower had plenty of hot water and I loved the towel warming bar. Lots of extras here to make you feel pampered.  We had a beautiful view of the fountains and gardens, and the weather was mild enough to open the tall windows and enjoy the scents and sounds .The housekeeping staff was the best I have encountered in all of our travels. My son accidentally dropped a glass on the bathroom floor and the staff arrived within 5 minutes to clean it up, even though it was 11 pm.  And the rooms were always cleaned and ready upon our return from breakfast. 

The full Irish breakfast was wonderful, served formally in the dining room, but was still comfortable and accommodating for my 8 year old. Lots of cold food choices from the buffet, and the hot items were brought by the wait staff.

The front desk and concierge staff were always ready to answer any questions, and greeted us by name each time we left the hotel.  We were able to walk to the Viking Splash Tour and the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tour, both of which were an excellent way to tour the city.  I loved returning to the welcoming scent of the peat fires at the end of a busy touring day!  The indoor pool was also a great place to unwind and perfect for my son after a long overnight flight.

Easter Sunday morning was beautiful.  The staff planned an Easter egg hunt in the gardens where they hid lots of bags of delicious chocolate eggs for the children to find.  The Easter Bunny was there and posed for pictures with all of the kids, and everyone had a fun time.  Just one of the small details that makes The Merrion Hotel a special place to stay in Dublin.",5,2010,02,10
200,Made feel very special on a special occasion,"Stayed here for an engagement and found the staff brillant from concierge to reception to restaurant. Got a great deal when I booked, champaign in bright room made for a nice touch. Food in restaurant was lovely. Have great memories from stay. Good hotel in great location and topped off with excellent staff.",5,2010,02,08
200,"Used to be good, now losing its charm","I have stayed at the Merrion countless times in the past 5 years, and am really disappointed to note that it is completely losing its charm.
Reception staff completely uninterested, not friendly or unfriendly, completely indifferent, apart from the countless errors on my credit card.
Rooms look tired and jaded, even though the price had gone up.
Breakfast quality had deteriorated, and all that seemed to matter was the tip.
Sadly, in the recession, Dublin has lots of empty hotel rooms, after this latest stay, I'm choosing to stay elsewhere, which is a shame, given this hotels brilliant past. Judging by the quiet lounge areas, it would appear others are feeling the same.",2,2010,01,21
200,Amazing Location & Service,"Wow...what a hotel! Yes, the rooms could use a little sprucing up but that's totally overshadowed by the to-die-for location and the service. We had room service breakfast delivered in 20 minutes!  The art is fantastic. We had a staff member walking us around the hotel searching for a particular painting and when we found it we were blown away.  You don't have access to this type of art in this casual setting anywhere!  Loved the art high tea.  We wish the Cellar bar had been opened while we were there because it looked like a great location.  

Being able to walk to all of the great Dublin locations was amazing! Book of Kells, Grafton Street, great restaurants, the parks.  We had perfect weather and had a wonderful time!",5,2010,01,20
200,Wonderful,"It was a fantastic stay, wonderful service and delicious meals at the restaurant. Breakfast is amazing with high quality irish products.  The rooms are clean and the beds very comfy with 100% egyptian cotton sheets. The lounge area seats and the rooms will need a little update very soon. Special thanks to Fiona @ reception.we'll be back soon.",5,2010,01,17
200,Was ok rooms need a little work,the hotel staff are as expected very good however offer services even if you do not want them. the hotel room was ok nothing special. pay for broadband and breakfast was ok nothing special. the Bathroom however need an overhaul. dated chipped and yellow grout on the marble tiles needs updating. all in all the hotel was just average nothing like i expected.,4,2010,01,04
200,Understated elegance but not entirely perfect,"We had spent a relaxed afternoon with friends in the Merrion last year and they swear by it's standards so had looked forward to our new year's day treat.Overall, it is good- understated elegance - but some room for improvement.
On the whole ,the staff were excellent but our receptionist fell down on small issues which gave an overall feeling that he didn't care about our custom as they have so many wealthy people using the hotel our business wasn't that important. First ,despite me telling him we had pre-paid, he tried to debit my credit card. Secondly, we asked him to enquire about a table in the Cellar restaurant - when we came back 20 minutes later , he still hadn't and tried ( unconvincingly) to balme the restaurant staff.Thirdly , he offered a complementary newspaper and we were not surprosed that the next morning our's was the only room without a paper. Must do better David.
The room was comfortable but, as others have pointed out, in the garden wing some rooms have a lovely view...of a factory. The air-con is noisy at night- this does not become obvious until later and we would have asked to move if we had been staying more than one night. Finally, the absence of tea/coffee facilities is a poor show.
The pool and steam room are excellent - I understand the Boss himself enjoys same on his requent visits to Dublin.
Bar 23 is small but comfortable, attentive staff who know their business. 18€ for a glass of champagne is dear but this is Dublin.
Having booked a table at the Cellar Restaurant ourselves, we enjoyed an excellent meal with good service. The calimari batter could have been more crispy but goats cheese and mint garden peas very tasty . Roast Quail was near perfect but the fishcakes could have been bigger.Very good desserts and petit fours with mint tea made the event enjoyable, helped by a good wine-list with a particularly wide selection by the glass.
Digestivs back in 23 rounded off a pretty good experience and the turf fires and art make this an ideal chillax venue.",5,2010,01,02
200,New year's eve hideaway,"This is the second year in a row we have gone to the Merrion for New Years Eve.  Instead of the normal hype and fuss, it's a great way to enjoy a quiet night in a really luxurious hotel ... even though we only live a couple of miles away I think it's the best in Dublin.

Enjoyed afternoon tea, the pool, an upgrade to a room in the Main House (the original Georgian building on Merrion Street rather than the Garden Wing extension) and a great breakfast.  We ate out in a local restaurant, as my only gripe would be the room service menu cost which is excessive even for a five star hotel.  (As we were checking out we saw they had a special offer of organic beef burger, fries and a glass of wine for €20, but we hadn't spotted this the evening before).  Apart from that one issue I'd highly recommend the Merrion.  

Service was excellent.  For example, when we checked in at 4 pm the lounge for afternoon tea was full, but they took our room number and held the next available table for us, then gave a call to the room to let us know it was ready.  There was a short queue for breakfast (due to everyone sleeping in as long as possible on New Year's Day morning and arriving between 10.30 and 11 am) but they handled it very well, giving glasses of freshly squeezed OJ to those of us waiting.  We were looked after particularly well by the receptionist (French with dark hair) who was also serving breakfast.  Didn't catch her name but maybe her manager will see this and know who we mean.

Having been in (but not stayed in) the other top hotels in Dublin (Westbury, Four Seasons, Shelbourne, etc.) I think this has the edge in terms of atmosphere and surroundings.  Location is central but on a quiet street, and the artwork on the walls is worth visiting for on its own.",5,2010,01,01
200,Relax in Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Probably the best hotel in Dublin. Service was professional & friendly, rooms spacious, dinner at the Cellar restauarant was only surpassed by lunch at the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant next door. As we didnt book in advance, we didnt have a chance to sample the spa facilities although the pool was wonderful.",5,2009,12,14
200,Wonderful!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Merrion. Could not fault it. Food amazing (ate in Patrick Giulbaud), bedroom lovely, customer service top notch!

Just wished we stayed longer...will be back.",5,2009,12,07
200,The Best!,"Spent one night here as a family treat having stayed in the past without family.  Everything about this hotel is fantastic, the location, the staff, the decor, the rooms, the leisure facilities (rare in Dublin city hotels).  There is really no where better in Dublin if the budget can extend this far.  To be honest, while it has five star prices - it is worth the money!",5,2009,12,06
200,Great hotel in a central location,"Stayed in this hotel in 2 nights on a break to Dublin with my mother. We stayed on the Sterling Saver offer and got a very good deal. The hotel was beautiful throughout, tastlefully decorated and spotlessly clean. Staff efficient and polite. Door and concierge staff should be commended as they are your first impression of the hotel and they do a wonderful job. Daniel particularly stood out.

We enjoyed christmas afternoon tea in the drawing room on the Saturday, the carol singers were excellent. Tea was of a high standard and surroundings festive but relaxing. 

We did not eat dinner in the hotel, but breakfast was again of a good standard. Service on the first morning was a bit slow, but much better the second morning. 

The hotel was very busy and the seating in the drawing room and public areas seemed to always be reserved. A rest by the peat fire would have been a perfect end to a day in Dublin.

The bedroom was large and spacious (a delux garden view). Lovely toileteries and extra touches. Other trip advisor reviews have noted the lack of tea and making facilities in the bedrooms and we missed this also. Housekeeping service was excellent both morning and evening.

The Spa was beautiful, the pool perfect and very relaxing. Again the cleanliness was noteworthy and the staff polite and professional. 

Overal an excellent  hotel in central Dublin.",5,2009,12,06
200,Gorgeous location with terrific service,"I stayed in the Merrion Hotel as a special treat recently and had a super stay. The building is beautiful, very centrally situated and within easy walking distance of the city centre. The staff are very polite and attentive. We had a basic room but it was lovely, with all the pampering touches. The only slight negative was that we found the bar to be very expensive.  17.50 euros for a pint of Heineken and a small glass of wine is excessive. However, everything else was very satisfactory and we would definitely stay again.",5,2009,12,05
200,Fabulous!,"I loved this place because it was cosy and made me special. The breakfast was really good, with a wide variety of fruits and breads. The location was great, and the tour bus stop is just outside the hotel, which gave me enough time to do a hop off tour bus tour. I loved the city and the people were so polite, friendly and helpful at the hotel. Definately a place I would visit again!!",5,2009,12,04
200,This place is perfect,"I love this hotel. It's luxurious without being ostentatious. It's understated. The staff are down to earth but polite. The art is genuinely jaw dropping. One tip. Don't have too much to drink the night before and tick every box on the breakfast in bed menu. I don't care how good it is, €100 is too much for breakfast.",5,2009,12,02
200,"Incredible, charming, with a great location","Stayed at the Merrion for two nights, and it was so much more than I expected.

From the moment we arrived, we were treated like the only guests in the hotel. Service and check-in was impeccably smooth; not having a card with us we could use to guarantee the room was handled discretely and effectively, and wasn't an issue for the staff at all.

The room was lovely, spotlessly clean and quite 'quaint' - real Irish charm about it. The shower was wonderful! Bed was very large, which was great, and very comfortable also.

The sitting areas where high tea is taken were wonderfully inviting; roaring peat / turf fires, quiet conversation, and beautiful artwork everywhere. Drink prices in the bar were very expensive, but service was, as expected, impeccable.

Ate in the downstairs restaurant on the first night; the maitre d' was just wonderful! Neither of us are wine drinkers, but a bottle was included with our meal. He suggested a wine we could enjoy despite not having a taste for it, as such. Great! The food was incredible; I'd particularly recommend the braised liver!

We had breakfast in bed, and it was a sight to behold; a trolley full of the most amazing food; we couldn't finish half of it! Beautiful. I've attached a photo of it, in fact. I couldn't help myself!

The pool area is lovely; the pool itself is beautifully presented, and the changing rooms are spotlessly clean. The supersucker swim clothing driers are great! Five seconds and they're dry as a bone.

The location is amazing; right beside St. Stephen's Green, in a beautiful row of Georgian town houses directly facing the government buildings. It's walking distance to anywhere you'd care to try.

Can't wait to go back!",5,2009,12,01
200,Very Nice Marriott with World Class Service,"My eight year old son would say that his favoritr part of this hotel was the pool.  My twelve year old daughter favored the room service breakfast.  My wife was impressed with the art.  I like the bar that stayed open 24 hours--handy for adjusting to the time change.  The hotel seems to have more business travelers than families.

The bottom line on this hotel:  very nice Marriott rooms and common areas with world class service within walking distance of the hot spots.",4,2009,11,18
200,Marvelous,"My sister and I travelled to Ireland to visit with two ailing aunts, while our reason for coming to Ireland was not too pleasant staying at the Merrion was so marvelous it took the sting out of our trip.
It was a trip of a life time!",5,2009,11,17
200,Wonderful hotel~fantastic staff~however:,"We love Dublin and enjoyed our stay at The Merrion BUT will probably not stay there again.  We booked an expensive room--beautiful, large--the bathroom was gorgeous though ill equipped: room for a dressing table or a small table to put cosmetic bag, but instead there was only a long narrow shelf above the sink.  No coffee or teapot in room--and this is unfortunate because room service charges are totally laughable.  We have stayed in some of the most expensive hotels and the prices on Merrion menu were absurd!  A glass of champagne in the bar?  $25--silly.  I hope the hotel pays attention to comments as we would love to return to the hotel (unfailingly friendly staff) but won't unless these issues are addressed!",4,2009,11,14
200,"LOVELY ROOM,GREAT SERVICE, GOOD LOCATION",Stayed at the Merrion with my 18yr old daughter. Had a garden wing room which was very spacious and comfortable. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating and we really enjoyed the use of their great infinity pool. Would definitely recommend this hotel,5,2009,11,11
200,Dont stay anywhere else!!!,"After a terrible experience staying at an hotel in ballsbridge for the weekend of the marathon iin 2008 i decided this year to pay the bit extra and stay at the merrion, and to sum it up without goin on to much it was the best spent money EVER!!! Only 2 mins from the start line and two mins from the finish fantastic location, if you are running the marathon then u will not get any better hell if your goin to dublin full stop stay here yes it may be a little more expensive but your worth it!!!!",5,2009,11,02
200,Honeymoon @ The Merrion,Utter bliss from the minute we walked through the front door!  can't praise it highly enough!,5,2009,10,29
200,Excellence In All They Do,"Absolutely fantastic stay at the Merrion. Despite booking the 'Sterling Saver' - a great deal on their website under Rates and Reservations - we were never afforded anything but first class service. From the Concierge, to Reception and the Restaurant, this is a fine example of 5 star luxury.

Cannot praise highly enough and would recommend to anyone visting Dublin; it's location (just 100 yards from St Stephens Green) is fantastic for all sightseeing.",5,2009,10,29
200,In the hotel Merrion,"My wife and me came first time to Irland from Finland. I was a little bit worried about, how we will manage. When we came to your hotel all the worries were gone. We got very friendly wellcome. A friendly girl guided us to our room and told everything we needed about the hotel. The persons in reception liked to give us all the information about Dublin we needed. Especially we enjoyed the relaxed and quiet atmosphere in your hotel. We recommend your hotel to everybody, who likes luxury and especilly for them, who travel first time in their life to Ireland.

200,Magnificent!!!,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin is one of my favourite hotels in the world! Complete luxury in the heart of Dublin City. Although right in the centre you feel transported to a world away from modern life where you can really relax and feel special. You can do as little or as much as you like.
Staff are fabulous, very kind, friendly, efficient and helpful. Food is lovely, modern Ireland at it's best, marrying traditional with international.
Rooms and suites in the main house are beautiful. Suites in the garden wing also are. Rooms in the garden wing least attractive.",5,2009,10,16
200,You would find it hard to find a better hotel anywhere in the world.,You would find it hard to find a better hotel anywhere in the world.,5,2009,10,15
200,Luxury with friendly staff,"I found the hotel Merrion in Dublin on line and booked online and since I was traveling with my 21 year old son, I booked a family plan with 2 rooms which included daily Irish breakfast.  The hotel had a spa and a pub; but what I enjoyed most was the high tea every afternoon.  The staff are wonderfully efficient and super friendly; the food was top notch, the linens and the furnishings were the best and the bathrooms with robes and slippers was fabulous.",5,2009,10,11
200,"Opulent,stylish,homely and in a perfect quiet location in city centre","From upon arrival to departure the standard of service and hospitality was second to none.Friendly and professional staff who made you feel welcome and made our stay a ""home from home"" experience.
      Our room was a beautiful traditional room,with a stunning marble 4 piece(stand-alone shower,which is always nice)bathroom.Mini-bar was fully stocked and everything from the linen.matress,furniture,carpets was all of the highest standard and pristine.The view from our room was over the fantastic manicured gardens and was uplifting to say the least.
     The Merrion has a wonder collection of art in it's homely reception and public areas.The Drawing Room with it's peat-burning fires and warmth was so cosy and homely that it was hard to drag yourself away to go out and explore the city itself...it really is THAT good!
     We ate several times in the hotel.breakfast was a fantastic array of fresh fruit,sumptious hot choice menu,and anything you could wish for to make your mouth water and set you up for the day ahead.We also has an evening meal in the Cellar Restaurant and again,the food,service and price were all excellent.
    The hotel itself is situation only 2 minutes walk from the thriving hustle and bustle of St Stephens green and the main thoroughfare of Graftons Street,where all the chic shops and boutiques are,yet the street on which the hotel is situated is like a calming oasis,..quiet,nearly traffic-free and safe.
    Having experienced other so-called ""5 star"" hotels and been let down or disappointed each time,I can honestly say that The Merrion truely deserves every one of its 5 stars and can't wait to return asap.",5,2009,10,08
200,Magnificent,Such a treat. A 5 star hotel in every sense of the word. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and its pure luxury without being flashy. We enjoyed our too-brief stay enormously.,5,2009,10,08
200,Just loved it,"Recommended to us by a friend we trust in hotel matters, we found this hotel exactly to our taste. The service was impeccable, friendly, smiling and discrete. Unlike so many city centre hotels, the public rooms were buzzing with folk coming in for tea or drinks into comfortable, beautifully  furnished spaces with a traditional peat burning open fire. The garden area would be lovely on a  nice day. The hotel's collection of antiques and paintings (from 18th-20th centuries) was worth visiting the hotel for alone. Breakfast was pricey but I fear that was the rotten exchange rate.  We found our room very comfortably furnished with lots of space, ample marble bathroom and the telly was quite large although we didn't watch much. (Someone below commented that theirs was small so must have had bad luck there.). 

The heated pool was almost empty but almost perfect for a quick dip before dinner at the end of a busy day. All in all a great place and we shall certainly return when and if we are next in Dublin.",5,2009,10,07
200,Impeccable,"Booked this hotel as a treat as I always wanted to stay there. I was not disapointed. It is probably the best hotel in the city. Great location, beautiful surroundings (the gardens are an oasis) .. pure luxury!",5,2009,10,06
200,Should have stayed at the Westin,"I was very torn when deciding where to stay for the weekend and prayed that I had made the right decision.  Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot after our delayed Ryan Air flight got us in at 1am to be greeted by the night staff.  Not the friendliest bunch but we were tired so I thought I'd have a good night's sleep and realise I was over-reacting the next morning.

Wrong - no good night's sleep as the bed was hard and we got woken up the next morning by house keeping moving / scraping the furniture above us.  What's more the hoovering didn't let us get back to sleep.  The flatscreen TV in the room was very small (about 20inches, slightly bigger than a laptop screen) and the batteries had gone in the controller.  The bedside lightbulb had gone too.

Plus point - the bathroom was spacious with a good shower and although there were Merrion's own toiletries, you feel that you deserve a luxurious brand such as Molton Brown for the amount you pay to stay here.  They did, however, have this in the Tethra Spa but without a jacuzzi and chairs by the pool it wasn't really worth spending much time here.  

Unfortunately breakfast was not included in our 3 for 2 offer (which a few of the 5 star hotels were offering at the time) so it cost us a lot of money considering the Pound was so weak.  All in all not the best experience but maybe I was expecting too much.",3,2009,10,04
200,Over priced - but it is Dublin,"Stayed here for a package deal which included dinner for two in the Patrick Guilbaud Restaurant next door. The hotel is the former residence of the Duke of Wellington and I can confirm that the facilities are somewhat more salubrious than a stable (for those of you who know the famous quote). 

Since the hotel is a converted Georgian town house, it is a bit creaky in places - but I saw when I was there that they were getting ready for a major refit. I found the front office staff to be somewhat haughty and they had to be pressed for information - perhaps they get too busy and don't have time for a customer orientated approach. The rooms were OK - I would say Holiday Inn standard, but we had to ask for a change of room due to noisy neighbours, this was accommodated, though we lost our no smoking preference.

Since the resturant meal was part of the package I will mention it as well. Patrick Guilbaud is reportedly the only Two Star Michelin restaurant in Ireland - but I was able to compare it with a non rated but comparable haute cuisine restaurant called Frangipani in Kuala Lumpur (mentioned in Frommer's Guide as probably the best French Restaurant in South East Asia). I am sorry M. Guilbaud, but Herr Bauer of Frangipani wins hands down. In both places I chose the tasting menu. At Frangipani the flavors were beautifully contrasted and teased the palete, there was a gradual build up of suspense before the main course was delivered. Service was genuinely friendly and attentive. The wine list was exceptional. I did not find any of this at Guilbaud's. Of course the prices in Dublin and Kuala Lumpur can hardly be compared - but if you were to fly from London to KL on Air Asia X AND have a meal at Frangipani, then the cost is roughly the same.",3,2009,10,03
200,What an amazing hotel,The Merrion is an luxurious hotel with a great staff and a great location.  The gardens are beautiful and the 2 living rooms with fireplace are so inviting and relaxing.  The hotel also has an infinity pool and spa.  My room was a perfect size and very clean.  I did not eat in the restaurant but I did have a late night meal in the living room that was very good.  The fireplace gives off an amazing scent that makes you want to sit there all day but don't because Dublin is a place to be out in and exploring.  The Book of Kells and the Library in Trinity college is quite interesting and definately a must see.  The Music Pub Crawl is something that is very fun to do as well as interesting.  If you have time I recommend the day tour to Blarney Castle and/or the day tour to Wicklow - both places are so green and beautiful.  I would definately recommend the Merrion Hotel to my friends and I hope to go back there soon.,5,2009,10,03
200,"So quiet but right in the center, with a James Joyce as neighbour. The place to be with the right book and a good wine","Don't miss the cellar wine bar.
Good size bedroom, very quiet.
Interesting art exhibition.
The only negative point was the breakfast, a little too expensive.
Great spot for a city break",5,2009,09,24
200,Superb hotel....,"What a lovely hotel, great facilities and helpful friendly staff who were genuinely happy to help.  Bedrooms were very comfortable and pleasantly decorated with a more traditional feel than say that of The Dylan.   Would recommend a visit to the Cellar Bar even if you are not a guest at the hotel lovely interesting setting.

The only element I didn't like was that you could smell smoke throughout the hotel from the open fires in the reception and coffee areas, but hey a really minor negative point in what was a fabuolous stay.",5,2009,09,21
200,little bit of heaven in city centre,"all you expect from a 5 star hotel without the ""stuffy aymosphere"". relaxed yet totally professional ! situated in the heart of the city this location is perfect ! nicest rooms we have ever stayed in! leaves the four seasons hotel trailing behind !!!!!",5,2009,09,12
200,Outstanding Merrion Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin last week.  It is a beautiful Hotel, all the amenities you could ever want, including a heated pool.  Rooms were immaculate, and included a mini bar.  Location was excellent.  Wood burning fireplaces all lit downstairs in the hotel, a beautiful courtyard outside with plants, trees and a wading pool.  Breakfast was included and was excellent.  Service was excellent, shower was excellent as were the consierge.  Anything we requested wheter it be something in our room a place to eat dinner, etc was recommended and all had great service and value for what we wanted.  I have no complaints.  If we ever stay in Dublin again, this will be the Hotel for us.  

One of the best parts was the location.  Just around the corner from Saint Stephen's Green, a huge, beautiful park in Dublin.  Two minutes walk to Grafton Street and maybe 5 minutes walk to the Temple Bar area.  Just a superb Hotel!

You will not be dissappointed.",5,2009,09,11
200,Our favourite hotel in Dublin,"We come over to Dublin a couple of times a year and since we first stayed at the Merrion a few years ago we haven't stayed anywhere else.  
It is in a great location - just next to St Stephen's Green, it is a beautiful building with wonderful public areas.  The bedrooms are large and confortable.  We love the Cellar bar in the basement.  There is a great swimming pool there as well.

However the best thing about the Merrion is the staff - in particular the concierges.  They are incredibly welcoming and helpful.  On the latest visit we particularly noted Rory the French barman in Number 23.  

I only wish I could afford to stay at the Merrion more often.",5,2009,09,03
200,"Gracious, luxurious, wonderful",I am definitely returning to Dublin and to the Merrion. We stayed in the basic king room and it was grand and very well priced. Location and staff superb. I talked to the actor Gabriel Bryne who is a frequent guest. The swimming pool is lovely. The peat fire in the lounge a delight. Dublin was fun too.,5,2009,09,01
200,Not the place for a romantic weekend,"We were promised a gastronomic weekend but really came away disappointed.  The hotel is very unwelcoming - more suited to business than leisure.  Rooms ok but everything has a label asking if you want to buy it - umbrella, gowns etc.  No tea and coffee facilities in room - only expensive room service.  Mini bar also very expensive.  Restaurant small, crowded and noisy.  Food good but not great.  Staff aloof, remote and patronising.

Hotel lacks initmacy - too busy and impersonal.  For this much money I would rather have gone to the K Club or Carton House where the surroundings are much more tranquil.",2,2009,08,27

200,Beautiful hotel with outstanding service,It was the first stop on our trip. Got in early morning and were able to check in right away with a nice pot of tea sent up to our room to help shake off the jet lag. Service was outstanding. The room was beautiful with a huge marble bathroom. In room wi-fi worked flawlessly. The location was perfect. Loved it!!,5,2009,08,07
200,Amazing Hotel - one of the best weekends ever,"My sister and I stayed for 2 nights recently to see Bruce Springsteen at the RDS. Although we have been back for a few weeks now I am still on a high from such a great weekend. We were greeted at the door by Patrick, who deserves a special mention for his smile and enthusiasm. All the staff, without exception were fansastic. Friendly efficient, knowledgeable and cheerful. We were treated so well. We had tickets to see Bruce Springsteen the first night (who was amazing!) and as we enjoyed it so much decided we wanted to go the second night. The concierge provided us quickly with great tickets at face value only - we were delighted!
We had an amazing champagne cream tea served with charm, very efficiently. (Tip - unless very hungry have one between 2!)
Hotel was expensive, but reassuringly so. Am saving up to take my husband!

200,simply the best,"Stayed here recently to avail of the special offer with restaurant patrick guilbaud.  Without doubt the best hotel I have stayed in in Ireland.  Level of service is superb, rooms beautiful and the location excellent.  If only I could stay here every time I visit Dublin.
Go there if you can!",5,2009,08,03
200,Superb hotel in Dublin - highly recommended.  Just perfect!,"My husband & I stayed at The Merrion Hotel in Dublin for 5 nights for the U2 shows at Croke Park.  The hotel has superb reviews on Trip Advisor & this was one of the deciding factors for us to stay there - we were not disappointed.
From the very minute we stepped into the lobby the staff we extremely friendly, polite & ready to help with your every wish.
Our room was superb - spotless-clean, loads of space, luxury shower/bath room & everything you could wish for.  We asked for a laptop & tea/coffee facilities & these were brought to our room instantly at no extra charge for the duration of our stay.
The swimming pool is superb - a truly relaxing experience in the heart of this great city.
Highly recommend the Cellar bar - lovely food, great drinks & again, very attentive staff.
Would recommend this hotel as the best in Dublin (we've tried a few now) - can't wait to go back for the pampering & luxury treatment!",5,2009,07,30
200,Charming centre city hotel with wonderful art but seriously let down by slow service,Beautiful hotel and although staff are very polite and friendly the service is VERY SLOW!,4,2009,07,18
200,Top Class Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,Availed of the Merrion's Seven Star Steal Deal - overnight stay in the Merrion and 4 course surprise menu in Restaurant Patrick Guildbaud. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Very warm welcome and efficient check-in set the tone for the quality and friendly service afforded to us throughout. Dinner in Guilbauds was superb. Excellent breakfast the next morning. For the quality on offer this deal is exceptional value.,5,2009,07,13
200,A haven of luxury and tranquility,"We stayed at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin in May - it was rainy and cold. When we entered the hotel we were welcomed by no less than 3 wood-burning fireplaces, a complimentary drink, because we would have to wait for only 10 minutes for our room to be made up, and the most attentive staff. 
Our rate included a free bottle of champagne which was chilling when we entered the room. When we returned from an evening out, the ice had been replenished and the bottle was still lovely and cold! 
The following evening the waitress in the hotel bar even went to the restaurant downstairs to fetch a glass of the wine we had had with dinner, since they didn't serve it upstairs.
The Cellar Restaurant served a freshly prepared Irish breakfast with various breads, pastries, cereals, fruits and freshly squeezed orange juice. The perfect start to the day.

The Merrion is a lovely and quiet hotel to stay in, the website doesn't really do it justice, it's much cosier. And there's also a 2-star Michelin restaurant in the same building, if that's something you might be interested in (Patrick Guilbaud). It's about a 5-minute walk to the city centre, about 15 minutes to the busy Temple Bar district. The airport bus stops fairly close-by and the staff is exceptional. In other words - the perfect place to stay in Dublin!",5,2009,07,09
200,You should stay here if you can,"We didn't upgrade so we really had a very basic room for our 5-night stay, but the room and the entire hotel were wonderful.  The room was well-appointed and had a fabulous bathtub.  Housekeeping was immaculate.  Every employee we encountered was polite, knowledgeable and genuinely looked happy to be at work.

The primary reason for the trip was business, but my spouse and I stayed for a few days after the business was done.  The location was very good for sightseeing and getting about Dublin.  We ate one breakfast and one dinner at The Cellar restaurant, and had drinks in The Cellar bar as well.  Both meals were very good and the bartender gave exceptional service (can't recall his name, but he's from Vancouver, Canada). 

Had dinner at the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.  Both the food and service at Patrick Guilbaud were exceptional, and we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Guilbaud.  Rather than order a bottle of wine, we asked the sommelier to do wine pairings for each course; these pairings were a very well chosen and made the meal one of the highlights of our few days in Dublin.

Back to the Merrion itself.  I couldn't finish this review without commenting on the art collection.  (There is a guide to the art collection in each guest room and, if you plan to stay at the Merrion, it would serve you to read it as soon as you arrive.)  The art hanging in this hotel is extraordinary and it's a privilege to have it in such a public space that is not a museum.  It made every trip to the lobby an aesthetic adventure.  Knowing that there was art all over the hotel also made me want to explore hallways where I really didn't need to wander.  In fact, I had to go down to the CLOAKROOM to identify a piece of luggage and there were pieces hanging in that stairwell!!",5,2009,07,06
200,Excellent but needs a little tlc,"Stayed as part of a group of eight, for a long weekend and have to say that the hotel is a little tired looking externally. I don't doubt that it's a magnificent old hotel but a little tlc wouldn't go amiss.

The staff were, without exception, superb. Very attentive without being over-bearing and the little personal touches made all the difference.

I'd stay here agin but wouldn't pay the rack rate. A few deals are out there at the moment, some coupled with lunch at, (the two michelin starred), restaurant Patrick Gilbaud, which adjoins the hotel. Well worth a look.",4,2009,07,06
200,Out of this world,"My stay was back in 2008 and was out of this world. Stay was a surprise gift from a friend. Staff are 5* without a doubt. Had a garden view room, good size and comfortable. Afternoon Tea in the Drawing Rooms was a total delight. Will be back soon.",5,2009,07,02
200,seven star steal,"There was a special offer for B&B in this 5 star hotel with a surprise 4 (really 6 or 7) course tasting menu in the attached 2 Michelin star Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.  The hotel was excellent, staff were friendly and helpful without ever seeming fawning.  The pool and  gym were excellent and the spa looked good, as was breakfast. The meal in the restaurant was superb, perfect service from knowledgeable staff, the Maître d'  checked if we had allergies or dislikes before the meal, as it would be a surprise, and other people on the same package got different meals, so it was quite individual and the highest quality.",5,2009,07,02
200,A wonderful experience,"Having stayed in many quality hotels around the globe, The Merrion is definitely up there with the best.The staff were nothing short of excellent and their attention to detail was second to none.It would be difficult not to stay at The Merrion on any other visit to Dublin.",5,2009,07,01
200,Loved The Merrion,"I just loved everything about this hotel. The Doorman was so lovely and sweet throughout our stay and all the staff were really brilliant. We had a room overlooking the garden and it was hard to leave it after the 3 days. We ate in the downstairs restaurant - The Cellar which has really cool vaulted ceilings and the wine bar next door still has the original stone work which I love. The food was fantastic and I couldn't get over the prices, it was so cheap! I'll definitely be back!",5,2009,07,01
200,excellent hotel,"I have nothing but good things to say about The Merrion, it was excellent.  We travelled with our 22 month-old daughter and the touches the added for her made me a fan forever.  There was a tiny robe and slippers for her in the wardrobe as well as a range of baby toiletries and a beautiful cot made up for her.  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  The bed was enormous and our room overlooked the gardens.  Finally, breakfast was delicious.  We'll definitely stay there again, loved it.",5,2009,06,23
200,Great weekend break,"Lovely hotel and fantastic service in the centre of Dublin. Great hotel for a weekend break or business in the city, quite pricy but worth it for the quality",5,2009,06,19
200,17.06.2009 The Leading Hotels of the World - Showcase for Leaders Club Members! Simply sublime!,"We know now the Merrion Hotel Dublin for years and it is always a pleasure to visit this superb Leading Hotel of the World. This time around we had a invitation to the Leading Hotels of the World Showcase of fine Hotels from Europe and Africa. The Showcase was presented to Leaders Club Members only and was held in Nr. 24 of the Merrion Hotel - this is the Ballroom section of the hotel. We have met with representatives from many Member Hotels incl. the Puente Romano in Marbella, The Gleneagles in Scotland, via the Halkin in London ( see our review from our stay at the Halkin in April 2009 here at Tripadvisor - see our profile ) to the Royal Mansour and the superb Westbury Hotel Dublin ( newly renovated at it' s best! ) and many other hotels to tend to at this very special event. We had the pleasure to be greeted by the Leading Hotels of the World Head of Sales for UK, IRELAND, SCANDINAVIA and SOUTH AFRICA Mr. M. Saleborn who is usually based in London plus many Members from around Dublin and Ireland. We also had received many information about the Merrion Hotel and all the other hotels plus many goodies incl. Key-rings, Brochures, Insider Tips, plans, travel planning and in-room product samples of shampoos and body lotions from the hotels featured at this very well done event at this stunning hotel in Dublin! We also had canapees plus Taittinger champagne, fine wine, salmon and orange juice on offer. The event was on for three hours and the time was super fast! That is always the case when people meet up who sincerely appreciate hotels around the world and talk about them in a meaningful way. Also happy congratulation' s to all members of the Leader' s Club who have won free nights at many hotels at the Raffle during the evening, Well done! As said earlier we have appreciated the Merrion Hotel for years now incl. drinks at the Nr. 23 Bar, Snacks at the Cellar Bar beside the Cellar Restaurant and we even had fine traditional afternoon not so long ago, we can very well remember this in the Drawing rooms and the Nr. 23! The service is always sublime and the building in itself was constructed out of fully restored Landmark buildings and comprise the historic wing and the newer garden wing plus a superb courtyard garden and 2 Michelin fine Dinning at Patrick Gilbaud Restaurant plus the Tethra Spa! The location is a powerful one incl. the office of the irish prime minister which is oppoite the hotel located plus many other government offices! Also only a few minutes from the Merrion Hotel is the famous St. Stephen' s Green Park - one of the finest inner-City Parks in Europe plus the very well known shopping street named Grafton Street is also only a short hop from the hotel plus pubs, shops, Brown Thomas - the most famous department store in Ireland - and the Trinity College, the National Gallery of Ireland and Temple Bar are only within 5 to 20 min. strolling or leisurely walking distance from the Merrion Hotel in the heart of Dublin which comes highly recommended for a visit or stay. We hope in the future we will attend more Leading Hotels of the World events because this is a optimal way to celebrate our Leaders Club Membership for a superb future and beyond. So do not forget to FLY!STAY!EXPLORE! MORE! and be open to explore the world local and global!",5,2009,06,18
200,Merrion is quality at a price,"The Merrion Hotel lives up to its ""Leading World Hotel"" status with both quality and price.

The beds are some of the most comfortable for nights of restful comfort. Rooms are agood size. The gardens and sitting rooms are excellent for business meetings and privacy. The location is most suitable for government meetings and business.

The hotel is not well situated for vacationers with long walks required to historic landmarks and the river area. The price is quite high and I am sure that one can find better value for their money in other parts of the city.",3,2009,06,16
200,Proper 5 star...,"With so many hotels masquerading as 5 stars it's always nice to experience the real deal, and that is what The Merrion really is.  A true 5 star experience from the valet parking to concierge to the restuarant staff you are truly made feel extremely welcome and that yur presence is appreciated.  The staff really cannot do enough without being overly attentive.  While there I ate it Patricj Guilbauds... food was flawless, which is to be expected in a 2 Michelin Star restuarant but the service offered my the maitre d and the waiting staff was above excellent.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough and along with the Dylan I would rate it as the best hotel in Dublin.",5,2009,06,11
200,"Excellent, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, just wonderful","The Merrion was a really lovely experience for my husband and I. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and its easy to see why the Merrion is rated as one of the 'Leading hotels in the world'. The ambiance, service and friendliness of the staff in a non intrusive way was really delightful. The facilities of the hotel are all of the highest standard as one would expect, its all the other little things that made the experience wonderful. The Patrick Guilbaud restaurant was simply exceptional, the food, staff and service simply fantastic......the painting throughout the restaurant and hotel were quite simply the icing on the cake. We will definitly be back.",5,2009,06,11
200,Great evening in Merrion Hotel.,"Myself and my wife wanted to have a night out and an evening meal in Dublin (without the kids). We choose the Merrion as they had a reasonable on-line room rate. www.merrionhotel.com  We arrived at the hotel and the doorman took my car keys and parked the car, which I didn't want to see till tomorrow anyway. Check-in was quick and it wasn't long till we were shown to our room. The bags were subsequently delivered promptly. We didn't go for anything fancy room wise, but were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and en-suite bathroom, which had a shower as well as a bath tub. The finishes in the room were exceptional, as being an architect I am quite critical. It had all the extras that you would expect from a Five star hotel. The room came with a city view as opposed to a garden view, lucky for us were not really interested in a room with a view. For a Friday evening the hotel had a quite atmosphere with open fires in the lounge areas, that look out onto the perfectly manicured gardens, in case you needed to have a smoke. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, nor Patrick Guilbaud's adjacent to the hotel. We dined only a short walk away in the Pearl Brassiere, a French restaurant with a fantastic menu and reasonable price, extensive wine list to cater for all budgets. Returning to the hotel we had a night cap in the now dimly lite and cosy lounge area before retiring to our room. We had a very relaxing stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a city centre hotel surrounded by plethora of great restaurants. We will be revisiting this hotel in the future.",5,2009,06,10
200,Wonderful Hotel in Central Dublin,"Beautiful hotel.  Had a warm greeting from the staff, although as is the want with hotels these days, the reception staff not Irish.. surely there must be some Irish people who speak French, German and American..! 
Beautiful drawing rooms with the smell of peat logs coming from the fireplaces gives it a warm relaxing atmosphere. Garden room was very comfortable. Dashed to the swimming pool to get over the journey, which was excellent. Steam room was also a plus.
Roast beef sandwich and a pint of Guiness served in the bar set me up for the day.  Late night cocktails in the relaxing bar ensured a very comfortable nights sleep.
I will return to be sure.",5,2009,06,10
200,WHAT A GEM!,"We stayed at the MERRION in Dublin just for one night because the hotel we had originally chosen had overbooked.

20 minutes after our arrival at the MERRION my family and I wished this hotel were our first choice (we spent 3 nights in Dublin): it is just an example of how a 5 star hotel should be.
If the amenities that are abundant and really first class can compare with other very good 5 stars, the difference at the Merrion is in the details and especially in the high quality of service.
When we arrived from the FITZWILLIAM’S, tired and disappointed by the fact that they were unable to check us in (see my other review), we were greeted by the staff of the Merrion. When they saw that we had a toddler with us and that he could not sleep in an ordinary bed (at the other hotel we were offered a tiny cot or a regular bed for grown up kids…), they realized they had been given the wrong instruction and guess what we found on our way back from dinner? A proper wooden child bed, with linen, a little bathrobe, little slippers and king size baby products for his bath. Needless to say that our little boy took a good bath and had a very good night sleep that night…

We had interconnecting room, very comfortable and quiet, decorated with a classic taste.
The rooms gave on the patio and were quiet, clear, and spotless.

The bathroom offers bath tub or shower, Irish soaps and shampoos, accessories of all kind.

The Cellar restaurant is just excellent. One thing we really appreciated is that the kid’s order was taken immediately and on his table 15 minutes afterwords. Once again, the porcelain and the cutlery are studied for kids and very tasteful.
If the Merrion hosts a very famous MICHELIN rewarded restaurant, the Cellar is also very good, the wine list very honest (it ranges from good reasonably priced house wine to very expensive and fantastic bottles), the food choice really satisfactory and the kids menu full of healthy choices (as opposed to the “junk food only” options we sometimes find). Breakfast which is taken in the same place is nice and the orange juice freshly squeezed. 

My little boy and I also spent a good hour in the fantastic swimming pool at the SPA: spacious, clean, good temperature, idyllic, when you think that it is located in the very heart of a capital town. The staff was again very attentive and offered me some swimming material for the kid.
It is a pity that we could not try the spa treatments!

Check out was good: concierge and staff gave us space for our luggage and the possibility to refresh us and the kids before we left. They were just waiting for an event to start but they took the time for us.

Our first choice had been the Fitzwilliam because it is literally across the street from St Stephen’s Green and it’s great when you have a toddler. Given our horrible experience there and our fantastic experience at the MERRION, we will certainly choose the MERRION should we go back to Dublin. It’s worth to take a 5 minutes walk to St Stephen’s Green and stay at the perfect place!",5,2009,06,09
200,"Impressive hotel, excellent facillities, good service","This is a very interesting hotel at a very good location. The rooms are very good, the facilities are exceprional, the staff is very friendly.",5,2009,06,05
200,Some problems - overcrowding and lounges full,"We thought this was a beautiful hotel but the overcrowding made it a problem for us (and we are used to european city hotels).

The cellar restaurant was too full and cramped during the weekend. The service suffered badly and I felt sorry for the staff who had really tried to provide a personal service during the week.  I would rather have had a small a la carte breakfast in one of the other public rooms. 

Just wished I had known, but then again, we had another problem.

In the public rooms we found that we could not get a seat due to the business meetings during the weekdays and then people dropping in for tea and drinks at the weekends. 

So the lovely turf fires (which we went to enjoy ) were not able to be enjoyed by us. 

This happens for most of the days we were there - a battle for space.

One day we tried early but could not get a seat in the public rooms because they were booked out and reserved by people not staying at the hotel -  there was simply no space. 

On the other days it was a battle to get anywhere to sit morning, noon or night. Once again, it was crowded by non residents.  In the evenings groups would come in and monopolise the space for hours loudly. The staff made no effort to recognise or help guests.

I understand that as guests we are paying for the public rooms and if the lounges are denied to us then it's a simple ripoff. 

Even when they were booked out by non-residents (at say) 3pm staff would not let us sit there earlier. They know of the problem as staff were non-existant at times and then very cold and unhelpful when they appeared.

Something is going on - a policy to keep residents out and get more paying non-residents in I suspect. What a cheek.

The hotel needs a ""residents-only"" lounge or special reserved seating for hotel guests. It also needs to be made clear that hotel guests are 2nd class citizens in these rooms until this happens.

The final insult was at checkout when the staff insisted on converting our bill to Sterling. We had booked in Euros and were not happy with both their insistance and the rate.",2,2009,06,04
200,"Great Hotel, very civilized and comfortable.",Have high tea in the afternoon. Very relaxing. Nice spa and pool. Breakfast is excellent.,5,2009,06,03
200,A perfect place to stay,"We stayed at The Merrion for 2 days at the beginning of our trip - and loved it so much we came back to Dublin early to stay another 2 nights.  The staff are gracious, know their city and make you feel very welcome.  The rooms with the turf fires were wonderful - a great place to relax and to meet with famly who live in Dublin.  We can't stay enough good things about this hotel.",5,2009,05,30
200,A wonderful place,"What a wonderful place we wanted to spoil ourselves in Ireland and found this great rate online at the Merrion for bed breakfast and parking.  We stayed for 4 nights and from the moment we arrived they could not do enough for us.  

The food and service was fantastic.

They truly are a five star.

Do yourself  a favour if you can afford a bit extra and get a good package stay at this wonderful place.",5,2009,05,30
200,"""Seven star"" stay",We stayed in the Merrion Hotel for just one night  recently as part of a special offer in conjunction with its Patrick Guilbaud restaurant (2 michelin stars). The hotel has a brilliant location in the city centre and is beautifully decorated with a great art collection. The rooms are probably in need of some updating at this stage but are very comfortable and clean. Service was impeccable - every member of staff we encountered on our way to our room welcomed us. Dinner was fabulous and the overall package (which I think runs until the end of July) was great value. Breakfast the next day was delicious with a great selection.,5,2009,05,29
200,Best in Dublin,"The ever burning, turf-fueled fireplaces in the public rooms provide a welcoming aroma and add to the traditional feel of the stately, but warm rooms in this expanded townhouse hotel.  Everything is first rate about the experience.  Cost is high -- only a reduced fare, multi-day package made it workable for us.",5,2009,05,27
200,Top Class Hotel,"The Merrion is a magnificent hotel in every way.  It is truly 5 star and it lived up to all our expectations.

The attention to detail and the service of the staff is superb. It is expensive but you are in a staying in a  top class hotel

If you want a 5 star experience, then this is the hotel for you.",5,2009,05,27
200,A home away from home in Dublin,The Merrion is the perfect spot from which to explore Dublin.  The service is suberb and the staff friendly.  I would wholeheartedly recommend it.,5,2009,05,25
200,A-MAZING,"we stayed at the Merrion (second stay) for three nights in April and enjoyed our stay.  Staff is every helpful from the minute you walk through the doors.  I lost my earring while I stay there and I called down to the front desk to see if anyone turned it in,  no on did but when I went to back track my steps I asked  staff in the restaurant if they seen an earring.  They told me, they were informed that earring was lost and they would look for it.  I couldn't believe that everyone knew about my lost earring.  Hotel is very close to downtown shopping (walkable)  which a plus!!!  I love this hotel!!!",5,2009,05,04
200,Great Trip to the Merrion Hotel,"we stayed at the merrion for 3 nights in april, it was a great stay with all the staff very helpful (even checking some info on the net for us). we had breakfast included in our tariff and it was fantastic, used the spa, the pool, cellar bar and the cellar restaurant and can not fault any of them. Expensive but as we discovered so was the whole of dublin. will go back when the pound and euro are more  amenable.",5,2009,04,30
200,"Fabulous, but avoid Cellar Restaurant","The Merrion is a delight.  Beautiful surroundings, attentive service, and a great central location.  The staff was superb and deserve all the accolades offered.  The only disappointment--and quite a pricey one--is the Cellar Restaurant.  The Cellar Bar is a great spot for a drink, but avoid the food which is uninspired, greatly overpriced, and inedible in a couple cases.  Service at the restaurant is also not in the same league as upstairs.  In a nearly empty room, it was clear that everyone wished we would finish and leave.",5,2009,04,27
200,Dublin heaven - supreme service quality,"There is only one hotel in Dublin for me and that is the Merrion.  I have tried most of the others and they simply do not come close.  The service and the amosphere are what makes the place special.  You could be there for a formal dinner, a spa retreat, a business trip, a drink before the rugby - whatever - it is always a good experience!",5,2009,04,25
200,Very nice but a bit over hyped,"Because of the reputation this hotel has, we expected something out of this world (it has been voted the best leading hotel in world for the last two years).
We thought it was very nice and we were very pleased with our stay but we didn't feel as amazed as some of the reviewers. The room was very nice but we thought the staff were a bit arrogant and didn't come up to scratch a few times (check in and afternoon tea especially). For this reason it didn't achieve full marks in all categories. Our low mark on value was down to the very poor exchange rate with the pound so isn't the fault of the hotel.",5,2009,04,19
200,"Best Hotel we've ever stayed in, nothing else comes even close.","What can I say? We've stayed in many five star hotels across the world, including many around Ireland. Some examples include the oldest and most talked about in Berlin, the Kempinski Berlin, Sheen Falls Lodge in Kenmare, Dromoland Castle, The Plaza Hotel in New York City, The Athenaeum in London and the Dorchester to name just a few!

Without a doubt, the service in The Merrion beats any of these other top-class, award-winning hotels. On arrival with out two-year old daughter and two older children, the receptionists and the manager greeted us and named each and every one of us as if we were regular visitors each month.

Those who say this wonderful hotel isn't suitable for children are greatly mistaken. The manager himself brought the kids to a treasure chest full of expensive teddy bears and children's books that were theirs to keep on departure. 

There's also no doubt that the Merrion is probably the most expensive hotel we've stayed in as well. For three nights in December,  with a large suite and interconnecting room for the children, it came to nearly €4000. 

Afternoon tea is superb and easily beats Hayfield Manor, which is renowned for it's afternoon tea as well as the Westbury, a competing hotel in Dublin, which disappointed us with it's so-called pleasant experience.

Breakfast was also superb and dinner in both restaurants is literally unbeatable only by the top restaurants in the continent. 

The decor in the room was classic and beautiful, and the maids employed were just as incredible as the other staff.

Being close to the heart of Ireland's government and being less than four minutes walk from the main shopping street, you really can't get better than the Merrion.

The touches at this hotel make a difference. Instead of an artificial tree like every other boring, typical five star, we arrived to the smell of fir, while the manager and staff were personally decorating the tree with beautiful baubles.

Altogether an unmissable experience, and we're disappointed with every other hotel we've visited since.

Go there.",5,2009,04,13
200,Never disappoints,"I stayed in the Merrion hotel on the 6th of March for the Andrea Botecelli concert. Whenever I get the chance to stay over in Dublin I book the Merrion. It is always consistently good and did not disappoint this time. The hotel has addressed the problem of the recession by offering great deals without quality or service being in any way diminished. Check in was smooth and efficient and the fact that I had stayed on a number of occassions was immediately recognised even the concierge staff seemed to know who I was! The room was immpecable with a welcome note from the management welcoming me back.

We had a beautiful late lunch in the bar and the food was superb as was the wine.when we got back from the concert my friend had a cesar salad with freshly cooked breast of chicken.

The breakfast the next morning is the best that I have had in any 5 star hotel and set us up for the day and I didn't eat until 7pm.",5,2009,04,08
200,Now I know what it feels like to be treated as Royalty,"I can't say enough about The Merrion.  It was hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  The staff was amazing!!  My 8 year old daughter lost her little stuffed animal outside the hotel upon  arrival.  She was very upset.  The staff found it outside in the street and tracked us down to return it!!  The hotel has amazing service and every aspect of our stay was outstanding.  The pool is the breathtaking and very relaxing.  The rooms were perfect.   When I return to Dublin, The Merrion Hotel will be my first chose of hotels..",5,2009,04,01
200,Fantastic service,"Beautiful hotel. Staff can't do enough for you. Loved the pool. I can recommend booking a massage. Quiet and select , yet very near to main shopping area. Breakfast was amazing, so was high tea and the michelin restaurant next door was superb....Can't wait to go again.",5,2009,03,15
200,Beautiful historic hotel,"Our stay in the Merrion was perfect. Excellent service, lovely staff, beautiful hotel and great room.Hotel is full of atmosphere and feels like a place of style and elegance. The location is perfect. We had a special winter rate which made our stay a great weekend deal not to be missed. The hotel has a beautiful swimming pool. The Cellar restaurant serves outstanding food during our visit a special menu from Ken Hom. Also there is well acclaimed Michelin starred restaurant Patrick Guilbauld which we haven't tried. I have no hesitation to recommend this hotel,",5,2009,02,01
200,Perfect,"Booked with Amex Platinum Card Travel Serviceand enjoyed an up-grade to a Junior Suite in the Main House, complimentary Breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant and also free lunch one day which we were unable to take as we were out of the Hotel during the day.
I fully endorse previous reviews commending all of the Staff,.
We had most contact with Concierge, Cellar Restaurant and Front Desk
Every single Staff Member that we came into contact with appeared to take great pleasure in looking after us. A massive change from most hotels. The level of service was every bit as good as that in The Mandarin and Peninsula in Hong Kong both of which are renowned throughout the world.
The Main House is old, so is a little quirky and there is a trek to reach the Cellar Restaurant but the food, service and ambience are all great. 
We usually eat in a hotel once and explore other restaurants in the town on the other nights but enjoyed the Cellar Restaurant so much that we took all of our meals there.
We just loved this Hotel !",5,2009,01,28
200,Comfortable and fabulous fires,Stayed at the Merrion for two nights as part of a business trip. The room was very comfortable and pool very relaxing before a pre-dinner cocktail in the bar. Turf in the bar and the drawing room filled the place with a delicious aroma and much needed warmth. Excellent art collection. Bar nuts the best in Dublin.,5,2009,01,06
200,This must be the best hotel in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at the Merrion for 3 nights over New Year.  We were absolutely delighted with everything from the moment we made our first booking enquiry until we left the hotel.
The location of the hotel is great - just off Merrion Square, a couple of minutes walk to St Stephens Green and 5 minutes to the shops on Grafton Street..  The atmosphere in the hotel is wonderfully peaceful and relaxing with real fires and lovely places to sit and relax.   We particularly loved the service and afternoon tea in the Drawing Room.  The breakfasts served in the Cellar Restaurant are good too.  The New Year dinner (again in the Cellar Restaurant) was exceptionally good.  None of the staff gave the impression of being hard done by, having to work late New Year’s Eve and then start  early New Year’s Day.  They must have been exhausted but still smiled and were anxious to please.
We stayed in a superior double in the Garden Wing and booked direct with the hotel.  It was not cheap but we got a reasonable deal and were more than happy that it represented value for money.
The hotel is great but it was the staff that made our stay so memorable and enjoyable.  The staff seem proud to work at The Merrion and they do their utmost to give the best possible service.  Overall staying at the Merrion was a wonderful experience that we would love to repeat.",5,2009,01,05
200,Outstanding service,"Just returned from memorable stay at the Merrion. Location, character and well-maintained state of property were all that could be wished for. In particular we were impressed by the outstanding art collection and quality furnishings which gave the hotel an individual character that we have rarely experienced elsewhere. What most impressed, however, was the professionalism and courtesy of all the staff, notably the front desk and concierge. All requests were promptly and efficiently dealt with, and in a friendly and individual manner that made us feel most welcome. Would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel as an elegant base in central Dublin.",5,2009,01,04
200,"Good hotel, but quiet noisy rooms","I was in November for one night at The Merrion in Dublin. This was my second visit to the hotel. It is an upper-class and very well located hotel. Service is excellent, with the exception of one person at the desk, but that happens. In a nutshell here are some pro's and con's:

PRO's:
* it's - like the taxi driver said - an exclusive place
* perfect location
* very good french restaurant linked to the hotel (expensive, but really good)
* nice sitting area with open fires and good tea

CON's:
* i did not like the comfort of the room, ok it was near to the elevator, but i could hear far too much things from the corridor. the room itself was quiet noisy, with some elements. this should be better for a five star;
* while most things where very clean, not everything was perfect and this should be perfect at this level;
* breakfast was limited. there was a lot of hot options, but i am not into that and the continental breakfast was too limited.",4,2008,12,10
200,Beautiful city centre retreat,"Treated ourselves to a night away thanks to a gift voucher we had received. The hotel is in a great location for St Stephen's Green and Grafton St and there are loads of top class restaurants nearby. Check in was smooth and the receptionist walked us to our room - we were in the standard room i.e. non garden view. Room though was lovely and no complaints. 
Nice health club and swimming pool with beautiful changing rooms and showers etc. Spa area looked nice too. Cellar Bar downstairs is very quaint with lots of little snugs for privacy if required. Cellar bar has good reputation for food too - we had already booked the nearby Town Bar & Grill which I can highly recommend ! Up another level on the dining stakes is Restaurant Patrick Gillbaud (Michelin stars) which is part of the hotel. Check out the prices ! although I understand they do a terrific 3 course lunch for €50 ? We loved the hotel's tea rooms and reception rooms which while smallish were very comfortable  and had a lovely atmosphere with the smell of the turf open fires etc. All staff were very friendly and efficient. Nothing is cheap it has to be said but this is a Dublin 5* so what do we expect. Bruce Springsteen always stays here while he is in town so if it's good enough for The Boss it's good enough for me ! and Bobby McGee  (sorry couldn't resist that !)",4,2008,12,08
200,Nice but overrated,"Good quality hotel, and friendly staff but nothing exceptional for a 5 star. Also, for a 250 euro room I would have expected breakfast to be included. One issue we had was that although we booked a non smoking room we were sent to a smoking room on check in. Called the desk they said again it was a non-smoking room but when they came up to help us move they finally agreed it was was in fact a smoking room. Moved to a smaller room but were told on checking out it had the same price rating. Offered an upgrade next time but don't think I'll bother with next time. Overall, not hugely impressed.",2,2008,11,27
200,Dublin STYLE.,"A fine experience . Large Irish art collection.Good location.
Perhaps the public areas are too small for the crowd.Guest bar and front drop off area included.
Our ""Garden"" room had only a side street view , but was quiet.
The bathroom excellent.
Do find the money for the 2 star French restaurant , possibly the most stylish and best service I can remember.
Warm swim pool.
Staff faultless but not Irish.",5,2008,11,25
200,"I was robbed in my hotel room this week, so be careful!","Just to alert your readers....
While the hotel is lovely, I woke up to find a man in my room who fled with my laptop on Thurs, Nov 20th. The hotel has been good about replacement, but they need to do a thorough review of their staff and security procedures.",2,2008,11,24
200,Old time style and efficiency,"Despite Dublin's eye-watering expense it's still possible to stay in this lovely city at not vastly overinflated prices. We booked 4 nights at the Merrion over the internet and stayed for the price of 1 night as advertised by the hotel's website for a deluxe room.

Check-in was seemlessly efficient. The very helpful receptionist gave us a guided tour of hotel and room and arranged for a DVD player to be delivered to our room within 10 minutes of our request being made. 

The public areas are beautifully decorated and the smell of open peat fires adds a certain charm with the result that the areas can be somewhat crowded with non residents wishing to share in the experience.

The room overlooked the beautiful garden although there was also a free view of an airconditioning plant and glass recycling point. The room was well appointed with an enormous comfortable bed with high standard 5* amenities. The decor is individual with original local prints adding to the charm. The grandeur is however slightly faded and a refit is probably due for soft furnishings such as the carpet.

The spa has a generously sized pool compared with other hotels of similar standard.

Overall, a most enjoyable and comfortable stay in a charming and friendly staffed hotel. However, it would be easy unless cautious for added food and drink costs to spiral. Breakfast is not included and as always minibar and room service prices are a trap for the unwary. It would have to be a mighty fine pizza to earn its €24 price tag!",4,2008,11,23
200,Absolute Quality!,"My partner and I have just returned from a long weekend at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin.  
Everything about this hotel from arriving at the front desk to the check out has been top class. 
The staff at this hotel are some of the most attentive and customer service faced individuals that I have experienced in any hotel throughout the world.  

The greeting at the front door, and being whisked away to our room, with a full room orientation was very welcoming and no problems at all with an early check in as we arrived at 10am.  The hotel is basically made up of several Georgian town houses with all the traditional features that you would expect from a period property in the centre of Dublin. Only 5 minute walk from St Stephen's Green / Trinity College and the shopping streets of Dublin.  The National Gallery and Parliament buildings are directly opposite the hotel.  The Dublin Tour buses run from outside the hotel entrance, and the horse drawn carriage rides operate from outside St Stephen's Green. 

The room was luxurious, with marble bathrooms including a shower and bath. Ask for a room looking over the gardens as these are beautiful.   The staff offered a turn down service every evening and replaced towels twice a day.  

I mentioned that it was my partner's birthday, and we were given a special present with balloons and even after a minor mishap with a wake up call we were presented with chocolates and afternoon tea at the Merrion including champagne.  

This hotel has a lovely spa with an infinity pool on the lower floor, several choices for restaurant and bars.  The public areas were traditional with log fires and comfortable armchairs and sofas. 

Afternoon tea is highly recommended, as the ambiance is second to none.  A harpist was playing on our last day at the Merrion.  Whenever you happen to see a member of staff, they always greeted you courteously and made you feel like you were in your own home. 

There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars within a 5 minute walk, so if the prices of the hotel food are too much you will be well catered for.  

The hotel deserves it's accolade for being part of the group of 'Leading hotels in the world' and I could not recommend this hotel more highly.  I would not hesitate to come back and wish to commend the staff for making our stay a most enjoyable and memorable experience.  I can't wait to make a return visit!",5,2008,10,07
200,"Excellent,  elegant  and  kidproof!","Have just spent a wonderful two nights at the Merrion. Mother who is
recovering from a stroke and has limited mobility, myself and four year old
daughter.
 
We used every hotel facility and without exception all were great from the
concierge service who answered e mail enquires before our stay which
enabled us to to make the very most of our weekend, the doormen who
graciously and without fuss escorted my mother, room service which has to
be the most prompt I have ever encountered ( pot of coffee and sandwich
from order to delivery 4mins!) , housekeeping - an ironing board and iron
brought set up and new can of spray starch provided in minutes.

We ate one night in the cellar restaurant which is very child friendly and
I thought represented excellent value for money, they even created a foil
handbag for my daughter to take away her delicious uneaten handmade cookies
that came with her dessert!

We stayed in a ground floor garden room which looked out over the courtyard
- we did not find air con at all noisy. We also made a great deal of use of
the the swimming pool which was very warm perfect for little one though i
think my daughter most enjoyed the freshly sqeezed orange juice and
complimentary fruit after just as much.

I do a ot of travelling for work and can say this is a truely great hotel I
will be rebooking",5,2008,09,12
200,wonderful indulgence,what a treat!  the smell of the peat fires - the excellent service - the location - wonderful - the room rate we got (direct enq to hotel by email) was good - tho tea and drinks anbd dinner are pricey - but the service was fab - (slightly complicated pricing plan for breakfast was anoying - and as with almost all hotels - they bill you for full breakfast and you have to point out if not the case! lovely pool under ground and drawing rooms are so relaxing and elegant to sit in before you go out - after you come back at night with a drink or for tea in the afternoon - bliss,5,2008,09,11
200,A lovely hotel with great staff,"This hotel was amazing, so much so that we did not want to leave!  The staff were extremely efficient and couldn't do enough to help.  The room was gorgeous.  

The Cellar Bar and Restaurant served lovely food and was ideal on our first night when we decided to go for a drink there as it was raining, it has a lovely, cosy atmosphere.

I can not recommend this hotel enough and would definitely stay there again.

I am very impressed.",5,2008,09,07
200,Try something else next time,"This property has the old Irish charm down to a tea. The smell in the lobby is breaktaking but the staff is not, they do not know what they are doing. The Cellar Restaurant and Drawing Rooms are great but I have not been to the Patrick Guilbaud restaurant. The room was old and boiling hot. The bathroom was small and old. Nice to have a pool. Good location.",4,2008,08,25
200,Fantastic!!,"We've just returned from the Merrion and it was absolutely perfect!!! Some reviews don't rate this hotel as 5 stars but we can promise you that it definately is. We e-mailed the hotel to ask if we could check in earlier as we had an early flight and although we couldn't check in immediately they said it would be ready within the hour and they could have our bags waiting in our room so while we waited we decided to go the National Gallery which is literally just down the street, when we returned 2 1/2 hours later we checked in to our lovely room, we had a superior garden wing room which we got an excellent deal for through expedia.  Our room was very spacious, clean and had a pretty view of the gardens, in short it was perfect for what we needed it for because lets face you really wont be spending alot of time in your room anyway but the hotel was still fabulous!!! Dublin has so much to offer and explore that it really is a brilliant destination for a fantastic weekend!!",5,2008,08,25
200,amazing hotel with superb service,"we stayed at the merrion for 2 nights. the rooms are lovely, the loos great and the food excellent. for me what made this hotel special, apart from proximity to the tourist areas, the decor, the gardens was...
we were due to leave dublin last eve but due to flash floods we missed our flight. we were unable to find a hotel room for the night and our airline provided chaauffeur wanted to dump us on the flooded streets at 9.30 pm and go home. we managed to persuade him to take us back to the merrion. There we were welcomed by the concierge, the front office and all the staff on duty. They unfortunately were totally booked but they took care of our luggage, we sat by the fire to warm ourselves and fed our teenage kids and ourselves while the front office staff called every hotel in dublin to find us a room for the night. After an hour of continous calls, they managed to find us a room.
To me what distinguishes a good hotel from a great hotel is how the staff handles situations when things go wrong. And Merrion came through with flying colours.",5,2008,08,10
200,Fabulous,"What an outstanding hotel!!!!!!!!
Classic elegance, great location, beautiful courtyard. Our room was extremely spacious and up-to-date. Great Cellar Restaurant and Bar. The drawing rooms were perfect for tea as well. There was a great spa and beautiful indoor pool. We avoided the Patrick Juilbard Restaurant because we were told by other travellers that it was too expensice for what you got. Other than that FANTASTIC!",5,2008,07,31
200,Wonderful Hotel,"This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel.  We booked direct on the hotel website and paid €199 room only for a Saturday night (26/7/08) which we thought was excellent value. The hotel itself, the staff, our room, everything in fact was of understated 5* quality. The valet parking service at €20 per night is very good value for the centre of Dublin. Our room was a good size and very comfortable. As breakfast wasn't included in the package we bought fresh pastries from M&S and just ordered coffee for 2 in the morning which at €13 was expensive but then you are staying in a luxury hotel so this is to be expected. There are lots of cafes in the area so if you wanted to go out for breakfast there are numerous options. We didn't eat at the hotel this time but we have previously dined in The Cellar Restaurant and the food was lovely and reasonably priced. The hotel is less than a 5 min walk away from lovely restaurants situated around St Stephen's Green where there is no sign of the Hen/Stag parties that Dublin is regretably famous for. We have stayed in a few different Dublin hotels over the last few years and this is undoubtedly the best. If you can get a good rate like ours and you want to enjoy a more ""refined"" Dublin experience then this hotel can't be beaten. If you want to be surrounded by rowdy, loud, late night party people then stick to a hotel in Temple Bar.",5,2008,07,29
200,Not So Sure,"Well this hotel was perfectly located, it was booked for my partners birthday. I was disappointed however with the lack of facilities within the room. We were told that we would have a playstation, wireless internet, dvd player and much more, however this was not the case when we arrived. The wirless was an extra 50 euro, no playstation and no dvd player not that these were required.
 The food was VERY expensive for example a tea was 7 euros, a full english breakfast was 29 euro, afternoon tea with a few pastries was 37 euro......, an evening meal for 2 was 150 euro.... hence eating elsewhere!!
The staff were very kind and helpful and couldnt do enough for you. The Spa area was fantastic, the pool and steam room were a delight and must be used by all. The gym was very small and very basic, but useable for a short stay.
We enjoyed our stay but would not stay again due the expense of food and drink and lack of facilities within the room. 
My advice is only go to this hotel if you are live up to the status of someone of wealth...",3,2008,07,26
200,What a Gem,"My husband and I just returned from a weekend stay at The Merrion and what a great experience we had.  From the moment we walked in, the staff was so helpful and gracious.  The hotel itself is beautiful with gorgeous living rooms with fireplaces where you can relax and have tea.  They also have a beautiful garden in the courtyard.  Besides the beauty of the hotel, I can't say enough about the concierge.  They went out of their way to make reservations for us and did it with a smile.  Anyone who claims this hotel is too expensive, I say ""you get what you pay for.""  I happened to get a great deal with Expedia however, I would have paid full price for a room at this hotel.  I will definitely return to Dublin someday and when I do I will definitely stay at the Merrion.",5,2008,07,25
200,A little bit of paradise in Dublin,"We were delayed on our trip throughout Ireland, thanks to the airline who decided to slam on their brakes midway through takeoff (london to dublin), and then had to go back to the gate to refuel (turns out, the air traffic controllers thought the plane behind us in line was a wee bit too close, so canceled our takeoff... so, i decided to just head to Dublin and carry on the following day... so, we decided to treat ourselves to a beautiful luxurious hotel... and chose the Merrion.... WOW!!  what a nice place to stay.  the staff was wonderfully helpful and accomodating.  they upgraded us to a very nice hotel room with a lovely view of the garden area.  

My 6 year old son called housekeeping to ask why they didn't put chocolates on the pillow at turndown, and they replied ""we just don't do that""  then about 10 mins later, some delivered a WHOLE BOX of delicious chocolate truffles!!!  we were blown away by that... it was entirely unexpected.  

Then we headed to the pool.... what a beautiful pool they have... and so nice and warm.  We didn't order any dinner (since we arrived so late)... oh yea, we got dinner around the corner at Hugo's... the concierge suggested it as a ""casual kid friendly"" place.  it really wasn't kid friendly, but the hostess was so incredibly helpful and ordered some fun food for my son... and, as it turned out... was a waste of time since what i ordered was perfect for him.  but, the Hugo was a REALLY good restaurant.... service, food (delish!!) but, fairly pricey for a ""casual restaurant"".. i think our check came to about $100 for one adult meal and one kid meal, plus a glass of wine.

but, back to the Merrion..... BEAUTIFUL, welcoming if not a bit dowagerish... my son and i were def the youngest people there... but, i appreciate the whole dowager thing.  

only negative was, the bed was a bit cold at night with just a thin sheet/blanket (no down comforter, like the Parkcity in London and Marriot everywhere)

we'll stay there again on our way back home..... cheers....",5,2008,07,23
200,Enjoyed this luxury hotel.,"This hotel was fantastic and we stay in many higher end hotels, mostly Fairmont. This is a wonderful luxury hotel.

I found the staff extremely friendly and attentive. I wanted to make tea myself so they brought cups and a kettle to my room and left it there for the full stay and replenished the cups and glasses on a twice daily basis.

The bathrooms are huge, the beds very comfortable and the breakfast fantastic. I had the best omelette in a long time there.

AS well, the place is an ""art gallery"" and there are areas you can relax in front of a fireplace and enjoy the elegance and ambience of this hotel.

I'm quite finicky about hotels but I must say the service and this hotel was great.",5,2008,07,22
200,"Hotel breaths History, but with many weaknesses NOT worth the money","Just back from staying in the Merrion in Dublin this week -
here is a quick summary -

- HOTEL
old building, with a lot of history and great decoration that is Ireland-relevant (postcards, Irish peace contract, etc) It even has its own art collection. nice folks on the frontdesk, lots of umbrellas available - and you will need them!

- ROOMS
As nobody sleeps in the hall - but in a room, this is where the weaknesses begin. And those who read my list of reviews do know, i usually do spend good money, but the Merrion @ 350 Euro -  really disappointed me! 
Bathroom appliances are a bit cumbersome and do not let you mix warm and cold in one waterflow; the shower's hot/cold is made of plastic! Sorry folks, this is 50'ies technology!
AirCon is noisy, and guess what, the flow of air's temperature is the same like in the room. Finally the double glazing is obviously much to modest to limit the noise from the street - but worse, i could hear folksspeak next door and in the hallway and in the floor above! So while the rooms are average / a bit smallish in size, they are nicely decoarated but does this help if you reach for a good sleep? No. This is really weak and I wonder how they get a 5* ever. (i left at 5.30 am twrds Airport)

- OTHERS
i had no chance to look into the Spa - nor did i try room sevice or the hotel restaurant.

- PATRICK GUILBAUD RESTAURANT - next to Merrion
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND anyone having time and enjoying a good food go visit the restaurant - signature dish is Lobster Ravioli which is very very smartly done - they do G&T foamy amuse geule - Excellent Strawberry Dessert ! 
The place holds 2 Michelin Stars and is worth the money -
so do not worry on spending 150Euro a head, you will remember it for some time!",2,2008,06,28
200,Wonderful with children,"The Merrion's website has a whole section dedicated to young travellers but I was very impressed by the way they handled my 3 girls aged 7, 4 and 7 months. The welcome from the doormen was genuinely enthousiastic despite the fact that this is a high end luxury hotel used by the upper end of Ireland's travellers.

The interconnecting rooms on the ground floor of the garden wing were perfect and the girls came back to find balloons and glasses of milk set out in their rooms and minature fluffy bath robes for them.  

The concierge recommended some good places for pizza (we found Pasta Fresca and the nearby Unicorn (very good) ourselves) and where to go and got us on the Viking Splash DUKW tour at very short notice.

In short - a highlight of an excellent holiday, expensive, but worth it.",5,2008,06,05
200,Worth every penny,"Our recent weekend trip to the Merrion hotel was a real treat.  While the rates advertised would normally prevent this venue being considered for a weekend in Dublin, a gift voucher meant we could indulge.  And voucher or not we will definately be back.  From the moment we pulled up outdise the hotel we were treated like royalty.  The staff could not have been more welcoming or professional and we highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious treat.  We ate in the cellar restaraunt which was relatively reasonable price wise and spent a relaxing evening spotting minor Irish celebrities in the cellar bar! The pool was one of the most pleasant I have enjoyed so bring your swimming gear!  Location wise the Merrion is ideal to explore the Dublin area and we also recommend the restaraunt ""Fire"" at the mansion house for your second nights meal rounding off a fantastic Dublin weekend.  One tip, the breakfasts at the hotel were ridiculously expensive but there are a number of small cafes very close to the hotel so you have options.",5,2008,05,23
200,Disappointed by lack of front of house staff!!,"The hotel knew of my arrival including approximate time as they had booked the chauffuer service from the airport for me.  Depsite this I had to let myself out of the car because there was no doorman at the front of the building to welcome me to the hotel.

Once I had booked and paid for my night stay at the hotel, I was expected to find my own way to my room and carry my own bags.

I had an excellent meal at the Cellar Resturant with a good selection of food and drink, however, when I wanted after dinner coffee in the drawing room there were no chocolate or other petite four to accompany it.

The deluxe room I had was faultless, excellent furnishing and decor.

Considering that the hotel advertises itself as Dublin's most luxurious five star hotel, I didn't feel I got the full benefit of it.",2,2008,05,21
200,A true home from home,"I have been at the The Merrion just once before, in late 2007. This time, as soon as I had stepped in through the door, it felt like I had not been away .... a home from home.

This hotel is so very welcoming, with bags of charm and individuality, that you loathe having to check out at all.

I arrived early afternoon, I was shown to my room - a garden view, which is well worth requeting because the rooms give out onto the central garden courtyard, which is another unique element of charm at this hotel.

I unpacked and noticed a shirt was fairly creased, so requested an iron and ironing board. Within just 3 minutes there was a knock at the door - the iron had been delivered in double quick time. Once I had finished I left it out in the hallway and wondered how long it would take before it was taken away.

After doing some paperwork in my room, I prepared to go to the swimming pool. The Merrion boasts one of the best hotel pools I have come across (a full 15 metres long), together with a decent enough gym and sauna. As I closed the bedroom door behind I noticed something - the ironboard and iron had already been cleared away!

That evening I dined out with a couple of colleagues, so I have no judgement of the restaurant. However, the next day we had a very early breakfast there, which was excellent. A full buffet with excellent juices, fresh fruits, cereals, yoghurts, pastries, breads, cold meats, smoked salmon, etc etc - too much for me!! And doesn't include the cooked food you can order ....

As I left my bedroom to go and check out, I walked through the glass coverd walkway to the reception, glanced over one last time to the see the bronze statue of James Joyce in the garden, wondered through the sitting room areas, with the smell of the previous evening's peat fire still lingering, and I though t to myself..... ""how long before I return to this wonderful home from home?""",5,2008,05,14
200,some of the best service you will find,"This is my second visit to this hotel - fantastic service and great room.

IMO this represents the best hotel for service in Dublin. Also, the location at the top of merrion square is very good.

If one is looking for a buzzier environment - the Shelbourne is a better bet - the public areas of this hotel are very reserved.

I will definitely return",5,2008,05,03
200,Old-style luxury,"This is a lovely hotel. The service is friendly and efficient and the decor subtile and relaxing.  We had an unexpectedly decent evening meal in the Cellar Restaurant, and I was especially impressed with the way that the Matre D' handled a crying baby (why on earth do people take noisy babies into otherwise relaxed restaurants in the evening?) which could easily have ruined the experience.

The garden rooms, which overlook a closed planted courtyard, are quiet and refined. It's a shame that the internet service is extorionate, and the business centre only had one working PC - which (as is always the case) was always in casual use. Following the modern trend of free wi-fi in rooms would add that perfect finishing touch.",5,2008,05,01
200,"Overpriced, disappointing","Stayed here for a weekend but was very disappointed unfortunately. The hotel is in a great location but is now dated and hugely overpriced. Service is ok, 'spa' & pool area is grubby, broken tiles showers, needs to be painted etc. Couldn't recommend it unfortunately.",1,2008,04,30
200,They could've been a contender...,"I can well understand the attraction of the hotel.   It's a handsome hotel in a good location in Dublin.   However my personal experience left much to be desired.  

First -  The room we were given smelled badly from the paint renovations ongoing in the hotel.  We were given another room and guess what - next day - they started painting on the floor we were now on. 

Second- I discovered I had left an important item in the hotel after checking out.    Upon telling the hotel we were promised it would be arranged to be sent to me the next day (200 miles away -same country).   That should have been it,  but after that first promise it took an avalanche of emails and phone calls to finally put that that relatively simple request into action.   Do you want it messengered for only 450 Euros,  we were asked.  We politely replied when would it arrive?   Tomorrow  was the answer.  Perhaps you should look into overnight delivery services, then.  Good idea - okay that would be 65 Euros.

The last straw was an email we received from the hotel's security department asking us to prove the items were ours.  Gosh .... I've- described the items - they were found in the room in which I was staying last night - perhaps you want me to take a lie detector test.   

The situation was finally resolved when the hotel we now staying at told the Merrion that Ireland guaranteed postal delivery would arrive the following day at a total cost of 8 Euros - which it did.  

I hate to sound so finicky -  There certainly is a lot to like about this hotel and I wouldn't expect my experiences to be commonly repeated.  However 5 star hotels with 5 star prices should be able to live up to  high standards.",3,2008,04,28
200,recommended,"we stayed with our 18month girl for a weekend. everything was wonderful about this hotel and id love to give 5 stars, except one ot two things let it down.
firstly, the air con! as someone else mentioned ealier not only is it noisy but it pumps cold air when you need it warm and vice versa. but we did get a complimintary upgrade to a suite which ofcourse was lovely, but the only view from the Apsley suite is of a car park!! but this is really nick pickin, the ambience, food, location, rooms and particularly the staff are all excellent. highly recommended.
  
.",4,2008,04,21
200,A Welcome Smell of Paint,"When I last reviewed the Merrion, I thought it was beginning to look tired.  It still is but there is now at least some work being done in refreshing the rooms or at least the paintwork. Perhaps I am a bit more mellow as it is still a cool time of year and one does not have to endure the hopeless air conditioning system which makes a summer stay much less appealing.

My current niggle is with housekeeping.  From the moment they start servicing the rooms, the corridors are littered with used towels and bedding, the debris from uncleared room service and hoovers.  This is for much of the day and makes it more hostel and less hotel. Surely, it would be possible to clear more regularly or provide the cleaning staff with a cart to help them move the detritus around the hotel.

Hotel transfers to and from the airport are expensive at over Euro 100 each way but fast and efficient.  Most importantly they always use the cross-harbour tunnel which most taxi drivers dislike using because they prefer their passengers to remain trapped as they inch through Dublin's traffic chaos. Taxis are a discrace in Dublin, dirty interiors for the most part and if one is really unlucky a driver who is coming close to his annual bath date.  In fact, Euro 100 is a bargain.",3,2008,03,01
200,Amazing Old World Hotel,"Spent a few days prior to Xmass here and couldn't have been happier. The place is amazing and what a top of the line hotel should be. Rooms are exceptional w/ high-end linens, amazingly comfortable beds and beautiful bathroom.  We arrived enjoyed tea in the lobby in front of a peat fire while our luggage was taken to our room. We arrived to find out clothes hung, suitcases opened and toiletries laid out...that's service.

Location is great right in the heart of old Georgian Dublin. The staff was friendly and accommodating in every way possible. Will definitely go back even if we have to pay full rate (got a great pre-holiday deal).",5,2008,02,21
200,Great stay,"Stayed here for an anniversary with two other couples over Christmas.

Upon arrival our car was looked after and we were offered help with our bags.

We were delighted to find a gift of some complimentary strawberries and other goodies in our room for our anniversary. This was a lovely touch.

The room itself (in the garden room) was well appointed with a big comfy bed and a nice bathroom.

A brief trip to the pool confirmed that it is a nice place for a swim, but the facilities do pre-date the 'every hotel has a spa' syndrome that has struck Ireland so perhaps could be updated.

The cellar bar is great for a drink before heading out for the evening, however we were disappointed that all the seats except those at the bar had been reserved in advance. We weren't staying there long but if we had been this would have been annoying.

Breakfast the next morning was fantastic, with a wide choice of made to order dishes available and briliant attentive service.",5,2008,02,20
200,"Comfortable, pleasant stay","Impeccable service as soon as we stepped out of the cab. I loved the large marble bathroom with seperate tub. My husband and I look young for our age, and sometimes get treated like teenagers at nice European hotels, but not at the Merrion. Everyone was very nice helpful and friendly.  

I am an American expat and like to travel around Europe during the weekend as time permits. The Merrion definitely tops on my list!",5,2008,02,07
200,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed for one night just before Christmas and it was a wonderful experience, only wished we could have stayed longer.

We arrived in a bedraggled state having just crossed from the UK on a horrible ferry crossing, my little boy had been very ill and was wearing a t-shirt and nothing else, not what you want when you arrive somewhere like this!!! However the staff could have not been more lovely to us, explained what happened and even though we were early within ten minutes we were sitting in our suite with the conceriege having arranged to valet our car, clean our clothes and food on the way, I was particurarly impressed as it was two days before Christmas and there was a note in the room saying same day laundery etc was not available but they managed to do it for us, excellent service.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite overlooking the Irish Parliament, it was a gorgeous room, decorated in a classical style, huge Xmas tree in the room, lovely big comfy sofas and a seperate dining area. Our lunch was excellent, very tasty and prompt.

Bathroom was lovely and big, bedroom not overly big but enough room to fit a cot into for our little boy, two well stocked mini bars with everything you could wish for.

All of the staff were so pleasent and welcoming and it was lovely to go to an Irish hotel and see Irish staff!!! The hotel is a series of old Georgian house joined together and it has a wonderful charm about it.

We had dinner in the Cellar Restuarant that night and this was my only disappointment, it was good but not great, a limited menu and the food just didn't quite do it for me, next time I would try the Michelin start restuarant.

Next morning we had breakfast in our room which was excellent, lovely and hot and a really nice Irish fry, then unfortuantely it was time to go, I really did not want to leave.

On departure the assistant manager who had checked us in the day before came out to the car to enquire about our son and to make sure everything with our stay had been okay! Now that is truly good service.

Yes it is not cheap but when you receive service like this you don't mind paying for it, I would recommend it and can't wait to go back.",4,2008,01,30
200,Best Hotel In Dublin,"Fantastic place, lovely rooms, staff cant do enough.
I definately recommend lunch in the vaults, really nice honest food, not cheap but worth it!",4,2008,01,20
200,"Great place to stay, great service","This is a very nice place to stay if you do not want to be in the downtown overpriced  touristy part of Dublin.  I noticed the complaints that the hotel is far away from the downtown area, which is actually a blessing.  Be a smart tourist and figure out the public transportation!

The location, in Ballsbridge is fantastic with 6 pubs/eatery's within a 10 minute walk.  It is a quiet part of the city, away from the drunks, tourist traps.  The eatery's there are not touristy, and are frequented by the locals.  You will pay the local prices for beer and food.

The staff is outstanding, offering that personal service that you don't get with a large hotel chain.  

The free breakfast in the morning is very good, we had each morning the 'full Irish breakfast' which was to die for.

The rooms were fully furnished, very nice bathrooms, comfortable beds and cable TV.  Every day the rooms were cleaned (they even folded our clothes).

LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.  Yes, the hotel is far from downtown if you are walking but if your a savvy tourist like me you have the public transportation figured out before you get there.  A simple hop on the number 4, 7, or 45 bus is only 10 mintues to the main square and O'connel Street.  If you have a family, buy a bus rambler which only costs 8.50 Euro and covers two adults and 3 children under 16. It is good for a whole day, and worth every penny.

I highly recommend this hotel for anyone, especially if you have a family.  We have been there twice now and will definately be return customers again.",5,2008,01,16
200,"Wow, this is special","We stayed one night and wow this is a special hotel. If you want Dublin at its best this has got to be the hotel. From the strat, there was valet service for the car, the staff were extremely professional and courteous - the best I have experienced in any hotel in the world. The hotel inside is a special place and the afternoon tea is a must. Everything in the city centre is within walking distance, shops, museums, the government buildings etc. The Garden room we booked was very nice although it didn't have the wow factor that the rest of the hotel has (bathroom was fab though). While we were there a couple of known faces in the government and Irish television walked past. As the service and hotel was so good I am sure that anyone who plans to stay there won't be let down.",5,2008,01,14
200,Amazing,"What a truly wonderful hotel, perfect for our honeymoon.  I have stayed in many hotels throughout the world and can safely say that this is the best.  I can't wait to go back for our first anniversary.

We pulled up outside and were immediately greated by a friendly member of staff who kindly parked our car for us.  As we walked in we were welcomed by friendly staff in an impressive, warm reception area.  They could not have been more accommodating for the whole stay.

We were shown to our room and our bags arrived shortly afterwards.  In the room was champagne, flowers, a wonderful selection of fruit and a book of romantic poetry.  The room was spacious, glamorous and presented to a very high standard.  As I walked around I thought that this is what it must be like to be rich and famous.  What a fantastic room, what a wonderfully comfortable big bed,  what an amazing marble bathroom with all fixtures and fittings.  The room was spotless, I can not fault this hotel at all.

I looked out of the windows and enjoyed the views over the well manicured garden.  This hotel has an amazing family feeling to it, I had only been there a few minutes and it felt fabulous.

We ordered room service and selected various foods from the extensive menu.  We weren't disappointed, the food was perfect, beautifully presented and it melted in your mouth, needless to say we had quite a lot of room service during our stay and were constantly amazed at the presentation and quality of the food.

Highly recommended",5,2008,01,07
200,Very good and luxurious hotel,"Lovely rooms, great lobby and restaurants, location good for site seeing as well as shopping in Grafton street but quiet enough to feel almost outside the city..

Dinner in the Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud is highly recommended",5,2007,12,03
200,This is truly an extraordinary place to stay,"We just returned from this wonderful hotel.  My partner summed it up best when we answered the hotel's Survey.  ""The only way this hotel could be better is if the rooms were free"".  It's an amazing experience to have this kind of service is such delightful surroundings.  We stayed here two nights in one room, then checked out to go to the West of Ireland and checked back in for a second two nights.  Our first room was on the third floor of the main building.  This lovely room overlooking the Irish Parliament was made available to us before 11:00 am.  After our transatlantic flight in Coach class, this was very welcome.  Our second room was even grander--a wonderful high-ceilinged room on the 2nd floor overlooking the very attractive gardens. We are members of the Leader's Club of the Leading hotels of the World and do not hesistate to join if you frequent their properites.  We were given fruit and chocolates as our gift amenity on our first stay.  When we returned the second time we were greeted with an Irish Porter cheese, fruit, chocolates, a bottle of Guiness and, we guess in honour of Thanksgiving, a little American flag.  Our luggage, the bulk of which we'd left behind before heading west, was delivered to our room within five minutes of our arrival.  I truly cannot say enough good things about this place.  It is pricey (as is Ireland with the dollar in the state it is) but worth every Euro we spent.
Do not miss this marvellous place if you have the chance to stay there.  We miss it already!",5,2007,11,26
200,The Merrion must have seen better times. the heating system is a night,"The hotel has a very good location, more or less in the center of town. The stuff is more than friendly but this can not help if the heating system does not work, is very  loud and the not working aircondition system adds noise one does not need in the middle of the night. The rooms needed a complete renovation specially the tubes. One could here if someone in the hotel is having a shower or is going to the bathroom. The breakfast is much too expensive. 25 Euro for fruits and sweets is not appropriate. We changed the room 4 times. We will never go back to this hotel. They knew about the rooms and the problems, did agree with everything we told them but asked for the whole price. The hotel was recommended by our friends. THey will not come back again.",2,2007,11,26
200,Absolutely Beautiful!,"The Merrion is outstanding in every way! Upon arrival from the U.S. and arriving at 5:30 am the staff rushed to get us into a room and did so as early as 9:30...just make sure you ask for early check-in before you arrive. The staff was curteous and went out of their way to help with luggage, hailing taxis, etc. Concierge was perfect..making dinner reservations and travel accomodations painless! 
The location of the hotel is perfect...do not rent a car because you will not need it! Everything is within walking distance to this hotel!
We had huge room overlooking the gorgeous gardens. The bathroom was absolutely spotless as was every little part of The Merrion. The toilet was a little stubborn..the handle would have to be held down to flush completely. Sparkling brass all over...not a fingerprint in sight! 
The drawing rooms are spectacular, complete with a burning turf fire. Nothing but relaxing! The spread at afternoon tea is impressive...but at a price!
Overall The Merrion is stunning and we would not hesitate to stay there time and time again!",5,2007,11,05
200,best there is,Fantastic hotel in every way and very child friendly. Have stayed here many times and hopefully will have many more visits.,5,2007,10,30
200,Super location,"Stayed here for Christmas it's a great place the staff are very good the rooms are great and the spa is small but very good. I love the pool area.
It's also a great place for afternoon tea just sit by the open fire and relax.
The location is perfect only a 5min stroll to Grafton street and only around the corner from one of the best restaraunts in Dublin l'Ecrivain it's a must",5,2007,09,30
200,charming hotel in the best location in Dublin,"We just returned from a wonderful 6-night stay at the understated but charming Merrion Hotel.  We paid 345 Euros/night ($490/night due to the poor exchange rate), which included a full Irish breakfast.  We stayed in a Garden Wing Deluxe King room which had a view of the lovely gardens.  The room was about 330 square feet which included a large bathroom with separate tub and shower, ample counter space and heated towel racks.  The room had a flat screen TV, minibar, safe and two large closets – one with a built-in dresser.  We did not use room service, so I can’t comment on that, but the staff was extremely warm and friendly and always accommodating to our needs.  Breakfasts were served in the Cellar Restaurant and included a full buffet as well as delicious hot items off the menu.  Despite being in the basement, the restaurant had a very nice ambience.  We also had an excellent lunch in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud (the Michelin two-starred restaurant that is rated number one in Ireland) – the prix fixe lunch cost 35-47 Euros (2 or 3 courses) per person.  This was a bargain, as dinner for two would run upwards of 250 Euros.  We did not use the spa services; however we used the very nice 18-meter pool and steam room at no charge.  Another useful amenity was a business center with two computers that offered free internet access for all guests.  The Merrion Hotel is a sea of calm in an upscale neighborhood in very easy walking distance to Grafton Street (main shopping area) and Temple Bar (bars, clubs and restaurants).  In addition, there are numerous nice restaurants and picturesque parks surrounding the hotel.  If we return to Dublin, I have no doubt that we will stay in the Merrion again.
",5,2007,09,13
200,Absolute Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Merrion is my favorite hotel in Dublin and one of my favorite in the world.  

The Merrion is in the center of Dublin and in a central location, easy to walk or cab to virtually everything.  The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is a lovely area to walk day or night with some nice restaurants, bars and other convienience stores, etc.   Very elegant neighborhood, very safe.  A few pictures are shown above.  

Upon getting out of a car, the door staff will take your bags and you will soon be in the lobby area where you will catch a hint of the wood burning fireplace.   The front desk is very warm as they are professional.  Once you check in you will be able to enjoy the lounge area, bar area and garden area immediately behnd the lobby.  Rather than feeling like a typical business hotel, you feel as if you are visiting a very well to do friend's home.  

Very warm and elegant lobby, one of my favorite in the world.  The bar area is very friendly and you are sure to strike up a conversation with guests and locals alike.  Food is also wonderful and you will not want to leave the hotel.    The Cellar restaurant downstairs is also very popular and great for all meals, I really like breakfast.  

Rooms are elegant and classic, yet have all the modern amenities.  The bathrooms and amenities are wonderful as are the high ceilings and large room size.  The rooms have a nice balance of being elegant and functional.  

The concierge and all staff are FANTASTIC.  Everything here is perfect and you will be in the center of it all.  Considering the Merrion versus the Four Seasons (more suburban), I would pick the Merrion every time.  Enjoy your trip.
",5,2007,08,30
200,Lovely hotel,"We loved the Merrion. Our room was large and comfortable. The staff were very helpful and friendly - nothing was too much trouble. Sadly (as with many Irish hotels now) there were few Irish staff. Breakfast was excellent.

The only downside was that our room overlooked a service alley and we were woken about 6am by the bin truck emptying the bins - request an inside room overlooking the courtyard.

The hotel has a great location - a short walk to St Stephens Green, Grafton St and Temple Bar.
",5,2007,08,28
200,"Lovely, posh and romantic","My now-husband surprised me with a stay here on St. Patrick's Day last year. He proposed in the courtyard, which was quiet and secluded; he knew he was going to propose that day, but didn't know until he saw the courtyard that it was going to be the right spot, and it was! The staff is incredibly accommodating; they let us drop our bags off hours before we could check in and let us leave them there long after we checked out (we had a lot of sightseeing we wanted to do). Definitely has a ""proper"" air to it, but it's exactly what you expect and are paying for. The bathrooms were stunning, and we found the bed to be very comfortable. Simply a wonderful property, and we can't wait to go back.
",5,2007,08,28
200,Excellant Hotel - Great Staff,"It started as we arrived and were greeting by the wonderful doorman with the irish blue eyes.  Even though we arrived at 7AM after an trans alantic  flight, the staff husseled to get our room ready for us.

This is a georgous well maintained quaint hotel that features a lovely garden in the center and a beautiful art collection throughout.

We just love it when bot staff and the physical hotel are excellent. We will definately stay there again,
",5,2007,08,24
200,"Nice accomadating hotel, place to stay in dublin","Very nice hotel, the living room is so comfy and cosy with the fireplace, great place for afternoon tea.  The beds are hard and the a/c didnt work well in our room.  Otherwsie very nice stay and great location, defintaely recommend it
",4,2007,08,18
200,"Fantastic, but not totally comfortable...","Beds are hard, very hard. Air conditioning does not work well. They seem to have problems with their reservations system...our check-in was botched, though they eventually got it right. Otherwise it really is a great place.
",2,2007,08,09
200,I loved it...,"This is just a lovely place, without a doubt.  The room was huge by European standards.  The bath was a lovely room.  The gardens were lovely and I ordered tea there many days instead of dinner.  Lovely to be outside.  I had a few treatments at the spa, and it was lovely.  The people there are quite nice.  There was nothing I did not like about the Merrion.  I spent a lot of time in the Hotel, as this trip was about recuperation, not vacation.  And I chose the Merrion so I would be comfortable while in the hotel.

I think people who are disappointed with it tend to be used to large new hotels.  But people need to be realistic.  These older hotels are NOT a brand new Hyatt.  But they are charming and lovely in their own right, and frankly, to compare them to a Hyatt in Minneapolis is unfair.  Compared to other European hotels, I found it very large, very updated and full of amenities.

I would go back in a heartbeat, for a day or a month.  It was that memorable.
",5,2007,07,27
200,Delightful property.,"I like this hotel. It has character, charm and is very comfortable. Yes the rooms could do with an update but as it is the overall ambiance is right, it exudes an air of bygone elegance, not out
of place in Regency Dublin. Tend to stay away from rooms in the front of the hotel as it can get somewhat noisy from the busy street. Housekeeping is excellent as are the other guest services in the hotel.
",4,2007,07,26
200,Expenisive and not much atmosphere,"Stayed in this hotel with my husband for a two night break.  While the hotel is very nice we found that there was not much atmosphere and the service was not quite five star.  The restaurant was only average and the only bar open was the residents bar as it was a Sunday night.  We definately did not like the complusory parking charge of twenty euros (unlike the Four Seasons) per night.  This was not pointed out to us on check in. We will not return to this hotel.
",3,2007,07,25
200,Adored The Merrion,"New York City.  July , 2007.  I just returned from a short stay at the
the Merrion and I have to say that it was one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in.  The room I stayed in was huge; especially for european standards!  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel was in a beautiful and central location of Dublin.  It had a decent workout room.  But the hotel had a fabulous swimming pool--big enough to do laps. 
Finally, the buffet breakfast was so good and filling that I usually skipped lunch .
",5,2007,07,02
200,Feel part of Dublin,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in this hotel many times over the last few years.  Due to our company travel policy I have also had the good fortune to stay in most of the other leading Dublin hotels and none really come close to the Merrion.
The hotel is base round a large courtyard and has been converted from a number of georgian terraces.
The luxury and and attentive service is there but is understated.  Unlike the luxury chain hotels in the city, the Merrion actually feels as if it is part of Dublin.
The Cellar restaurant is very good and along with the bar oozes character.
It would be interesting to compare with the recently re-opened Shelbourne Hotel.
",5,2007,06,11
200,"Lovely Hotel, deserves its five star rating","We had a lovely stay at this hotel.  It is considered the best in Dublin and, while pricey, is worth it.  Great central location, beautiful rooms, attentive staff and very good restaurants. I would definitely stay there again.

",5,2007,05,30
200,Strange nights at the Merrion,"The hotel itself is nice, distinctly Irish and fashionable. The room was comfortable yet tired.  I loved the great room fire place, high tea, art collection and the pool; hated the ghost living in the hotel.  Our room was haunted.  Yes, I said haunted.  The table lamp switched on each time I got into the bed.  I removed the bulb and thought my problems were over but the light in the closet then came on.  After several go rounds in and out of bed to shut the door completely (which shut the light off) it came on again and again.  I called the front desk for duct tape and sealed the door shut.  Victory!  The next day, while having room service for lunch, one of my shoes (which I had taken off and left across the room) flipped over by itself.  While this did not ruin my stay, I did not enjoy the harassment.  It was very cold in my room and a portable heater was provided.  I actually met one of the owners of this Hotel while I was in Tokyo (at the Four Seasons Marunouchi)and told her my story.  She was amused but not surprised.
",3,2007,04,30
200,Give the Merrion a miss,"I had high hopes for the Merrion after reading all the reviews posted. I had booked 2 rooms, only one was ready and on their booking system. We were told it would be sorted out asap and the keys for the additional room brought to the other room, we waited over an hour and finally I called reception to be told that the keys were waiting at reception for me!!! Unimpressed! The second room was next door and we settled down for the night, the heat was unbearable and the air conditioning was not working. I complained the next morning to be told that it would be readjusted and would take half an hour. We returned to the room after breakfast and found that the unit was still not working. Again we were told that it would be fixed. By late afternoon I had had enough as by now I was irritated and we moved rooms, to a smaller room on another level from our children.
Service from the front desk was good, concierge staff were helpful and friendly. Bar staff were overworked and it took  half an hour to get our drinks to us. Breakfast service was slow, tea and toast arriving quickly but  the remainder up to half an hour afterwards. None of the waiting staff were native English speakers and communication on a number of occasions was challenging! The food was good, I have had better. It is expensive also.
In summary, I think this hotel is not sure what it is about. It aspires to be 5 star but  falls short in my opinion. The decor is shabby in places and the rooms could do with a lick of paint. Yes it is centrally located and comfortable but it lacks something. For the price I think I could do better next time. The Shelbourne is amazing, had a quick tour and would probably stay there next time!
",2,2007,04,18
200,Merrion the benchmark for other hotels,"A stay at the Merrion is always something I look forward to.  The quality of the service from the moment you have the door opened for you to the moment you leave.  Nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are all clean and comfortable with a good range of amenities available.  The location is great for leisure as well as business with everything being in walking distance.    A stay here will leave you with a new view of what good service should be.  This is the benchmark I use to measure other hotels.
",5,2007,04,13
200,Bliss,"Just returned from our first trip to Dublin. What a treat the Merrion was.  Early flight, but on arrival, reception were lovely and found us a room by 1030.  Lovely coffee and pastries whilst waiting,  Room fab, even a childs robe and slippers, very thoughtful.  Pool really nice, tho a little chilly for kids.  Cellar Restaurant served a lovely evening meal. Room service for son, fresh home-made spag/meat-balls, gobbled up.  Icing on cake, when we arrived back early evening, glass of milk and a sellophaned wrapped tray of cookies with a Merrion balloon had been left for son. He was in his element.  What a thoughtful touch.  We didn' t eat breakfast at hotel, as swimming was priority, but did try the little coffee shop next door which served coffee, bacon/tomato on toast...to die for.....

Fantastic time...Dublin is expensive, but the hotel was well worth the extra.  Final thing, as a treat, skip lunch and try the Afternoon tea, served 1430-1800.....Great fun....

Can't wait to find a reason to go back :-)
",5,2007,03,06
200,Old Fashioned Charm but a bit tired in places,"The Merrion has lots of charm as it is made from a row of Georgian houses that have been knocked through. With high ceilings, detailed cornicing and welcoming fireplace, the lounge areas are certainly a highlight and you could spend many hours relaxing there while attentive service continues to keep you well lubricated.

The service couldn't be faulted really. When I couldn't decide between 2 newspapers to have delivered in the morning, the receptionist suggested that both were delivered on a complimentary basis. Also there was no problem changing my wake-up calls according to the schedule of my day. I was served promptly at breakfast and the one big bugbear that I have which is condiments and sauces not being brought out promptly enough to have with my breakfast did not materialize as these came out with the hot coffee.
  

The bedroom I stayed in was a superior king size room with a siting area in front of a large plasma TV (this should really be de rigeur in top class hotels) Slippers and dressing gowns were provided also. Also the bell hop who brought my luggage up spent some time going through all the features of the room which was a nice touch.

The bathroom as spacious with a separate bath and shower and this was where the age and upkeep of the hotel really showed through with a noisy radiator, mouldy and cracked sealant and a shower which had seen better days.

Price-wise the Merrion and the Westbury are very similar but I know that for something which had unbeatable character, the Merrion gets my vote.
",4,2007,03,06
200,The best hotel in Dublin,"Have stayed here three times in the last couple of years.

The service, ambiance and facilities are far superior to any other Dublin hotel (I have tried them all and I would not even bother reviewing them!)

The building itself is beautiful - an old Georgian townhouse and some of the rooms are in an extension known as the garden wing.  

There is nothing to beat sipping a drink in front of the open peat fire in the beautiful drawing room.

Easy 5 min walk to Grafton Street.  Lots of pubs nearby if you fancy a bit of real Irish hospitality(!)
",5,2007,02,07
200,An excellent 5 star hotel wtih a lot of charm and style,"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and it has been a great experience. Not cheap, but that can be said for the whole Dublin as well. The room was great, the service excellent and the food at the restaurant a very pleasant experience.  a highly recommended hotel.
",5,2007,01,10
200,hard to get any better,"The Merrion remains an absolutely favorite place to stay in Dublin, if you look for a calm, high quality setting. Being in Ireland for work 2-3 times a year, checking in at the Merrion definitively beats the Conrad (undoubtedly a good hotel, yet not as refined and with awful food in its cafe-bar) and probably also the Morrison (also a high quality but different offering, probably best for a party weekend out). Staff is nice and helpful, the intimate lounge with fireplace one of the best places to have an afternoon tea or after dinner drink.
",5,2006,12,16
200,loved the luxury,"we have just returned from a weekend in the merrion we were overall pleased with the service most of the staff were friendly the rooms were clean and housekeeping service was good we had a nice room but no view the little extras were nice! eg the toiletries slippers and towelling robes beds were turned down at night and water left by the bed only dissappointment there was no tea making services in the bedroom and i felt for this class of hotel they should provide tea /coffee when we went to the drawing room space to sit and relax and have a coffee were limited and you could not always manage to find a table saying all this i would be happy to stay there again
",5,2006,11,20
200,Fit for a King,"What an amazing spectacular place, in a perfect location, where the staff is respectful but remains in the background, incredible eating experiences. Greatest breakfast imaginable- no, it's beyond imagination. Prices at the bar and cellar restaurant surprisingly reasaonable. Put your shoes out at night for a complementary cleaning, and watch how they come back the next morning! Molton Brown amenities. Amazing, amazing sitting rooms in the lobby. You must go. Dublin is fantastic, and this place makes it sparkle even more.
",5,2006,11,14
200,perfect,"I am amazed at the last couple of reviews.  Stayed here in Sept for the 3rd time and once again everything was perfect.....The food, service, our room.  Great place to stay if you want to treat yourself to a nice day shopping in Dublin followed by a lovely meal to end the evening.  I agree that it is very expensive.  Not the type of place you would stay for a week unless you are loaded.
But definately worth it for a nice weekend.
",5,2006,11,06
200,A Let Down,"We stayed at The Merrion in July. Check in was painful as the person on the desk was more interested in doing something on her pc. We were eventually checked in and taken to our good sized room which overlooked the back end of a row of shops and3 skips! 

We changed room to one with a view of the garden. Downside was that the new room was tiny. 

We found the service was really poor. We waited at our table in the garden to be served drinks before dinner. We waited 20 minutes for assistance before I gave up, went inside and asked for some assistance. It was not the case they did not know we were there, they just did not care. 

Dinner at the Patrick Guillbaud restaurant was torturous. The menu is stunning and so is the wine list. I have nothing but praise for the food. But again the service was abysmal. I am a vegetarian of which they were aware, because I had told them and they had provided me with a vegetarian menu. Firstly we were brought an appetiser, mine was beef! I explained I was vegetarian and did not eat meat or fish. They took it away and came back with a replacement of fish soup! My partner wanted to leave then but I convinced him to stay. What a mistake. As we soon learned, not one member of the serving staff spoke English as their first language. As the manager/co-owner told us at the end of the meal, that is why they did not understand the word vegetarian’. Being of Irish descent and having lived in Dublin as a child, I was amazed that in an English speaking country, the serving staff did not have a firm grasp of the language. 

Anyway, £300 lighter we left having complained bitterly. 

We stayed 2 days and the service was so poor we could bear it no longer. We could not wait to leave so we checked out early on our final day. 

It is such a pity as the hotel is very lovely (even if it is bordered on one side of the garden by what looks like a factory) and we were very much looking forward to it. Do not stay here unless you want to pay a fortune to be treated very badly.

200,Overpriced-Overrated,"Booked package called Live Like A Duke, one of the best double rooms in Main house with Breakfast, non smoking. 

On arrival were allocated a large smoking room which was looking a bit shabby. We complained as this was not what we had booked,  they checked the booking and yes we are right, however they did not have a Non smoking room to give us, so we had to sleep there the first night.   We decided to have afternoon tea and some cakes. We sat  in the garden got the tea and no cakes, the waitress forgot about them! Not a good start.

Next day we were shown to another room which was very nice and Non smoking. The hotel was allright but I could not say it came up to our expectation of 5* and was certainly not worth the money. We have stayed in 5* hotels often so do know what they should be like.

200,only place to stay in dublin,"this is the only place to stay when in dublin. i have stayed in quite a few of the big name hotelr in the city and this is by far the best. the service is wonderful and staff are very attentive and helpful. breakfast is to die for and when i misplaced an expensive coat they were extremely efficient at locating it for me and was in the room on my return. i have stayed here on numerous occasions when in dublin and cannot fault it ,it is up there with the best!

200,Definitely Dublin's top hotel,"Stayed at the Merrion as a treat for a weekend in July and it was a magnificant experience. Location, surroundings, service, food and drinks - all of the above were impeccable. Our room was in the hotel's Garden Wing and was extremely impressive and had a unique charm and decor which I haven't experienced in any other Dublin hotel. The attentiveness of the staff (unrivalled in any other Dublin hotel), the feeling of relaxation upon entering the imposing georgian entrance and the selection of first-rate bars and eateries collectively make this undoubtebly Dublin's top hotel.
",5,2006,07,10
200,Perfect Dublin,"After having lived at the merrion for about two weeks, I can definitlvely say that it is Dublin's best hotel.  Located just 2 blocks aways from the beautiful grafton st., fitzwilliam spuare, and the tram stop, it is of utmost convienience.  The hotel itself is gorgeous;however, its more modern wing, containing most of the rooms, is somewhat lacking in originality.  I have no complaints regarding hygiene, and the service is excellent.  While not quite as glitsy as the four seasons, I find that the merrion's convenience more than makes up for it.  Try to stay in one of the old rooms if possible.
",5,2006,06,24
200,Grrrrrt hotel,"We stayed in Merrion after a gruelling two nights at The Gresham owing to some miscommunication by our travel agents. Merrion is a top of the line property with great rooms - expensive though (but hey since when have good things started coming cheap!!).

We stayed here for 5 nights. Merrion is located right opposite the government buildings and is an office area. There are some pubs and some restuarants around. We had a probelm as we reached around the 1st May day when nearly everything was closed. There is a BUrger King nearby which helped us through that day! Our kids had a blast at the heated swimming pool and I could have a good work out at thier gymnasium.

Stephens Green park is situated two blocks down and the Stephens Green mall is a nice place to do some shopping as well. Dont forget to take the Hop on Hop off bus -its nice!

While Dublin is a nice place, the only thing we did not appreciate about Dublin was that youngsters (males mostly) are drunk most of the time and causing scenes in pubs, reaturants, streets, everywhere. It can get a bit dodgy when you are travelling with kids like we were. Avoid walking late and lonely alleys.
",5,2006,05,20
200,"Gorgeous hotel, but is it worth the money?","Coming from a stay at a 3-star Citadines in London, the Merrion was a world of difference.  The hotel looks like someone's elegant house, but personally I prefer the anonymity of a big, fancy hotel.  To me, the service was way over the top with a bellman running out as soon as our car pulled up -- and a wait for someone to show us to our room.  The whole thing made me a little uncomfortable.  It was also strange to me that we had to walk through the area where everyone was having tea to get to our room.  And it seemed like anyone could walk in off the street and have tea in this 'intimate' hotel.  

The room was nice, but not unbelievable, and the bed was really uncomfortable.  I was also disappointed that it cost $15 just to use the internet to print out my boarding pass.  

We did see a supermodel while we were there so I guess it's a great place for people that want to get away from the crowds in Dublin.
",4,2006,05,04
200,Underwhelmed,"We were so looking forward to a night on the town in our home town,  courtesy of a gift voucher for a room in the Garden Wing, but the disappointment started when we arrived and the caped and top-hatted doorman ignored us as we got out of our taxi.  Reception was very good, we were shown up to our room but oh dear, instead of the lovely garden view we had anticipated, we looked out onto the back of a Tesco warehouse across a dreary little lane.....  The bathroom was somehow cold and uninviting and the floor was lethally slippy.

Coming back after an afternoon in the National Gallery we wanted a cup of tea, but there are no facilities in the bedrooms, so had to pay for a pot downstairs, and what a farce that was - nowhere to sit, eventually offered two small tables of differing heights, the tray kept sliding down to the edge.  Not a relaxing time.

At bedtime the room was ferociously hot, despite the so-called air conditioning and we tossed and turned all night.  The redeeming feature was breakfast, excellent, and in all fairness any staff we met were very friendly and helpful - but one felt there was a slight rip-off going on with the prices.
",3,2006,04,30
200,Guests not accommodated,"This hotel is beautifully furnished in the public areas, but we were very disappointed with the bedroom.  We booked a garden room, thinking that we would get a room with a garden view - we did not.  It looked onto a dirty street. When, we asked if it was  the correct room, we were told yes.
Also, we had booked the room well in advance and had requested an early check-in of approx 1.30pm/ 2pm -  as we were working and needed to freshen up.  This was not at all facilited as check-in was at 3pm and they would not shift from this position! Eventhough, as we all know in the real world, many rooms are vacated early due to people getting early flights etc.  We had lunch while we waited, which was also disappointing.  I wonder was it a stunt to get us to eat there, which we were going to do anyway?? I thought for the price and the standard of the hotel, their serivce overall was not 5*.  They have a lot to learn still about service.

200,"Beautiful hotel, top class service","Was very impressed with the Merrion, service was flawless. The atmosphere is lovely and it has a lot of character.Staff were exceptionally friendly and professional. All the reception rooms and gardens were beautifully furnished, and the architecture is fabulous.
",5,2006,03,26
200,"Good, but not perfect","One night at the hotel, for my second stay, both on business (so, evening arrival and morning departure).  This time in garden wing (last time managed to get moved to an 'original' room - with lots of character) - room was ok, but a bit let down by details (lots of visible wires behind flat screen tv, trouser press not working, limited control over the room lights - too many linked together).  Plus, power seemd to go sometime in the middle of the night and an emergency light came on, alongside a rel. loud electrical noise.  Plus - drain-like smell in bathroom - not clear where from, but somewhere around the w/c; would confirm comments elsewhere that bathroom fittings looking tired, stained + add that the heavy trad. marble style does not quite fit with a realtively modern room (shower water pressure v. good, however and hot).   Given the brevity of the stay and lateness, not worth complaining, but would have done if had been there with family.  Room service was great for quality, but timing a bit off (dinner late and b'fast too early).  Overall, ok for a one-night business stay and can walk to nearby meetings - but did find front desk staff curiously unwelcoming/disinterested (and my company always puts people there) - both on arrival and check-out.
",4,2006,03,22
200,Somewhat overrated,"Let's start with the positives:
1. The hotel is beautifully decorated and very elegant.  All the common rooms feel very special. 
2. I was given a room 4 hours before the scheduled check-in time!
3. The staff are very polished.
4. Breakfast (smoked salmon & eggs) were perfectly prepared.

Now, the negatives:
1. Room (admittedly the cheapest, in the garden wing), was nothing special - smaller than cheaper rooms at the Westin, the Conrad, and the Fitzwilliam, also 5 star hotels - and less comfortable.
2. Service was over-the-top.  Sitting in the lounge area, I was asked 3 times if I was being looked after.  Serving tea at breakfast took, no exaggeration, 4-5 minutes, primarily because the tea pots are extremely heavy, the handles extremely hot, and they try to put too many objects on a small table.
3. It's mean not to offer an adequate breakfast buffet at this price level.  It forces the order of a cooked breakfast.
4. I was woken at 10:15pm for turn-down service!
5. I was woken at 4:45am for a mistaken wake-up call!
6. The walls are thin enough for me to have been disturbed at 2:30am by the couple next door talking and watching television.

In summary, if elegance and prestige are important, choose the Merrion.  Otherwise, the Westin is probably a better choice.

200,bad staff and policies,"Word of advice if you want a drink in the main bar.. make sure you have a seat before you order a drink..as they wont serve you.. even if you are staying in the damn place...

I couldnt believe this happened in a supposedly upmarket hotel.. and i shall never stay there again..

300 euros a room and you cant get a drink..
",1,2006,02,05
200,Friendly staff,"My wife and I had a 3 night Christmas break at the Merrion.We enjoyed it very much.The food (cellar restaurant)was excellent.The Christmas lunch was particularly good and was served in a nice relaxed and friendly manner.
We had a day at the races on Boxing day,the hotel arranged this for us as part of the package.This also went very smoothly, with transport to and from the course organised by the hotel.
The location is perfect,within walking dstance of the major tourist sites.
My only minor niggle is that there is no tea/coffee making facility in the room.There is of course 24 room service but sometimes you just want a quick cup of tea without all the 'fuss' of silver tea pots etc.
I can't emphasise enough how friendly the staff are and it all seems genuine.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin.
",5,2006,01,09
200,Not Great,"Let me start off by saying that my husband and I have stayed at the Merrion on four previous occasions and found the hotel to be excellent. Until our recent stay, it was definitely our preferred hotel in Dublin. But after just having returned from a two-night stay over the New Year's weekend, I'm not sure that we will ever return. 

I'm not sure what the problem was at the hotel that particular weekend, but the service and attention to detail were way below what you would expect of a five star hotel. So many things went wrong, it became a running joke. We arrived slightly early and were told that our room would not be ready until the normal 3pm check-in time. Fine, but when we arrived back at around that time, we were shown to a smoking room, when I had specifically requested non-smoking. We were informed that there were no other rooms available, but after insisting, were shown to another room on the ground floor right next to the elevators. The room was not great, but at that point we just wanted to relax. As we began to settle in, we realised that this room did not appear to be in regular use. The furnishings were worn, the duvet cover was stained, the bathroom fittings needed mending in some cases, and the taps in the bath were reversed (ie hot was cold, etc.) The mini-bar was only half-stocked, not that we would have cared, except the hotel tried to charge us for the items that were never there in the first place upon check-out! There was a fold-up bed in the room that had to be removed, and then the armchair had to be put back in place. The inter-joining doors also needed to be fixed. In short, our first few hours at the hotel were extremely hectic and far from relaxing as staff came in and out trying to sort things out. It appeared to us that the hotel were not prepared for the New Year's weekend at all, and seemed either under-staffed, or without their best staff. We arranged this special weekend away with another couple who had never stayed at the hotel. Unfortunately, they experienced a two-hour delay checking in, and were also shown to a smoking room after specifically requesting non-smoking! To top it all off, we had booked in on the 'New Years' package, and didn't receive the 'treats' that were supposed to be in the room until we asked for them. I had forgotten about it, but after speaking to our friends, they had chilled champagne and chocolates upon arrival in their room. The staff did not even have us registered for the package, even though I had booked the month before, had received two emails from the hotel, and had confirmed the reservation the day before! It was another thing we had to sort out with the staff.

I can only think that the Merrion is not faring well now that the Four Seasons is the other game in town. We stayed there just two weeks before New Year and had a very pleasant stay. However, it was clinical service and we were looking forward to the superlative, warm service experienced at the Merrion over the past few years. But what we realised is that the Merrion appears 'tired' in contrast to the Four Seasons. Especially the room features and the spa. 

There were good things about the weekend. The drawing rooms at the Merrion are wonderfully warm and inviting, and overall the food was very good. The hotel put on a decent New Year's celebration, and the staff were always friendly, especially the doorman. The pool was nice and never crowded, although I would agree with previous comments that it is in need of updating. I found the pool facilities in general to be very basic.

I must say that after numerous phone calls to reception during our first few hours at the hotel, simply because things kept going wrong, we finally reached the assistant manager who sent up some fruit and chocolates, and comped the room service sandwiches that we had ordered earlier. We appreciated the gesture, but the problems we experienced could have been avoided by the hotel. Again, I'm not sure that we will return which is a shame because the location is superb and we've had so many good experiences in the past. The problem is, when you're spending that much, you don't want to risk another bad one.

200,Disappointing,"Stayed at the Merrion in Dublin for a three day break over new year. My partner and I were really looking forward to a relaxing break having read some of the glowing reviews on this site. However, our experience was far from relaxing or enjoyable.

On the positive side, the hotel itself is beautifully decorated and very elegant. Our room was a garden room and was a good size with a large marble bathroom which was very pleasant. However...

We arrived at the hotel to find that our booking for dinner on New Year's Eve had been lost. The receptionists (having blamed my partner for not confirming the booking - despite his three emails to the concierge a month before) offered to arrange an alternative venue for us for dinner - we asked that the new restaurant be somewhere with a vegetarian menu and were told by the hotel that they had booked us into a nearby restaurant and that our dietary requirements would be no problem. 

On arrival at the restaurant, we discovered that they had not in fact been informed of any of this and we were left with a menu which we largely couldn't eat. Fortunately the restaurant in question was extremely accomodating at the eleventh hour and managed to find something for us. 

Following this unfortunate initial experience, we were prepared to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and treat this as a one-off - that is until...our booking for brunch on New Year's Day was also lost and we were told we couldn't get a table until 1.30pm despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty, we were served breakfast for two with only one set of cutlery, and our room was left only half made up every day of our stay with our nightclothes literally thrown in a ball on the pillows. 

Thinking that the experience could not possibly get any worse, when checking out (with considerable relief), we discovered that the booking for our taxi to the airport had never been made, despite the fact that my partner requested this at the same time we went to complain about all of the above.

At no stage was any apology offered by the management, despite my partner's complaint the day before we checked out and the front desk assuring us that a manager would be informed and would speak to us about it. 

On check-out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay - we said no and still no apology was offered and our original complaint was not acknowledged. 

Having stayed at many five star hotels around the world, we were beyond disappointed with The Merrion and are puzzled as to how the hotel can retain a five star rating. If you're going to Dublin, do yourself a favour and don't throw your money away on this place.",1,2006,01,02
200,Can't praise it enough,"First off, I need to explain I had booked a garden wing room (on a room only basis) through an accommodation website for my husband for his birthday in September, but when we arrived, there was a problem with the reservation, and we were transferred to the Four Seasons, but were invited back to the Merrion on a B&B basis with their compliments.  Some people might have minded this inconvenience, but we were thrilled that we were given the chance to experience 2 of Dublin's top hotels for the price of one!  

We returned to the Merrion last weekend and they couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome.  Instead of the garden wing room I was expecting, we were given a beautiful, and very spacious room in the main house, with a view of Government buildings across the street.  There was fruit and hand-made chocolates awaiting us, and a note from the manager, which I thought was a nice touch.    

We had both dinner and breakfast in the Cellar restaurant, and both were delicious.  Dinner was surprisingly reasonable for a hotel of this calibre(main courses are available from only €14), and the array of fruit, pastries etc. at the breakfast buffet was second to none.  

Yes, there are some niggling complaints, namely the €20 charge to have your car parked, and the fact that you have to walk through the busy drawing rooms to get to the spa (not very comfortable if you're wearing a bathrobe!!).  But equally, I would suggest that the Four Seasons also has a few: the fact that visitors to the RDS use the hotel car park, leaving no spaces for guests, and the ultra-formal service that sometimes verges on overbearing.  But these are minor complaints, and wouldn't put me off staying in either hotel.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Merrion - mostly because they went the extra mile to make up for the ""lost"" reservation, and I think that sums up their attitude towards their guests.
",5,2005,11,23
200,Wonderful Hotel,"The Merrion Hotel in Dublin where we stayed for four nights in October, 2005, was wonderful. It is a luxurious, tastefully decorated hotel created from four restored Georgian town homes. Having a drink or tea before the fire in one of its two living rooms is a special treat. It was wonderful to find such a friendly, helpful staff in a large, deluxe place. 

We spent our first night in a large, comfortable room on the street side of the hotel in the main section with a large seating area, enormous bathroom, separate shower and all the “bells and whistles” of a fine accommodation. The next three nights we switched to an equally nice room on the backside of the main section that was much quieter. 

We ate two dinners in the Cellar Restaurant…an attractive facility with attentive service and great fish (the black sole was excellent). One other night we went to Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, which adjoins the hotel and found the food, service and décor lives up to its hype as the best restaurant in Dublin. Be sure to make reservations because it is very popular. Our fourth dinner was at Pepole’s, an excellent continental style restaurant a short walk away (that also needs prior reservations).
",5,2005,10,23
200,Better Than Expected,"Just returned from a 2 night break at The Merrion and it was much better than I had expected, and the location is also very good for the centre, its shops, and bars! We stayed in a superior garden room and it was better than I had expected, with a good view over the gardens, two armchairs, massive bed and large marble bathroom. We had breakfast served in the room on both mornings and it was fantastic (except for the rubbery sausage) and very well presented with white linen and a red rose. We also ate at the hotels 2 Michelin star Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud, which was also very good but the portions are a joke, so don't go if you want to leave the table at the end of the evening feeling satisfied.  Overall, very nice and I believe from my experience, deserving of its status. Will be back in the New Year!
",5,2005,10,18
200,Very disappointed with the Merrion,"we were delighted with the bedroom but were a little taken aback by the bathroom, which was extremely dated. The shower in particular was in need of serious maintenance. The doors of the shower did not even seal and there was brown staining on the area where the shower tray meets the doors and tiles.  The entire appearance was in stark contrast to the quality of the room. 

Shortly after arrival, we headed to the Tethra Spa, which had looked very inviting on the website. However, we were extremely disappointed for a number of reasons. 

(a)The pool was extremely cold and too unpleasant to swim in;
(b)The ceiling and walls in the pool area were unclean and the paint work was stained;
(c)The tiles in the seating area of the steam room were also stained from continued used and they looked like they needed to be bleached clean.

The check out staff were v. rude and the hotel is totally over priced. You do not even get free parking or newspapers!! You can get much better value for money elsewhere. This hotel should not be a 5 Star Hotel.
",2,2005,10,18
200,A bit pricey,"OK, I need to say this upfront, we booked the Merrion for our first night in Ireland and were not disappointed. Of course, that may have been more for the upgrade to the FitzGerald suite (from the garden wing room that we were supposed to have) that we received for reasons I have yet to fathom. That being said, staff were wonderful, room was wonderful, hotel location was great. But, be prepared, everything is pricey! Coffee in the courtyard for two was on the order of 9 euro. Wine in the evening was 11-13 euro per glass. Good, but man those euro go quickly. Also, breakfast was extremely hard to find (in the basement). For lunch or dinner, we'd recommend the Pearl Restaurant, just up the street. Great food, and much less expensive. Given the price, probably won't stay here again (though I would if I could count on the upgrade again!).
",4,2005,09,15
200,Over hyped - over priced,"Stayed at the Merrion during a weekend break. Billed as the top hotel in Dublin. The hotel had beautiful architecture and the staff were impeccable. However, found the decor of the hotel to be a real let down. While the drawing room and tearoom would be considered by many as ""quaint"" I found it slightly stuffy and pretentious. Irritating factor was to get to your rooms you have to walk through the drawing room, through the tea room, past the bar and through the conservatory to get to your hotel room!!  Our room was a garden wing room at £260 a night (which apparently was the cheapest price available) The room was large enough but really needs updating. Furniture was worn, carpet had stains, bathroom shower unit was yellow with age. They didnt even have tea or coffee making facilities in the room. I was very disappointed that the room did not match the steep price and it did ruin my stay in Dublin. On top of that the breakfast that was included was paltry to say the least.  For the cooked breakfast, the sausage was to my knowledge inferior and I thought a 5 star hotel should at least provide top quality ingredients and the buffet spread could have been better. I wouldnt stay here again but go back to the hotel that I visited the last time I came which was Brooks Hotel which is way better than the Merrion (and cheaper!!)
",3,2005,08,25
200,Best in Dublin,"From the moment you see the elegantly understated entrance to the Merrion you know you are visiting a hotel that oozes class. The doorman set the tone- First impressions are so important. The receptionist was friendly and helpful. The concierge were outstanding- call you by name after first contact. This was our 25th wedding anniversary which we had told the hotel about when booking. We had booked a ground floor room overlooking the garden (I believe the cheapest available) but were given an upgrade into the original Georgian part. In the room was a heart shaped confection, compliments of the hotel. The room was extremely elegant and well appointed, with views across to the beautiful Georgian public buildings over the road. The hotel has a fantastic art collection- really an extension of the National Gallery, and well worth visiting just to see these masterpieces of Irish art. The reception rooms are comfortably furnished and with typically elegant proportions. We had breakfasts in the hotel and afternoon tea on our last afternoon- very sumptious and worth missing lunch to give it full justice! Breakfasts are part self service part waiter- generally excellent and with a friendly staff. We had one slightly dud day when we had to repeat our orders a couple of times but I suspect this was a one off. For us the real joy was the swimming pool- immaculate changing rooms and an ""infinity"" pool at a perfect temperature for swimming. This wasn't a cheap holiday- Dublin overall is pretty expensive. We stayed three nights and left with a feeling that we had been somewhere rather special, which we would recommend to any of our friends.",5,2005,08,23
200,Average Hotel Very High Price,"Stayed at the Merrion the first few days of Aug/05.  The room was nice enough but definately not anything special.  It was very expensive and I was disappointed as it was highly rated by other travellers.  Staff was not very friendly.  Their must be better for the money in Dublin!
",3,2005,08,15
200,Nowhere better to stay.,"This is the most refined hotel imaginable.  The staff and service are excellent, almost to a fault.  The breakfasts can only be described as outstanding. We have been before and intend returning again, but if glitz and glamour are your preferred taste, go elsewhere.
",5,2005,08,12
200,"Satisfactory, but more like 4star","On the positive side, the service was good and so was the food. However this is more like a good four star hotel than the five stars it has and compares poorly to the Four Seasons. My room was on the small side and felt like it needed smartening up. 

Verdict: expensive for what you get.",3,2005,07,23
200,Merrion Hall not the same as Merrion Hotel,"This hotel was very nice, but the location was not.  Please be careful when you are booking through this website that you know the difference between Merrion Hall and the Marrion hotel.  One is near city center, but the Merrion Hall, through Expedia, is not the same.  The hotel is quite lovely, but is not convenient for short visits.  To visit the city center, you must either take a taxi or train.
",3,2005,07,17
200,Location was best quality,"The location at this hotel was good, but we still needed to walk quite a ways to get to downtown shopping areas and touristy sites.  The room was not impressive for being such a highly rated hotel.  Very plain, nothing special for the high price charged.  We did have an experience with a run away bath shower nozzle, twice, that sprayed down the bathroom as the knobs were flying off the handles... almost made some fun in the stuffy hotel.  I am accustomed to staying at Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons and other top notch hotels, this one left a lot to be desired in both service and accomodations for the price.  Had the price been less, it may have been acceptable.
",2,2005,07,15
200,Magical Merrion,"We enjoyed our stay in the Merrion very much indeed.  The staff were very courteous and efficent, the room very clean and the large bed an extra bonus.  The bathroom was also up to our highest  expectations-no problems there-.The full Irish breakfast was enjoyable and very filling and set us up nicely for the day to explore Dublin.  The central location of the Hotel meant we could do this on foot or on one of the pay and go busses.  In fact we never used our car from the day we arrived until the day the staff brought it to the front of the Hotel for our reluctant departure.  Well done the Merrion
",5,2005,06,28
200,Our stay @ The Merrion,"Overall, the stay would have been 100% had it not been for the temperature of the room. The service was outstanding from the Concierge to the cleaner, and the food and facilities were excellent. A swim in the Spa is a must, one of the best pools I have been in. The terrace for cocktails was complimented by fantastic weather (although it chills when the sun disappears!) and the art collection is incredible.

I mentioned the temerature to reception on 4 occassions (with no avail) and also heard the recepionist answerng a similar call whilst waiting to comment again..! It's a shame that the stuffiness of the room let our stay down.
",3,2005,06,14
200,"Beautiful, but...","An elegant hotel, great art, and a wonderful location.  Concierge and doormen were very helpful and friendly.  Our ""deluxe rooms"" in the newer section looked out to the beautiful garden as promised, but we thought them rather small and dark--they were on the ground floor and had casement windows rather than french doors as rooms on higher floors did.  As a previous visitor mentioned, our rooms, too, were very warm despite opening the windows to the chilly night air; we ended up turning on the air conditioning.  Breakfast in the Cellar was fair (the granola and berry compote on the buffet were delicious), but the service was inconsistent; one morning our orders came almost too quickly, and another we waited forever!----and we always waited too long for that essential first cup of coffee!  Next visit to Dublin we'll probably try somewhere else.
",4,2005,06,12
200,"Beautiful, but overpriced.","There's no denying that the Merrion is the height of good taste - elegant drawing rooms, tastefully furnished bedrooms, understated pool area.  The staff are courteous without being obtrusive and the whole place has the feeling of staying in someone's (albeit large) country house.
We stayed in a room in the newer part of the building.  The bathroom was enormous - separate shower and bath, but the room less so.  It was also very hot and stuffy and despite putting the air conditioning on low it stayed that way.  The decor was discrete, but also slightly shabby in places eg chipped paint on the furniture, dirty balcony.
The pool is large and unlike most hotel pools you could definitely swin lengths in it.  I found the changing rooms a bit dirty though - it was towards the end of the day, but would have expected someone to come a check them over regularly.  We both had a treatment in the spa, which was fine - not amazing, but nothing to complain about.
We didn't have dinner in the hotel, but the breakfast was good.  Again, not amazing - the portions were good, but it was overcooked and a bit bland.
All in all if we went back to Dublin we would consider staying at the Merrion as it is a really nice hotel.  At 260Eur for 1 night though I would expect it to be as good as it was and maybe a bit better.

200,Best stay ever with my kids !,"For a holiday in Dublin with the kids, we got a nice package deal on the Merrion internet site for August 2004 (probably low season) : double connecting rooms, full breakfast.
The hotel is very discreet from the outside, very nice inside. Rooms were roomy, clean, very silent (important with the kids).
For the first time in a 5 star hotel, I felt the kids were more than welcome : from the mini bathrobes and slippers to the friendly attitude of the staff, everything was perfect.
The breakfast, either in room or at the restaurant was incredible in variety and taste.
Tea was a delight everytime.
Room service at night was incredibly good - homecooked hot breads (4 choices !), delicate food, great desserts.
The staff was absolutely perfet : discreet, helpfull but not exagerating or obsequious.*
The hotel is well located to explore the city walking - though not exposed to traffic or noise from pubs etc...
Nice fitness area and pool.
We got grand rest (rare with the kids), grand food, grand luxury holidays.
Thanks The Merrion !

200,One of The Best,"My wife and I have stayed at many excellent hotels and the Merrion can hold its own with the best of them. The service is excellent and the hotel's  relatively small size allows the staff to recognize guests and to provide personal service. The public rooms are well-maintained and tastefully decorated and the restaurants and bars are smoke-free due to Ireland's recent push for a healthier society. The guest rooms at the Merrion are also very nice and have a nice assortment of ammenities. The Restaurant Patrick Guillbaud is still Ireland's finest and the Bar 23 is reserved for guests.  This is a nice touch since the Cellar Bar can become crowed in the evening. We had breakfast in the Cellar Restaurant one morning, but we ordered room service on the other days.  The prices were the same, the service was right on time and the food was excellent, so I would recommend this option. All in all, this is the place that I'll return to when I next visit Ireland.
",5,2005,04,25
200,very nice but,"When I stayed there I was allocated a room in the new wing which didnt live up to the traditional style and promise of the lobby/lounge areas, the rooms in the old georgian wing must be amazing based on other reviews. I'll be asking for one of these next time.
",4,2005,03,21
200,elegant piece of history,"Our four nights at The Merrion were quite near perfection.  We had a large, quiet room in the old section with a lovely view of the gardens.  The burning fireplaces in the main rooms added to the coziness of the hotel.  The included breakfasts were excellent with a great variety of fruits, breads, and cooked to order items.  The only challenge was the difficulty of getting to the spa from the main house, in bathrobes, without going through the lobby - quite a maze.  We had one dinner there, and the food was not anything special.  Service was excellent throughout.  The pool and spa are superb. The location is excellent, we never used public transport, we walked everywhere.  There are many great restaurants and pubs within a 3 minute walk.
",5,2005,03,16
200,I agree but...,"Like the previous reviewer we were there for Valentines Weekend. There is no doubt that you get what you pay for and the ambience and service is second to  none. Room service late on a Friday after a miserable Ryanair flight from London was superb.

It does seem odd not to have tea/coffee making facilities. We couldn't get booked into the Cellar restaurant, but there is no shortage of excellent alternatives nearby - Try the Rubicon, just round the corner.

It doesn't quite rate alongside some of the foreign hotels I've stayed in for luxury, but is a distinctive and quality destination well placed in the City.
",4,2005,03,01
200,"Nice hotel,but well overpriced","I stayed at the merrion for valentines weekend. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was nice, especially the bathroom. The only thing i didn't like about the room is that it had NO tea/coffee making facilities which I thought was a bit strange considering it's a standard feature  in most 3 or 4 star hotels.Another dissappointing feature was the price of food. I'm a person that doesn't mind paying top prices for top quality food, but after I paid 32 euro for a simple sirloin steak,I knew I was being ripped off when I had in front of me the worlds smallest sirloin and didn't get my value for money. I don't think I'll be returning here although it is a nice hotel, it just wasn't as luxurious as people make it out to be.I think I'll stick to the 'Clarion hotel IFSC'.
",3,2005,02,16
200,Amazing service !,"From the moment we entered the hotel, we immediatly felt wellcome.  The staff is very professional. We immediatly noticed that this hotel is not part of a large chain like Four Seasons, Hilton, ... because many staff members treated us very personally and we appreciated this very much. The building (recently renovated Georgian townhouses integrated in one entity) is amazing. The garden is very relaxing. The rooms are spacious. The afternoon tea in the drawing rooms is the best in Dublin. The full Irish breakfast was very good and was the best way to start a day in Dublin. Nothing but good points !!! Really worth the price !!!
    ",5,2005,02,09
200,Fantastic!!!,"Having read the reviews on this, I decided to take my fiance to this hotel. We were very happy with the choice - everything about the place is elegant, even down to them not having a huge sign on the front of the building. This hotel feels more like a home than a hotel with very helpful hosts. All the staff were great - one small complaint if any, was that the concierge did not have the best suggestions of places to eat and drink. 

Our three days there were magical, enhanced by a rigourous massage in the Tethra Spa! The pool and steam room are ok, but the treatments are worth every penny. 

Breakfasts are fantastic - and served with grace and style. Food in the drawing room on the otherhand is ok, although very expensive. However service again is impeccable. 

Without doubt, one of the most pleasurable hotels we have stayed in for a long time. The people make the difference in a place like this - we visited the Morrison and the Clarence - neither is a patch on the Merrion. They are stuck up their --- trying to be cool and sophisticated and thus fail to achieve either.
",5,2005,01,04
200,Lovely,"We just loved the Merrion.  Fabulous place to stay.  Further details on why below:

So elegant.
Staff very friendly, well-trained, and professional.

Rooms well appointed and comfortable.
Very child friendly, even in the dinning room at dinner.

Beautiful gardens and very light throughout.  Loved the sitting rooms with cosy fire and lovely furnishings.

Breakfast is gorgeous!  A real mix of Irish/North American/continental cuisines (and that is just breakfast!).

Central to all the things we wanted to see:  Trinity College/Book of Kells, Grafton Street, National Museum, etc.

Concierge service very helpful and friendly.
Stay here.  You will not regret it!",5,2004,12,08
200,Worth every one of its five stars,"We stayed for three nights in the main part of the hotel, in a large and comfortable suite.  Nearly everything about this hotel is spot on.  Its location is perfect, in the middle of Georgian Dublin, near Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College, the National Gallery, Parliament -- not to mention some very good restaurants.  We tried twice to get into the nearby Bang Cafe, but apparently it's always fully booked.  Ended up in a lovely restaurant called Rubicon, but there were several others in the area that looked just as promising.

The service in this hotel is what sets it apart.  When there were slip-ups -- as there inevitably are, even in the best hotels -- the staff were always ready to make it right.  And they're obviously trained, a rarity these days.  For example, because there is no separate service lift, I sometimes found myself waiting for the lift along with a member of staff.  When that happened, they always insisted that I take the lift (""for you, madam"") while they waited for the next one.  It's a small thing, I know.  But how many times, in other so-called luxury hotels,  have I been pinned to the back of an elevator by a hotel staff member wheeling a suitcase trolley or room service cart, without so much as an ""excuse me""?

The main buildings are Georgian, with the pleasing proportions of that style of architecture.  Several paintings in the public areas were done by artists whose works hang in the National Gallery, just down the street.  Yet for all that, this is not a stuffy hotel.  You're encouraged to sit by the fire (there are two lounges), read the paper, drink tea or coffee . . . hang out.  On a drizzly November afternoon, it was just what we needed.

The only complaint I had was that, because of the way the main rooms are laid out, anyone staying in the Garden wings has to pass through the lounge areas.  At one point, a stream of people came through, suitcases in tow -- it was like having afternoon tea in Grand Central Station!  

Overall, this is a wonderful hotel, but make no mistake -- even with the discounted rate (390 euro per night for the suite, with a generous breakfast included), this is not a cheap date, especially with the very unfavorable euro-to-dollar exchange rate.  

But I know I'll always think of Dublin with affection because I stayed at this hotel.  As they say in the ads -- priceless!
",5,2004,12,01
200,Perfect,"Just back from a wonderfull citytrip to Dublin. The Merrion could justify his price.
Paid 240 euro for a double room, full irish breakfast included. Got this price by emailing the reservation department. On the website more expensive!
Were happy to leave on saturday when the crowd came. So a tip if you can come during the week lot's more fun, easier to book a restaurant, getting into a pub or doing some sightseeing & shopping. Crazy no smoking policy even in the pubs from this year on! Dublin was our alternative for the yearly regural christmas-shoppingtrip to expensive London. BUT Dublin follows very well on the prices!!!
Pearl brasserie nextdoor was our best meal!
",5,2004,11,14
200,"Nice Hotel, But Overpriced","My partner and I stayed here in July for one night only. It took us an hour of driving around Dublin to find. When we finally found the Hotel it was a miracle because there is no proper sign outside, merely a brass plate at the front door. This annoyed us somewhat. Staff were extremely courteous and friendly. Breakfast was tasty but very pricey. The room was some what dated, but the marble bathroom was lovely. We booked on the net not through the Hotel website, and I would say that these bookings are possibly given the worst rooms. The spa was lovely and the treatment that I received was out of this world. I would highly recommend that spa for a luxury weekend away. The Hotel was lovely, but I think overall the quality of the room left the whole experience down.
",3,2004,11,08
200,good but at a price,"good hotel, but dukes suites not worth price. service was very good throughout hotel. Patrick Guibaud way overrated. way too much $. no Irish hospitality. food not that good for price.
",4,2004,08,10
200,6 Stars,"The Merrion has all the details right in a location that is perfect.  The doorman was outstanding at both arrival and departure, personable, welcoming,  and efficent.  Check in was a comedy of errors but Daniel more than made up for it with chocolates and champagne.  Few downtown hotels in any town have a quiet, restful garden like the Merrion which encourages you to open your window and watch the people and the ducks.  There simply can be no better, big hotel in Dublin. 
",5,2004,06,26
200,Excellent - best in Dublin,"Excellent hotel with great service, nice bar, great for cold winter evenings in front of the open fires, great location, great food.  The rooms are all lvoely but if you can get into the old wing of the hotel the rooms are just superb... you spend most of the night trying to get onto the high bed!  I have not stayed in a better hotel in Dublin
",5,2004,06,14
200,Doorman & Ducks!,"The nicest, most elegant hotel in Dublin.  We really liked the Merrion for more of an old world, English Tea, doorman environment.  The Clarence was also great - a nice dichotomy from the Merrion.  Staff was friendly at both, but more so at the Clarence.  The gardens at the Merrion were amazing and we spent time watching the baby ducklings drop into the pond.  A great eating spot near the Merrion is the Pearl Brasserie only a few doors away.   You couldn't go wrong with either  hotel!
",5,2004,05,27
200,over-priced,"I stayed at the merrion from the 26th feb to the 29th feb, with my partner and another couple. I obtained the hotel at a special offer rate and i would not consider paying the full price that the hotel normally request, especially as there were no breakfast included in the price! Throughout our stay, we encountered a couple of minor problems, such as........

(1) We ordered coffee and toast one morning, while we were waiting for a taxi to take us on a bus tour, this was ordered in the drawing room, the coffee arrived quite promptly, however we still hadn't received our toast by the time the taxi had arrived even though the order was made over 20 minutes beforehand. Needless to say, the taxi driver had to wait while we quickly ate our breakfast and added the waiting time onto our taxi bill!

(2) Our final problem and quite an important one is, the overall bill that we received, having checked the printed out receipt from reception, i noticed quite a hefty bill for room service, knowing that we hadn't really used room service i was quite amazed to discover 85 euros had been added to our bill! It turned out to be a bill for a half bottle of champagne, vodka and redbull and i believe some peanuts! 
Reception were quick to amend the bill and it was sorted out with no fuss. You really have to be careful with hotels that offer those sort of facilities, it makes me wonder how many people have been charged for items they may not have even had!

As a positive note, i will say that the staff at the merrion are exceptionally polite and friendly. I had a pleasant stay there and i would recommend the hotel to friends etc.",2,2004,03,01
200,"New Year Dinner,Poor food.","The Merrion is a wonderful hotel based upon four Regency townhouses skillfully combined into period elegance.The staff were great fun,always smiling and both attentive and efficient without being obtrusive.We paid for a deluxe room in the old part of the hotel which was spacious,tall ceilings and windows,regency decor,marble bathroom...my perfect hotel room,we all loved it.We stayed on a package over New Year's Eve which included,at a Euro 98 cover charge,a quote 'feast',see their website for full details.The feast prepared by chef Ed Cooney was quote'combines quality Irish ingredients with an additional festive twist'.My family and I are not fussy eaters but we all agreed that this was one of the most disappointing meals that we had ever eaten and in fact the cheese course was the only one I really enjoyed.We had eaten wonderfully elsewhere in Dublin including a memorable meal in the romantic Pearl Brasserie located next door to the Merrion.Within the Merrion is the award winning Restaurant Patrick Guilbard but hotel guests are advised that this restaurant is closed over Christmas and New Year.In fact this restaurant is not closed but appears to be utilised for private functions over festive periods,hotel guests are excluded and in this the hotel appear to be taking advantage offering only the Cellar Restaurant...the Cellar restaurant is really the breakfast room and lacks the ambience necessary for a gourmet dinner.I complained to the head waiter who was genuinely concerned that we had not enjoyed our meal and seemed surprised that the meal was described as a feast.Talking to the receptionist next morning she admitted that they had received other complaints about the dinner.My advice is NEVER,repeat NEVER! eat at this hotel unless the hotel guarantees that the meal will be served in the restaurant Patrick Guilbard.",2,2004,01,21
200,Classy hotel with cute staff,"The Merrion is located just away from the main action of Dublin but certainly within easy walking distance. From the outside it is discreet but stylish, very much the boutique townhouse hotel. We stayed in a garden room, which is in an annex behind the main house. The room itself was fairly sized with pretty standard 5* decor and fittings. 
Room service was prompt and polite, as were all the staff. And the boys at the front desk were very cute! Because of a function in the Merrion, we went for afternoon tea at the nearby Shelbourne. An hour in their drawing room confirmed that we had chosen the right place to stay. 
There is no comparison with other hotels in Dublin.",5,2003,12,15
200,World class,"After a lost AutoEurope reservation, a flat tire and a bum stay on our first night, we could not wait to get to the Merrion. We were not disappointed. The room was a junior suite in the Georgian building with fantastic linens, marble bathroom, high ceilings, gorgeous plaster work and superb room service. Do not miss a meal at Patrick Gilbaud. You will pay dearly, but leave satisfied. The bar is quite nice with the smell of burning peat giving you a sense of welcome.",5,2003,08,28
200,Excellent!!!,"Absolutely lovely weekend I spent here. Will return again anytime!! The staff, rooms, service are impeccable. And the concierge is very attentive to your needs. Will recommend this to anyone. You won't get a better hotel in Dublin City!!",5,2003,08,07
200,Just OK,"The hotel was nice but not 5* the service was just OK and concierge staff was minimum help.

Stay at 4 seasons if you want excellent service and large hotel and a Claridges if you want excellent service in a small hotel.",4,2003,07,05
200,Superb,"My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Merrion and I must say that rarely have I been as pleased to part with my money. The level of service and detail is truly spectacular. The staff is extremely friendly, professional, and attentive. We stayed in a room in the newer Garden Wing with a beautiful view of the gardens and pond which was usually occupied by several ducks. The room was huge and plush. While the bathroom contained floor to ceiling Italian marble as well as a separate bath and shower. There was nothing quite like the view of the gardens while drinking a pint of Guinness and listening to the Cranberries on the hotel supplied CD player. The hotel is only a stone's throw away from Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green. I for one intend to stay at the Merrion on all future trips to Dublin.",5,2003,05,10
200,Nearly perfect,"Bedrooms and public areas are just great, and the works of art on display are museum quality. Service is generally fantastic, but there was a considerable delay in obtaining my car when I was checking out (valet parking). Apart from that minor hiccup, this is all you could want from Irish hospitality. Expensive but worth splashing out on.",5,2003,04,16
200,Fabulous!,"Stayed here on a long weekend break and did not want to leave! Its wonderful! With excellent service and a very helpful concierge, helping to make the stay very memorable. What we like to remember is relaxing in the lounge,sitting in front of the log fire,  being served a wonderful afternoon tea whilst the weather outside is less than favourable. It is just fabulous!!
",5,2003,02,03
200,A haven of luxury and peace,"Imagine a large room overlooking a garden with fountains and (maybe) ducks, where you can open the window and still hear nothing of the bustling city around. Everything at the Merrion is fist class : rooms, furniture, service, breakfast,art display and history. And you are in the city centre. It's not cheap, of course, but it's not so expensive for the quality. I spent three days in june with my wife, on vacation, and we were delighted. If you go to Dublin, cancel your other reservation and book at the Merrion!

200,Wunderbar,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, das Hotel Marrion Dublin ist eine Erfahrung! Ein wunderschönes Hotel mit sehr freundlichen Menschen. Ein der besten Hotel, das ich besucht habe.  Ich schreibe normalerweise nie Bewertungen, aber weil das Hotel Marrion mich schon zum zweiten Mal fragt, mache ich das gerne - denn die erste war nicht vollständig. vielen Dank!",5,2018,10,09
200,Kommunikation,"Wir waren für die Dauer von 4 Übernachtungen im Merrion. Ein elegantes, klassisches 5 Sterne Hotel mit vielen Annehmlichkeiten für anspruchsvolle Gäste. Ein sauberes geräumiges hochwertig ausgestattetes Zimmer. Leider sind die Zimmer etwas hellhörig, insbesondere dann, wenn eine geschlossene Verbindungstür zum anderen Zimmer geht. Trotz allem sind die Zimmer in Richtung Innenhof ruhig und vom geschäftigen Treiben auf der Straße hört man wenig. Das Frühstück und das Essen sind hochwertig mit gehobenen Preisen, aber das erwartet man in einem 5 Sterne Hotel auch nicht anders. Ein schöner, großer Pool ist das Highlight des Spa. Mitarbeiter alle freundlich und zuvorkommend. Schön fanden wir, dass das Housekeeping wohl eine Geburtstagskarte im Zimmer entdeckte und am Abend 3 Tafeln Schokolade als kleine Aufmerksamkeit ins Zimmer legte. 

Nun zu den Kritkpunkten, die uns dazu brachten, statt 5 Punkte nur 4 Punkte zu geben. Beim Frühstück wird gerne mal was vergessen, das bestellt wurde oder es wird etwas anderes serviert. Zu meinem Geburtstag am Samstag hatten wir für den Abend bereits am Mittwoch einen Tisch an der Rezeption reservieren und bestätigen lassen. Am Samstag war dann kein Tisch reserviert. Hatte man vergessen oder die Kommunikation zwischen Rezeption und Restaurant gestaltet sich als schwierig. Man fand dann eine Lösung und es gab noch einen Tisch, zwar nicht den besten, aber wenigstens einen Tisch. So was ist für den Gast nicht gerade angenehm, zumal am eigenen Geburtstag. Am Nachmittag waren wir - als Gäste des Hotels - beim Afternoontea bereits abgewiesen worden, da nicht reserviert, aber 
auch nicht wirklich erfreulich. Wir sind dann an die Bar verwiesen worden, haben dann im Freien noch eine angenehme Stunde verbracht. Am Tag vor der Abreise hatten wir an der Rezeption einen Flughafentransfer für den Abreisetag gebucht und auch bestätigt bekommen. Leider wurde auch der vergessen, also gab es ein normales einfaches Taxi zum Flughafen. 

Da wir vom traumhaften Dromloland Castle angereist waren, ist uns der Unterschied im Service schon deutlich aufgefallen. 

An zwei Abenden waren wir in der Cellar Bar. Nette kleinere Gerichte, schönes Ambiente und sehr nettes, durchaus persönliches Personal, da sich vom etwas unpersönlichen und leider in der Kommunaktion verbesserungswürdigen Personal im Hotel abgrenzt.

Insgesamt aber alles in allem ein erfreulicher Aufenthalt, alles was schief lief, wurde wieder ausgeglichen. Vielleicht bis irgendwann mal wieder.",4,2018,09,02
200,Gutes klassisches Luxushotel in zentraler Lage,"Von außen wirkt das Hotel zunächst nicht luxuriös, die typischen, verschiedenen Stadthausfassaden verhindern dies. Innen ist das Hotel größer als gedacht. Im Atrium ist ein schöner Garten, der bei gutem Wetter auch Plätze zum Verweilen bietet, sei es vorn vor der Bar oder hinten vor dem Garden Room Restaurant. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich, professionell und effizient. Der Service war insgesamt professionell und sehr freundlich. Das Zimmer bot Ausblick, mit kleinem franz. Balkon, zum Garten im Atrium, daher auch sehr ruhig gelegen, war gut, stilvoll und ansprechend eingerichtet. Das Marmorbad war geräumig, hatte Dusche und Wanne. Das Bett, Boxspring, war gut und sehr bequem mit leichter Daunendecke. Das Garden Room Restaurant war auch fürs Dinner gut, nicht überteuert verglichen mit ähnlichen Restaurants in der Umgebung. Das Continental-Frühstücksbuffet ist zwar qualitativ gut, bietet aber nicht gerade eine reichhaltige Auswahl, dafür ist der Preis für die Hotelkategorie wenigstens nicht überteuert wie sonst meistens. Auch hier ist der Service zu loben.",5,2018,08,22
200,Favoloso ,"Abbiamo trascorso un weekend lungo a Dublino e l’ accoglienza del Merrion ha reso tutto perfetto. La colazione veramente eccellente, dal setting della sala al menù.  Un’esperienza fantastica senza nessna pecca. Da tornarci sicuramente",5,2018,08,19

200,Benvenuti a Dublino ,"Sono stato con mia moglie in questo Hotel dal 9 all’11 luglio 2018. Struttura di primo livello, in pieno centro, camere molto pulite e dotate di ogni comfort. Una segnalazione particolare alla gentilissima Pamela che, nella nostra lingua, ci fa servito a colazione in modo impeccabile dandoci anche consigli e assistenza sul nostro soggiorno .",5,2018,07,14
200,Toller Frühstückstee,"Bei strahlenden Sonnenschein habe ich mir im Garten des Merrion einen irischen Frühstückstee gegönnt. Alles war perfekt: das Ambiente und der Service. 
Die Einrichtung in der Lobby und den Kaminzimmern ist sehr gediegen, die Innenkabinen der Fahrstühle sind sogar in Eichenholz verkleidet. ",5,2018,05,12

200,Feines Hotel in bester Lage,"Wir waren für ein Wochenende im Merrion und fühlten uns dort sehr gut aufgehoben. Die Zimmer sind wunderschön und sehr groß ebenso die Bäder. Die Halle mit Kamin und ausgestattet mit Antiquitäten, in der man gemütlich einen Tee zu sich nehmen kann, hat uns besonders gut gefallen. Die Mitarbeiter sind kompetent und freundlich. Die Lage des Hotels ist ausgesprochen gut, da man alle Aktivitäten auch zu Fuss in Angriff nehmen kann. Dublin ist wunderbar - besonders beeindruckend war die Old Library im Trinitiy College. Tipp: Die Warteschlangen vor Ort sind nicht so lang am frühen Abend. Auch absolut empfehlenswert ist ein Ausflug in Küstenstädtchen Howth.",5,2017,10,12
200,"Bonito, bien localizado y excelente servicio","Es un muy buen hotel, el servicio es excelente y la localización también. La habitación muy confortable, el desayuno muy bueno y variado. Fue una muy buena experiencia y si vuelvo a Dublin, seguramente reservaría aquí.",5,2017,09,06
200,Esperienza bellissima!,"Abbiamo soggiornato al Marrion sia all'andata sia al ritorno del nostro viaggio in Irlanda. La cortesia, pulizia, disponibilità del personale ci hanno fatto sentire a casa. I letti sono molto comodi e le pantofole di cortesia ,che vengono poste la sera ai lati del letto, sono uniche.  Torneremo sicuramente a trovarvi. ",5,2017,09,04
200,Führendes Hotel,"

Erfüllt deutlich, was von einem Hotel dieser Kategorie zu erwarten ist. Preis etwas gar hoh. Frühstücksraum unter Tag etwas düster. Würde trotzdem wieder hingehen. Ausgezeineter Service, sehr aufmerksame Crew.",5,2017,08,26
200,"Zentrale Lage, guter Service","Übers Internet galt das Hotel als ausgebucht (U2 Konzert-Wochenende), per Telefon war dann aber ein Zimmer noch frei. Haben uns pro- aktiv im Vorfeld für Services kontaktiert. Der Spa Bereich ist nicht besonders (nur Pool und Dampfbad) und beim Frühstück hatten wir mehrmals ""Pech"" (lange Wartezeit fürs Essen und schlechter Tisch). Generell aber sind die Mitarbeiter sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Genial ist aber vor allem die zentrale Lage. Wir konnten vieles zu Fuss erledigen.",4,2017,07,30
200,HOTEL IN CENTRO,"OTTIMO ALBERGO in Centro. Accoglienza da 5 stelle.
Abbiamo avuto una bella camera con vista sul giardino davvero molto bella.
PISCINA E CENTRO BENESSERE al top. L'Hotel è in una zona molto elegante di Dublino e vicinissimo alla via dello Shopping.",4,2017,07,06
200,Great Experience,"L'accoglienza all'arrivo è stata la migliore possibile. Tutto quello che era stato concordato all'atto della prenotazione è stato portato a termine felicemente (Si trattava di un viaggio in Irlanda che mi ero ripromesso per il mio compleanno. Entrando in camera, ho trovato su un tavolo una nota di auguri accompagnata da deliziosi dolcettiI) Tutto è stato di alto livello, l'ambiente della camera, il bagno, la colazione.e quant'altro. Un'esperienza insomma che mi auguro di ripetere presto.",5,2017,06,10
200,unico,"hace que el lugar sea aun mas lindo, imperdible, conocer este hotel . todo el sevicio es sobresaliente, ideal para un viaje super activo, las habitaciones son un sueño, grandes, comodas, el servicio de desayuno incluido a la habitacion y disponible las 24 hs,",5,2017,05,22
200,Eccellenza irlandese.,"Siamo stati in questo albergo per Capodanno. Ambienti bellissimi ed eleganti, stile classico. Sale con camini.Camere ampie e dotate di ogni servizio. avevamo quella con vista sul giardino. Si viene accompagnati perchè l'albergo è grande. Colazione continentale completa e di ottima qualità. Servizio in camera ottimo. Cena di Capodanno raffinata e ben servita.... non possiamo scrivere della festa di mezzanotte a causa di un piccolo inconveniente con il bimbo che ci ha costretti a tornare in camera un pò prima. Una particolare menzione per la signora italiana che serve al ristorante, super gentile e professionale. (mi scuso per aver dimenticato,a distanza di mesi, il nome). Piscina centro benessere abbastanza grande...unica pecca.... sala relax piccolissima. Albergo che consigliamo anche per la posizione, in un quartiere elegante e non distante dalle vie dello shopping.",5,2017,05,16
200,Aufenthalt in Dublin,"Aufgrund der Erfahrungen mit dem Merrion bei unserem letzten Dublin-Besuch war für uns klar: bei einem weiteren Aufenthalt in dieser Stadt kommt für uns wiederum nur dieses Hotel in Frage. Am Service, am Zimmer und an Bedienung und Verpflegung im Kellerrestaurant und der Kellerbar hatten wir nichts auszusetzen. Was mir besonders aufgefallen ist: benötigte ich Hilfe vom  Personal, so hatteich nie den Eindruck, jemanden zu belästigen (Motto: Achtung, Kunde droht mit Arbeit), sondern die Hilfe wurde immer gerne und freundlich geleistet. Wenn der Kunde irgendwo König ist, dann im Merrion!",5,2017,05,09
200,Das beste Hotel in dem ich je war!!,"Ich habe mich sehr auf meinen ersten Aufenthalt im Merrion gefreut und wurde nicht enttäuscht. Auch wenn das Hotel höchsten Ansprüchen genügt und sehr elegant und edel ausgestattet ist, fühlte ich mich als junger Alleinreisender sehr wohl. Vom Empfang bis zur Abreise war alles perfekt. Solch einen Service habe ich in noch keinem anderen Hotel erlebt. Ein Traum in Dublin!!",5,2017,04,25
200,Muy buena experiencia,"En general todo funcionó muy bien. Un detalle: la cafetera está en un mueble q no tiene toma corriente para enchufarla.
El servicio y el personal excelente, realmente muy buena atención.
Es para recomendar",4,2017,04,09
200,Hotel centrale a Dublino,"L'hotel si trova in un'ottima posizione per visitare Dublino anche a piedi.
le camere sono ben arredate e moderne, qualche particolare è un po' datato ma nel complesso la qualità è buona. Un merito particolare alla cucina, molto varia e raffinata, ottima l'assistenza del personale e il servizio in camera. E' certamente uno dei migliori hotel della città, non conosco i prezzi per valutare il rapporto con la qualità poiché ero in viaggio di lavoro, ma da quanto ho visto mi sembrano adeguati.",4,2017,03,14
200,Tradition und Qualität wunderbar kombiniert,"Schon bei der Ankunft wird man freundlich und professionell in Empfang genommen. Der Check-In Prozess entspricht höchsten Erwartungen von den Formalitäten über Informationen zum Hotel und der damit verbundenen Geschichte sowie der Begleitung zum Hotelzimmer und dem Gepäckservice.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und professionell / geschult.

Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral - Fussgängerzone, National Museum und National Galerie - alles liegt wirklich ""um die Ecke"".

Bei nächsten Besuch in Dublin werde ich hier wieder absteigen.
",5,2017,02,05
200,Tradizione irlandese,"Hotel posizionato nel cemtro di Dublino, personale accogliente e gentilissimo, camere spaziose nell ala garden e silenziose, piscina gradevole facilmente accessibile, ma il vero must e' la sala/e da tea dove si svolge il rito pomeridiano con gran classe.
Non do l eccellenza a quest hotel per la colazione posizionata sottoterra ,cara e senza troppa qualita'. Ritornero'.",4,2017,02,05
200,Siamo veramente al TOP,"Hotel in zona centralissima. Personale gentilissimo, mi hanno accompagnato personalmente in camera perché in effetti la struttura é grande in modo da non crearmi problemi nel trovarla. Camera grande, perfettamente attrezzata, due bottiglie di acqua a disposizione, set completo per il caffé, courtesy set ottimo, ciabattine e biancheria da letto e da bagno superlativa. Comprendo che magari questo sia un aspetto ritenuto minore, ma per me é importante e raramente ho visto biancheria cosí bella. Letto grande e comodissimo. Si dorme benissimo. Wifi velocissimo e ad accesso immediato. Anche il personale alla concierge é gentilissimo.  In sintesi, veramente perfetti. Se torneró a Dublino, cittá che peraltro merita il viaggio, andró sicuramente di nuovo al Merrion.",5,2017,02,03
200,Primo posto meritato ,"Hotel di ottimo livello, molto confortevole e con servizio impeccabile. Le camere affacciate sul giardino sono particolarmente silenziose. Breakfast di ottimo livello. Sistemazione perfetta a pochi passi dal centro",5,2016,12,04
200,Hotel centrale e confortevole,"abbiamo frequentato questo Hotel per 3 notti, belle camere silenziose e ampie, ottimi servizi e area comfort. Meritevole la SPA, con bagno turco e piscina (anche spazio palestra). Giudizio ottimo. Sicuramente suggerito.",5,2016,11,15

Desayuno increíble. Las zonas comunes son agradables y tranquilas .
La habitación era preciosa. El cuarto de baño de película!!",5,2016,11,09
200,Excelente Estancia,"Estuvimos hospedados en dos ocasiones, en habitaciones muy distintas, y en abos casos, fueron excelentes. fue recomendación de un amigo, y nosotros lo recomendamos ampliamente.

Il ristorante è di ottimo livello con piatti curati e molto  buoni.

200,Impareggiabile,"E' raro trovare un hotel che offra così tanto ad un ospite. L'eleganza che contraddistingue l'intera struttura ( dagli spazi comuni alle camere) va di pari passo con la perfetta organizzazione ed efficienza nel minimo dettaglio. Il personale (tutto)
è improntato alla educazione massima, al rispetto altrui. E' indubbio che il plauso maggiore vada a chi dirige le varie strutture di questo raffinato hotel. Tutto, qui, funziona al meglio: i ristoranti, la piscina coperta, l'art tea... ma anche il servizio di concierge (complimenti, durante la nostra intera permanenza non ha sbagliato nulla, relativamente alle nostre richieste). Inoltre, l'accoglienza riservata a mia figlia (di 7 anni) è stata attentissima. Elevato il livello di comfort delle camere: dalla silenziosità alla comodità dei letti alla pulizia. Da menzionare, ancora, la cura verso il gusto del bello con la notevole collezione d'arte che è sparsa un po' ovunque nei vari spazi. Il tutto senza mai sfiorare l'affettazione e la pacchianeria.  La degna collocazione, infine, in uno dei quartieri più eleganti di Dublino ne fanno di questo un posto unico. Un grazie a tutti, per questo autentico privilegio concessoci.",5,2016,09,16
200,Un hotel muy especial,Hemos disfrutado de este centrico hotel y de su exposicion permanente de pinturas. Bellisima la exposicion. El hotel muy selecto y el personal muy amable en especial Laia que al ser de Barcelona como nosotros nos atendio con mucho cariño.,5,2016,08,27
200,NO VISITES LA CAFETERIA ¡¡¡,"gran hotel, instalaciones inmejorables ( tambien las pagas que el hotel no es barato ), espacio gym y piscina de ensueño ( tambien lo pagas que el hotel no es barato ), habitaciones impecables ( también las pagas que el hotel no es barato), desayuno impresionante, sobre todo su personal ( que aunque lo pagues y no sea barato son unos chicos cariñosos y profesionales que te hacen sentir como en casa, sobre todo Luis - lo mejor del hotel ), y ..... el bar del hotel , que aunque lo pagues y no sea barato, es un lugar trisssste ( hubo mas ambiente el el funeral de mi tia-abuela ) y aburrrrrido y sobre todo con unos camareros mal educados y engreidos que te llaman la atención de malas formas  por hablar o reirte ( ¡¡ por dios que estamos de vacaciones ¡¡¡ ), y esto seria disculpuble si sus cocteles estuvieran a la altura , pero nisiquiera eso, bastante malillos - por ser amable pero mejor ir a otro sitio a pedir los cocteles ( y eso que te los cobran como si la ginebra se extrajera de las minas del rey Salomón ) aconsejo el Shelbourne en Dublin, mucho mejor y mas amables ( menos en el personal del desayuno que son inmejorables )",2,2016,08,19
200,Ottimo hotel,"Ovviamente costoso, situato in una zona elegante a ridosso della confusione del centro ma molto più tranquilla.
Colazione ottima, servizio impeccabile, stanza elegante e letto comodo, piscina e palestra compresi.
Di rilievo il bar interno dove andare a prendere un birra od un caffè e l'esposizione di quadri che rendono il Merrion un vero e proprio piccolo museo.",5,2016,08,18
200,HOTEL CASI PERFECTO,"Servicio de desayuno excelente, calidad inmejorable , atención del personal exqusita , Luis, fantastico atendiendo a los clientes, entrañable y muy atento para que te encuentres como en tu casa. Recepción excelente siempre ayudandote en todo lo que necesites. Habitaciones e instalaciones excelentes, zona de piscina y gym inmejorable. Problema para ser perfecto: servicio de bar: nos llamaron la atención por estar escuchando una cancion en el mobil, a muy poco volumen , ese día no tenían ningun cartel puesto en las mesas de  ""cuidado con el mobil para no molestar al resto de clientes"" y al día siguiente lo pusieron en las mesas. Nos pareció fatal ademas el modo de decirnos el personal que apagaramos el mobil fue de muy malas formas y ya no volvimos a consumir mas en el bar, y es una pena porque los cockteles no estan mal pero es una zona en la que no te dejan casi ni hablar.  La clientela suele ser muy mayor en el hotel y debe ser que tiene que estar todo en silencion , no hay ni musica es muy aburrida y deprimente.",4,2016,08,16
200,Nettes Hotel ,"Schönes Hotel zentral gelegen. Freundlicher Empfang, obwohl das Zimmer um 16 Uhr noch nicht frei war. Dafür gab es Getränke. Das Zimmer in den Hof, war geräumig inkl. des Bads. Da wir das Fenster offen gelassen haben, war es in der Früh etwas laut. Das Frühstück war ok, aber nicht aufregen. Dennoch war es ein angenehmer Aufenthalt.",4,2016,08,13
200,Mehr als angenehm!,"Sehr gut, nur zu empfehlen! Im Stadtkern gelegen und dennoch sehr ruhig. Perfekter Service und dies rund um die Uhr. Einrichtung für mich genau richtig. Nicht übertrieben, mit viel Geschmack.  Für mich ein Hotel, in dem ich mich sofort wie ""zu Hause"" gefühlt habe. Somit perfekt!",5,2016,07,27
200,En el balance: muy bueno,"Lo importante: las habitaciones, que es lo que uno busca en un hotel sobre todas las cosas, son muy buenas, la decoración es prolija y cálida. Los colchones y almohadas: muy cómodos. Puede que la vista no sea maravillosa, pero se subsana con el interior.
El desayuno es muy bueno si se toma en cuenta que no es sólo lo que hay a la vista sino que además se pide la parte de cocina (caliente) de la carta para que llegue recién cocinada a la mesa. El trato es particularmente MUY bueno siempre. 
Comer algo más liviano en el ""Bar No.23"" del hotel, es siempre rico y también bien atendido. El salmón ahumado irlandés que sirven es excelente.
Defectos hay siempre, pero volvería sin dudarlo!! No lo cambiaría para probar otro hotel",4,2016,07,16
200,Charme Georgiano,"Classe e raffinatezza, ci si aspetta di incontrare James Joyce o Oscar Wilde, con una buona tazza di tè, in uno dei salotti della hall. Opere d’arte alle pareti, mobili d’antiquariato e camere molto belle, in particolare le suite con vista del Parlamento.",5,2016,06,29
200,"edles Hotel und Restaurant und Kellerbar, an bester zentraler Lage mitten in Dublin","Das Hotel liegt super für ein Dublin Sightseeing oder für Business Meeting.Service ist gut und sehr entgegenkommend, hilfsbereit. Zimmer sind gross und bieten allen Komfort. Ungewohnt das sehr hohe Bett - passt zur englischen Ausstattung des ganzen Hauses. Restaurant ist sehr gut, die Kellerbar fantastisch.

Wenn das Zimmer um 1500h nicht bereit ist, könnte man in der Wartezeit einen Kaffee, The oder Fruchtsaft offerieren. Dieser musste aber in der Tagesbar (Lobby) bezahlt werden.",4,2016,06,15
200,Toller Komfort in bester Lage,"3 Nächte haben wir dieses außergewöhnliche Hotel genossen. Service und Komfort waren exzellent. Hervorzuheben ist das stets freundliche Personal, die jedem Wunsch gerecht geworden sind. Die Zimmer sind sauber und werden mehrmals täglich aufgefrischt. Der Stadtkern ist fußläufig gut zu erreichen.",5,2016,05,17
200,Casi perfecto,"Estratégicamente ubicado en el centro de Dublin, este hotel tiene todas las características para ser un cinco estrellas de referencia. Personal amable y profesional, habitaciones amplias y cómodas, así como confortables instalaciones comunes. 
La excepción sería el restaurante The Cellar ubicado en el claustrofóbico y oscuro sótano del hotel. Aunque el desayuno es correcto, la calidad de la cena deja mucho que desear. 
El hotel está en obras. Ganaría mucho si trasladaran el comedor a la zona del jardín y también mejorando la calidad de las comidas en The Cellar y al mismo tiempo estimulando la creatividad del chef. ",4,2016,05,16
200,Spiten Hotel,Ausgezeichnetes Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud mit sehr innovativen Gerichten und spitzen Weinkarte. Der Service im Hotel ist hervorragend und immer extrem freundlich. Bester high tea den ich je hatte! Hervorragende Lage in Dublin,5,2016,04,12
200,Grossartig,"Wir waren für vier Nächte in Dublin mit unseren erwachsenen Töchtern. Schon der Empfang im Merrion war unglaublich: rasch, effizient, humorvoll und sehr freundlich. Das ganze Hotel ist perfekt sauber und sehr stilvoll mit den verwinkelten Räumen und dem Kaminzimmer. Der Pool und der Fitnessraum sind ebenfalls sehr schön, gepflegt und ruhig. Die Lage des Hotels ist ausgezeichnet, und wir sind überall hin zu Fuss gegangen. Am Meisten gefallen hat uns der Humor und die zuvorkommende Art des Personals. Auch mit Regenjacken fühlten wir uns willkommen. Es ist das perfekte Hotel für hohe Ansprüche und dennoch sehr persönlich und zum
Wohlfühlen.",5,2016,04,03
200,Solo una palabra excelente,"Es un hotel de tradición,  muy hermoso y excelente condiciones.  Las habitaciones son muy cómodas.  La piscina estubo muy bien,  al igual que el bar del hotel fue excelente hay dos y cada uno tiene su atractivo.  El conserje nos ayudo mucho en reservas.  Hotel excelente con muchos detalles ",5,2016,03,17
200,Zentral und Schön,"Professioneller, unaufgeregter Empfang. Sehr relaxed. Hotel liegt sehr zentral. Service ist in der Regel ausgezeichnet. Ebenso der Empfang beim Frühstück. Der Service des Personals ist allerdings beim Abräumen und Kaffee bringen verbesserungswürdig. Einige Schwächen gibt es im Hotel wie z.B. die mangelnde Toilettenspülung (Zimmer 305) und Durchgang durch die Kaminzimmer. Insgesamt aber ein sehr angenehmes Hotel.",5,2016,03,16
200,Angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Nach zehn Jahren hatte ich wieder einmal die Gelegenheit im Merrion abzusteigen. Mein Aufenthalt war genau so angenehm wie ich ihn von damals in Erinnerung hatte. Dieses Mal hatte ich über Leading Hotels of the World gebucht. Als Leading Club Member habe ich auch einige ""Extras"" bekommen.  Auch soll man sich unbedingt die Zeit nehmen für einen ""High Tea"".in der Lobby am offenen Kamin. Ein köstliches Erlebnis.",5,2016,02,02
200,El mejor hotel de Dublin,"Se trata de un muy elegante y acogedor en Dublin.

Ottima colazione a buffet, stanze di classe, e opere d'arte suggestive. Ti sembra di vivere un'atmosfera d'altri tempi. Consigliatissimo!",5,2015,12,28
200,Typisches kolonialisches Flair,Die Atmosphäre ist wirklich ganz besonders in diesem Hause. Besonders angenehm sind die Salons in denen Tag und Nacht die Gäste aber auch auswärtige Personen den klassischen engl. tea time genießen können. Sehr gutes Frühstück. Perfekt geschultes und sehr freundliches Personal. Sehr schöner SPA Bereich mit 18m langem Innen-pool. Sehr schnelles WLAN (umsonst !)..,5,2015,12,12

200,Charme,"Un albergo semplicemente elegante ed accogliente. Le camere sono ben curate, attenzione ai dettagli,pulizia e ben mantenute. Quelle che si affacciano sul viale principale sono perfettamente insonorizzate. In generale tutto il personale è efficiente e gentile ma grazie in particolare alle signorine Diletta e Silvia (colazione). Consiglio ai futuri ospiti un aperitivo nei pressi del caminetto nel salotto adiacente il bar. Un albergo che non si dimentica!",5,2015,10,28
200,Da sogno.,"Bellissimo e affascinantissimo hotel in questa città davvero simpatica. Camera splendida, sale del bar che sembravano prese da un film (tanto erano tipicamente calde e accoglienti), è disponibile anche la spa, seppure senza sauna.
Il personale è molto cortese, in particolare la sig.na Diletta, italiana, che la mattina era alla sala delle colazioni e ci ha dato anche ottimi suggerimenti per le visite alla città.",5,2015,10,27
200,classe al centro di Dublino,"Abbiamo soggiornato con mia moglie due giorni al Merrion, per visitare Dublino prima di un giro in Irlanda. Albergo che rispetta le aspettative nella qualità del servizio, nelle camere, nella attenzione ai particolari e per l'ottima posizione. 
Merita di essere il n. 1",5,2015,08,27
200,Irische Eleganz,"Das Merrion Hotel liegt sehr gut. Die Zimmer im alten Hauptteil sind sehr stilvoll eingerichtet. Die Qualität der Betten und Wäsche ist gut. Im Badezimmer fanden wir wenig Ablageplatz und eine etwas altertümliche Bad- und Duschkombination.  

Die Fenster isolieren sehr gut. Safe, Teekocher etc. sind vorhanden. Die Anleitung zum Gebrauch ist etwas seltsam, um den Zugang zu erhalten wird eine Emailadresse verlangt. Das mutet eher seltsam an. Das WIFI hat allerdings eine gute Geschwindigkeit. 

Das Frühstück ist ebenso durchschnittlich, wie das Servicepersonal.",4,2015,08,16
200,EXCELENTE,"Magnífico el servicio de todo el personal del hotel, de lo mejor que experimentado en muchos años de viajes tanto personales como profesionales.   La gastronomía muy buena también. De los dos bares del hotel, el mejor es sin duda el ""The Cellar Bar"".  El otro, el ""23"" es bastante rancio, aunque la selección de bebidas (es especial el whisky), pero un servicio perfecto y ejemplar compensa el aspecto viejo.  La ubicación muy buena, pero no llega a ser perfecta.",5,2015,07,19
200,Increible!,"Fui a Tomar el Te en el bar de Planta baja, EL servicio Fue Increíble desde que llegamos hasta que nos fuimos, muy atentos a todas nuestras necesidades.
Te sirven Te en hebras
La pastelería representaba Cuadros de la galería del hotel. una Exquisitez",5,2015,06,26
200,Falta de atencion al cliente ,"No nos permitieron esperar en recepción de hotel mientras terminaban de preparar nuestras habitaciones. Todos los espacios de espera estaban reservados para el ""tee"". Fuimos a tomar algo al comedor para esperar y se nos dijo que estaba cerrado para preparar para la cena. Todo esto lo entendemos, el problema es la manera que escogieron para decirlo. Nos sentimos despreciados. 

Al día siguiente nos cambiamos al Shelbourne. Mejor tarifa, mejor hotel y mucho mejor trato. ",2,2015,06,12
200,Grandioses Luxushotel,"Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Grandioses Grandhotel, welches aus 4 historischen Gebäuden besteht. Ausgestattet mit Antiquitäten. Sehr geschmackvolle Zimmer mit äußerst bequemen Betten. Zwei exzellent Restaurants, wobei ich Ihnen den Lunch im Feinschmecker Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud sehr empfehle. Mittags wirklich ein Bargin. Aber uns gefiel auch die Bar ausgesprochen gut.",5,2015,06,08
200,Ein Aspekt ....,"den ich den Betreibern des Hotels hoch anrechne: Schon beim Betreten der Lobby fällt der Blick auf auffällig gute Kunst (sowohl Fotografie, wie Malerei). Das mag viele Gäste nicht interessieren, zumal in vielen anderen 5-Sterne Hotels darauf weniger Wert gelegt wird. Für Ästheten und Kenner ist die künstlerische Ausstattung des Merrion absolut überdurchschnittlich. Eine Freude für jeden Gast, der nicht nur Matratzen und anderen Komfort für sein Wohlbefinden schätzt.

Alle anderen Dinge, die es zu bewerten gibt, waren auch auf hohem Niveau und sind von anderen Gästen gewürdigt worden.",5,2015,06,01
200,Wir fühlten uns königlich,"Was soll man dazu sagen! Einfach ein wunderschönes Hotel der oberen Klasse. Hier wird Luxus geboten. Der Empfang ist vorbildlich. Es dürfte zwar etwas langsamer englisch gesprochen werden für nicht so geübte, aber das ist ein Detail. 
Die Zimmer sind mit allem ausgestattet was ein Hotelgast braucht. Luxuriöse Ausstattung, schöne Möbel, bequeme Betten, und ein grosses, Luxusbad. Alles ist sauber. Die Zimmer werden beim verlassen in Ordnung gemacht, alles schön aufgestellt, und wenn man vom Nachtessen zurückkommt ist der Bettüberwurf weg, die Vorhänge gezogen, ein sauberes Tuch vor dem Bett und die Hausschuhe davor. Einfach ein vorbildliche Service. 
Schöne Restaurants, gemütliche Atmosphäre mit Kamine, Businessraum, Bar...hier hat es alles um die Gäste so richtig zu verwöhnen.

Wenn in Dublin, dann nur im Merrion!!! Passion und Leidenschaft werden hier gross geschrieben!

Vielen Dank für alles!!",5,2015,05,31
200,Perfekt,"Hinreissendes Hotel, das wunderschön ausgestattet ist und erstklassigen Service bietet. Relativ gut gelegen; man erreicht das Trinity College (Book of Kells), die Shopping Area um Grafton Street und den Temple Bar Distrikt gut zu Fuss.",5,2015,05,28
200,Inolvidable,"Excelente hotel, extremadamente acogedor y con personal a la altura que se espera de un hotel singular. La habitación comodísima y extremadamente limpia. Está en un edificio histórico y al lado -se accede desde el hotel-  de un restaurante extraordinario. Es un lugar de referencia para los dublineses que quieren tomar el té por la tarde, así que conviene reservar porque el salón, muy cálido con su chimenea siempre encendida, no es muy grande.",5,2015,05,18

200,Sentirsi a casa a Dublino,"Per un breve soggiorno a Dublino ho scelto questo albergo situato strategicamente al centro di luoghi interessanti, in modo da poter tranquillamente girare a piedi. Nel raggio di una bella passeggiata si trovano le vie principali, i pub più frequentati, il  Parlamento, il Trinity College e i migliori ristoranti, ammesso che non si voglia restare nell'ottimo ristorante dell'albergo.
All'interno del Merrion c'è un'aria di casa, tranquille e ampie sale con il camino che scoppietta, ambiente ovattato, cura nei particolari dell'arredamento classico. Le camere  sono ampie e per il massimo della tranquillità io ho scelto una camera affacciata sul bel giardino interno. Servizio impeccabile. Ottimo ricordo. Per parlare di vil pecunia, soldi ben spesi.
Consigliato.",5,2015,03,25
200,Sehr schönes Hotel.,"Das Hotel befindet sich in einer super Lage zum Stadzentrum. Es ist sehr gepflegt, sauber mit sehr gutem Service und schönen Zimmern. Hier stimmt alles was man sich in einem Hotel dieser Klasse wünscht und vorstellt.... Kurzum .... Perfekt von a-z!",5,2015,02,26
200,art afternoon tea,"wunderbare location für einen afternoon tea der uns ein einem altehrwürdigen salon serviert wurde in front of a working fireplace. zusätzlich zu den herkömmlichen sandwiches (leider etwas zu geschmacksneutral), scones und süssigkeiten wurden aus der grossen artsammlung des hotels noch drei gemälde kunstvoll als Patisserie serviert und deren bedeutung/geschichte erklärt. die gemälde konnten wir zudem live besichtigen. der tee war köstlich, die bedienung königlich (im gegensatz zum personal am hotel und salon empfang, welches uns - was wir von einem 5stern hotel erwarten, weder die türe öffnete noch uns zum salon und unserem platz begleitete. alles in allem schien die hektische welt draussen für eine weile weit weg zu sein.",5,2015,01,18
200,Excelente!,"El hotel esta ubicado en el centro de Dublin muy cerca de todas los mejores lugares de la ciudad. 
El hotel es super de lujo y el servicio es perfecto. Siempre tenes alguien para ayudarte en tu estadía.
Las habitaciones son grandes y las camas muy comodas. Dentro de la habitación uno encuentra todas las comodidades y los baños som enormes con jacuzzi y ducha separadas. 
Los dos restaurantes que tiene son muy buenos, uno mas casual y otro (mas caro) que es imprsionante.
El mejor lugar es el salon de te que tiene opciones muy ricas y tambien tienen el te tradicional apto para celiacos. Lo super recomiendo, caro pero el mejor hotel de Dublin.",5,2014,12,09
200,WOW,"TOP TOP TOP !!
Was soll ich sagen, ich war Überwältigt.
Ich habe schon viele Hotels gesehen, ABER dieses ist nicht zu schlagen.
Zimmer, Restaurant, Sauberkeit und Service sind SPITZEN Klasse.
Wenn ich noch mal in Dublin sein sollte, ""NUR"" Hier !",5,2014,11,20
200,El espíritu señorial de Dublín,"Un hotel precioso, con un trato servicial , muy céntrico...muy cerca de las calles bulliciosas de Dublín y del Trinity College, Lo mejor del hotel es sin duda la hora del té en uno de sus salones con chimenea......con un pianista amenizando ....Las habitaciones muy confortables.",5,2014,11,05
200,Si merita la prima posizione,"L'albergo è situato vicino al centro. In 5 minuti a piedi si raggiunge Grafton Street (la via dello shopping), il Trinity College (dove è situata la biblioteca più antica al mondo), il Temple Bar (quartiere di bar, pub e ristoranti). Di ottima qualità, con camere eleganti (Stile British) è abbastanza spaziose. Molto curato e con un servizio eccellente. L'albero ha anche un ristorante integrato con due stelle Michelin ) l'unico due stelle in tutta Irlanda). Inoltre dispone di un bar aperto 24ore al giorno e diverse sale ""tra room"" con camino. Completo anche di Spa! C'è davvero tutto. Molto consigliato.",5,2014,10,11
200,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel,"Wir waren begeistert von unserem Aufenthalt im Merrion. Geräumiges Zimmer, gute Betten, top sauberes Badezimmer und freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Das Essen im ""Cellar Restaurant"" war ausgezeichnet. Keine riesige Karte, aber die Qualität des gebotenen Essens entspricht dem Standard des Hotels.
Wenn wir wieder nach Dublin reisen, kommt für uns nur das Merrion in Frage.",5,2014,09,03
200,Il miglior hotel a Dublino,"Grande classe e fascino per un hotel di lusso al centro di Dublino. Ci siamo stati diverse volte e  non siamo mai rimasti delusi. Il tono dell'albergo non è sfarzoso ma raffinato e discreto, i due grandi saloni dove si puo' assaporare un ottimo cream tea fanno respirare e vivere un'atmosfera di altri tempi. Questa volta inoltre ci hanno fatto un upgrade gratuito e ci hanno dato una bellissima junior suite al 3 piano. Materassi e cuscini comodissimi
La cortesia e la professionalità del personale è veramente degna di un 5 stelle. Piscina bella e calda. Unica nota media è la palestra, una po' essenziale, al limite del basico",5,2014,08,26
200,Classe ed eleganza.,"Il Merrion Hotel è indubbiamente uno dei migliori hotel presso cui ho soggiornato. Ambiente elegante e ricercato, ma allo stesso tempo sobrio e raffinato. Situato in centro, in una serie di edifici d'epoca. Camere spaziose ed eleganti. Ottimo servizio. Da non perdere il tè pomeridiano servito nei saloni, davanti al camino acceso, gustando una ricchissima varietà di pasticcini.",5,2014,08,05
200,Königlich,"DAS Traditionshotel in Dublin. Ein ""Leading Hotel of the world"" - zu recht. Gemütlichkeit, Eleganz und eine gewisse Noblesse zeichnet dieses Hotel aus. Eine tolle Lobby und Bar wo man gerne verweilt und in schönen Gesprächen die Erlebnisse vom Tag Revue passieren lässt.
Außergewöhnlich gut ist der Zimmerservice. Offensichtlich kein ""Billigpersonal"" wie sonst in den meisten Hotels üblich. Nette engagierte Damen die mit Herz und Einfühlvermögen bei der Sache sind. Unglaublich !!! Soviel Kleinigkeiten die in der Summe halt das gewisse Extra ausmachen.
So stand zum Beispiel bei der Abreise eine gekühlte Flasche Mineralwasser im Mietwagen bereit. Hier könne ich Leben. Eine 150% Empfehlung für Dublin und Irland.",5,2014,06,01
200,Raffinato e curato,"Ottima struttura , adeguata al prezzo non proprio economico . Addetti alla reception molto cortesi e disponibili . Sala colazioni un po' sacrificata ma ampie sale superiori ove viene ugualmente servito il breakfast. Bel giardino interno e ottimo servizio bar che serve un delizioso e abbondante ""afternoon tea"" . Le stanze sono ben arredate e confortevoli ma su venti canali di TV satellitare selezionabili non uno in lingua italiana : una mancanza di riguardo rimediabile !",4,2014,05,28
200,Molto valido,"Appena arrivata sembrava una struttura anonima, insignificante ma ti accorgi subito come fermi la tua auto del servizio e della magnifica accoglienza! Ho visitato parecchi alberghi e penso sia tra i pochi con tantissimo personale e tutti gentilissimi! Un ambiente caldo che gioca tra i colori del legno del panna e dell azzurro abbina raffinatezza  a sobrieta! Camere spaziose, bagni molto curati e riforniti di prodotti per la cura della persona di ottima qualita! Colazione non economica ma molto valida, ubicazione super!!!",5,2014,05,04
200,Eccellente,"Ci abbiam soggiornato 4 giorni: pulito, bello, gente sempre estremamente gentile, disponibili, professionali e non uno, dico non uno, che non abbia sempre salutato col sorriso e cercando di metterti a nostro agio. Clientela di tutti i tipi. posizione Ottima, a 4 passi dal centro. Peccato non aver sfruttato la spa. Se torno a Dublino, ci torno!",5,2014,04,22
200,Fantastico.,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel tre giorni con mio marito. Direi che tutto è stato impeccabile, pulizia, cortesia, affabilità del personale. Non ci si poteva aspettare di meglio. Stanze comode ed essenziali, cena e colazione eccellente, accoglienza cordiale e professionale. Anche se esternamente può apparire anonimo e poco accogliente direi che poi internamente è molto meglio. Abbiamo trovato un ambiente molto british... fantastico anche nei profumi, e nelle note di sottofondo. Ma io sono amante della buona musica e in generale soggiornare in un posto silenzioso e anonimo è una delle peggiori esperienze che io possa fare!! Ritornerei, sicuramente!! Da non perdere chiaramente anche per una sosta veloce, per un aperitivo o un drink caldo!!",5,2014,04,13
200,toll!!!,"sensationelles Housekeeping, blitz blanker Service im Zimmer und Bad, tolle, sehr freundliche und immer hilfsbereite Mitarbeiter, der Spa ist ein wenig klein gehalten, das Gebäude Ensemble sehr sehenswert, schöne Innengärten, tolle Restaurants, guter Frühstücksservice, die Bar, Lobby und das Restaurant sind sehr zu empfehlen, wie das gesamte Hotel, die Adresse für Dublin!!!",5,2014,03,31
200,Veramente soddisfatti,"Fine settimana nella splendida Dublino e pernottiamo in questo hotel, molto centrale dove la cordialità è di casa. Stanza perfetta, pulita e molto accogliente. Sicuramente quando ritorneremo pernotteremo qui.",5,2014,03,11
200,Ottimo hotel a Dublino,"l'hotel è ubicato su Merrion Street, in zona centrale.Dall'aeroporto dista circa 40 minuti in taxi alla cifra di 35 euro. L'hotel ha una facciata anonima, ma entrando ci si rende conto dello splendore interno.Ha una ala vecchia in cui ho soggiornato. Personale ineccepibile, sempre disposti ad esaudire ogni desiderio con cortesia. Stanza degna di un 5 stelle. Accanto alla reception sono presenti 2 sale da thè con divani e poltrone. E'presente una piscina interna riscaldata a 30 gradi in cui è libero accesso anche ai bambini il che potrebbe recare disturbo a chi è in cerca di 5 minuti di relax. La posizione centrale e la vicinissima stazione taxi rende possibile raggiungere senza difficoltà il centro pedonale , la chiesa di S Patrizio od il Castello e parchi.
La colazione a 25 euro a persona è un po cara. Il pranzo è servito al Cellar restaurant in una bellissima taverna in cui è possibile avere un'area riservata e tranquilla.La sera la location è in una sala ristorante che non mi ha entusiasmato: ambiente freddo, soffitti bassi, non rilassante. La qualità dei cibi ed il servizio resta comunque di alto livello.
Nel complesso un ottimo hotel in cui ho passato un bel fine settimana.Da soggiornare ad occhi chiusi. Si merita in pieno una recensione: ""eccellente"" ,che do molto di rado.",5,2014,03,05
200,Sehr schönes und gut gelegenes Hotel,"Ich war im Merrion im September für 2 Nächte. Der empfang war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Der Service des Personal ist sehr gut und freundlich. Das Zimmer das ich bewohnte hat leider nicht einem 5 Sterne Hotel entsprochen, wohl mehr dem eines 2 bis 3 Sterne Hotels. Es war nicht sauber, sehr abgewohnt, lag neben der Küche oder dem Zugang dazu, es war sehr laut und ungemütlich. Schade! Denn sonst ist dieses Hotel wirklich sehr schön und liegt auch super um Dublin zu erkunden. Da ich doch ein wenig enttäuscht war, werde ich beim nächsten Besuch ein anderes Hotel testen.",4,2014,01,10
200,Bello e curato,"Siamo stati in questo albergo a inizio agosto. Molto bello: il servizio e' all'altezza dei migliori alberghi di Londra, molto ""old british style"". Ambienti, servizi....tutto sono molto curati, direi addirittura accurati. Piacevolissima e assolutamente consigliabile una sosta per un drink o per il te' del pomeriggio. Perfetta anche la location in pieno centro a Dublino, e perfetti i servizi del Concierge, se vi servono consigli sul da farsi. Abbiamo provato tutto, compresa la bella piscina, tranne il ristorante, che ha la stella Michelin, ma al quale (essendo francese) abbiamo preferito i ristoranti e pub irlandesi nelle vicinanze.",5,2013,10,28
200,wow,"sono stata dovvero bene in questo hotel, pulito, confortevole, stanze belle e grandi che dire appena potrò ci tornerò amo dublino e ora so anche dove poter soggiornare:-))) ve lo consiglio assolutamente",5,2013,07,02
200,Un hotel excelente...,"Si quereis daros un gran capricho, este hotel lo merece. Cuidadas habitaciones, atento personal, y un maravilloso Té de las cinco. Aunque esta muy céntrico, es muy tranquilo. Lo que menos nos gusto fue el desayuno, pero cerca hay multitud de sitios donde hacerlo.",5,2013,06,26
200,lusso e charme,"Sono appena stata in questo meraviglioso hotel con due amiche .....e che dire ? siamo state trattate come delle vere regine . Nonostante la nostra prenotazione fosse per una superior , ci hanno fatto un upgrade e assegnato una suite con vista sul Parlamento , camino , arredi d'epoca , comodità di ogni tipo . Servizio eccellente , personale cordiale e colazione di ottimo livello con grandissima scelta . Il tutto nel pieno centro di Dublino , a due passi da Grafton Street e dagli altri luoghi di interesse . Davvero consigliatissmo !! Se dovessi tornare a Dublino , starei ancora assolutamente al Merrion !",5,2013,04,24
200,Non all'altezza delle aspettative,"Leggendo le varie recensioni, sono arrivato in questo hotel credendo di soggiornare nel miglior albergo d'Irlanda. Effettivamente è buon Hotel in ottima posizione nella zona georgiana, struttura pregievole di interesse storico, in quanto era l'abitazione del duca di Wellington, all'interno gli spazi comuni sono molto suggestivi, saloni arredati con mobili di antiquariato e numerose opere d'arte appese alle pareti (pare che sia la piu' grande pinacoteca privata di Dublino), il resto tutto nella norma per un hotel cinque stelle, con vari elementi certamente da migliorare:
- l'ingresso dell'hotel è talmente anonimo che di sera passa quasi inosservato, senza bandiere, ne soprattutto luci esterne, certamente utili per poter accedere da una scala,
- il personale della portineria, presente solo di giorno, era spesso impegnato nei fatti propri, invece che interessarsi ai clienti in uscita, se non venivano interpellati, i taxi te li dovevi fermare per strada da solo......
- il sistema di climatizzazione della camera era rumoroso, poco confortevole e difficilmente regolabile
Tutti elementi questi che in un hotel di questo spessore non sono ammissibili!!",3,2013,04,01
200,"Weiter verbesserter Service, erneuerte Zimmer","Der Service war wiederum sehr gut, insbesondere die Zimmer werden äusserst genau gereinigt durch gutes und sehr freundliches Personal. Einziger Schachpunkt war das Heizsystem, welches nicht optimal funktionierte in einem Raum. 

Kann das Hotel ohne Einschränkung empfehlen.",4,2013,03,24
200,Stile e Charme,"Hotel molto curato, con un servizio eccellente. Personale gentilissimo e disponibile. Stanze veramente spaziose, con bagni eleganti. Una meraviglia le sale da tè. Posizione ottima, in pieno centro, per visitare Dublino a piedi. Perfetto e veloce il servizio in camera. E' stato un soggiorno davvero perfetto.",5,2012,11,27
200,Recomendable,"El hotel Merrion es muy acogedor, ubicado en una zona tranquila y bastante cercano a las zonas comerciales. Con una iglesia católica muy cercana. Las habitaciones y el servicio de primera. Un gran desayuno.la gente del hotel es la mar de amable y presta a estar pendiente del mâs mínimo detalle. De no ser por la lluvia y el frío, algo que ya sabíamos caminar desde el hotel a la zona comercial y viceversa hubiera sido un paseo ideal. Lo recomiendo ampliamente.",5,2012,11,17
200,Un clásico cinco estrellas,"No está en el centro neurálgico de las atracciones turísticas pero sí lo bastante cerca como para ir andando. El servicio es excelente y las instalaciones bastante correctas, especialmente las zonas comunes. El Spa un poco pobre, sólo piscina cubierta y baño de vapor. Las habitaciones acusan el paso del tiempo pero el mantenimiento es impecable y la limpieza también. ",4,2012,11,03
200,Bellissimo hotel in pieno centro a Dublin,"Fantastico Hotel, molto curato ed in posizione eccellente. Le stanze sono molto curate, pulite e grandi. La posizione ti permette di visitare tranquillamente la città a pochi minuti di camminata. Una nota a favore al centro spa, la piscina è davvero incantevole. Ho soggiornato per lavoro, ma se dovessi tornare a Dublino scegliere questo hotel.
Colazione ottima, arredamento in stile irlandese ed il personale è davvero molto gentile e disponibile.",5,2012,09,29
200,Albergo fantastico...peccato la spa!,"Elegante albergo con stanze spaziose e molto pulite. Ottima posizione per girare a piedi la città,personale attento e qualificato. Unico neo è il centro benessere il cui ingresso è permesso ai bimbi trasformando la piscina in un vero e proprio acqua park! Inoltre la spa non è all'altezza della bellezza e del livello dell'hotel. Se per voi è fondamentale un po' di relax dopo le scarpinate di tutta una giornata...diciamo che non è il top. Per il resto tutto fantastico!",5,2012,09,01
200,Stile e magia.,"Uno deglio Hotel più esclusivi e suggestionanti nel quale abbiamo soggiornato, il personale è molto gentile ed attento ad ogni possibile richiesta, inoltre la sala da thè è un vero gioiello di architettura Giorgiana.",5,2012,09,01
200,Gute Qualität und Service auf hohem Niveau,"Hotel auf hohem Niveau entsprechend den LHW Anforderungen. Die Zimmer sind ein wenig gewöhnlich und nicht extrem schön, eher ein wenig altbacken. Positiv ist der freundliche Service im ganzen Haus und der gute Service.",4,2012,08,06
200,Bien,"Estuvimos alojados una noche en abril.
Los salones son realmente acojedores, excelnetes para pasar un rato charlando, tomar el té o leer.
Las habitaciones, pienso que están en el punto de empezar a pensar en na renovación. No es que estén mal, pero principalmente el baño tenia algunos detalles que ya detonaban que para seguir manteniendo su esplendor deben modernizarse/reformarse.
La zona de la piscina esta muy bien para un baño matinal, el gimnasio muy normal.
El desayuno se sirve de forma elegante con cubertería y vajilla muy acertada. El personal del desayuno muy atento, también lo es en general.
En definitiva un muy buen hotel, y muy bien situado.
Lástima que cuando estuvimos estaba cerrado el restaurante de Patrick Guilbaud.",4,2012,05,15
200,Britisches Flair - passend zu Dublin,"Das Merrion ist ein 5-Sterne Hotel direkt gegenüber dem Regierungssitz. Sympatisch ist die Aussenansicht des Hotels, man erkennt nicht auf den ersten Blick, dass es sich um ein Hotel handelt (und es kann gut sein, dass man daran vorbei läuft wenn man anreist...). Der Empfang vom Doorman über Rezeption war sehr freundlich, wir wurden direkt darauf angesprochen dass an Karfreitag in der City nicht allzu viel los ist. Das Zimmer auf dem Ground Floor war gross und im britischen Stil eingerichtet, was sehr gut zur noblen Art des Hotels aber auch zu Dublin selber passt. Flachbild-TV, Marmorbad, kostenfreier Internetzugang - alles ist vorhanden. Auch sehr schön ist die Kamin-Bar/Lobby. Der SPA-Bereich ist eher klein, trotzdem ist es ein schönes ""nice-to-have"" nach einem anstrengenden Tag. Hotel sehr zu  Empfehlen, auch wenn ein 10 minütiger Fussmarsch gemacht werden muss, um im Herzen von Dublin zu sein.",5,2012,05,08
200,Stupendo soggiorno di classe a Dublino,"Ho soggiornato per alcune notti in questo stupendo e lussuoso hotel nel cuore di Dublino. Che dire... Ineccepibile sotto ogni aspetto, dalla location agli arredi delle camere e ai saloni stupendi. Personale all altezza del nome dell hotel, portieri gentilissimi e simpatici, receptionist preparati e disponibili ( a parte qualche caso isolato, direi un 2 su 5 addetti, che oserei dire con la puzza sotto il naso, forse perchè da turista quale ero, non indossavo un gessato od un tight come buona parte degli ospiti, cosa che faccio abitualmente ogni giorno della settimana lavorativa e non da turista! Eh eh !) a parte questa parentesi, è stato davvero un soggiorno stupendo e credo che tornerò, magari presentandomi in smoking! ;) 
Lo consiglio vivamente a tutti.",5,2012,05,02
200,Old style nel cuore di Dublino,"Una volta arrivato all'indirizzo fai fatica ad accorgerti dell'hotel; e' infatti ricavato da una serie di case dalla facciata austera dove, tra l'altro e' nato il primo duca di Wellington. Appena entrato ti ritrovi in un'atmosfera di altri tempi con saloni ben arredati e dotati di camino dove e' possibile prendere l'aperitivo ( molto interessante la lista dei Martini ), o il piu' classico dei the.
Camere spaziose e ben curate con grande bagno interamente rivestito in marmo. Pulizia accurata e servizio attento. Buona la colazione del mattino. Prezzi in linea con il livello dell'hotel.",4,2011,11,12
200,muy elegante y céntrico,"Este hotel es un clásico de Dublin. Ocupa varias casas de estilo georgiano, con mucho encanto, en una de las cuales nació el Duque de Wellington. Está en un sitio inmejorable, pero, por otro lado  en una calle tranquila, lo que es algo positivo. Las habitaciones son correctas, aunque un poco pequeñas. El desayuno es bueno, pero está abajo en lo que eran las bodegas, con lo que no tiene vistas al exterior. Tiene un restaurante con una estrella michelín, uno de los mejores de Dublin. Por otra parte, en las paredes del hotel cuelga una colección de arte moderno, fundamentalmente de pintura irlandesa, que tiene gran valor. Los salones para tomar un té, al borde del jardín interior, son insuperables.",4,2011,10,04
200,OLD STYLE HOTEL,"Si tratta di un insieme di case vittoriane unite per formare  questo hotel posto nel centro di Dublino, di fronte al palazzo del Governo irlandese; se il tempo lo consente è piacevole trascorrere qualche momento tranquillo nei giardini dove si puo' anche ordinare un drink o pranzare

Per chi ama il classico è l'ideale ma attenzione perchè ha tutto dello stile ""british"" e quindi troverete i bagni senza il bidet e due rubinetti separati: uno per l'acqua calda e l'altro per la fredda...; viene voglia di dare una ""spolveratina"" a tutto, ma forse tutto è solo tanto ""classico""

La carta del room service è sempre la stessa da anni...ma il servizio è veloce

Il personale è tutto molto gentile e premuroso ma un po' ""asettico"", come se avessero imparato una parte a memoria...

Una piscina coperta grande per gli standard di Dublino ed una SPA in pratica inesistente: un bagno turco ed un camerino per i massaggi; piccola palestra molto affollata di primo mattino con attrezzatura non proprio all'avanguardia.

Il buffet della colazione non è nulla di eccezionale e di recente sembra  ridimensionato, ma si puo' ordinare alla carta (con sovrapprezzo)

Positivo il fatto che la connessione ad internet in camera sia gratuita cosi' come il business center, assai essenziale ma facente funzione.

L'arredamento delle stanze non è un gran che ma i bagni sono grandi e puliti.

Frequentato da businessmen che spesso si incontrano anche  per la colazione mattutina ma anche  da famiglie durante i mesi estivi.

Anche il te' del pomeriggio è abbastanza richiesto

Buono il rapporto qualità/prezzo",4,2011,08,03
200,"Albergo di grande tradizione, e non delude","Il Merrion è tutto quello che si aspetta da un grande albergo di tradizione.  Servizio professionale, belle camere, ambienti piacevoli.  L'albergo consiste in due edifici con un interesante  giardino in mezzo.  Il ""garden wing"" è considerato meno prestigioso del corpo principale dell'albergo, ma la ns. camera (una suite) era bellissima.    Veramente non c'è altro da dire.  Semplicemente perfetto!",5,2011,07,29
200,Sobrevalorado,"Bien situado, y con una atención al cliente estupenda, pero: Precios de barra y bar absurdamente elevados (un café expreso -mini-café- 3 euros más IVA y servicio) y cocina mediocre (salvo que quieras pagar el dos estrellas que hay en el hotel). Las habitaciones bajas son armarios empotrados con cama -eso sí, con buenos colchones-, y el regulador de la calefacción es absolutamente inútil. Nuestro baño tenía importantes fallos de diseño (bañera elevada, pocos jabones, faltaba enchufe para secador en baño, forzándote a utilizar una exterior sin espejo...). La combinación de luces es nefasta, y si abres la ventana (hasta donde te permiten) te puedes encontrar con una familia aparcando el coche en tu cara (recuerdo que es un 5 estrellas). La entrada en la habitación es a las 3, por lo que te fuerzan a consumir en su bar mientras esperas (16 euros un Sandwich de tamaño ""pin y pon""), ¡y el vino..! confunden el tipo de uva con la calidad, y te soplan 9 euros y medio por una copa similar al Valdepeñas picado. La business room es de risa, y no tienen WIFI (o no la supe encontrar). Demasiada luz en los pasillos, que pasa a las habitaciones a través de mirillas y ranuras. Ah, y no duermas siesta porque te despiertan para ofrecerte hielo con una cubitera... ¡qué majos! Por lo demás bien...",3,2011,01,03
200,Service und Lage bestens,"Für ein verlängertes Wochenende aufgrund der positiven Tripadvisorbewertungen gewählt. Die Lage ist zentral, vieles ist leicht zu Fuß zu erreichen. Unser Zimmer im Neubau war gut geräumig und in angenehmen Farben gehalten, die Betten und Kissen ohne Mangel. Schönes Mamor-Badezimmer mit Dusche und Wanne und allen notwendigen Annehmlichkeiten. Die Mitarbeiter vom Empfang bis zur Bar alle sehr freundlich, der mehrfach tägliche Service in allen Belangen perfekt. Besonders genossen wir das in unserem Package enthaltene Valet-Parken. Der Pool im Spa ist großzügig dimensioniert und sehr gut temperiert. Leider sind hier keine Liegen zum Entspannen. Auf das Hotel-Frühstück haben wir wegen der Preises ( € 35.-) verzichtet, in nächster Nähe gibt es hierfür viele Möglichkeiten. Einziger echter Mangel ist die laute Klimaanlage, und wenn wir stattdessen das Fenster zum sehr schön angelegten Innenhof öffneten, kam von dort ein deutlich wahrnehmbares, beständiges Brummen aus Abluftschächten.",4,2010,10,21
200,perfecto,"Un hotel super agradable, el personal encantador, la situación es muy centrica pero tranquila,el restaurante del hotel muy bueno",5,2010,09,29
200,CALIDAD TOTAL,"Ciertamente es un muy buen hotel, tanto en la recepción como durante la estancia son todo atenciones. Nos alojamos en la Suite Merrion, que la verdad es que era bastante espaciosa y con vistas al jardin, sin ruidos, con una cama de lujo.
El desayuno parte buffet y otra carta, estaba bastante bien.
Los conserjes tremendamente amables y solícitos.
La piscina de lujo.
el único pero son los amenities que ponen pocos y tienes que ir pidiendo, pero por lo que he visto en algunos hoteles empieza a ser una mala constumbre.",5,2010,08,23
200,Hotel mit schöner Ausstattung,"Das Hotel „The Merrion“ (5 Sterne) gehört zur Hotelgruppe „The Leading Hotels of the World”. Es besteht aus einen alten Haupthaus (höherer Zimmerpreis) und einem moderneren Nebengebäude. Die Zimmer im Nebengebäude sind recht geräumig und nett eingerichtet. Die Zimmer im Haupthaus kann ich nicht beurteilen. Das Personal ist freundlich aber distanziert. Das Hotel liegt nicht unmittelbar im Zentrum, trotzdem sind die Sehenswürdigkeiten von Dublin zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Frühstück ist eher auf englische / irische Gäste ausgerichtet, ist aber hervorragend. Die Eierspeisen sowie der Kaffee / Tee (in Silberkannen) wird serviert. Das Selbstbedienungsbuffet ist allerdings nicht übermäßig reichhaltig. Besonders schön sind die beiden Kaminräume des Hotels. Generell ist Dublin ein „teures Pflaster“, dies gilt auch für das „The Merrion“. An anderen Orten bekommt man mehr für sein Geld.",4,2010,07,16
200,"Old fashioned, but very trendy","Wer's gern old fashioned mag und ""typisch"" Irisch, und auch ein paar Euro Mehr ausgeben kann, ist hier richtig. Große Zimmer mit allem Komfort, aber dennoch alles auf alt getrimmt.
Lobby, Bar und Bibliothek mit Kamin und Torffeuer und Ohrensesseln. Eben wie man sich's vorstellt. Für ein romantisches Wochenende ideal. V.a. die Lage besticht: gleich um die Ecke St. Stephen's Green (Park) und die Einkaufsstraße im Herzen Dublins.",5,2010,07,08
200,Führenden Hotels der Welt,"Von außen ein roter Backsteinbau, hinter dessen Fassade man nicht einen in
weißem Marmor gehaltenen Empfangsbereich vermutet. Sehr edel.
Auch die großzügigen Zimmer sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. 
Der Poolbereich erinnert an ein römisches Bad. TOP !
5 ***** können hier völlig zurecht vergeben werden.
Nicht günstig, aber das weiß man ja vorher. 
Die Lage ist ebenfalls perfekt. Man ist schon nach ein paar Schritten ""mitten drin""-
zur Fußgängerzone sind es keine 10 Gehminuten.
