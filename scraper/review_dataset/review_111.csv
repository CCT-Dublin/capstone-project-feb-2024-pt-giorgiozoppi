111,Amazing,Fantastic stay. All staff were amazing. Daniel helped me out big time. Great hotel. Great staff. Bed was super comfy and didn’t hear any noise. I will 100% be returning here to stay. Can’t wait to come back. This is the best hotel ever I am so overwhelmed,5,2024,10,20
111,Birthday Celebration,"Daniel was a phenomenal help with planning my partners birthday. Considering the hotel had a few aspects that were under refurbishment, he ensured that our stay wasn’t disappointing and that we had a great time. Been to a fair few 5 star hotels but Montcalm stands out due to the staff. Daniel in particular was an absolute star!",5,2024,10,18
111,Fabulous Royal London House!,"We had exceptional customer service from start to finish! We booked to stay here for a special birthday celebration. Communication with the hotel was excellent. As the pool and spa were being renovated during our stay, we had a complimentary room upgrade and breakfast which was amazing! We arrived in our room to find balloons and chocolates which made our stay even more special! Thank you for an amazing break. We will definitely come back again soon! Special thanks to Manikant Revankar and Otilia Primovici.",5,2024,10,13
111,Very good!,"We booked this hotel as an anniversary for my partner and I, the check-in was quite fast and we settled in the room quite quickly. Although on the website it is announced that it had a pool and spa when we get there we will discovered that they were under construction, it was very disappointing for us despite the fact that they offered us to go to their twin hotel. Far from this the service was spectacular, from the doormen who are charming and the reception. We had breakfast on the 10th floor and we were surprised by the kindness and variety that is in it, our waitress Fatumata was quite attentive and made sure that everything was perfect, the eggs Benedict were spectacular, thank you Fatumata for the recommendation!!! We would like to return when the spa and pool facilities reopen, apart from that, without a doubt the service in this hotel is spectacular.",4,2024,10,12
111,Any occasion!,"Here for business and couples. Reception very friendly, asked if we’d been before and have a great room with Club access!  Club access makes all the difference Manikant Revankar made our stay extra special as he went above and beyond to look after us! I can’t recommend this hotel enough - the restaurant on the roof is divers and the beds are to die for!!",5,2024,10,08
111,Superb service really comfortable beds amazing views,"Always my first choice in London if there's space.

The rooms have incredible light from full length floor to ceiling windows, some of the views of London are superb.

The breakfast is good, with plenty of choice and Aviary also boasts great views and light.

One f the standout aspects of the RLH though is the service.

It has, independently some of the best FoH service I've encountered. The staff retention is also strong and so you regularly see the same faces. Additionally, when one folds in to this the volume the hotel experiences, it seems fair to elevate the staff's efforts even more.

For example, whilst sitting in reception as I killed time prior to my train, I observed an obnoxious and self-entitled lady being rude to the staff because her key card didn't work.

Any seasoned traveller will know, this can happen when they're next to your phone. What I also observed was how expertly the staff dealt with the situation and individual.

I would always recommend.

Thanks as always to Camelia, Daniel & Otilia. Best of luck in setting up the new venue January",5,2024,10,07
111,Perfect,"Spent a night at the Montcalm and the service was immaculate. The whole experience was honestly special. Thank you so much to Sanya who helped me throughout the whole stay, check-in through check out. My anniversary trip went smoothly thanks to her!",5,2024,10,06
111,Our long  weekend at Montcalm was wonderful thanks to the very good staff and especially Daniel,"The hotel is lovely, clean and the staff is very helpful and the Daniel our concierge made sure our stay and visits were organised. The staff is very helpful n very respectful. The location is perfect and we had quiet nights. We will defintely be back",5,2024,10,05
111,"Amazing hotel, very kind staff, great staying","I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone for making our stay truly wonderful. From the moment we arrived, the entire team was incredibly helpful, friendly, and professional. Your hospitality exceeded our expectations, and every interaction made us feel welcomed and cared for.

Thank you once again for everything. We look forward to staying with you again in the future!",5,2024,10,04
111,Amazing,"My boyfriend planed a stay here for us for my birthday. The service was unreal, everyone was soo kind and attentive making us feel as if we were the only guests at the hotel. January the hotel manager really went out of her way to ensure my birthday felt special. The room within it self was beautiful with a lovely view. The spa was the highlight, although it was closed for refurbishing they had a car take us to and back from one of their other hotels where the spa was just as good.  Would definitely recommend and look forward to coming back!",5,2024,09,30
111,Stunning hotel!,"We had such a fantastic experience with Montcalm RLH from the minute we arrived at the front door to be greeted by Dennis, until the moment we left. We have had nothing but pleasant encounters with every staff member we have met and nothing was too much trouble for any of them. The friendliness, hospitality and service at the hotel and restaurant simply can’t be beaten. 
Special thank you to David in the Aviary Restaurant who ensured that my Mum with Coeliac Disease was so well looked after and catered for. 
We will certainly be back to stay at the Montcalm RLH and we already can’t wait to return",5,2024,09,29
111,5 Stars are not enough… top top class!,"I booked a one night hotel stay to enjoy with a friend visiting from overseas and I wanted the stay to be a great experience for my friend. The initial communication with the hotel was terrible. I was desperately trying to book a spa treatment at the Montcalm East partner hotel due to the temporary closure of the spa at the royal London and couldn’t reach either of the hotels by phone and had no response to my emails for days. I was genuinely worried that booking the royal London Montcalm had been a mistake. How wrong was I!! As we turned up at the Montcalm east hotel for our complimentary spa afternoon  (prior to checking in at the royal London) we were greeted by smiling staff who had been expecting us and went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. The Spa was super lovely and upon departure the staff offered us a glass of Prosecco as we were waiting for the paid taxi to take us to the royal London. As we arrived at the royal London we were greeted by Miss January… the single most lovely and attentive concierge I have ever met (and I have stayed in a lot of 5 stay hotels) everything from the bubbles upon arrival, the easy checking, the friendly staff and January herself taking us to our room and showing us how everything worked was just exceptional. Dinner in the Avery roof top restaurant was wonderful and the roof top terrace amazing with its incredible views and wonderful service. The rooms were comfortable with moonlighting and under floor heating and the breakfast buffet was scrumptious. At check out we were offered another glass of bubbles. Easy taxi booking and assistance with our luggage. The entire experience was one of the best I have ever had but the most amazing part of the stay was the staff -  everyone from the charming porter, to the exceptionally service minded concierge, January, and  the helpful bellhops made our stay incredible. The  cheerful security guys in the roof top bar along with the pleasant restaurant waiters and chatty bar staff was absolutely top class. I cannot fault our stay in any way, we were made to feel like VIP’s from the moment we arrived and for that I thank you and highly recommend anyone to experience a true 5 star hotel.",5,2024,09,28
111,Brilliant staff incredible hotel,"Me and my partner had the most amazing stay at this hotel;  we went for our anniversary. When we arrived we dealt with Sanya at reception, who checked us in, she was great she had a lovely welcoming warm smile, she was very professional and friendly. Whilst we waited for our room to have the last touches we were given complimentary glasses of Prosecco. Once the room was ready January took us to our room, she was so friendly and went above and beyond, she showed us around made sure the room was the right temperature and she even upgraded us to a huge gorgeous city view room, that they decorated with balloons for our anniversary and treated us to breakfast free of charge! I honestly couldn’t fault our stay. The rooms were spacious, modern and clean, the bed was super comfy, very quiet, great room lighting, mini bar, and some macarons as a welcome. The next morning we went down to breakfast in the Aviary, we opted for a buffet breakfast, great selection all very fresh. We finished off by looking over the views of the city on the open rooftop. The door men were very welcoming didn’t catch their names but they were always willing to help and asked us if we had a nice time or where we was off too. I would highly recommend this hotel for a special occasion as it felt such a treat.",5,2024,09,28
111,Beware of this hotel,"Stayed at this hotel dozens of times whilst working in London. They offer a club membership but it’s a fraud. I had enough points for 4 free nights, but points have simply disappeared!! Emailed them twice and nil response. This hotel is not and will never be 5 star, 3 at best. Read the reviews about infestations, disgusting",1,2024,09,28
111,Excellent stay,"Our original hotel moved us to this one. From the phonecall advising us of the move right up to the checkout, they couldn’t do enough for us. Excellent all round service. Will definitely book for this hotel next time. Big thanks to January for her help also.",5,2024,09,25
111,Lovely stay,"The staff were welcoming and helpful. The room was lovely, comfortable and had everything you needed in the room . I ordered room service for dinner which was lovely and had breakfast delivered to the next morning. I will definitely stay again.",5,2024,09,25
111,Great service,"Great service when I turned up at 01:30 in the morning looking for a room having had my reservation declined at a previous hotel that was also full. Valan on reception was incredibly kind and managed to find me a room where I could put my head down for the 3.5 hours I needed to before getting a train home. Very comfortable bed, clean room lovely facilities will return.",5,2024,09,25
111,Off course I said yes……,"I would just like to thank your manager January and all the team at The Montcalm hotel. 
My partner brought me here for my birthday weekend and to watch the boxing match at Wembley. But what I didn’t know was he was also planning to propose to me. 
The team at Montcalm helped to make this the most perfect proposal and stay and I would like to thank them from the bottom of my heart. 
Nothing is ever too much for these guys. This is was our second time staying and we will definitely return time and time again. The Montcalm will now always be a special place to us. 
On both occasions the rooms have been immaculate and the service has been second to non.",5,2024,09,24
111,Lovely modern hotel. Great service,"Stayed here when visiting the Barbican Centre to watch the London Symphony Orchestra.
Great location and friendly welcome from the doorman
Loved the spacious feel inside the reception, bar, restaurant.
Wonderful service from the reception manager on check in who upgraded us to a club room with free drinks between 530-7pm in the club lounge
The bedroom was very nice and the bathroom also. 
The breakfast was in the rooftop restaurant which overlooks the city. Best breakfast we’ve had in a hotel for a long time 
Will definitely return when we visit the Barbican",5,2024,09,24
111,Proposal above and beyond,"Checked in at the Montcalm royal house on 20 September for 2 nights for my partners birthday and I planned to propose to my partner before hand by emailing the hotel
I had a response from one of the guest relations team January her name was and she went above and beyond and had the room decorated for me for the proposal we also was greeted with free champagne at check in and in the room. The hotel treated us with the upmost respect and great service and would always offer to assist with baggage and other things such as organising a chauffeur service to go to the SPA at Montcalm east. The detail January and the team had organised for the room proposal was great rose petals candles heart balloons etc it was great I will definitely be staying again and would like to personally thank January for all her help",5,2024,09,22
111,"Good check-in and lovely staff Otilia, gave us complimentary breakfast due to pool not being opened due to refub.","Nice touch if free wine for anniversary and free wine tasting offered.  Room ok was disappointed with bathroom, room not cleaned as asked during day and then trying to get in when do not disturb light on. Staff friendly and great overall. Wine tasting was good.",4,2024,09,22
111,Great hotel & service (especially Daniel!),Daniel the head concierge was very polite and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and he definitely enhanced the experience. The room was great and the food was very nice too. The roof top terrace was a great spot for a couple of drinks and the breakfast there was also nice. Overall would definitely recommend!,5,2024,09,22
111,Wonderful and memorable experience in London!,"Wow over and above expectations!

Very nice, modern hotel in great location!

All hotel staff we’ve met are very nice and professional. Also very helpful.

We truly felt welcomed and at home!

Special thanks to Daniel Todorov for making our time in London truly wonderful and memorable! 

Daniel was always there to answer our questions. Great itinerary you made and awesome places you recommended!

All 38 of us family and business partners had a great time at the hotel and in London! Thank you very much Daniel and everyone in Montcalm!

Wish to come back soon!",5,2024,09,21
111,Not a true 5 star,"After over a half hour and three different people we cannot find your booking and are you sure you have booked with us? even though we were showing them our booking on their booking system on our phone. We finally got offered a drink and to sort out the problem.  Unfortunately this however made us late for a dinner meeting elsewhere in town.  We were told we had an upgrade however on arriving in the room to find dusty shelves, rubbish on the floor, damaged furniture, curtains falling off runners and wallpaper pealing I would question if that was an upgrade in a supposed to be 5 star hotel. 

Also no access to the rooftop bar for private function and the gym was not in use either. The bar in the foyer closed at 10:30pm.

Comfortable sleep great shower even if the towels were a little scratchy and the toilet paper reminded me to school toilet paper in the 90’s. 

We went for breakfast that was on our booking to only be told no we weren’t on the breakfast list which was going to take another call down to reception and try to sort it when we said don’t worry I don’t have time for the amount ineptness  it will take you to sort something.  No one seemed to care that we said that or complained and ignored us again. 

The concierge gentlemen were amazing and attentive. Very considerate and polite. Along with the bar manager in the evening who not only organised our drinks but took them through to the lounge for us.

Upon checking out we mentioned this to be told I’m sorry let us give you a discount on your next stay.  Just ring us and tell us when you next book in and we will add it on.  Customer service on reception is not even adequate.  Why is it down to the customer to have to explain when re booking. It isn’t our first stay but it will be our last. It is not a 5 star in my opinion. 

On top of a dirty poorly kept room whilst sitting in the front foyer with a coffee we watched mice run along and go into the kitchen.",2,2024,09,20
111,Posh hotel in great location,This is a truly luxury hotel a 6 minute walk from the tube set opposite Finsbury Square. The rooftop bar had great views and cocktails and the Aviary restaurant had great food. Very helpful doormen and staff who gave us some excellent recommendations and helpful directions. The suite was spacious with super comfortable beds,5,2024,09,20
111,64 dlls for WATER?,"They charged us about 64 dlls for a WATER!!!! wtf?
They did not want to give us back our deposit even after the water charge and took us almost 2 months to get the deposit back after many calls
Last time we called they made fun of us saying ""did you really think the water on the table would be free?"", which we were impressed by the attitude, they seemed nice in person, but this is UNACCEPTABLE.
Room was about 320 dlls but still charge for water? Unacceptable!",1,2024,09,18
111,Vanshika & Diana are the best! Thank you!,"Such amazing, outstanding service I think I have ever had in a hotel. The staff (particularly Vanshika & Diana - thanks girls!) went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and looked after during our 2 night stay. Such friendly faces and lovely people. I would highly recommend this hotel which is also in a great location of London.",5,2024,09,18
111,Excellent stay,"An excellent stay in a very comfortable room. Excellent staff at check in and check out. Mohammad was very welcoming on check in, in particular. A hotel I'd recommend to others. I missed breakfast on this occasion but last time I had it, it was excellent.",5,2024,09,17
111,Our favorite hotel in London,"This is my favorite hotel in London. Definitely recommend for you to book this hotel. I stayed in this hotel many times and I have to say that they keep on surprising me. The staff is very kind and willing to help. Miss Stevens helped us very good and always makes sure we have a great time. I love that, makes me feel like coming home again.

The hotel serves a good breakfast where you can choose from the menu and walk around the buffet. The eggs florentine are really good. The spa was under renovation this time but we enjoyed using it before so definitely something you have to check out while you visit this hotel, it's free of charge for hotel guests. The rooms are spacious and we love the bed in this hotel! It's so so cozy. Location is perfect near Liverpool street & Moorgate station. Very central located so that means you're almost everywhere within max 20 mins. For us this is also very important.",5,2024,09,16
111,A luxurious and pleasant stay,"What can I say that has not already been written here about the exceptional staff team working at the Montcalm Royal London House. From greeting the delightful Dennis at the door, to having the head concierge Daniel assist in anyway possible (in my case helping figure out how to access my room). Everyone was so polite and helpful, they all went above and beyond to make my stay a most enjoyable one. Then there was the hotel itself, impeccably kept to a very high standard and most comfortable. I held the feeling of those who worked at the Royal London House had a passion and pride in their roles and love for the hotel. Thank you xx",5,2024,09,15
111,Exceptional. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else,"I wish it were possible to give more than 5 stars. From the person working on the door to reception, the restaurant and bars every member of staff you encounter during a stay at the Montcalm Royal London goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful. I would like to mention January in guest services who always goes the extra mile when I’ve stayed there. This visit was for my mother’s birthday and there were balloons,  cake and a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us in the room.  The beds are very comfortable and the room was spacious and stylish as is the hotel in general. The food, restaurant and rooftop bar were just as wonderful. The staff even brought out a little cake and sang happy birthday to my mother when they heard why we were there. I didn’t use the spa this time but found it great on previous stays. The club lounge is a lovely spot to get some work done in peace too. I can honestly say when heading to London I wouldn’t stay anywhere else",5,2024,09,15
111,Such an incredible stay!,"Has to be one of the friendliest hotels. The manager was so sweet and welcoming. So were all the staff. We had an anniversary night celebration and there were the yummiest treats, balloons and champagne waiting for us at the room! Super clean, such lovely atmosphere. Perfect for anyone!",5,2024,09,14
111,They came up trumps,"Our third stay and booked for a visit to Wimbledon and Regents Park open air theatre. 
A real test of a place is how they manage a situation when something goes wrong. Montcalm came up trumps.
On arrival, they couldn’t find our booking as it had been done centrally. We’d booked an executive room with breakfast included. Reception said that offer was not now available. But they agreed to honour.
Concierge Daniel took us to the room but it was an accessible and not what we wanted.
Quickly, he found an alternative room and gave us bottle of wine as apology.
We had a wonderful stay. At checkout, the manager came out to apologise for the mixup and discounted our bill. Most unnecessary but much appreciated.
Thanks Montcalm. See you again.",5,2024,09,12
111,Wonderful hotel,We had a wonderful stay at the Montcalm and will definitely stay here again. Really friendly staff that can’t do enough for you. We had a really spacious room with a super comfy bad and the hotel is in such a great location with a fantastic roof top bar with great views.,5,2024,09,08
111,The best full stop,"We adore this place, service is second to none, and omg the bed was so comfortable, I slept for 12 hours straight. Everyone seems to care, always asking or signalling to see if your all ok, totally refreshing. We had a fabulous meal in the Aviary restaurant and shared a steak so large we had to leave some, and cannot ever remember that happening, we were attended too by an absolutely lovely you lady called Keerthana, fast , attentive, willing , very charming an absolute credit to the organisation. Hope to see you all again soon.",5,2024,09,08
111,"Wonderful stay, friendly staff","Wonderful stay! The staff is super friendly, everyone is very helpful and kind. Nice soft beds - amazing breakfast, once again great service also at the restaurant. I definitely recommend staying here for your next visit to London! Will come again.",5,2024,09,07
111,A Royal Experience,"Customer Service is un matched 11/10. Anything you need/want the staff will sort you out. Location again 11/10 - you’ve got mortgage - Old street & Liverpool Street station within walking distance from the hotel . The hotel is currently getting a makeover which I was very excited to see/ hear. I definitely think the hotel need to bring back their signature chandelier in the reception area. Thank you to all the team especially, January ( Manager) Diana at the reception checking me in and out - Sanders in the club lounge making sure my glass was never empty haha. I intended to only stay one night but ended up staying an extra 2 more nights. The club lounge is worth the extra coin for unlimited beverages and snacks. I stayed on the 9th Floor with a lovely view. I think housekeeping should to pay more attention to detail when cleaning the rooms and replenishing toiletries - hair nets should be worn because a lot of hair was found on the bedding and bathroom towels. Mini bar has a good selection of drinks n snacks. OHI forgot the Aviary Rooftop bar and Restaurant 9/10 views amazing - service 7/10 - food ( breakfast) 9/10.  I personally don’t like the stuffed birds as decor around the bar but that’s my own opinion. I’ll definitely be back. I’ve been visiting this hotel since summer 2022 and haven’t looked/booked any other hotels in London. Shout out January and the Montcalm Royal London House Team.  :) :) :)  5stars",5,2024,09,03
111,THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!,The best hotel experience i have ever had! As soon as we arrived we were greeted by smiley faces from all the staff. We arrived early and asked if our room was ready to be checked in early and Vanshika upgraded us and made us feel extra special on our anniversary. She made the whole experience so sentimental and extra enjoyable by also allowing us to have upgraded club lounge access to celebrate. January took our bags to show us to our room which they had beautifully decorated with balloons and petals. We really felt so beyond happy at the effort and time that went into making our trip so enjoyable! As we checked out Vanshika went the extra mile to also personally email me to book directly for the best price in the future and we definitely will be back!!! Absolutely incredible staff and service that you really can’t get anywhere else.,5,2024,09,03
111,Hotel,"We just got married and wanted to stay somewhere last minute.
Our usual go to is Montcalm
Hotel and as usual January sorted a very nice room out for us at short notice.
Great service as always and always accommodates our needs. 
Its a very beautiful hotel too.",5,2024,09,03
111,Do not stay! Mosquito infestation!,"So we stayed here for 2 nights with our friends so had 2 rooms on the 7th floor 724 and 726. On the first night my friend and my partner (in separate rooms) woke up with bites all over them, my friends eye swelled up where she had been bitten and had to spend the rest of her weekend walking around with an awful swelling on her eye. We complained to reception and showed them the videos of all the mosquitos and were told we would be moved to 2 new rooms on the 8th floor! We moved on the second day and woke up the following morning with more bites! 3 out of 4 of us were covered in some big bites. We were only offered originally 50% off the first night to which I told the management I wasn’t happy with that so they agreed to give back the full night stay for the first night to each couple! On reflection this is not acceptable at all. Who goes to a hotel to be eaten alive by mosquitoes! Also I was woken up on the first morning by a guest that was pissed looking for her friend at 7.15am! And also the cleaners let themself in on 2 occasions when I was in the room when we didn’t ask for room service. Also both rooms we stayed in the air conditioning unit was not working! The first night the air con was so cold and we couldn’t turn it Down so had to sleep in a jumper. Second room was stifling hot and couldn’t turn on the air con. Also the manger lied to me and said the mosquito problem only started this weekend 3 days ago reading other reviews over 3 weeks ago there has been this issue for a lot longer! Hotel needs to be closed down until this is sorted as simply is unacceptable!!",1,2024,09,01
111,Great hotel and location for getting around,"Lovely hotel, beautiful rooftop bar, been here before really enjoyed our stay again. Reception team lovely Dianne! Hope I got that right. 
However my only feedback this time is breakfast service needs improving. The Manager is brilliant very good and attentive, however the staff speed of service not so good. But sure it will improve would not put us off returning",5,2024,08,31
111,Amazing staff and management make this hotel,"I would start by saying this hotel is made exceptional by the staff and management.

This is the second time we’ve stayed at this hotel. 

We stayed for 2 nights as a couple. 

We were greeted upon arrival by Rory at the front door who is ever the gentleman and exceptionally polite, a true gem for this hotel.

We arrived earlier than the stated check in time of 15:00 at around 13:15, the room wasn’t ready but not a problem, we left our bags at reception and went to explore.

After we’d finished exploring we returned to receive the room key at around 23:00. When we opened the door we were hit in the face by the heat in the room, the air con was on but did not work. Due to the time we showered and got in bed as it was late and  we were knackered and too tired to be moving rooms. The room itself was very modern and clean, mini fridge fully stocked, good views of the city, large tv and super comfy bed. 

The next morning we awoke boiling in the room, once we were ready we ventured to reception to speak to someone. We were greeted by Vanshika who offered to move us immediately, offered us a complimentary bottle of wine and lounge access with free drinks. 

We went for breakfast on the 9th floor, amazing full English breakfast that was 10/10. Continental options were also available amongst a full list of other options like eggs Benedict etc.

Once we had the keys for the room we brought our things from the previous one. When we opened the door again we were hit in the face by the heat. The air con was again not working, I made a call to reception and Vanshika (Duty manager) assured me someone would be up to take a look at it. We didn’t want to wait for someone to come to the room as we only had one day left. We returned to the room around 6pm and to our delight the air con had been fixed and the room was icy cold. 

When we checked out it was quick and easy. We were greeted by another duty manager named January. She was amazing and took time out to sit with us to discuss our stay and how it can be made better in the future. I appreciate how understanding and considerate she was with our feedback. I also appreciate how she sent me a direct email welcoming us back in the future. 

Pros:
Great staff/ management
Top tier breakfast
Clean and modern rooms
10 mins walk from multiple tube stops
Not far from shops

Cons: 
If you’re a light sleeper like me the rooms can be noisy, I stress that this is dependant on where you’re located in the hotel and not representative of the hotel as a whole. (near a lift shaft/ directly below the breakfast buffet/bar), bring ear plugs it’s not a problem. 

Overall:

Amazing hotel made great by the staff and management who cannot do enough for the guests, special shout out to January, Vanshika and Rory. They make this hotel what it is, I would definitely return again for a third time.",5,2024,08,31
111,Excellent services and rooftop restaurant highly recommended,"The location is great for accessing subways or buses. The staff provides excellent service, and members at the door are always courteous and friendly when greeting and receiving guests. Rooms are clean and cozy. We especially want to compliment the rooftop restaurant, which we highly recommend. The rooftop restaurant has an exquisite setting and offers great food choices. Mr. Cheriff was very friendly and always took excellent care of the diners, both young and old. He made everyone feel at home and relaxed. Mr. Jamil, Sebastian, and all the staff always had big smiles and warmly welcomed us to start the day. Our family had a great experience during our stay, and everyone enjoyed it!",5,2024,08,30
111,"Lovely hotel, awesome rooftop bar!","Absolutely lovely hotel! The rooftop restaurant and bar has awesome views, and the staff are the best. Very friendly, helpful, polite and professional. They made our experience even better!! The rooms are nice, bathroom are spacious and have under floor heating (if need). We will definitely be back for the rooftop bar soon, but also to stay in the lovely hotel later in the year :) An all round wonderful experience, thank you x",5,2024,08,29
111,Excellent,"All staff amazing friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and good size we were a family of four and thought we had booked a room with a double bed and sofa bed so were nicely surprised to get two adjoining rooms  instead! Fresh milk in the mini fridges in the rooms excellent. Location wise I have stayed in better hotels in London but this was lovely and quiet and away from the hustle and bustle. The only thing that needs improving is the aviary restaurant at breakfast service was very slow.
Also when we checked in at reception they notified us between I think it was 5-6.30 we could get free drinks and crisps in the downstairs lounge are, we did this most days and the kids had cokes adults ahead wine and was all good quality.",5,2024,08,28
111,Weekend break,"Best hotel in London. From I arrived till I left everything was perfect. The breakfast is amazing and the view over London is beautiful.
January is amazing and an absolute delight to deal with. Nothing is a problem. This lady is an absolute gem one in a million. January thanks for everything.",5,2024,08,28
111,Great staff,"The hotel is a little bit dated but the very friendly staff both at the front desk as well as the concierge make more than up for it. 

Especially the concierge department deserve a special mention. From printing documents to personally hailing cabs they are always ready to provide excellent service.",5,2024,08,25
111,Great hotel and amazing staff.,"Diana at the reception was exceptional, she went above and beyond to make sure that I had a lasting experience at the Montcalm during check in and throughout my stay that I decided to book the same hotel again to return to the same month for a planned family trip. She’s such an invaluable asset to the establishment and I should mention the entire staff was pleasant and welcoming.  A. Ojora",5,2024,08,24
111,We’ll be back!,"Myself and my daughter stayed last weekend and had the most wonderful stay. Not only is the hotel beautiful and the room was spotless and included many extra touches, such as the mood lighting which my daughter loved.. but EVERY single member of staff we came across was beyond welcoming, warm and ever so professional. The kindness we were shown and the way in which the various staff remembered us each time we came and went was such a lovely touch. 
Special thanks to Daniel (concierge) and the young guy (sorry, can’t remember his name but greeted us daily by the door and helped Daniel.. lovely young man) and also Dennis on the door, who immediately recognised my accent and made us feel so welcome upon arrival. 
We will definitely be back and we’ve told all our family and friends about our wonderful experience. 
The only negative I have is that I actually booked this hotel because it had a pool and I wasn’t informed that it would be closed for renovations. Slightly disappointing. Breakfast was lovely, so many options and the roof top bar was a highlight. Thanks so much to you all.",5,2024,08,23
111,Best stay in London!,"Couldn’t fault this hotel at all!, it’s our second time here and we love it! 

The best place to stay in London with the most helpful and kindest staff. 

The room was unbelievable, with the most comfiest bed and the best views from our window. 

Once again thank you to January Stevens for helping me surprise my girlfriend.",5,2024,08,22
111,Wonderful stay,"The staff has been most accommodating and friendly. Mr. Manikant Revankar, who is the gentleman at the club lounge, made the stay most pleasing. He made my family and I welcomed and helped in every way possible. His friendly, respectful and delightful mannerism kept us all in a joyful environment.",4,2024,08,22
111,Hotel review.,"The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and the facilities provided were also good. The food at breakfast served a variety of customisable dishes. However, our bedsheets were not changed during our 4 day stay, and the toiletries in the bathroom were not replaced after use, and the control panel in the room was difficult to operate at times. Overall the stay was good however there are minor inconveniences to take into account.",4,2024,08,21
111,Didn't Meet Expectations,"This is a classic example of how Tripadvisor rankings can be misleading. I was looking for a hotel for a weekend in London using credit card points and this was one the of the highest ranked I came across (#36 in London currently). The lesson here is, if you have time, dig into the specifics of reviews rather than just relying on the score.

Because of this I had pretty high expectations going in but unfortunately just don't really get the ranking or how it won a Travelers' Choice Award.

One of the main issues was cleanliness of the rooms. The first room I was given wasn't very well cleaned so I trekked back down to the reception to ask for another. The next one also wasn't super clean and was a much worse layout, so back to reception I went. I was already beginning to half regret asking for a different room in the first place. Finally, an hour after originally arriving, I was given a supposedly upgraded room. It wasn't perfect but at this point I just wanted to get settled in and unpacked.

This third room had a nice view over Finsbury Square but also some challenges - the light controls randomly stopped working and lights were on super bright when I was about to go to bed. It took me a bit of time to figure out how to reset it all by removing the keycard in the slot by the door. As others have mentioned, the whole hotel seems to have issues with light and temperature controls. Some rooms have tablets to control it all but this one had a panel (which kept falling off) covering where the tablet had previously been and presumably removed because it didn't work.

The bathroom was pretty nice - one of the reasons I chose this hotel - but lights were either off or on super bright. Great if you want to check out your pores up close, less so when you want to wind down for the evening. It had a nice big bathtub which I enjoyed using, but no shower screen or curtain so water got all over the floor.

As others have also mentioned, rooms don't have true king sized beds, rather two twins joined together which leaves a weird uncomfortable ridge in the mattress. Even if you stick to just one side it wasn't that comfortable.

In general the room had definitely seen some wear and tear, and to add to the experience I ended up having to kill a couple of mosquitos and a gross, large, aggressive, and persistent house fly in the middle of the night.

This hotel is probably fine and fun if you're there for a wedding, or bachelor / bachelorette party, which many people seemed to be (might explain so many 5/5 ratings), and the lobby and bar / restaurant looked really nice. There is a complimentary happy hour in the lobby, which is a nice feature.

In its favor are a good location, despite the lighting issues bathrooms are really nice and I appreciated the Soapsmith toiletries, and generally it's fairly quiet. I also liked the fridge and spotlessly clean mini kettle in the minibar area.

Customer service was good and responsive and they tried hard to get me a suitable room - the manager also comped me a bottle of wine which was appreciated.

I think the place has just seen a bit of wear and tear and the room control issues seem to be some systemic problem. The gym and spa were closed when I was there but brand new ones are coming soon which should be good. I was able to use the facilities at the neighboring Montcalm East which did the job for a quick work out.

Overall it was a bit of a challenging stay and the hotel didn't really live up to the ranking or the price point. There were some things I liked but probably not the best use of my hard earned credit card reward points. For the room itself, given the problems compared to expectations, I was thinking like a 1 or 2 rating but the customer service genuinely did try to make it a better experience so I think a 3 feels right.",3,2024,08,21

111,Relaxing stay in a beautiful hotel.,"A very warm welcome awaits you the moment you walk through the doors of the Montcalm Royal London House. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel is decorated tastefully throughout, and the room that we stayed in was spacious and clean. There was a great choice of snacks and drinks in the mini bar and the breakfasts had plenty of options for all.  The hotel is in a great location and easy to reach.  The rooftop terrace is worth a visit, with lovely views and very tasty cocktails!  We would recommend staying here, and we will be booking again.",5,2024,08,18
111,"Great Hotel, Great Locaion","Recently staying for a business networking trip and found the staff, even before I stepped into the hotel, extremely polite, professional, helpful and friendly.  My room was ready a little earlier which really helped and they try to do their best if they can.  The air conditioning didn't seem to work on arrival but one quick call to Reception and they managed to control it from there and it was sorted within a minute!  
The mini bar is quite pricey so I didn't have anything from there.
The room and bathroom was clean and very comfortable.  I chose a high floor and it was nice and quiet.
Breakfast is pricey too at £25 each but again, the experience and the staff go above and beyond to make sure you're treated extremely well.
Thank you Montcalm - I wil be back",5,2024,08,15

111,A Birthday To Remember,"I stayed at the Montcalm last year for mine and my partner’s 29th birthdays and could not fault our experience. 

This year we returned to celebrate our 30th birthdays and from start to finish we had such a special experience. Otilia welcomed us at reception and without giving anything away, organised a beautiful arrangement in our room. She was helpful, kind and made our stay more special than we could have imagined. Staying in a hotel where you feel looked after is very rare and the Montcalm does this very well, thanks to their incredible staff. 

We had breakfast at the Aviary the next morning and again were welcomed by smiling, kind faces. The staff made our birthday’s one to remember. 

We cannot  fault this hotel and we will be returning again.",5,2024,08,13
111,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Was looking forward to a nicer hotel accommodation on the last night of our travel vacations. This hotel is appealing to the eye and front desk has initial appearance of being accommodating; but, functionally we were assigned a room with no functioned air conditioning. I'm talking room temp was almost 90 degrees/we couldn't even wait in the room because it was too stifling. Spoke to several people, assured us the mechanic was n it; left two hours to let hotel sort it out. Stopped back by the desk; they assured us it was fixed. It was not. Mechanic met us up there and confirmed it wasn't fixable and we needed another room. Front desk ""upgraded"" a room that was probably 5-10 square feet bigger but with brown/sticky stains on carpet and white stains on wall. At this point, we are exhausted, just want to relax before we fly out the next day. Overall appalled by the hotel. Biggest positive was just the convenience of having two restaurants: in the building. Only reason I don't give it one star.",2,2024,08,09

111,"Nice hotel, but beware of the noise","Lovely stay at Montcalm. Food brilliant, service of serving staff and concierge excellent. The spa is area is small but more than adequate if using out of busy times :) Only gripe was the horrific noise coming from Finsbury Square which has appeared to be turned into a Bowling Green Party space with speakers and music blaring from afternoon till gone 10:30. The sound was in no way blocked by the windows and kept us up - I appreciate this isn’t the hotels fault, however for the class and cost of the hotel, it would have been better service to let us know at check in and offer alternative rooms. :)",4,2024,07,25
111,Wonderful family week,"We had a wonderful week in the Royal Montcalm House with our teenaged kids an their grandparents.

Thank You! Britta, Switzerland",5,2024,07,24
111,Amazing customer service from January!,"Stayed at the Montcalm for my friend’s birthday weekend. I had been emailing January, the guest experience manager, before we arrived to have the room decorated as a surprise. Upon arrival January greeted and escorted us to our room personally and handled our every need going forward. She was very helpful and friendly.

Everyone is focused on ensuring you enjoy the best possible experience, and we would like to say a massive thank you to January and all the staff. 

It’s also the little, subtle things that make it special too - a spotlessly clean, very well appointed & spacious room, excellent Aircon, quality towels, toiletries & bedding, very comfy bed and cute bottles of fresh milk in the fridge. 

The breakfast choice is very comprehensive, in great surroundings. The pool & jacuzzi are such a bonus and it’s wonderful to be able to relax.

Thank you!",5,2024,07,22

The service in the hotel was brilliant, they decorated the room and left chilled wine for us when we arrived and the manager January’s care for us during our stay was outstanding. She personally took us to our room, had our bags delivered and kept checking on us during our stay. I would definitely come back next time I’m in London.

I came to celebrate my wedding anniversary and January made sure I felt welcome. Great touch with anniversary balloons and drinks and simply awesome warm people. Everyone from the concierge to the waiting staff and the people at the entrance or check in, together with the manager of the breakfast restaurant, they were all service oriented and just perfect. Friendly and happy to assist in any way. We had a business suite with plenty of space and very comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet has everything you need and more, only thing I would have liked to have was a better choice in juices (for such a hotel, having fresh orange juice has to be on the must-have list). Rooftop bar/restaurant has great staff and great food, and the view is breathtaking. Absolutely recommended.",5,2024,07,17
111,I would stay at this hotel every time I go to London! Highly recommend it to everyone wanting to stay in the city!,"Beautiful hotel, loved the location! Great testaurant and bar within the hotel. Loved the Aviary roof top Bar! 
But what I loved the most was the concierge service! Daniel at the Montcalm goes above and beyond his call of duty. He is warm, professional and extremely attentive to the guests personal needs.",5,2024,07,16
111,Amazing value for a premium hotel,"The hotel is aesthetically pleasing as you approach, and just as impressive once inside. The concierge was really welcoming, as were the reception staff. 

Our room was not ready for check in, which wasn’t ideal as we had a gig to get to. However the staff were really apologetic and we were given complimentary drinks in the lounge and also breakfast for the inconvenience.  

The rooms were spacious and the beds super comfy. The shower was unreal, with the robes a nice added touch. 

Breakfast in the roof top bar was amazing with lots of cooked options as well as pastries, fruit etc. And check out really quick and easy. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are after a little added luxury without breaking the bank.",4,2024,07,16

111,Thieves!!,"We had a long weekend stay at this hotel and our impression about the staff overall is very bad for this hotel. The most dissapointing and disgusting thing that cleaning staff has gone through our personal belongings in the room! Its very disturbing and we are very angry. We have left our wallets with some bank cards (not all of them) in the room in our backpacks. After we checked out we have had experienced strange transactions in our bank accounts from the cards which were in the rooms. The ones we had with us, was everything okay. We had to block all cards and now to replace them. Some of the staff have taken pictures of all our cards and were inside our things and stole our money!! Its unacceptable and it’s a crime. We don’t recommend staying here. For this price it’s really possible to find way more better place and feel more safe. Never coming there again.",1,2024,07,14
111,"Best value, premium hotel stay in London.","Exceptional customer service from concierge, check in staff, and waiting staff in Aviary from start to finish. Smiling, happy staff always makes for an enjoyable stay.

111,Awful hotel; do not recommend,"The Montcalm Royal House London is a mid-range hotel stuck in the 1980s masquerading as an elegant 4-star hotel. For what this property costs, it’s quite terrible and I don’t understand all the positive reviews. 

First, the lobby desk seems to always be in chaos with most employees not knowing what’s going on. Every time I interacted, the employee helping me was being “watched over” by another employee and had to check everything with that employee “watching” before answering me. This went for check-in, basic questions, and check-out. There’s also a terrible fragrance being pumped into the air that gave everyone in my party a headache. 

The room itself – straight up 1980s.  Only way to turn on bathroom light was with a button next to the bed. Speaking of the bed, it was terrible. Truly. It was two tiny beds put together with a huge crack in the middle. Then they use some sort of mattress topper that doesn’t stay on; it bunches up under you making sleeping quite uncomfortable. Next, there wasn’t a physical “Do Not Disturb” sign available and no way to control the indicators on the panel outside of the room. One day I felt quite ill and tried to nap. Multiple knocks on the door. Carpet had a ton of stains and the robes smelled like they’d not been washed. 

Housekeeping also seems to struggle. There was a refillable bottle of water (full) when I checked in, but it was never replenished. There was also no body wash in the bathroom (shower or next to sink). Despite asking, it was never replaced. 

Views from rooftop are nice!

If you’re going to pay this much in London, stay somewhere better.",2,2024,07,13
111,Excellent Hotel and service,"Just returning home for our stay at the hotel . I would give this to anyone as a highly recommend hotel , not only for location but for the high standards that are given by the stall

111,The Montcalm Royal exceeds all expectations,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partner, it looked incredible online and I hoped everything would be just as amazing in person.. it absolutely was. From the moment we arrived I was incredibly impressed with how the hotel looked and how the staff treated us upon entry. Check in was incredibly simple and we were able to leave our bags there whilst we explored. Upon hearing it was my partners birthday the incredibly kind man finalising our check in wished a happy birthday, offered us the breakfast and later sent a bottle of prosseco up to the room. I am completely blown away by how kind the staff are and every interaction just made the trip incredible. The room was stunning and absolutely spotless, the spa was so refreshing, the rooftop bar was beautiful and whilst these were all incredible, I cannot stress enough that the staff really made our stay special. If I ever find myself in that area again I will not hesitate booking here again.",5,2024,07,10
111,Anniversary weekend break,"January and the rest of the team at Montcalm Royal London were fantastic.  They made our anniversary truly special.  The Aviary rooftop bar is amazing regardless of the weather and  the breakfast there was delicious and of high quality.

111,A warm welcome in the big city,"Hotels during Wimbledon fortnight are very pricey in London and our usual favourite was unjustifiably expensive. So we thought we’d try somewhere different. 

The Montcalm is well situated on Finsbury Square with an NCP car park underground just yards from the door. 

After a hiccup with getting the bags delivered to the room the head concierge Daniel was mortified and was exceptionally gracious and generous in his response. I genuinely felt sorry for him he was so upset that they’d let us down!

The room was well appointed and very comfortable and spacious. It looked like it had recently been refurbished. 

Breakfast was taken in the roof restaurant and Sherif the main man was so welcoming and friendly and all the staff very pleasant. 

This hotel will now be one of our top choices for our regular London visits.",5,2024,07,06
111,Wonderful stay!,"My mom and I stayed in a twin deluxe room, the room was clean, bathroom was modern, lots of really nice touches. The staff was SO nice and very helpful. Check in was super easy and quick, they obviously really care about their customers. We had breakfast included and I say get the breakfast 100%!!!! It was a buffet style but also a menu you could order specialty meals from as well as specialty coffees. The breakfast is taken on the top floor which has amazing views of the city and it’s furnished so beautifully. It has a nice bar and outdoor patio to relax on. Very luxe experience! The waiters are so kind and seemed happy to be there. The manager was walking around checking in with everyone and taking care of any needs, he was absolutely charming too! My mom and I just had the best stay here and if we are back in London, we will return to Montcalm!",5,2024,07,03
111,Excellent one night stay to attend nearby business function.,"Excellent stay at the Montcalm to attend a nearby business function.  As always the staff were friendly and efficient, offering high standards of customer service.  The room was clean, modern and very well appointed with all the things you need.  As well as the Aviary Restaurant and Bar on the 10th floor overlooking the city, there is a sports bar and a normal hotel bar too.  Strongly recommend!",5,2024,07,03
111,A hotel that cares for its guests,"I stayed 2 times at Montcalm in June - the first was a little disappointing, but after relaying my feedback on the issues I got an email from Alex Stroie, who has been a superstar in redeeming the hotel for any inconvenience caused on the first trip. I would just like to thank Alex for his effort to put the guests top of mind and resolve my issues and trying his best to run a quality experience. Hire more people like Alex!",5,2024,07,02
111,10/10 fabulous,"We had a fantastic time. We have stayed previously and was looked after so well both times. We were travelling for my birthday and the staff made us feel so welcome and made us feel so special. The room was beautiful, facilities welcoming and clean, and the breakfast was delightful. January was so kind and caring and we can’t wait to come back and stay again.",5,2024,06,30
111,Great hotel; first choice for future London stays,"This was my second stay in 6 months and I wouldn’t hesitate to book The Montcalm again. The staff were, without exception, professional, helpful and friendly, especially Camelia, on the front desk who was very welcoming and helpful. The room was very comfortable and clean; amazingly comfortable bed and the shower was perfect.",5,2024,06,29
111,Good experience,"Hotel really good. But above all staff, really professional and available. Good hotel, nice rooms and good breakfast. Very thanks to Daniel, head concierge,  who is so kind, so available. Really good esperience, to reccomend above all for groups",5,2024,06,29
111,Sophisticated city hotel with exceptional staff,"My husband and I visit London regularly and chose the Montcalm for our recent visit. The hotel, location, amenities and staff are Second to none. The staff, especially the breakfast waiting staff and the hotel manager January Stevens were exceptional.",5,2024,06,29
111,Gem Hotel,First time at this hotel. Check in was welcoming and friendly especially by Diana and Otilia as well as all the other staff that helped us.Our room was clean and spacious with a great working shower. Would definitely stay there again as also very central to get around.,5,2024,06,26
111,The best service.,The best service we experienced. It’s our first time to check-in in a hotel as a family of three and the staffs were very nice and helpful especially Diana and Otilia. They were very accommodating and kind. Also the rooms are very spacious and clean.  We will definitely come back again!,5,2024,06,25
111,A pleasant stay,"I had higher expectations from this hotel and brand. My friend surprised me with a hotel room booking and a spa session at the Montcalm for my Birthday. Upon arrival we were told the room was not available yet therefore we headed to the spa first. 
The spa experience was good and the massage was great, although it was quite busy therefore all the facilities had a short wait time. 
Once we finally got our room it was a lot smaller than most rooms in London. We also noticed some stains on the carpet and curtains therefore upon informing Reception, Daniel who was the Head of Concierge swiftly arranged for another room providing us with an upgraded room with plenty of space and it was clean too. 
Daniel also provided  complimentary Birthday macaroons and booked us an igloo with a view of the city at the hotels restaurant The Aviary which we were very pleased with and enjoyed having drinks and snacks there. Thanks to Daniel we had a pleasant experience in the end at The Montcalm. I would book again ensuring  we had a decent room upon booking.",3,2024,06,25
111,Great find,"Great hotel, lovely warm welcome, nice rooftop bar and terrace and pool was great. Would stay here again due to location and welcoming staff. Not much else to say, when things are as they should be hotels just work. It felt comfortable, check in was easy, everything clean and good quality.",5,2024,06,24
111,Great place…short bus ride or taxi from main attractions.  From Heathrow take the Elizabeth line to Moorgate station…,"I think you will enjoy your stay at this hotel.  It is everything it claims to be.  My best suggestion would be to take the advice of their head concierge Daniel.  He can set you up with reservations for fun restaurants, tickets for tourist activities, and how best to get around the greater London area.  The hotel is very clean and comfortable with restaurants, roof top bars and pubs.  If you want to try new and different Daniel can point you in the right direction !  Have fun !  We did !",5,2024,06,24
111,Exceptional Service & Hotel,"From arrival to departure the service was impeccable.  All the staff were so friendly and polite, and genuinely so!   The guys in breakfast were exceptional!  The only niggle was being on the 9th floor, as the restaurant was on the 10th floor and you could hear every footstep thudding backwards and forwards across the floor until c11pm, which sounded like waitresses/waiters walking with purpose!  It was very loud.",4,2024,06,21
111,Anniversary Stay,"From the moment we walked through the door the welcome was second to none.
We checked in and to our surprise our room was ready early. We were offered a drink and then shown to our room by Emily. It was a lovely room and had been decorated with flower petals and a complimentary bottle of fizz and chocolates for our anniversary. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff but Emily in particular was extremely helpful and offered a fabulous service. 
We ate lunch in the rooftop restaurant which was also excellent and all in all had a fabulous stay and will be returning in the summer.",5,2024,06,18
111,"Amazing hotel, with amazing staff","Came here yesterday for a night with my cousins and the hotel is just amazing! I’ve stayed at the Montcalm several times now but the customer service I experienced over the weekend was unbeatable- January is definitely an asset to Montcalm, very bubbly with an upbeat personality and was able to assist us throughout our stay. Will be returning to Montcalm when we next stay in London!",5,2024,06,16
111,It’s nice but needs more sparkle to be a 5 star,"Stayed for two nights, it’s a nice hotel few things I expected more of, firstly the club lounge is an open area opposite the reception, don’t pay extra for it. My tv didn’t work when I arrived but it was fixed promptly. There is no room service menu available in the room. Apart from a couple of staff members including the doorman, the rest of the staff are missing that 5 star quality of customer service….room was ok and clean. The view was horrible of a brick wall which I wouldn’t pay £500 for if I were to stay again. I",4,2024,06,16
111,Amazing thank you January  Stevens for making my partners birthday special,"Honestly was such an amazing stay. I went here two years ago it was amazing for my partners birthday and we loved it soo much i decided to do it again. January Stevens was amazing shes made everything sooooo perfect! She acknowledged it was a birthday and had balloons on the bed and champagne on ice with macroons and a card was soo touched!!! To walk in and see the effort. I even chose the same room we was at last time and she made everything perfect. Thank youuuu

I was only bit sad that a few things have changed since 2 years ago. 2 years ago Breakfast was included it did say on the website too that if i book this room breakfast was included but the lady at checkin said they dont do that no more. Wasn’t sure what happened cause wen i called up a lady on the ohone also told me it was included. 
They used to have sky in the room i think or something and youtube to play music.  But now it only a real few channels no youtube or anythings the remote had movies button but it wasn’t a thing. 
But they still had a place between 5:30-7 to go for snacks and drinks as they used …they used to do spiirits,whiskeys and nuts but now only beer a cold drink and crisp. But still was nice as its complimentary. I guess they had to cut back. 

But overall was still amazing if i didn’t know how the stay was 2 years ago and i was rating it on this trip it would be a 4 and a half.  
Spa facilities were included.",5,2024,06,15
111,My experience for a special occasion.,"I don't usually write reviews of a hotel experience but this is the first time I have booked a 5* Hotel. It was my wifes 50th birthday so I decided to push the boat. What can I say. Thanks to January and all the team at this Hotel for making this such a memorable occasion. It is the effort and level of detail that makes the difference and it didn't cost the earth. Champagne, Flowers, Cake, Balloons, Rose Petals, and a Dozen Red Roses when my wife entered the room. You cannot put a price on that !! Even at the last minute when I made changes, it was done. Nothing was too much trouble. I would like to add the photos, but unfortunately I keep my memories private. You'll just have to take my word on it !!

It is about 5 minutes walk to the tube station and within 5 minutes you are in Kings Cross where you can practically pick up a line to anywhere in London.

We didn't eat in the restaurant / cafe because we were out, but I ordered food to my room from the 24hr room service. The food was reasonably priced and for a meal at that time to your room, it was really good.

If I can say one thing that is not a criticism, but just positive feedback on how I think it could be improved. The aviary bar and restaurant has enviable views over London. I don't feel the Hotel has taken full advantage of that. That is not to say it was a disappointment, simply it could be improved.

Thanks again to all the team for the time and effort that went in to personalise this experience of this stay for me and my wife. xxx",5,2024,06,12
111,City centre oasis,"Really great oasis of calm and excellent service in the heart of the city.
Comfortable large rooms  and beds. 
Lovely breakfast on the roof terrace is perfect in the summer - even this rather sunless one!
All the reception staff and Aviary stuff are friendly , warm and helpful.
Close to Spitalfields market and Brick lane  so no shortage of interesting eating to be had and the Elizabeth Line to whisk you to the West End. 
Wonderful experience",5,2024,06,11
111,Perfect stay. We will come back,"My wife and I stayed at montcalm Royal London house from 08-10 June and we were very pleased. Mrs January made us feel right from the start that our every wish was to be fulfilled. She did a great job as she listened and then did everything she could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. For example, I told her that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary here and she decorated our room with rose petals and balloons. So very attentive! Many thanks to Mrs January.

About the hotel: the hotel is very clean, the rooms are large enough and the 3 bars/pubs in total make your stay more enjoyable 😃.

If you want to switch off a bit, the wellness area is the perfect place to do so. The room is warm, the pool water is warm too and the whirlpool is very pleasant.

If there was one thing I would have to mention as potential for improvement, it would be the cocktails on the terrace bar. I'm sure you could create much better/tastier cocktails if you put your mind to it.

Thank you for everything and we will recommend the hotel to everyone with a clear conscience!!!!

111,Relaxing and calming stay in the most amazing hotel for 'me time',"My go to place every couple of months for a relaxing break.  The staff, the ambience, the room the facilities are just second to none.  The spa and gym are amazing and not very busy and time to relax and spend time for yourself and friends.   If you fancy an amazing evening on the roof top its beautiful where you can eat and drink with lovely views. 

A special shout goes to January the Guest Experience Manager who makes you feel so special and welcoming.  Thank you again",5,2024,06,10
111,Amazing Experience and the best proposal,"Amazing, beautiful hotel with wonderful staff! My partner proposed to me in the one of the stunning rooms in the hotel with the amazing coordination and help from January, Diana and Olivia! The experience was absolutely magical, many thanks to the great team for all their efforts and setting the room up. Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel for a great stay.",5,2024,06,05
111,Wonderful hotel,"I had the loveliest stay at this hotel! My partner and I celebrated our anniversary there, and I chose Montcalm as a surprise for him. It did not disappoint. First impressions matter, and right at the hotel door, we were greeted by Rory, who kindly took our suitcases in.

The reception staff were wonderful, and Camelia checked us in much earlier than we anticipated. We were also offered complimentary drinks at the bar and a complimentary spa visit, which was a delightful surprise since we were just planning to leave our suitcases and return when the room was ready.

When we entered our room, we were met with the sweetest surprise: a bed covered in anniversary balloons, handmade chocolates on the desk, and a lovely welcome card. I can't recommend this place enough and really can't wait to return.

Breakfast at the Aviary was a bittersweet experience, enjoying such tasty food and great city views while knowing we had to check out soon after. What a wonderful place and staff – they truly deserve their well-earned 5 stars! 

Can't wait to stay there again!",5,2024,06,03
111,Not on my favorite list,"After a long day, i’ve tried to check in and the receptionist told me that my room has been cancelled and no rooms are available. They didn’t make any effort to solve the issue.
A mail from the manager told me that they will investigate and come back. I’m still waiting……",1,2024,06,03
111,Outstanding,It was outstanding. The team made every effort to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I would also like to make a special mention to the breakfast team at Aviary rooftop who went above and beyond as I have many dietary restrictions and they were fantastic.,5,2024,05,30
111,Not worth it,"Staff are lovely but more like an OK 4 star hotel than and really good 5 star. No air conditioning in room?! No turn down service. Not very good communication. Tried to ring to reception a couple of times as there were no robes in my room. Was on hold waiting aaaaages. Went down in the end. 
The spa is a bit tired and the steam room wasn’t working. Room was also a bit tired looking.  All in all, meh!! I’d try somewhere else next time.",3,2024,05,30
111,Ups and downs,"I arrived with my pregnant girlfriend and was made to wait 40mins to check in which wasn’t great at all. We was sent to our room then had to wait for our bags to be delivered which was frustrating. Because they was busy we was never told about the hotel and what it offered, we’d booked club room and missed opportunity for drinks at the bar, the gym and spar because we wasn’t told. 

Breakfast staff and the food was incredible. Staff couldn’t have done enough for us and we was made to feel very welcome and was highlight of our trip. Choice of food and way it was made was brilliant, the settings with the view ect was real memory maker. 

The hotel room was nice but had some marks on the wall paper and skirting boards, sounds petty but it’s listed as premium hotel so believe this shouldn’t be the case. Location is great and overall experience was good. We’ve stayed in similar priced places and although wasn’t a bad stay by any means other than the breakfast experience we’d not rush to come back.",4,2024,05,30
111,Excellent service -Room with a beautiful view 😍,"Exceptional service from Camelia and the team who made us feel very welcomed and valued. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will definitely be returning. The room was spacious, spotless and comfortable. Quiet, cosy, clean and warm! The relaxing evening in the spa was amazing!",5,2024,05,28
111,Excellent,"Beautiful hotel, with lovely, professional staff. Really made us feel special for my big birthday, and absolutely looked after me when I was very poorly. Requests honoured, gorgeous comfortable room. Didn't try the breakfast, sadly - perhaps another time.",5,2024,05,28
111,A painfully expensive bad night’s sleep. Heed my warning and avoid,"I can confidently say that other than a night at a budget hostel in 2014 (£50, never again) this is the worst hotel experience yet (£243, never again). It was nowhere near 5 stars and based on my experience the hotel did not meet official 5 star rating guidelines.
 
Executive summary of 5 star failings:
Not shown to my room nor given any support with facilities.
Poor level of provision, teas/toiletries and areas lacking cleanliness.
Poor communication with reception and support not forthcoming.
No heating controls in the room and unable to switch A/C off.
No ability to set a do not disturb button nor request room servicing.
Broken internal safety double lock.
No turndown service.
 
At 1.30pm on the day of arrival I received a message via the third party booking site that my booking at the Montcalm Brewery hotel was void due to ‘maintenance issues’ (there will be many more of those later) and so I was to be moved to their sister hotel, Montcalm Royal London. At 5* and a Club Room paying guest I’d expect the hotel/s to try and contact me directly but I let that slide and redirected myself to their sister hotel.
 
Upon arrival I was directed by friendly concierge to the “beautiful ladies” at reception, a rather strange comment to make in 2024. Reception staff were not interested in my booking inconvenience and gave me my room key. I had seen online that the Club Lounge was open until 7.30pm but no, reception now told me it closed at 7pm so I had missed out on that. As I had a dinner reservation and was now 10 minutes further away from the venue I quickly went to my room to change and head back out. Room looked fine on first impression and I was temporarily satisfied. Note here that I was not shown to my room nor given full orientation of hotel and bedroom facilities in accordance to 5 star guidelines.
 
Back in my room after dinner and the positive first impression of the room now matches the inadequacies of the earlier experience. The room was exactly as I had left it, no turn down service as is required for a 5 star hotel. Bathroom was acceptable but not luxurious. Robes and slippers were good but the toiletries were presented a la Premier Inn, fixed to the wall and no allergen information available. There was a QR code, but I don’t shower phone in hand. Bodywash as substitute for handwash or soap at the sink as example of another corner cut. The apparent heated floor was cold and the shower screen was crusty. This is not reflective of Club level rooms in a 5 star property.
 
After a passable shower I wanted a tea before bed and found that I couldn’t get the kettle to open (kettle a la low cost self-catering accommodation complete with limescale). The teas and coffees were complemented by two miniscule cheap mass catering biscuits and four Lakeland UHT portions. For £17 though at the minibar I could buy a 187ml bottle of Campo Viejo which retails at the supermarkets at around £7. No turndown service meant that I couldn’t even capitalise on a pillow chocolate and didn’t want to pay £6 for some cashews. Finally, I figured out that the OPEN sign on the kettle was worn off and managed to have a cup of tea. Another example of not meeting the ‘excellent standard of in-room facilities’ as required for a 5 star property.
 
Next comes my biggest issue which has left a bad taste in my mouth, worse than the UHT, since last week. The room was very warm and I couldn’t find how to turn down the A/C. I checked the online guest handbook which states “if you wish to change the room temperature settings, please use the interactive panel on the wall close to the bathroom door”. I searched but no panel. I called Reception who advised that they will come and assist me. Midnight comes and goes so I call down again, sometimes they did not answer but I am advised that somebody is coming. 12.30am I call again, this time stating urgency as I needed sleep given I was on a business trip. I give up and go down to reception in my pyjamas to find help. Once there I am shown a device that tells me that they’ve changed my room temperature to seventeen degrees. I ask what about the controllable heating in-room, as a minimum entry requirements for one and two star hotels must provide controllable heating (on/off) by the guest. A gentleman follows me to my room and upon finding no controls he shrugs, ‘maintenance’. I also show him that my secure double door lock does not work so I cannot lock my room from the inside, and that I would like to be able to as a solo female traveller. He fiddles with the lock, realises that it is broken and leaves. No interactive panel in the room meant that I had no heating controls and could not activate the do not disturb sign.
 
After 5 hours of sleep I woke up freezing. I put the TV on to find that I only had three channels, all German. Scheisse. At this point I was ready to give up and check out as quickly as possible. I went downstairs for the Club Lounge continental breakfast as advised in the guest handbook, to be redirected back up to the main restaurant. Note that the same handbook also advised that the Club Lounge was open in the evening from 5.30pm until 8.30pm but I was refused entry at 7.15pm. The breakfast room, the Aviary, was pretty but again a façade for subpar offerings: lukewarm tea and coffee in serving jugs on the bar and a modest continental selection. My poached eggs a reminder of my overall experience; a good first impression but underdone and unpalatable.
 
As I checked out I explained how poor my experience had been and was offered £70 refund on my stay meaning I only paid £170 for the displeasure. I have since emailed the hotel twice to request an invoice receipt. They have not responded.",1,2024,05,27
111,Excellent as always,"Booked 2 nights here for the family trip to London to watch Leeds get promoted, which unfortunately didn’t go to plan 

Our 5th stay here … booked  club rooms as usual, as we like the free breakfast and afternoon drinks. Unfortunately the breakfast option has now been removed from the offer, but as we didn’t know we were offered free breakfast upgrades, which was good

The aviary restaurant was v nice for breakfast and we also enjoyed the roof top bar for cocktails in the sun 

Enjoyed a few beers and games of shuffle board in the Burdock bar in the lobby 

Another good stay as always in  our London
 hotel of choice for our family trips",5,2024,05,27
111,Understaffed,"Service at breakfast was almost non existent. Woefully understaffed. Waited 15 minutes for a coffee then gave up waiting for a second one. Found out on leaving there is a second available restaurant on ground floor which people should have been directed to by staff but weren’t! Waited 15 minutes to pick up left luggage. On departure queue for people checking in was unacceptably long. Great location but that is about it. With more staff, better communication and better organisation the hotel would get five stars from me.",3,2024,05,26
111,This has lots of good reviews just one too many issues on our visit,"This was a nice hotel in a good position near to Liverpool Street station. We splashed out a bit on a Club Room because we were visiting Chelsea Flower Show so wanted to create a nice few days. Check in took a little while and we had arrived a little early (check in from 3pm), The young lady on reception was very pleasant and upgraded our room to 607. We got to the room opened the door only to discover someone else was staying in the room! We of course returned to reception and we were allocated another room, as it turns out the room type we had booked. The room was nicely appointed but things like the had soap dispensers didn’t work well and despite requesting a high floor with floor to ceiling windows we got a room on the 1st floor overlooking a service area (see pics). We had a few hours to kill before we went out but couldn’t find any information about the exclusive club lounge which was included with our booking. It wasn’t mentioned at check in nor was there any info in the room. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful the next day after we had a good nights sleep, we did order a cappuccino which we had to chase and eventually arrived after we had finished eating. It was a good stay but elements of service really let it down, we did mention this on checkout and a small discount was refunded as a gesture of goodwill, I would have scored 3 had it not have been for this kind acknowledgement. This hotel has good reviews we just had a few too many issues on our visit but would like to stay again.",4,2024,05,24
111,Nice stay,"Lovely hotel, great location, perfect to watch sports in the bar downstairs however, breakfast was quite slow and they didn't seem to have enough staff or tables spare for the amount of people staying... other than that was great, would recommend.",5,2024,05,21
111,A+ Hotel is nice secluded area.,"Excellent hotel, nice comfortable rooms. Really enjoyed the breakfast. Service is really good and friendly. Had access to the lounge which unfortunately I did not have time to visit due to evening meeting. Will be definitely staying again when the price is right. Convenient for Liverpool Street Station.",5,2024,05,18
111,Would not rush back,"In summary 

Room was not ready until gone 3.30pm despite check in at 3pm

Room was freezing had to call reception to change temperature - there are no in room AC controls by morning it was too hot so had to call down again - crazy idea

No Shower screen so water goes all over the floor 

Only light switch for bathroom is by the beds … totally useless if you want to use the toilet in the night 

We definitely had the dud room.",2,2024,05,18
111,Shh don’t tell anyone,"We have found our second home, from the smiles as you arrive to the check in and follow ups to even passing staff in the hallways. It’s a haven! We use this as a base for our London adventures and a work base. - if you meet January and Daniel then that is an added bonus as they both thrive and shine at what they do. We like to sit and people watch and we thought it was just us to receive this high standard of customer experience but it’s not it’s everyone - plan your day wisely and the spa can have as little and 2/3 people in making that down time even more relaxing - please keep this venue a secret and let January and Daniel know that your read about them",5,2024,05,14

111,"ok, not great, 4-star at best, there is better","nice rooms 
spa is in need of serious cleaning and refurbishment, which is probably ok, if they let you in, I had to go back to reception and have them call the spa to allow access (which I believe is now limited to the highest rack rate).  So in the spa, it's just dirty,  Don't forget to bring your own towel from the room, it's a spa without towels, yes, new fangled spa. 
steam room - work great, but all the tiles are falling from the walls and scattered on the floor - watch those toes - extractor is working, but badly and seeping some black stuff onto the walls
sauna - is on, but only a touch warmer than the rest of the spa, so sit in a wooden box, maybe it's the smell you like - just not hot
pool - is small but really good - have great jets, allow you to swim in place in case it gets a little squishy

Haven't had dinner, looked at room service, but I'm always put off when the room service menu is completely different to the actual's restaurant menu, it has sub-standard written all over it; been there been burned in the past.

Overall, hotel is about 3.5 - 4 starts no where near 5 stars",2,2024,04,22

They were kind, courteous and went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay, were comfortable and treated with care.

111,THANK YOU!!!!,"We couldn't have chosen the best hotel for our little London vacation. The whole team was very kind and professional, especially Mrs. January who offered us a free upgrade and a bottle of prosecco on our arrival to celebrate my partner's birthday in the best possible way.

111,It's the staff that make the Montcalm it a must - revisit experience. What a fabulous Hotel!!,"You guys are wonderful! We stayed the weekend, arriving much later than expected and were treated to the fabulous team, led my Mr Paul! All the night desk staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. Even though the twin-room booking had been mis-allocated by booking.com, the staff quickly and efficiently sorted us out - I was very impressed with them all and they couldn't do enough to make us comfortable. They felt like family. Our room was lovely. Clean, modern, spacious with fantastic facilities. The spa was clean, and operational but it needs some TLC - with the tiling and the panelling broken in both the sauna and spa, it felt unloved and tired, an unfortunate contrast with the of rest of the hotel and the only thing that let the experience down for me. This will be my hotel of choice next time I'm in London and I'm already looking forward to seeing all the fabulous staff again. Thank you all!",5,2024,04,08
111,We enjoyed here in March in Royal hotel,"The most beautiful vacation

111,"Excellent hotel near the Barbican, with great service and food!",A great quality experience. Grand yet very personal. We had a warm welcome with a glass of bubbly. The hotel manager and reception staff were absolutely committed to us having a great stay. The Aviary restaurant and bar  was a great location for a celebratory meal (in honour of my son’s MBA graduation at the Barbican just a very short walk away the following day)  with the added bonus of a lovely rooftop view over London. Thank you to the general and reception managers and staff for helping us have such a memorable stay!,5,2024,03,25
111,"Great location, nice hotel","Lovely room, very clean… very warm!! 
Toiletries are nice, white fluffy robes and towels. 
They charge your credit card £50 despite paying up front. Not sure why this is necessary of a hotel of this calibre. 
The bar is nice. The restaurant staff and food was also very good. 
Front of house staff could be nicer.",4,2024,03,22
111,£400 a night club room with no hot water,"Reported the issue with the hot water to reception before going out for the evening, but when I returned late, it wasn't fixed (luckily I checked!). So, I had to pack and move rooms, which was somewhat inconvenient.
The next room had a broken touch screen, so you couldn't control the temperature or lights. Randomly pressing a blank screen meant I left the 'do not disturb' on all day, meaning no room service.
Disappointed, as this could have been a great hotel, but for the price, it needed to much be better. ",2,2024,03,15
111,Tired and basic,"The hotel is a little style over substance and is need of a refit. The rooms are basic and things just don’t work. The water is temperamental. The lights are often not working. The bed is lumpy and the pillows should be in the bin and not on offer for guests. 

Definitely not worth the price.",2,2024,03,15
111,On the decline,"Going down hill rapidly. Been staying here for years but more recently they can’t seem to get it right:

- AC in room not working
- beds aren’t comfy
- everything’s a hassle
- charges for mini bar (not used)

The only good thing about this place now is the location. Feels tired whilst being quite expensive",1,2024,03,14
111,Super stay,"It was our second stay here at the Royal Montcalm Hotel and what a wonderful stay we had was greeted by very friendly staff, we had breakfast they were short staffed as 2 had called in sick and very busy but I must the manager made up for it he was brilliant apologised for having to wait and made everyone feel welcome and well looked after, rooms are beautiful beds super comfy, all staff good but I must say guest manager January is a class above she goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and special, can’t wait to go back, thank you all

The service upon checking in and checking out was excellent and efficient. Also, the area downstairs was very nice and coffee was amazing!",5,2024,03,04
111,Fabulous Stay,"I have wanted to stay here for a while, having previously eaten at The Aviary and also visited the hotel's pub next to the entrance, and our wedding anniversary seemed just the right occasion.  Guests are offered prosecco at check in and we were fortunate to be given a free room upgrade. When we entered our room we were delighted  to find  rose petals and anniversary balloons on the bed,  macarons and a handwritten card on the coffee table and the  room had  a good view over Finsbury Square. There is a smart technology panel for controlling ligting, under floor heating, housekeeping and air con. Huge tv and very well stocked mini bar. The softest bath robes I have ever used and great slippers too. Lovely to have breakfast in The Aviary and what an excellent breakfast it was!   Self serve continental and cooked breakfast with lots of choice  plus additional items  cooked to order  like avocado on toast. Set in a beautiful building, well staffed with great facilities and well located,  this hotel is a lovely little slice of luxury. ",5,2024,03,03

111,Amazing stay,"We went for our annual trip to celebrate early valentines at the Montcalm royal London house and it was such an amazing stay as usual! January from the guest experience team made sure all the little touches were done (petals on the bed, macarons and bottle of Prosecco). We received complimentary breakfast at aviary, access to Montcalm club and late check out at 1pm which was an added bonus. Daniel from the concierge team got us last minute reservations at Yauatcha especially on Chinese new year! Can way to visit again",5,2024,02,12
111,Absolutely unreal hotel!,Me and my partner just returned from our third visit to this hotel and can honestly say it gets better and better every time January the guest experience manager could not do enough for us. I tried contacting her about booking direct but couldn’t get hold of her so I booked through booking.com and she picked it up and remembered my name so on check in we found out she’d upgraded our room for free and added breakfast at the rooftop bar for our duration of the stay. The staff really cannot do enough for you. The location is amazing too. It wasn’t our first and certainly won’t be our last visit to this amazing hotel. Thankyou for an amazing stay!,5,2024,02,11
111,Great stay,"I regularly stay at Montcalm The Royal London House and am always very happy with the service and the rooms at this branch of the hotel.  I've seen reviews suggesting the cleanliness of the rooms wasn't up to scratch but I've never had this problem, in fact the room are always very clean when I stay.  The beds are super comfortable and the heated floor in the bathroom is very welcome in these colder months.  The staff are always on hand to help and can't do enough to ensure your stay is perfect.  One day I'll get to use the spa!",5,2024,02,11
111,Beautiful stay!,"Absolutely amazing stay at The Montcalm Royal London House for my partners birthday. Beautiful room with birthday balloons and macaroons, such a lovely touch. Lovely views from the hotel room, especially at sunset. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. A special mention to the hotel manager January who is extremely kind and made this occasion special for us. The spa facilities were nice, great for a little bit of relaxation. The bar located on top floor was amazing, nice cocktails and stunning views! Thank you, we will be back.",5,2024,02,11
111,Fantastic,"The best hotel in London, all of the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you. The rooms are a great size with super comfortable beds and massive baths with delightful wash products, we can’t wait to come and stay here again in a few months",5,2024,02,10
111,The best hotel in London with the loveliest staff! From Alicia,"Everything was PERFECT! January Stevens
the Guest Experience Manager made our stay so special. She went above and beyond. I can’t recommend this place enough. I will be recommending it to everyone. The staff are a delight and the hotel is beautiful and clean. I’d say it is the best hotel in London. I stayed for an awards ceremony and January upgraded our room and made the night that bit more special for us - I am forever grateful for our incredible stay.",5,2024,02,10
111,Won't be going back,"This is one of the most pretentious hotels I have ever stayed in. The basics are missing or poor.  The pillows were thin, the bed was uncomfortable, and the curtains didn't fit correctly.  There was a constant noise in my room, I couldn't find the source to switch it off.  The towels were thin, of poor quality, and dirty.   There is technology for the sake of it, but it's poorly designed and implemented. There was a touchscreen device outside the bathroom to switch on the light and control the air-conditioning. It didn't cut consistently and didn't dim in standby. There were buttons beside the bed for the lights, and the bedside light button was the furthest from the bed.  The telephones in the room didn't work; I couldn't call reception. There were issues with the TV. On my first morning, I noticed a problem with the window and raised it with reception, along with the noise in the room. The initial response was to contradict me, saying the noise came from outside. When I was finishing checking out, I raised the issues I had with the person in reception, and again, their response was poor. They commented I don't know if they were trying to be funny, but I found it unprofessional. There must be better hotels in London that are less expensive, and if you want to pay the price, I'm sure better hotels are available. I have stayed in many hotels at various price points, and this was one of my worst experiences.",1,2024,02,08
111,Couples weekend away,"Great location from Liverpool Street. Very clean comfortable rooms and extremely helpful staff. Special big thank you to Daniel on front concierge desk. Nice bars and food, didn't use the spa but it looked very impressive. Very hard to find fault with the whole hotel package. ",5,2024,02,08
111,First Class Hotel - excellent service delivered consistently!,"The RLH continues to meet and exceed expectations! I’ve been a very regular guest staying most weeks at the Royal London House for the last few months, and always look forward to my stays. 

The bedrooms are of excellent quality with first class touches throughout. The rooms have a very relaxing feel and the beds are highly luxurious. Sounds proofing is also very effective and I’ve never been disturbed by a neighbour. This is a rarity especially in a busy city.

The staff are very accommodating and ensure everything is always to satisfaction. They are happy to help with any request and resolve any issue swiftly. Special mention to January and Camelia who lead the front of house teams across the hotel. It is clear they work tirelessly to ensure a great service!

The food is of very good quality – breakfast, room service and dinner. The views from the Aviary are impressive and a great way to start the day 😊 

The spa and gym facilities provide a welcome oasis away from the busy city life, and the water jets are especially nice!

Thank you again to the team & look forward to future stays!",5,2024,02,06
111,Tabrez and Cam - amazing,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday, they gave us complimentary gifts in the room. There was a little miscommunication which was kindly rectified by Cam and Tabrez who were exceptional. Made our stay perfect. Could not recommend enough!",5,2024,02,03
111,A new discovery: GREAT,"A new discovery in London: entry was extremely professional but warmhearted (a super nice welcoming lady from “home” (Oerlikon)): she really took the time to explain how it all worked rather than get to the next customer ASAP: made me feel like a welcome guest: location and entree is super comfy, homely and practical: staff in general is super friendly. Breakfast was top with an amazing view over London (10th floor). The room was practical, pillows and mattresses were great for a good night’s sleep, bathroom was totally my thing: if there was one little point of criticism: the “sophisticated” lighting/heating system in the room: the room was way too warm to my liking and it took me some time to figure out to get it down: looks like the touch-screen was touched a bit too rough/often and an old fashion button would have been welcome…
But I will be back here for a next London visit: business or pleasure: a keeper, for sure!",4,2024,02,03
111,Top Team At Reception,"The  Reception team were particularly helpful and although I did not have the opportunity to use all the facilities I was happy with my stay. the location of the hotel is really great and very close to Liverpool St and the Elizabeth line. the investment and development in the area, with a mass variety of eateries etc makes this a great location to enjoy London.",5,2024,02,02
111,"Breakfast A team of Fatima, Rob and Maria keeps you coming back!","The breakfast team at the Aviary, consisting of Fatima and Rob, led by their supervisor Maria is such a good reason to keep coming back to this hotel.

111,Great staycation,"One the best stays I’ve had in London, good value for money and the room was lived up to a good standard. I would definitely return in the future.

111,5* stay! Highly recommend!,"A perfect stay! If you need a hotel in central London, this is it. Every attention to detail is there, the hotel is beautiful. The staff go above and beyond. 
The guest manager January personally came to speak to us, ensured there was a little surprise in the room for my birthday, took care of us throughout our stay. 
The location is right by Finsbury Park so easily accessed from Liverpool St or Moorgate tube stations. The rooms were beautiful, heated floors, led lighting in an array of colours. There are pods ontop of the hotel where you can go for a drink - you need to pre book these. 
An incredible stay - we have already booked to go back! Thank you",5,2024,01,23
111,"Nice hotel, hated the bed and hot room","Was here for business and this hotel could have two different reviews. The hotel itself is nice and the staff were great and friendly. 

The other side of this story is the room. At the end of the day you’re paying for a room to sleep in. The room is nice, bathroom had heated floors, was a nice touch. But the king size bed was two twin beds pushed together with a crappy mattress pad where you could feel the split in the bed and overall uncomfortable mattress pad. Also woke up 3 of my 4 nights very hot despite having the AC on in January.  

Also picture of one of my “clean” towels in bathroom attached to review. 

Location is fine as I was there for work. 10 min walk to tube.",3,2024,01,22

will definitely be returning!",5,2024,01,21
111,Montcalm Royal London House,"Montcalm Royal London House
Firstly, what a warm and friendly welcome on arrival. Greeted with a glass of prosecco. Check - in was smooth. Staff at the desk were chatty and friendly. Then greeted by one of the Managers (January Stevens) who took us up to our beautifully prepared and presented room (rose pettles, macaroons & refreshments) when booking my Fiancè had stated it was a romantic get away so this was a lovely surprise upon entry to our room (Montcalm Club Double Room)  We were also given breakfast on the house as we had explained to January we were recently engaged and looking for a little get away to unwind after the busy xmas/new year period. Breakfast was delicious and there were plenty of options to choose from. 
The spa was also clean and well kept. Jacuzzi a little on the small side but bearable. 

The only down side if any was the slightly uncomfortable bed and the outdated T.V  bar this the service and standard of the hotel was impeccable.
Thank you Montcalm for a relaxing stay and a massive thank you to January for being so kind and helpful.",5,2024,01,21
111,The most amazing stay.,"We have just returned from the most wonderful stay at this hotel. It was for my husbands birthday and January who is the guest experience Manager could not have done anything more to make our stay more special. She did everything she could to ensure we had a wonderful time, there was a personal card in our room, balloons on the bed and macaroons. We also had a free upgrade which was the icing on the cake! 

We have already recommended the hotel to all our friends and family. We cannot wait to come and stay again!",5,2024,01,21
111,Home from home,"Home from home when I'm in London. Soundproof, extremely comfortable rooms. Very helpful staff. Fantastic transport links, particularly if you're travelling via Euston.

111,"Quiet, Comfortable, Welcoming.","I love thé business suite here, always so quiet and comfortable.
Receptionists and staff go out of their way to welcome you.
The wine in the exec lounge was again really good.
The exec lounge evening food offering definitely pales in comparison to some hotels, I like a decent hors d'œuvre from a lounge , however  what they lack in evening food, they make up for in attentive service, excellent wine and fab onsite restaurant.",5,2024,01,11
111,Service is excellent,"I stayed here with work and was rather disappointed. Whilst the staff were very friendly and polite, the room was average. Breakfast was very poor - the cooked breakfast was cold and the muffins/pastries were very dry. They didn't offer any herbal teas at breakfast either. The spa cushions were filthy and need replacing or a very good clean. I have also since found out I was charged for the minibar which I most certainly did not use - I am currently awaiting a reply to my email regarding this. 

Since posting this review the hotel have been in contact and resolved my complaints. I am looking forward to trying the hotel again. ",4,2024,01,09
111,Great staff and amenities. Room could’ve been cleaner for the price we paid however,Lovely hotel with great amenities and staff. Only small downside is that our hotel room was a little dusty and Bluetooth speaker in the room didn’t work but January the Guest Experience Manager made our stay that extra special. Would highly recommend the hotel nonetheless,5,2024,01,08

It is the perfect location, with a relatively spacious room and a comfortable bed.

Highly recommended and we will be back soon.",5,2024,01,08

111,Thank you!!!!!! January Stevens & Emily Summers ,"I just have to say me and my fiancée had such a lovely time it was our 3rd year anniversary because 2 years ago I proposed to my partner at the Montcalm Royal House, so it’s only right we come back before we get married which will be this year.
The Guest Experience Manager January Stevens was so amazing making sure everything is perfect for the anniversary day and I am forever grateful an absolute legend of a manager. 
Moreover the hospitality of all the staff were so nice and excellent customer service, which leads me to Emily Summers she was so nice to me and my partner making sure if we needed anything that we should come to her request and because of that me and my partner once again had a lovely experience staying at Montcalm Royal House and we can’t wait to come back again and by that time we will be married. 

Best Regards

If there any issues or queries these are resolved straight away. All staff are really friendly and accommodating. It was so great to be able to use the member’s bar area when booking a club room - the complimentary drinks and breakfast are a lovely touch! Pruthvish was so friendly and welcoming, thank you for all your help during our stay.

It’s great to be able to use the spa however only having a 30 minute session is a little restrictive, and you have to make sure to book in advance. Nonetheless it’s lovely to be able to use it!",5,2024,01,03

111,Very friendly and personable service and top class room!,"Room wise it’s one of the best hotel rooms I’ve stayed in. Can’t fault anything at all! 
 
Stayed over for the night for the works Christmas party which was close by in Shoreditch. 

From the moment I arrived to the moment I left the stay was an absolute joy! 
 
The mulled wine while checking in was a treat! Claudia (I think that’s who checked me in) was lovely, very friendly and efficient at her job. She even remembered me this morning when I checked out and came over to say hello and ask about my stay. In fact, every member of staff I encountered were brilliant! All friendly, chatty and made it a lovely relaxing stay.
 
My only criticism being it would have been nicer to be able to stay in the spa a little longer, maybe an hour vs 30min as I felt quite rushed. But I totally understand why the limit is in place. Admittedly with a slight hangover following the Christmas party, I could have easily spent my whole morning down there! 
 
I’ll definitely be staying again!",5,2024,01,02

They truly could not be more helpful without it being too much. They have created the perfect balance. I can’t wait to stay again next year!,5,2023,12,31
111,Rather disappointing hotel,"We were very disappointed at the service of the hotel. We paid over £600 for two nights. Although we understand price goes up for the New Years Eve but surely the service should remain/match. Following are the areas we find most disappointing.

1. Although on website it says they have pool/sauna and spa, we found out at the check in desk we only have 1/2 hour daily use as a complimentary. This was not mentioned on the website. 
2. No extra towels or slippers were provided to go to pool area. We ended up having wet room slippers.
3. No hot towel rail or laundry lines in the bathroom provide for wet swimming costumes. 
4. We could not order any meals/room service without a QR code and the QR code we had was not working in our room. 
5. We wanted to book the tickets for rooftop bar (Aviary) for the NYE drinks party. Hotel guests have no priority or discount for the booking. 
6. Some of the sockets in the room were not working, as we found out when using the hair dryer. 

We feel this is such a disjointed badly run hotel which contracted all the services out to the third party and doesn’t have a control over their services. Something similar to NHS service (sorry NHS😅) which we paid a lot for. 

I gave 3 out of 5 as a generous gesture because I think this would work better if I had stayed here for work/business. For this leisure trip we would have given 1 out of 5. 

Hope this helps other travellers.",3,2023,12,30
111,Great Stay!,"The experience was at Montcalm Royal was very pleasant all the staff showed excellent service, especially January Stevens who helped my experience at the hotel. The facilities were lovely especially the bar on the 10th floor and the room I stayed in was amazing, I recommend requesting the room 902 as it was fantastic due to the balcony view and room size.",5,2023,12,29

111,Exceptional hotel,"Exceptional experience! We went for a Christmas treat and we really had one! The good impressions started with Otilia the receptionist who was friendly,  helpful and upgraded our room to a suite. She explained what to expect re meals, room service, restaurant,  deposits, booking the spa facilities, etc. Very useful information from a truly delightful person. The suite was clean , air-conditioned and large, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and shiny!   The Aviary bar at the top of the hotel gave us a breath-taking view over London at night- unforgettable.  The cocktails were perfect. We had breakfast in the Aviary restaurant and there was a wide variety of food and lots of whatever we wanted on offer. One of the staff members, Angela, was very friendly,  efficient and helpful. The doormen definitely added value to our comings and goings, loaning us a large umbrella when we needed one, and full of smes and warm welcomes. I could go on at great length about this happy hotel but, suffice it to say that we plan to return for another stay. It was great!!",5,2023,12,27
111,Montcalm Stay 13th -14th Fiancé’s Bday Celebration ,"Stayed at Montcalm to celebrate my Fiancé’s birthday and everything was just perfect on Montcalms’ behalf. Emily Summers, a lady within the special experiences department really went above and beyond! 10/10 Emily and all those involved. The hotel room was decorated without me lifting a finger, complimentary sparkling wine and a dessert for us to walk into and enjoy. The spa is another top notch addition, clean and comforting. Luckily we had some time to ourselves in there and we really just enjoyed the hotel. Was a brilliant stay. Only confusing aspect is the deposit, still yet to recieve it back, has been 15+ days since I stayed so that should be explained a bit further at the time of stay. However this doesn’t put me entirely staying at Montcalm Royal, definitely a Top 3 destination in London to stay. Thank you Emily Summers & all of Montcalm, from Vincent",5,2023,12,26

111,"Peaceful, beautiful, amazing, clean 5* Hotel","Amazing, beautiful, peaceful. Always made to feel welcome even in such busy times. Client/ customer service was on point 5*. We stayed in room 429. Room spacious and all the amenities you need. Quiet too so was nice to relax for a few nights. 

The staff are always pleasant and always remembers us. The staff and service is the reason we stay every year. Deepak, Daniel and Jan was very accomadating to make sure our requests were fulfilled. 

No matter what you ask the staffs all have a yes attitude and will try their best. The hotel staff goes above and beyond. 

Breakfast is always great, but could get busy and tables are not managed or not enough staff as all are running around. 
Club lounge is perfect for a late afternoon drink and snack in a queit setting. 

The hotel overall is clean, tidy and presentable.always well presented with beautiful decor. Has a lovey welcome feel and the staff are all so pleaseant! We have already booked our next stay at this hotel!

111,Everyone must stay here! ,"This trip was extremely important to us as a family. The first family trip having lost our Mum & the first time we could all get together before Xmas. From the moment we arrived, we knew this was a special place! Greeted by the smiling doorman, who carried our luggage showing us through to reception. Beautifully decorated, stylish but not pretentious. January the Guest Experience Manager was just simply ‘amazing’. Nothing was too much trouble. From the moment we spoke to her before our trip, to our arrival, during our stay & saying goodbye as we left.
She was so genuine, heartfelt in her attentiveness towards us. We had Prosecco on our arrival, not just the one glass either, which was amazing. Our family rooms had been decorated with petals and balloons for my brothers engagement & our room was decorated too & to our extra surprise, upgraded! Not asked for or expected but overwhelming, in the nicest of ways.
We were able to use the club lounge for continental breakfast & the rest of our family group were allowed access to, so we could all be together….again, not asked for but January arranged it for us. We really don’t know what to say.
The rooms were beautiful, tasteful, elegant and had everything you needed. The mood lighting, mini bar facilities, big bathroom, lovely comfortable queen sized bed was fantastic! The rooms were immaculately clean - it was just lovely.
The restaurant (Burdock) was great. Lovely food and selection & the staff very friendly and attentive. Christmas dinner was fab. We went to the Aviary for drinks…again an amazing location on the rooftop & spectacular views. Breakfast there the following morning was spectacular! You could have everything off of the menu if you liked plus all the continental bits too….not something we had experienced before! We weren’t rushed, in fact the opposite and could enjoy the experience fully. The food was perfect and again the staff happy & very helpful.
January, the staff and their focus on making your stay amazing for you, makes them a class above the rest. We couldn’t fault anything. We felt like superstars and we have January to thank for that. 
The location is ideal with everything close by for shopping, the theatre, restaurants, all that you could wish for. 
January even checked our bill at the end and realised an error, sorted it and refunded us immediately, before we had even realised.
A truly wonderful stay, a must place to stay….you won’t be disappointed - a real treat but most importantly for us, the focus was on us and the staff making it special for us, which without doubt they did! 
Thank you January & your staff….we couldn’t have asked or wanted for anything else…..
We will be back ☺️",5,2023,12,12

111,The _Royal_ treatment in Finsbury Square,"I was in London on business and anticipated spending two nights at the hotel. I was so overwhelmed by the service and management that I decided to make a holiday out of London and brought my family over for Thanksgiving.  

There was a minor defect in our original room that I mentioned when I went to get an additional key (an inoffensive stain that I didn’t want to be blamed for).  The duty manager Kamelia(sp?) and I think concierge asked if they could accompany me and check. They were aghast and implored us to change rooms.  

I said it wasn’t a big deal and had started unpacking. I had additional business in another city, but then returned to London. 

When I told them that I was going to be coming back, they asked me to return to the hotel to see if they could make it up to me. They certainly didn’t have to but I received a complementary upgrade.

When my family joined, the rooms, got complicated and got out of a particularly thorny situation with the exceptionally professional help of the night agent (Juan). My wife and I had no idea how to organize our different rooms and our daughters were arriving at different times. Juan sorted it all out that he had seen much more challenging situations. My wife and I are both professionals and seasoned and we really couldn’t think it through. Juan’s comforting hospitality really was the proverbial “game change.” He said he would handle it all while we slept.

He is reflective of this hotel’s extraordinary staff.  

Good spot to do your business and bring by clients.  And magnificent for families; pool is dazzling.  Shuffleboard adds dignified fun. The valets are smartly attired with top hats and all. They welcome each guest upon return (often by name). Alex is my favorite but they’re uniformly inviting. 

Gorgeous rooftop restaurant and bar are just the beginning.  Couldn’t be more centrally located. Moorgate/Liverpool.",5,2023,11,24

It was an excellent stay again and the convience getting around London from the hotel is just so great. I thank the front office staff for their exceptional service and help. 
The hotel provided in raining and storming conditions umbrellas for us and a visit to the spa - sauna was wonderful in the evening.

111,A really special hotel experience ,"This hotel is fantastic and the service is incredible. We were celebrating our engagement and the team went out of their way to make us feel special, gifting us with a bottle of bubbly and a beautiful room covered with rose petals!

111,Luxury hotel with amazing customer service ,"Such a beautiful hotel which was great value for money! Everyone was so lovely and accommodating, we were greeted outside straight away by a kind man who took our bags to reception so we could check in quickly. The reception staff again were so nice and helpful. I wrote in the special requests that we were celebrating a birthday and anniversary and they even decorated our room and left little treats. Special thanks to Larisa and her manager for making this happen, it was so special!",5,2023,11,12
111,"Lovely hotel, little need for improvement","Staff were very helpful and nice! 
The doorman helped with our bags and we were given a lovely room with a nice view of the square. Wine and chocolate were left in the room too. 
Surfaces were a little dirty including the wardrobe doors but nothing major. One of the bedroom phones didn’t work but we only needed to use it once so it didn’t effect us too much! We went to the rooftop bar for drinks but were told we couldn’t sit and drink outside which was a bit disappointing as this was something we booked for and would’ve liked to know before arriving. Found the room well equipped and everything was there! But was very cold, felt like a window was open! 

Overall a nice stay in London and would stay again! Perhaps would go for a better room but lovely hotel.",4,2023,11,12
111,Best birthday stay,"Lovely night away with my friend celebrating my 40th birthday. Attention from staff was phenomenal. Special mention to January, Dhruv and Vlad who were very and attentive and helpful and made our stay exceptional.  We Accessed the spa facilities and whilst we enjoyed our visit to he spa, we felt a few details in the spa could enhance the 5 star experience e.g the addition of mood lighting, addition of eucalyptus   and updating the sitting area in steam room. Overall stay was 5/5",5,2023,11,12
111,Another perfect visit from one of the most attentive hotels in london,"So back at the Montcalm again.  It now isn’t really a choice any more, it’s a number one preference.

This visit was for our son’s graduation at the Barbican. We arrived very very early and our room wasn’t ready.  We needed to get changed and the hotel very kindly provided us with another room to get changed in.  They also told us to leave our bags and they would be transferred to our room.

On returning to the hotel we were promptly given our room keys, a family suite.  Spotlessly clean, everything worked, comfortable and a reasonable size.  Bags were in the room as promised.

A few complimentary drinks in the club lounge before a meal outside of the hotel organised by the concierge.  Amazing.

Our room was on the front of the hotel but we couldn’t hear anything from outside and slept soundly.

Breakfast was continental but the downstairs restaurant was full.  Without asking the supervisor arranged for us to visit the restaurant upstairs with a complimentary upgrade to full English as an apology for the delay.

In short. Amazing service, amazing value.

I have found that things can be very busy but the staff genuinely want to help and bend over backwards to help you.  Just ask!

To all the staff …. Look forward to seeing you again soon!",5,2023,11,09
111,Glowing ref for Amy at Montcalm,"I was greeted by Amy who was extremely professional and made my check in and check out experience very memorable.  She was extremely pleasant at all times.

The room was very clean and sophisticated. It was quite spacious. The staff member who came up with us explained everything in the room and made us feel at home. 
The breakfast was absolutely delicious. The breakfast staff was very accommodating to our needs and extremely friendly. 
The location is fantastic, only 5 minutes walk from Moorgate tube station and the hotel itself is quite central with lost of shops around.

We stayed for 1 night but wished we were staying for more.
Will try to be brief. Fantastic Central location by foot or public transport. 
Beautiful room. Lots of light, modern amenities and luxurious products.
Quiet comfortable stay with great views taking on board our special requests. Rooftop bar and restaurant lovely with outside domes that were really cosy.

111,Overnighter for a 50th birthday,"Great value with excellent service in a great location.  Without exception every member of staff is polite and helpful.  We were checked in by Kseniia who was lovely.  She explained everything and that by staying in a club room we were entitled to a complementary continental breakfast (which was fresh and tasty) and also complementary drinks (alcoholic) and snacks (5.30pm - 8.30pm).  We were out and didn’t get the chance but maybe next time!!

The room was clean and large.  Decent shower and large sink.  Bed was comfy.  Windows floor to ceiling with a city skyline view.  As it was my wife’s birthday there was a handwritten card and bottle of red wine (a nice touch) My wife doesn’t drink red but they gladly swapped for a bottle of white on ice!  

Kseniia phoned us to check everything was ok, that was a nice touch. Thank you.

Towels and robes were fluffy and clean.

1 floor up to The Aviary - a roof top bar with outside pods.  A great view towards The Shard in the distance.  We took our family there after our meal before they left us and went home.  Great vibe with a good DJ.  Once again the service was excellent. Earlier in the day as well as the evening we were served by Gulam.  He was a great guy, very talkative and friendly.  When he found out it was my wife’s birthday he brought us a surprise.  A special happy birthday brownie cake - another nice touch.

Otilia checked us out.  She was lovely too, very professional and wished my wife a happy birthday.  She enquired over our stay and what we’d done.  She offered us a beverage to take away but we were ok.

A great hotel with a spa, pool and 3 bars.  10 minute walk from Liverpool St station makes for an ideal location.  

The staff come across as very professional, they are also genuine and friendly. The staff make you feel like you want to go back and we probably will.

Thank you for a great stay!!",5,2023,11,05
111,Amazing ,"Great experience in the Montcalm, the staffs are very friendly and professional. The breakfast at the rooftop Aviary very tasty, with a nice view. we enjoyed our stay and will be back soon thank you. ",5,2023,11,05
111,"Great stay for biz trips, friendly staff","As always on my business trips a great and comfortable stay, with a convenient location next to Moorgate and Liverpool Street Station, and friendly and helpful staff. Kudos to Amy at reception, it was a rare occasion for me to speak German :-).",5,2023,11,03
111,Excellent!,"We had a fantastic stay. The hotel was lovely and the rooms were modern (which surprised us as some of the reviews we’ve seen suggested otherwise), spacious and comfortable. 

Breakfast was really nice and worth the additional cost and the 10th floor restaurant where it was situated was really nice, with a fantastic view. 

The staff were very attentive and helpful, especially January, who went out of her you to greet us and make sure we were having a wonderful time. She added finishing touches that made it really special. ",5,2023,11,03
111,Brilliant service .,"Excellent location with brilliant views from the room , had a lovely meal in the igloo with great 360 views of London and a button included for service which was excellent.

111,Excellent hotel for both business and pleasure purposes,"Excellent hotel for business/pleasure purposes. It's always my first choice when I'm visiting London for any occasion. Mary in reception is fantastic, and always makes me feel at home during my stay. The rooms are beautiful and modern with fantastic views. The car park opposite is also ideally situated with parking spaces big enough to fit a bus, so no need to worry about the car when it's parked up for a few days. Highly recommended hotel with excellent staff and modern rooms! ",5,2023,10,31
111,Our new favourite London Hotel,"Hotel was amazing from the moment we entered reception. The room was fantastic & clean with a beautiful well appointed washroom.

111,"Comfortable, gorgeous hotel","This hotel genuinely deserves all 5 stars. The staff are so helpful and friendly, and anything g you need is taken care of quickly.
Our room was upgraded for free, and it was spacious, clean and comfortable. We had a fantastic night sleep!
Complimentary spa was okay but not the highlight. I’d stick to everything else!",5,2023,10,29
111,Montcalm royal London trip,"We stayed at this montcalm after having a lovely experience with this chain before, for our London trip.
Good points
Staff were very helpful and welcomed us, Amy at reception checked us in and was very polite and explained everything.
Breakfast was good. Lots of choice in aviary suite, buffet full English, and the views from this floor were amazing.
Beds are very comfy, toiletries provided, bathroom clean with good size shower, coffee/tea making facilities. Mini bar, everything you need.
The spa area was clean, and although small, it was very nice.
Bad points.
For the spa, you had to change into robes provided and use your towels from room, but obviously, these get wet, so if you go back to your room for a shower, you'll have wet towels. (But to be fare, they ordered dry ones to our rooms as I moaned about this, and they came straight away).
The room could have been a little cleaner, a few stains on the floor, etc, but it wasn't too bad, just marked down on.
We would definitely stay again, and for price range, a lovely hotel.",4,2023,10,28
111,Good - But Could be Better......,"My wife and I stayed in this property for 4 x days during October 2023, and found it a good base for both business and leisure during our visit to London. Right on Finsbury Square and a short walk from Moorgate Tube Station. We stayed in a Club Deluxe room which was sufficiently spacious, and offered a large bathroom with a long, luxurious bath. Bathroom amenities (soap, shampoo, conditioner) were also good quality.  Club Deluxe rooms qualify Guests to enjoy a basic Continental breakfast in the downstairs dining room, along with complimentary drinks from 5.30pm - 8pm each evening, which is a nice touch. Front of House staff were always welcoming and efficient. However, Rooms Division needs to up it's game, as they 'forgot' to service and clean our room on more than one occasion, leading us to chase them up. Further, we asked for another toilet roll and were told it would be delivered by the Rooms Staff, and this never came. Whether they are short staffed, or merely inefficient, I have no idea - but because of this, I couldn't refer to this property as '5-Star.' So, in summation, I would say that this property is good, but could be so much better.",4,2023,10,28
111,Great stay,"Excellent location to get around London. Staff were very responsive & polite. It was my partner’s birthday and the guest service team had decorated our room with balloons and left a nice tray of macarons. Spotlessly clean, really comfy bed, great shower in bathroom, however the room was a little tired and could do with a refurb to maintain it’s 5* status - cracked tiles in bathroom floor and scuff marks and dent in wall in bedroom, need attention. We didn’t eat here, we used the bar but we were a bit disappointed that we couldn’t take drinks from the ground floor bar up to the roof terrace bar to enjoy the view. Overall a very pleasant stay.",4,2023,10,27
111,Great stay,This was a lovely stay with staff who were extremely accommodating helping me with checking in early and looking after my bags as I checked out  and made the experience pleasant and safe especially for being solo! If you do go ( which you should :D ) make great use of the rooftop bar with breathtaking views!,5,2023,10,27
111,Calming and exclusive experience in Central London,"Montclam London House has been my ""go to"",  good restaurant and access to office etc. is just walk away. Restaurant and the bar is cool. Always find their staff courteous - Swati is a delight during morning b'fast.",5,2023,10,26
111,Nice People,"Excellent stay! All the staff are lovely, especially Swati and Gebziela in the bar who looked after us every day for breakfast. They were super friendly and helped with everything we asked for perfectly. Thank you!",5,2023,10,26

111,Wedding Proposal at Montcalm - Unbelievable Experience,"I proposed to my girlfriend in my room at the Montcalm Royal London House and the experience was unbelievable.

I contacted the team months before hand to explain how I wanted the room setup and the guest experience manager January made everything perfect. I sent her designs of what I wanted and she ordered everything in to replicate the design I wanted at a good price and with no extra set up charges. I’ve attached some pictures, but there’s more to the setup that can’t be seen in them. January also provided us with complementary Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries.  

The day before I arrived, she informed me that she’d given us a free upgrade from the most basic room to a suite, and given us free breakfast at the aviary rooftop restaurant. The suite was amazing, it was on the top floor, with 2 bathrooms and with views over Finsbury square. 

When I arrived, I was also informed that every guest gets 30 minutes free spa treatments, and also there’s free drinks and snacks for all guests between 5:30-8pm (including beer, wines and spirits). You can’t really go wrong with free spirits even if it’s only for a few hours.

To top everything off, every single employee we dealt with at the hotel gave us top-notch customer service. It made you feel like royalty. 

January also emailed me after my visit to ask me to reach out next time we visit the hotel (which we definitely will be doing) so she can look after us again. I already can’t wait
",5,2023,10,22
111,Wow,"I want to live in the Montcalm , I want to win the lottery and to feel special every day like the staff at the Montcalm made my husband and I feel this weekend. Thankyou so much, staff make a hotel and the guys at the Montcalm have it in abundance. Bloody loved it.",5,2023,10,22

We will be back and would highly recommend this hotel.

111,"Average hotel, great staff & location","I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in October. The room we were given was dirty - the previous guests had left food in the mini bar and opened cans, the curtains/carpet had large stains and the lights did not work. We were moved to a different room which was much better. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. 

The location is great and ideal for reaching everything in the city centre. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby. The train station is only a 10 minute walk. 

This is a beautiful hotel with amazing staff but is let down by the cleanliness and condition of the rooms. In my opinion it is not a five-star hotel.  ",3,2023,10,20
111,"Very pleasant, relaxing place","Very kind and attentive staff. Larisa at the reception and Karl at the lodge did a great job to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I had a great time at this place, will gladly return anytime. Big thanks for the nice staff!🙏",5,2023,10,19
111,Amazing Stay! Can’t wait to re-visit!,"After previously staying at this hotel a few years ago, I booked to stay again and surprise my partner for his birthday, and it did not disappoint!

The staff kindly greeted us with a complimentary glass of champagne, taking our bags and showing us where to check in. We were welcomed by the lovely Mary, who showed us up to our room and made sure we were happy with everything.

A huge thank you to Mary for helping me set up a birthday surprise for my partner, he loved it! She arranged for the room to be decorated with balloons, banners and rose petals. I added a bottle of champagne, which was set up in the room and my partner received a birthday card from the hotel.

We had the best stay and can’t wait to return in the future. This hotel is worth the money… amazing staff, rooms and facilities!

A warm welcome from each member of staff. Greeted with a nice glass of bubbles and delicious macarons  as I was celebrating my special day with Montcalm Royal London House 7th anniversary. The room was spacious, cosy and the bathroom floor with underfloor heating was out this world. 

Mary, Assistant Guest Manager - was incredibly friendly, with her warm and caring nature. 

My spa experience was just as pleasant - unfortunately I don't recall the lovely lady who gave me a fantastic massage.

111,"Excellent and prestigious hotel, always a very relaxing experience!","The Royal London House is an excellent hotel, which exceeds expectations having been a regular guest over several months. The rooms are incredibly well appointed, with very sophisticated and high-tech finishing touches. The decor is of warm and natural colours, tastefully designed to leave you feeling very relaxed! The beds are nothing short of extremely comfortable and generous, providing a luxurious feel in all aspects. The bathrooms are also noticeably large with some offering bath tubs. 

The staff are very helpful and Camelia in particular, the Front of House Manager, is a real star of the hotel. She is clearly very passionate and dedicated to achieving excellent customer service in all areas, always seeking to go above and beyond. Camelia is always very welcoming and is keen to ensure your stay is as comfortable as possible. In addition, she is always very responsive and resolves any issue quickly and effectively.

The spa offers an oasis with good facilities and easily accessible, a rare find in the centre of London! The food is also excellent and room service is very quick and efficient. The rooftop terrace is very trendy with highly impressive views.

The hotel provides very good value for money, having stayed in many hotels across UK and Europe over several years for work. I would certainly not hesitate to recommend the hotel.

111,Service second to none ,The service at this hotel is second to none. The doorman is usually there to meet you at the door or see you out. I have always been able to walk up to reception and get service straight away. I did have a problem with a room once which was resolved by the duty manager team who couldn’t do enough to help.

I was very pleased that all my pre booking requests were carried out by the hotel and the welcom we received from Mary, Gurst Experience Manager made the start to our stay even more special.
The room was fantastic as well as the other hotel amenities such as the Spa, Aviary Bar and restuarant and i will be staying here again on my next trip to London.
Cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2023,10,09
111,A wonderful weekend!,"I booked the hotel as an anniversary surprise for my partner, for our anniversary. I can't fault our stay or the service we received throughout our weekend stay. Everyone was very attentive and amiable, especially Mary, the manager on duty, who showed us to our room and then came to say goodbye when we checked out.

The room was lovely and well appointed.

We had drinks in The Aviary and got to enjoy a fabulous sunset.

Thank you for a wonderful weekend!",5,2023,10,08
111,The most perfect stay in a fantastic hotel!,"Me and my partner arrived late on a Friday for a 2 night stay at this hotel. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. The staff are absolutely fantastic, they couldn’t do enough and they certainly made our stay extra special. 
Once we were shown to reception by the front door staff we checked in and were told the whereabouts of our room. The man (I didn’t get his name) was brilliant, very attentive and gave us plenty of information about the hotel and the use of the spa/pool etc. 
We then went to our room and realised we had been upgraded to a better room and also the hotel/staff had gone well out of their way to make it extra special for us. We had recently got married and upon entering the room there were rose petals placed on the bed, celebration balloons, a bottle of Prosecco and a congratulations card. We thought this was absolutely amazing and couldn’t believe how much the hotel staff had gone out of their way for us to make our stay even better. 
The room was amazing, great facilities, very modern, lots of amenities and faultless. The hotel itself is fantastic in a great location and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stay in central London. 
When we checked out the lady who we dealt with (possibly called Marienne) asked how our stay was which is always a nice touch and we said we had the best time in one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at. The hotel manager Mary came to see us before we checked out and asked how our stay was, she was also brilliant and we thanked her for the extras we had received courtesy of the hotel and we would definitely return. 
Literally couldn’t fault this place or the staff, it’s easily one of the best hotels we have stayed at and we will 100% return again in the future!

Thankyou for such an amazing stay!",5,2023,10,08

111,Excellent service from all!! ,"I've not experienced such a high level of service from all nembers of staff anywhere else! I decided to splash out as it was our 15th anniversary, I contacted the hotel to let them know of our special occasion as i wanted to make sure we could use the spa facilities on the friday shortly after we arrived. Mary contacted me, was vwry helpful and booked in the spa for me. When we arrived, we were greeted with a free flass of prosecco as we waited a min or 2 for someone to be available to check us in. Once all the paperwork was sorted Mary came out to meet us and take us to our room which was very lovely and upon getting to our room they had left balloons and petals on the bed along with some very nice chocolates to help us celebrate our anniversary!
We stayed in a club double which was very nice and had access to the club lounge which was worth the small amount extra due to the drinks/snacks available in the evening and the excellent continental breakfast in the morning!!
Overall, excellent value for money and highly reccomend as a quality place to stay in the centre of London!! ",5,2023,10,01
111,Wonderful hotel ,"Fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. Food great, breakfast great choice. From check in to departure staff were so helpful. Gorgeous room, comfy and very clean. Definitely staying here again. Great.",5,2023,10,01
111,"Exceptional staff , brilliant club room benefits ","My husband and I have just returned from another wonderful stay at your hotel ! Every member of staff are always so attentive and this stay was no different ! 
My husband had a funny turn in the spa and passed out ! All the staff in the staff were amazing including Hossam ! He was so kind and went above and beyond in helping myself and my husband ! One of the ladies from the spa even came out of the treatment room to help us ( I assume she was busy in there ) they knew how to treat him and calmed me down also !! 
Mary was exceptional and made my birthday perfect with Prosecco  , balloons and petals in our room ! So lovely and kind ! The club room facilities are brilliant with drinks and snacks in the eve and the breakfast is lovely too !

111,Lovely stay! ,"From the moment we arrived we was made to feel very welcome. Our first greeting was with the doorman who was polite and helpful. Every member of staff we walked pass said hello. Check in was easy. Mary took us to our room where they had arranged balloons as it was my partners birthday. The rooftop bar and terrace was lovely where we enjoyed a few drinks in the sun! Again every member of staff was lovely and welcoming. Breakfast was one of the best we’ve had at a hotel in London. Lots of choice and option to order from the menu too. Highly recommend staying here and would be more than happy to return. 

Thank you Mary for making our visiting one to remember. We look forward to visiting again. 

Alex and Carl ",5,2023,09,30
111,Brilliant stay at Montcalm,"I’ve stayed at Montcalm Royal London House twice now and both times have been brilliant stays. From the moment you arrive there is someone to greet you and take your luggage. The staff are always very friendly and helpful and the rooms are great. My room both times staying here has been very clean & has everything you would need for a comfortable stay. 
A great central hotel and very reasonably priced too!",5,2023,09,29
111,First class hotel and people!,Fantastic staff. Special commendation for Daniel the Concierge at the Montcalm Royal London House. Location is excellent and an easy walk to the tube underground. So many great restaurants within walking distance to Shoreditch. Excellent coffee and pastries at the first floor café and the staff in the café were so accommodating. Really enjoyed the top floor Aviary restaurant and bar with an excellent view. The room was very quiet and well appointed. Housekeeping staff went above and beyond for us. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2023,09,28
111,What are you looking for in a hotel that you won’t find at Montcalm Royal London house ,"This hotel has everything you need and can accommodate any occasion. The staff is polite and respectful, and the services are excellent.

I went with my husband for a birthday party and I highly suggest this hotel. The room came with birthday cards, chocolate, and balloons, which completely made my day.

Most significantly, Mary Philippiah made my day and stay much better; she constantly checking in and asking if we were okay or if we needed anything; she's such a wonderful free-spirited soul.

Thank you all one more. I had a fantastic birthday.

Adikatou ",5,2023,09,28
111,Always Excellent!,"This was our 4th stay at the Royal London, and I can honestly say that this hotel continues to deliver on all the key attributes thats needed for a coyoles stopovers in London.
Starting with the location, bring at the back of Liverpool St station, it is ideal for getting to the heart of tbe city and central London, but also the East End - the emerging gem which is Whitechapel as well as Shoreditch. 
The rooms are so spacious and well appointed, it formed the relaxing haven that we both needed!
The breakfast is plentiful and the staff are more than helpful when called upon, and of course there is the added bonus of the Avery rooftop bar - where we maxed out  on the Saturday evening having been blessed with glorious sunshine!
Special mention to the head concierge Daniel, his level of service and professionalism is as good as it gets.
A thoroughly recommended stay.",5,2023,09,28
111,A night in the city...and a birthday treat!,"From the moment we arrived at the Montcalm Royal London House we were made to feel very welcome. Check-in was swift and we received a personal introduction from the lovely Assistant Guest Experience Manager Mary. She accompanied us to our room which was a nice touch. We were greeted by balloons on the bed and some complimentary Macarons, thoughtfully placed as a small gesture for my birthday. 

The room was spacious, and had all the amenities for a comfortable stay. We decided to go straight to the Aviary rooftop bar for some refreshments which affords an amazing view over the city. The staff were friendly and we enjoyed a very relaxed few hours. It had a nice laidback atmosphere which is just what we were looking for. Perhaps because it was a Sunday it was a bit more chilled than the rest of the week. The vibe was perfect for us though, so we took full advantage of enjoying the panoramic vista of the London skyline as the sun went down.

As it was just a one night stay we didn't get to experience everything the hotel has to offer which is a shame. I was hoping to use the pool, but time just ran away. Next time. All in all a very pleasant stay.",5,2023,09,28
111,"AMAZING, WONDERFUL STAY AS ALWAYS.",We stayed here at this beautiful hotel for the 3rd year running. It’s always the most amazing experience from start to finish. We were greeted by Mary the manager who was lovely and saw us to our room personally. I had phoned ahead as it was my partners birthday and they put balloons in the room ready for our arrival. A lovely little touch.  Daniel who is one of the concierge team was so lovely and helpful as always. When we checked out Mary also wanted to personally check that we were happy with our stay. Such a lovely service.  This will always be our favourite London hotel and will definitely be back next year. ,5,2023,09,28
111,Best hotel I've been to,"I really enjoyed my stay here, because it far exceeded my expectations. I stayed here as a birthday treat to myself and from the moment I walked in, I was greeted and taken care of. I had requested a few things prior and even the customer service was so good over the phone. 

I walked into my room and found balloons on my bed with a box of chocolates and a personalised note from the hotel wishing me a happy birthday. The experience manager of the hotel was so friendly and kind and she showed me to my room, showed me how everything worked and I felt so welcome. The bed was comfortable, everything was clean, the spa was so nice and relaxing and not too busy. 

I order room service and it arrived quickly and the food was delicious! 

This is by far the best hotel I've stayed in in London and I will most definitely be staying here again soon!",5,2023,09,28
111,Lovely service with minor suggestions,"The service was really brilliant. We were offered a complimentary drink on arrival. The assistant manager Mary, was so lovely. She personally took us up to our room which she had upgraded and decorated for our anniversary. The staff were all very helpful. It was hard to get a hold of the spa over the telephone and it was unfortunate that you had to book 30 minute slots to use the facilities. Other than this, the location was great and I would recommend it. ",5,2023,09,27
111,Fantastic 2 night stay,"Fantastic experience from the very beginning great communication with a very helpful duty manager discussing our stay and the fact it was our anniversary I couldn’t have expected or received a better experience with Nibedita fantastic, our room was upgraded to a beautiful room we had a club delux room the room was beautiful and as a suprise and again going the extra mile as it was our wedding anniversary Nibedita and Mary and Ksenia had arranged for our room to be decorated with anniversary balloons and rose petals on the bed also with a complimentary bottle of wine, again going the extra mile which was hugely appreciated, we had a wonderful 2 night stay a lovely relaxing time in the spa in the evening which meant we were the only ones in there so very relaxing, the club drinks and snacks bar again fantastic staff very attentive and great choice of drinks and snacks, we enjoyed a beautiful meal in the aviary restaurant again extremely friendly and attentive restaurant and bar staff, beautiful views on the outside terrace, fantastic meal of steak cooked beautifully, fantastic cocktails and ambiance, the breakfast each morning did not disappoint the buffet style was lovely with a great choice and we had the upgraded cooked breakfast option, again staff very friendly and attentive, all of the staff are the friendliest and most attentive I have I ever known in any other hotel anywhere, from the porters as soon as you enter or leave, the check in staff, cleaners everyone, cannot recommend enough and we shall definitely be coming back ",5,2023,09,27

111,Perfect stay,My fiancé and I stayed here for my birthday and it was such a lovely experience! We’ve stayed at the Montcalm royal house quite a few times and they never disappoint! They upgraded our room and added fruit platter and Prosecco for us as part of the birthday experience and we really appreciated it! The staff are so lovely and always helpful. January helped us with everything and made our stay 10/10. Looking forward to staying there again soon!,5,2023,09,25

111,Superb ,"We stayed at the Montcalm for my wife's 50th birthday, the whole booking process was brilliant and the staff from the concierge to the front of house were fantastic, the welcome glass of prosecco was a nice touch also. Mary  from the events team went above and beyond to make the weekend extra special by preparing the room with balloons and petals, we were also able to leave our bags whilst we walked around London. The only issue was the  service at breakfast which fell short of expectations, we were overlooked for service and only on coffee arrived when too were ordered. Otherwise my new favourite hotel. ",5,2023,09,24
111,Birthday weekender,"Got out of the cab and was greeted by a welcomer who showed us to the concierge, the front desk was extremely helpful and when we were escorted to our room which had petals and birthday balloons on the bed.. very nice surprise and even had a Swedish massage.
The pool and sauna was great, the only thing that let it down was the restaurant was shut just before 10 and the bad weather meant we couldn’t sit outside which was part of the reason for booking the hotel, but besides that it was a nice experience",4,2023,09,23
111,First Class Service and a Warm Welcome,"Having stayed at this hotel on several occasions, my latest stay seemed different. The whole end to end experience stepped up a notch. From the warm welcome at the hotel entrance, I was escorted to the reception where I received an equally warm welcome.  Following an efficient check-in, I was delighted to find I had been allocated a room at the front of the hotel overlooking Finsbury Square. 
The room was spotless and shiny and (contrary to a past experience) all the electronics such as the touchpad for the room controls, worked perfectly. So often I am frustrated by hotels which have large wardrobes and only two hangers, but this one had a plentiful supply.
Within a few minutes, I received a call from reception to ask if I was happy with my room, which I was. This was really appreciated.
While at first I could hear some conversations from the bar below, (I wasn't sure of these were from some people at the from t of the hotel or the bar itself), these did not disturb me and I slept well in the comfortable and enormous bed.
Breakfast this time was at the rooftop restaurant area rather than the continental on the first floor. Again, I received a very warm welcome and the service was impeccable. The breakfast was of excellent quality and perfectly cooked. The young staff were a credit to the hotel.
Following previous stays, I have left this hotel just thinking I was yet another business customer passing through the doors. This time however, I left wondering whether I had been mistaken for a celebrity. Upon arrival at the office, I checked the mirror just in case, but decided that it was purely that the hotel currently has an excellent staff who care about its's customers on an individual basis. 
I already have a booking for December and am looking forward to returning.",5,2023,09,22
111,Quick stay at the Montcalm,"My recent stay at the Montcalm left a positive impression. Upon arrival, Mary at the reception provided a welcoming touch by preparing birthday amenities for our room, which was a thoughtful gesture. The quality of the room service breakfast, presentation, were commendable. It was a pleasant way to start the day during our visit. Visually The Aviary (hotel's restaurant dining area) provided a comfortable and refined atmosphere, enhancing the overall dining experience. In sum, Montcalm offers a commendable blend of hospitality and culinary quality, particularly when it comes to their breakfast offerings. I look forward to the possibility of returning for another visit.",5,2023,09,21
111,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is perfectly situated amongst a bustling dining and bar environment. Upon arrival, the team were helpful and attentive. I was originally assigned a room to which they quickly noticed would cause heating issues for us later, and was immediatley upgraded. However, I will state that the original room had certain discrepencies such as dirty curtains and wallpaper almost seemingly ripped off and not fully repaired. This was a Montcalm Club Double Room. A little concerning, considering the fact it is a 5 star hotel. I've seen other people comment on the state of their rooms needing immediate attention. Nonetheless, the new room assigned was wonderful! However I do hope that had I complained about the state of the first room that they would've moved us. Moreover, we had a lovely time using their pool. It's very lovely in there. You do have to book a spot as it is small and they manage how packed it gets in there. These can go quick depending on the time of day. Regardless, very nice facilities. If you book a Montcalm Club room, you get a free breakfast buffet down by the lobby. This was a very bland range of food, from a few fruit, yogurt, toast, ham and cheese. It was a little chaotic in there with limited staff and their inability to manage it all. I would say either order to your room from their other menu, which you'll be charged for or go out and get a GOOD breakfast. Their rooftop bar is also great! You can ring prior for them to decorate the room with a few petals and little black, yellow balloons if it's a special occasion, as well as more for an extra price. Ring up before if you'd like a nice view, they may be able to do this for you if there's a room available. Honestly, ring up and ask for specifics so you can get as close to what you want. There are a variety of rooms. It is a lovely hotel with lovely and helpful staff that will be as accommodating as possible, just few minor changes to really make for their 5* claims. I would visit again, but manage my expectations regarding what they offer as a ""5* hotel"" in London. ",4,2023,09,20
111,Our saviour!,"So I booked the hotel via wowcher, but there was a technical glitch when I booked, which meant I had wasted all the money I had spent on it. Wowcher we’re no help, I emailed to tell them there had been a glitch in their system, and they just told me they couldn’t do anything to help, so instead I rang the hotel and begged for help, and Dinesh M, working in reservations, was our saviour! He sorted it all out for us, and I am so so grateful! Thank you Dinesh! 
So although we haven’t been yet, I can see that the staff are clearly very kind and will do anything to help!",5,2023,09,20
111,Simply amazing,"It was my boyfriends birthday, and from check in to check out the whole experience was lovely. January the manager took lovely care off us and made sure the room was prepped with balloons and extra xx",5,2023,09,19
111,What a treat!,"From the doormen, to Daniel and Vladimir (concierges), to Karl & Liz in the club lounge, we were blown away by their attentiveness and professionalism! I visited London years ago and stayed at The Sheraton Park Lane in Mayfair. The Park Lane was beautiful and posh…and expensive. We’re having a better experience here at the Montcalm *plus* it’s in a better location and at the lower $ end of the 5-star hotel experience. We stayed in a club-level room and the king-size bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The pillow menu was a nice touch, too. We’ll definitely stay here again when we next visit London.",5,2023,09,18
111,January!!! Is the best Amazing hotel and staff,"What a great weekend we had for our mums 65th Birthday. A special thank you the the host January who accommodated all my requests to make my mums stay at the hotel an amazing 5star experience and she did not disappoint going the extra mile with absolutely everything, from birthday decorations in the room, with complimentary drinks and chocolates and a special hot breakfast at the Aviary. 
This is a fantastic hotel suited for families couples and friends whether your exploring London or just want to relax. We were greeted with Prosecco and juice and our bags were taken to the room whilst we explored the hotel.  We were invited to have complimentary snacks at the lobby and then we were on the roof top terrace having cocktails before we got ready to go out for the evening. We are already arranging to go back around xmas and I really want to use the wellness facilities this time as we hadn’t factored time for it this time. 
This will definitely be our go to hotel when we come to London. Amazing staff, facilities and environment. They made us feel like royalty and met all our needs. An amazing 5 star hotel experience from beginning to end. Thank you 🙏🏽 ",5,2023,09,18
111,Amazing hotel amazing team,"We have just had the most amazing stay at the Montcalm. The hotel itself is lovely with clean and spacious rooms, a great selection of bars and fantastic location. What really made our trip was the fantastic and friendly service we received from every single member of staff but especially Mary! Check in was a lovely experience, with a glass of Prosecco and lots of help with bags. We were asked if we were staying for a special occasion and told the lady checking us in we were getting married the next day. When we returned from our wedding our room had been decorated and a lovely bottle of Prosecco left which was the perfect and unexpected end to our amazing day. Thank you Mary and all the team at the Montcalm! We will be back! ",5,2023,09,18
111,A special birthday stay,"This was booked as a surprise birthday treat and it did not disappoint! Mary welcomed us on arrival and showed us to our room, which was lovely and had been decorated with balloons. A wonderful touch! The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with everything we needed. We enjoyed a drink on the glorious rooftop terrace and a relaxing swim in the beautiful spa and all the staff we dealt with were friendly, polite and helpful. We would be happy to return.",5,2023,09,18

111,The greatest concierge team ,"Montcalm- Royal London House is truly an outstanding and comfortable hotel! However, the real stars is the concierge. From the moment you arrive, they make you feel at home. From the great conversations in passing, the desire to make sure all your needs are met, and their expertise in their job- THEY ARE STELLAR! I’ll always remember Dhouv’s sweet pleasant aura as he provided advice about places to go and just providing overall assistance throughout my day! Thank you all for making my first trip to London pleasant! Give them all a big raise! ",4,2023,09,13
111,Best night manager! VIP treatment,"I stayed at the Mont Calm London house and it was absolutely a retreat. I booked a room but I got free upgrade to the massive family suite! All the VIP treatment was given to me by the real man of the show who was their Night Manager Mr.Khay!! He was extremely accommodating and made sure I feel spoiled and pamper!! Not to mention I was warmly welcomed by wine and a fruit platter. Khaye also added complimentary breakfast for me at the rooftop Aviary restaurant for all mornings of my stay! 
Even his team was amazing and took great care of me after downing too much wine! 
Eddie, Waris, Florian etc all of Khaye’s dream team! Will definitely come back for Christmas!! ",5,2023,09,13
111,5 Star Experience,"Had a wonderful stay at The Montcalm Royal London House for my Partner and I’s Anniversary. Was Welcomed by Mary (Assistant Guest Experience Manager) , a wonderful Host who decided upgraded our room as it was a special occasion. We both were made to feel very welcome. All of the staff were kind and hospitable.

The room was perfect and the Spa Section downstairs was incredibly relaxing. The only slight misfortune was that we could only book a half hour slot which we felt wasn’t long enough to enjoy all the facilities and the steam room wasn’t available due to ongoing maintenance. Hopefully next time it’s open as we were looking forward to spending time there. 

That should not take away from the rest of our experience which was superb. Thank you to everyone at the hotel and we look forward to coming back soon!",5,2023,09,13
111,Great hotel in a great location,"My wife recently treated me to a stay here for my birthday, whilst visiting London. All of the staff were really friendly and attentive, especially Mary the Guest Manager, super helpful and friendly. She even showed us to our room which had been decorated with birthday balloons and petals and some complimentary macarons which were yummy. We didn't get chance to use the spa, but would definitely come back again and make time next time! ",5,2023,09,11
111,Beautiful Stay,"We had such a lovley stay as always, the staff really went the extra mile to ensure we had a nice experiance.
Mary was so lovley and looked after us.
We stayed for our aniversary and they decorated the room for us",5,2023,09,11
111,Best birthday ever,"I came to the Montcalm for my birthday with a friend. 
Upon arrival we was greeted by the doorman who assisted us with our bags, Olivia at reception was very accommodating and welcoming. 
Mary the guest experience manager who greeted us and took us up to our lovely room which they had decorated for me which was very touching. 
She went out of her way to make us feel welcome and help us with anything we needed. 
She helped us book our spa visit and travel arrangements for later that evening. 
The spa was fab and very relaxing which a wide range of treatments. 
The room was stocked with lots of minibar treats and the bed was so comfy! 
The next day on check out Mary met with us again and ask how our night was. 
Mary thank you so much for all your help and welcoming us! 
I shall defo be visiting again soon! 
Thank you for a lovely birthday! ",5,2023,09,10
111,Wonderful birthday stay!,"We have just returned from a one night stay here. We arrived early for check in and was advised our room wasn’t ready but we were given a glass of Prosecco whilst we waited. The room was ready 30mins later than originally advised but we didn’t mind waiting as by this time we were on our third glass of complimentary Prosecco! 
Mary, the assistant guest experience manager was very apologetic about the wait and escorted us to our room, wished me a happy birthday and was very welcoming. 
The room was decorated for my birthday which was a lovely gesture. There were signs of wear and tear (marks on the walls and a bedside drawer which wouldn’t close) but this was minor. 
When we went out for dinner, the doorman efficiently called a taxi for us, asked us to take a seat at the bar and alerted us when it arrived. 
Cocktails at the bar in reception were fab! We went up to the Aviary on the 10th floor to have a look at the views (about 4pm) but it was packed, I would suggest booking in advance if you’d like a table there. It was a shame because I would have loved to have spent some time admiring the views but I think many people book here who aren’t staying at the hotel because it’s such a beautiful spot. 
We didn’t use the spa facilities but they look lovely, perhaps another time!
Room service breakfast was impeccable. Service was fast and the food was hot. We both had the full English and I appreciated that the choice of bread included sourdough. 
Check out was swift and Mary even came out to ask about our stay. She asked if we had any suggestions or feedback, I thought this was brilliant, she was not shying away from any potential negative feedback but actually we had nothing negative to say. Our stay was lovely. We’ve stayed at other Montcalm hotels and would happily return to this one. Thankyou Mary and team, keep up the great customer service! :) ",5,2023,09,10
111,Great Birthday..!,I had a really great time.  It was for my birthday and the hotel decorated the room for me which was a fabulous surprise.  The staff were very attentive and made me feel very special. Thank you all for making my birthday very special ,4,2023,09,09

111,"Amazing experience at the Montcalm! Special mention to Mary, Waris and Rob from breakfast","Amazing experience at the Montcalm! Incredibly warm and welcoming staff really made it a special experience for me and my daughter, nothing was too much to ask and they really went the extra mile! A special mention to Mary the manager for her customer focused approach that echos down throughout her staff, Waris from reception who is a breath of fresh air and sharp as they come in dealing with any requests, last but not least Rob and the team from breakfast….the breakfast dining experience in the aviary is not to be missed and you’d be hard pressed to find a better breakfast with a view in the heart of London. This combined with a spacious and comfortable room and leisure facilities makes the Montcalm our go to when visiting London, we will definitely be back soon. Adam Davis",5,2023,09,07
111,Truly memorable ,"Where do I begin, knowing from previous experiences that the Montcalm chain of hotel's are simply very good at what they do I decided to book the Montcalm Royal London House for my partner's birthday. Upon arrival the concierge couldn't do enough to get us up to our room. While unloading our baggage a traffic warden tried to write us a ticket which conceirge immediately rebuffed and allowed us time to move our car. Once at reception ""Lamine"" who greeted us was extremely warm, friendly and welcoming. Once he realised that we were there as a birthday treat we were immediately upgraded to  better room and with complementary breakfast the following morning at ""The Aviary"" roof top bar and restaurant. He simply couldn't do enough for us. That evening we visited the rooftop bar and once again were greeted by wonderful staff and excellent service. That evening we were unable to work out our air-conditioning system and so we were immediately accompanied to our room by a member of the team who swiftly showed us what to do. The following morning we went for breakfast at the rooftop and again were greeted by the wonderful Justyna who manages the rooftop and again her and her entire team couldn't do enough for us. Once they learned we were there for a birthday we were treated to free champagne and a birthday cake, they simply couldn't do enough. At this point we were visited by the hotel manager Camelia who extended hour check out time from 12 noon to 3pm completely free of charge to help accommodate our birthday plans. During all this we need help with our parking etc and concierge just couldn't do enough to help us. All in all I would like to thank Camellia, Justyna, Lamine, Vlad, Bargo, Ajo and Amal. You made our stay just effortless and we won't be staying anywhere else when visiting London. Finally we were greeted by the manger upon checkout just to make sure if we needed anything and then again by guest services. You run a beautiful hotel with an incredible team. Thank you, thank you and thank you.",5,2023,09,06
111,Great with some caveats,"In terms of the staff, this is a five star experience. Nothing was too much bother. 

The room was a little worn and needed some care in terms of the furniture and furnishings. We requested a room with a tub and we got that. Well worth it if you like to take a bath. Our trade off was no view however. The digital interface and phone never worked quite right. But the bed was perfect and huge for a London hotel. Essentially a 4 star room. It was just a bit corporate and tired. Limited mini bar. No microwave. Maybe I’m too used to American hotels. 

The location is good in that you’re close to a late night Tesco, Pret, M&S, Boots and many restaurants. Be aware at the weekend it’s empty and most places are closed because it’s not working hours for the City. We stayed 7 nights and the location was very functional for this. Got the Elizabeth line back to Heathrow airport. 

Overall enjoyable and a good choice. Not quite as amazing as I expected tho.",4,2023,09,06
111,Amazing Experience,"Just wanted to say a big thank you to the team at the Montcalm Hotel London for an amazing stay. Special shout out to Lamine for the great service and hospitality and also to Mary the customer experience manager for making sure all of our needs were taken care of. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be returning in the future. ",5,2023,09,06
111,Amazing! Can’t wait to return,"My boyfriend and I had treated ourselves to a nice weekend child free away for our 4 year anniversary. Unknown to me, my boyfriend had planned a proposal!!! Whilst I nipped to the toilet he sneakily managed to speak to the manager Mary who very kindly made our engagement that little more special. On our return from the proposal we had rose petals, Prosecco and balloons in our room. It was such a lovely touch and very much appreciated! It definitely made our stay! 
We spent lots of time relaxing in the spa which was amazing. From the moment we arrived to time we checked out, the staff were attentive, helpful and more than happy to help. Very impressed and will be returning ASAP. 

Thank you Mary and your wonderful team!! 

See you soon,
Annemarie & Ryan ",5,2023,09,05
111,"One of the best hotels we’ve been to in London, highly recommend when coming to Shoreditch!","I cannot fault this Hotel one bit, It is our second time staying here within the year and each time we have received the best service. The staff are beyond brilliant, they have looked after us the moment we arrived to the moment we were walking out the door to leave, I almost didn’t want to leave I love it here so much. The staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is as perfect as they can make it, very professional and most of all very kind. Florin was most kind to me and my partner, very welcoming and chatty, also very good at his job. The reception staff also were very respectful and helpful, you can see all the staff do their best for the hotel and the guests. 
I want to thank everyone for making our stay a memorable one. No doubt we will be back again for another visit. P.s. the location is perfect as a lot of sociable things to do nearby. Box park, bars, restaurants, junkyard golf etc. For parking, the hotel offer a car park to park in as the nearby ones are not very safe. It’s around a 10 minute walk but it’s the safest one to park in. 
Overall, would highly recommend this hotel when coming to Shoreditch, you will not be disappointed!",5,2023,09,03
111,Exceptional Hotel,"Just got back from a weekend stay and couldn’t fault it. The customer service we received from Mary and the rest of the team was 10/10. The rooms were modern, with lots of extras that made the stay even more comfortable, including USB ports and under floor heating in the bathroom. We had the chance to go up to the Aviary which had stunning views of London and a wide range of drinks. Looking forward to booking another stay. ",5,2023,09,03
111,"Great hotel, great location and staff that make the stay even better!","I stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House while I hosted an event at Aviary, the rooftop restaurant and bar. The hotel itself has clean and pleasant rooms, great facilities and is located centrally in London near several transport links. The best part about this hotel is the customer service and staff - they go above and beyond at check in, check out and everything in between. The service is second to none and I will definitely be returning as the experience makes you feel like you are in a second home. A special mention to Mary Philippiah and the reception staff who were helpful and accommodating during our stay.",5,2023,09,03
111,Returning guests for a reason :),"We always stay here when it comes to a milestone in our life. Whether that be a proposal, pregnancy or a birthday. And the reasons behind this is not just a gorgeous hotel but extreme gratitude to the level of service from first class staff. First and foremost, Mary in guest experiences has always been on hand to cater to our every need and handles surprises very well- she is amazing. Thank you to Mohin and Drew for helping to set up everything also. A HUGE thank you to Andrea & Louis in the Aviary restaurant who went above and beyond to cater to my pregnancy needs and delivered a great service with a professional, yet friendly attitude. See you all very soon Montcalm team- it wouldn’t be as fabulous without you guys :)",5,2023,09,02

111,"Great staff, excellent service","We had a very good time with our family in The Montcalm in London. The staff is very professional, kind and helpful. Daniel did a great job organizing a private chauffeur for the whole day and arranging all our restaurant bookings. Thank you.",5,2023,09,02
111,Unreal stay!,"Our stay at the Montcalm was absolutely unreal. It was our 5th anniversary together and I added a small comment when booking the room to see if they could do anything special for us. I wasn’t expecting anything to come from this special request but wow did they exceed our expectations! They set up anniversary and love heart balloons, as well as rose petals on the bed and complimentary macaroons. It was such a lovely touch and really elevated our experience. 
The spa was gorgeous, especially the hot tub I would highly recommend!
Also, the room service was amazing and they got every detail right on our order. 
I would 100% stay here again and I feel that it was very reasonably priced at only £207 for 1 night in a 5 star hotel. This staff at the hotel couldn’t have done enough for us, it was amazing! ",5,2023,09,02
111,Mini moon and was perfect,"We got married and went to London for a few days. I actually booked a more expensive hotel (4 nights) 1500 . But looking and reviewing I came across this . 850 for 4 nights. Spa pool . Roof top bar ! A real place to be . Sun was shinning we were sat looking over the city of London with beautiful cocktails. There not cheap there’s a cost for these views!!!! Mary made our visit excellent . I asked for champagne in the room which was there on arrival with balloons and flowers . Laurent Perrier £60 a bottle in a London hotel ? Cheap !! 
Receptionist told us we had a open or free bar every evening 5:30-8:30pm. This was fantastic everything free and drink as much as u want .I’m not sure everyone gets this but if your there to party I suggest to get this package as upstairs at the roof bar a double sapphire was 20 quid . But free at this bar . The only thing we we’re disappointed with was the breakfast we thought we had full breakfasts but was told we had continental only. 
The continental was pretty boring with toast pastries cheese and 2 types of meats . Orange juice ( not pure ) tea and coffee. We asked for a upgrade but wanted £25pp this was to much we thought. 

Room service was quick and great . 
The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard . Mary was fantastic but all staff were. I would return here without a shadow of a doubt . But make sure u get the full breakfast , and the open bar 5:30-8:30. 
Thanks for a great mini honeymoon you guys",5,2023,08,31
111,Great experience at Montcalm Royal House Hotel,"Moin and Karlheinz served me at Montcalm Royal House hotel. They gave me a warm welcome, very respectful and were swift to deliver my order. They made sure I am comfortable and I was extremely satisfied. ",5,2023,08,31
111,Fabulous ,I had such an amazing experience. Checked in late and was upgraded to a junior suite which was just fabulous. My own private rooftop terrace with amazing views. The room was so comfortable and well equipped. The rooftop bar was beautiful and the room service meal was very tasty. The staff were attentive without being over the top. I absolutely love this hotel and wish I could have stayed longer to make use of all it has to offer. ,5,2023,08,31
111,False Start,"Stayed a night for work purposes. on check in I had a half hour before having to be at a cinema performance. 

the room I was allocated was overheated and the air con couldn't easily be adjusted. the tv also didn't work when I got in the room. Reception called Maintenance to attend, they couldn't fix it so I was moved - the night managers were very attentive but it was going to take to long so I had to leave not having checked into a room. I returned at midnight and went to my new room, it was on the 9th floor and presumably an upgraded room. the windows looked out onto a bar terrace that was empty, had it been in operation that would have been too noisy and intrusive if you were in the room.

would try again, it's a v busy hotel for sure. the staff were nice and all trying to keep guests happy.",4,2023,08,31
111,Very special birthday stay,"What a wonderful hotel! We were lucky enough to be given an upgraded room to help us celebrate my husbands birthday over the weekend. Mary who was the Duty Manager was extremely welcoming and escorted us to our room which had been decorated by the team there with balloons and petals. A lovely touch and very memorable. 

We also loved the rooftop bar for drinks before heading out for dinner. Can’t wait to go back!",5,2023,08,30

111,Just fabulous from beginning to end!,"From the moment we walked into the hotel and up until the moment we left, we felt extremely well looked after and were delighted to be able to luxuriate in the beautiful design and surroundings of the hotel.  The staff are extremely friendly and so helpful and our special thanks go to Mary Philippiah who made our experience that extra bit special ensuring my daughter had a wonderful start to her 30th birthday celebrations.  Our room was beautiful with all mod cons and had been decorated, with balloons etc, especially for my daughter.  The bed was extremely comfortable with extra comfortable pillows and bedding.  The bathroom was super modern and luxurious with the added pleasure of underfloor heating.  Everything was very modern but very comfortable and we absolutely loved our stay and cannot wait to go back again!  Thank you so much Montcalm and Mary and your wonderful staff.",5,2023,08,29
111,"Flawless, amazing stay and would happily book again!","I booked a one nights stay with the hotel and it was flawless from start to finish. Me and my partner thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the service and would happily book again. A special mention to Francesca on reception for being so helpful at check in and at certain instances throughout the day. However , the star of the show would be Mary, the guest experience manager who ensured we had a the best stay possible. I had planned a proposal in our hotel room and Mary was both attentive and incredibly helpful/kind in arranging this for us and it was perfect to say the least. Would happily return and thank you so much Mary and Francesca!",5,2023,08,29
111,First class ,"Really wonderful staff, couldn't do enough for us. (Mary and her colleague on reception). The room was very good and the bed was very comfortable. We took advantage of the daily free spa session so started each day with a swim and a sauna. Absolutely first-class in every area. ",5,2023,08,29
111,"Fantastic, stay & hotel ","From the beginning to the end of our 2 night stay was fantastic. The check in was quick & efficient. We were met by Mary after checking in (customer exp manager) who welcomed us and took us to our room. They had decorated it with rose petals and balloons for our anniversary as well as a card and macaroons. The room was super modern & comfy. If I was to give a negative, the net curtains in the room were old, dirty & a hole in. They were very out of place in the otherwise super modern room.  Had drinks in Avery Bar in the eve, was very pricey and the pint was 3/4 of a pint. Tables a bit crammed in as well but otherwise great atmosphere & views. Breakfast was good, the buffer breakfast was OK, was streaky bacon which I don't like but others do, the egg wad a bit like porridge texture and beans luke warm. However I then ordered the Advacardo on toast which was made to order & delicious.  Staff all very polite and friendly in at breakfast. The bar downstairs was a great atmosphere on the Saturday night. There are Bell boys all suited and booted, top hat an all  :) Mary came to see us on departure to see if we had a nice stay and to say bye. The location is great as not in the middle of London so not as busy. You can walk to Tower Bridge within about 20 mins or so, walking distance from Tower of London & London Dungeons. I cannot wait to return. ",5,2023,08,28

Came down to london to celebrate my partners birthday, and was surprised with a few balloons and rose petals within our room. The room itself is so lovely with the most comfiest bed, and floor heating within the bathroom. Location is close to everything in london. The following morning we had a lovely time in the spa facilities, as well as a super tasty breakfast. Potentially the best breakfast I’ve had at any hotel! Thank you once again to Mary who escorted us to our room! X",5,2023,08,28

111,Comfortable,"Stayed at this hotel for one night in august, hotel was easy to find and was greeted with champagne whilst we was checking in, checkin was quick (properly a couple minutes) when arrived at room, the room was clean, homely and spacious, The bed was very big and comfy. 
We only wish the communication was a tiny bit better since when checking in we was told to call down to the spa to book our 30 minute complementary visit in advance, we tried numerous time to reach the spa and no one was answering, we had to go to the desk which then got sent down to the spa to book a time, the spa made us aware that we would receive robes and flip flops that would have to be worn down to the pool. When back at the room we received only robes which then we tried to call the spa again to make them aware we had no flip flops. So then we had to go all the way back down to ask about flip flops, to which they said that we have slippers in our room that we wear down to the pool. This was a small miscommunication but made our experience a little stressful in the moment. 
Over all our experience was relaxing, peaceful and comfortable. And we would definitely think about returning again! X",5,2023,08,26
111,Great Guest Experience team,"The hotel provided an excellent bespoke service when I wanted to add a little something to a special trip for a friend.

111,Great for the city,"Good hotel, loved the roof top terrace, drinks a little pricey. Room slightly on the warm side. Air con had to be kept on.   Good toiletries but the advertised bathrobes were not in room. Requested but never delivered. Can't comment on spa as did not use. 
 Reception staff very helpful, especially Claudia.  Will stay again. ",5,2023,08,25
111,Staff are truly something special,"We have nothing but praise regarding our two week stay at the Montcalm. Our suite was perfect for our extended stay - the temperature can be controlled to suit individuals, beds so so comfy, no traffic or city noise and the occasional bottle of wine or tray of macarons a welcomed treat. Above all our high commendation is to all the staff that we met and we do mean all. They were truly genuine, warm and welcoming in conversation and requests were either anticipated or kindly assisted with. It was our first time to London and we have nothing but high praise and gratitude to Daniel, Claudia, Mary, Ian (reservations) the wonderful people in the lounge access and all the staff for making our holiday that something extra special. We will always fondly remember our time spent with you.

Special thanks to Mary, although i never got to meet her until departure, she made sure my special decorative request was met and made to room look very nice which again my partner really loved and was grateful for.

Before our stay was over we were already itching to come back as we didn't fully explore all the facilities of the hotel but will make sure to do so next time especially with the kids.

From the start we were met by a polite gentleman that took our bags and then handed a rose flavoured Prosecco whilst waiting to check in. The manager Mary then showed us to our room and the hotel staff hand kindly placed balloons and rose petals on the bed. The rooftop bar was stunning, the downstairs bar, the bed and pillows were so comfortable and the underfloor heating in the bathroom unreal. The icing on the cake was the mood lights around the bed. Everyone was so friendly we didn’t get to experience all of the hotel (spa,gym , food) so we will be back :)",5,2023,08,21

Excellent service. really nice rooms, comfy bed. Quiet at night.

We ate in the roof top bar which, whilst serving good food, needs to consider if it is a restaurant or a bar, the area was far too loud for a couple having a meal whilst it is hosting a 30th birthday party in the shared bar area.
The hotel overall is a people place, it's staff are it's strength, thank you for a great time.",4,2023,08,18
111,Our new favourite hotel!,"Myself and my partner had the most wonderful stay at the Montcalm Royal London City, celebrating my 22nd Birthday and our anniversary 🤍

We have stayed in various hotels across London City, and without a doubt, this was our favourite!

Before arriving, my partner spoke with the hotel about our upcoming booking and celebrations. Upon arrival, we were greeted and made very welcome, escorted to our room by the lovely manager Mary, who could not have been more helpful and kind! 
The room was beautiful, impeccably clean, and decorated with balloons and a complimentary bottle of wine for our celebration.

The staff at the hotel are extremely helpful, at all hours, and just so kind and cheerful. This was such a highlight for us throughout our stay, as though an additional element it really can transform the experience. Daniel, Head Concierge, was very kind and helpful throughout our trip too.

Thank you to the staff for a wonderful experience and for making our celebration so wonderful. We very much look forward to staying at the Montcalm again soon!",5,2023,08,17
111,Great stay,Myself and my friend visited last weekend and had an amazing time. The service from door to desk from the moment we walked in was fabulous! I can't remember everyone's names but thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Was one of the nicest hotels i've stayed in. I was celebrating my birthday and loved the truffles we received in our room. I didn't get to enjoy the facilities of the hotel but I will definitely return. It was lovely to meet the manager Mary as I was leaving. Fantastic hospitality and service all round. ,5,2023,08,17
111,"TREMENDOUS HOTEL in the center of London.  Attentive Staff, Great Value, Great Spa",London is expensive and hotels rooms are small.  The Montcalm was perfect.  Good size room and reasonably priced.  The Staff and the Attentive service was what made this hotel stand out for me.  The Spa (although smallish) was very well run and relaxing.  Breakfast was great and the Aviary roofbar was wonderful in the sun,5,2023,08,17
111,A night at the Montcalm Royal London House ,"The hotel gets five stars for exceptional service from start to finish. We were greeted at the door and our bags were taken into the hotel. Registration was seamless.  We were walking distance to the Barbican where we would be attending a performance. Upon arrival they provided up with a refreshing beverage. Our rooms were modern with the right amount of amenities and plugs. If you book directly with the hotel, you can select the types of pillows you wish to sleep on. The fragrance you want in the room, and a few other subtle perks. These options are not available on third party sites. We stayed in room 816  which had a large bathroom. the room itself was perfectly designed and maximized the space. I like the quirky option of colored lights around the bed.  The Avery restaurant is on the top floor of the hotel and a pub is on the ground floor. On a Rainy day you could opt to stay indoors and still have a fine time.  The hotel was located near the tube, near mass transit, easy to find, across the street from a park, and had a large drop off and pick up area. I would stay here again. I had one small issue and the manager Alberto responded immediately to my concern which I am confident will be addressed in the future. I would stay here again without reservation.  We walked to the Barbican which was about 10 minutes away and walked back.  We felt comfortable walking at night after 10PM. ",5,2023,08,17
111,"Comfortable, with great service","We had the most amazing experience at the Montcalm and would stay there again without hesitation.  Everything--the spacious rooms, the food, the spa, the service--exceeded our expectations!

The location is convenient to both train and Underground stations, and the hotel is a moderate walk to some of The City's sites (St. Paul's, etc). 

The staff are very accommodating of families, and they went out of their way to make our visit perfect.",5,2023,08,16
111,Club lounge service and doormen were excellent ,"The club lounge service was lovely. Moin was so friendly and professional and even remembered my favourite drink from my brief visit the evening before. Thanks to him and Pruthvish, I felt like a cherished guest. As well, the doormen at the hotel are so kind, helpful and cheerful. ",5,2023,08,16
111,Club Lounge ,"At my arrival I discovered I had a complimentary drink at the lounge and Moin and Dixit where very kind and on point. I absolutely liked the experience. The ambience, the music and the Prosecco! The music had the perfect volume so I could also read while enjoying my drink.",5,2023,08,15
111,5* service - would definitely recommend for couples,"My husband and I stayed for 1 night at Montcalm at absolutely loved it. From beginning to end the staff were amazing - very welcoming, attentive and sooo helpful. Nothing was a problem and I felt everyone went over and above to help us enjoy our stay. The complimentary 30minutes in the spa was great - we went at 8pm on first night and 10:30am on the morning we were leaving and spaces werent too busy. The rooms are lovely, lots of amenities and the bed is just heavenly. Bhargav took us to our room and gave us a little tour which was VERY helpful and we were very appreciative. The underfloor heating in the bathroom A*! Breakfast at the Avery was beautiful and lots of choices which was great. The fresh mint tea with lemon was a nice touch. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would like to thank Maria, Francesca and Bhargav for their great service, as well as Nibedita who was excellent and made our anniversary stay extra special.",5,2023,08,15
111,Amazing experience,We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Montcalm Royal London House for my partner's birthday celebrations. I had been liaising with January who kindly arranged balloons and rose petals for us. Lovely spa and amazing hot stone massage!,5,2023,08,15
111,In the heart of the City of London,"Great location near the Liverpool station. The hotel looks chic and elegant. Restaurant / bar at the top floor is amazing. Staff is friendly and attentive. 

Breakfast is good, but the selection is very poor (typical English breakfast, nothing else basically). 

Rooms are okay, but very small.",4,2023,08,14
111,Beautiful experience ,"Our visit was a special  celebration  and the staff especially Mary ensured we have an amazing experience and it was exactly 💯 satisfactory. 
Our room was beautifully decorated with welcome drinks. 
Breakfast was absolutely fabulous and the room was very clean and smelled good too.

Thank you for a wonderful experience.
",5,2023,08,14
111,Good Location to get around in and out of the city and lovely staff and hotel,A massive thank you to January you went all out to make our room feel very romantic for our anniversary celebrations you and the staff made our few nights stay feel very special and welcoming we will definitely be coming back. The rooms are very good size for standard rooms and the rooftop bar is a must very nice setup with delicious food and cocktails. We also enjoyed using the spa and pool area. Overall lovely hotel and hospitality will definitely be a returning guest,5,2023,08,13
111,Bad trip,"It was all pretty pictures with five star price but the hotel was really bad. 
It was dark with only dirty corners.
Our room was not nice with view onto the backyard, really loud due to machine noise and the windows in the bathroom were darkened by some white foil. 
Ugly combination of shower and tub and yellow dirt in all the corners, water spots on the floor and door at arrival and the overall charm of a trainstation bathroom.
One shower gel for 3 people, never mind but really cheap gesture. Same piece of plastic from previous guest 3 days below a chair. Light switch next to the bed only, but while we were out someone from the hotel entered only to darken the room and close the curtains. Every day. first of all, creepy. Second, daily challenge was to find the switch. This was called „junior suite“. 

You can’t change the rules, no kids under 8 allowed at the pool („you booked on expedia, you should read what’s written there“), so i went by myself for exactly 5 minutes. You need to book your 30 minutes timeslot (really?!) in advance. You must change in your room into a bathrobe. You won’t find bathrobes in your room, but have to order them. Poolwater was cloudy, area not clean, yellow prints on white pillows all over. Dirty corners once again.

breakfast was definitely not five star worthy either and despite „fresh“ fruits ( plenty of brown strawberries and supersoft blueberries) ot a lot healthy options, no egg, no vegetables, very limited options. Yes, of course one can order extras at another restaurant but if you have breakfast included that’s not what you want.
Staff was „polite“ but talking to eachother badly about guests, seemed to have nose up high. 
We ordered for our son at the rooftop restaurant  3 scoops of icecream and he got simply 3 scoops of icecream in a white bowl. nothing wrong with that but not lovely either. And apropo rooftop and child, the child is allowed only in the dining area. ok again, it‘s the rule but: the more quiet outside terrace is bar area and the inside area with the loud music and view to the hard alcohol in the bar, that’s the dining area. Tipped the waitress there 5£ for 20£ bill and witnessed how she complained about it to her collegue. 
At the check out i asked for a receipt and she wouldn’t give me one, simply said no, she’d send it via mail, never got the mail. 
In summary, i‘d never go there again nor recommend it to anybody.",1,2023,08,13
111,Attentive and Efficient Personalised Experience,"From the moment of arrival, through check-in to the room itself, our experience of The Montcalm RLH was perfect. The staff, both Concierge and Front of house were attentive and efficient, nothing was too much trouble.  We were celebrating a wedding anniversary and Mary ensured our room was decorated beautifully, it was a wonderful surprise that we had not expected. Mary made a point of personally welcoming and congratulating us, both on arrival and upon our departure. The room was lovely, nice double size rain shower, underfloor heating, mood lighting and a very comfortable bed. This hotel was a little more expensive than our usual stays, but we wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again, especially for an occasion. We thoroughly recommend it. ",5,2023,08,13
111,Birthday away at Montcalm Royal London House,"I had an amazing stay at Montcalm Royal. Upon arrival I told the guest experience manager (January) that it was my birthday and to my surprise she arranged for a complimentary bottle of wine and balloons to be set up in my room. January and the rest of the staff were very professional, very welcoming and provided excellent service throughout my stay. Not to mention the leisure facilities were also very relaxing. I will definitely be returning in the near future. ",5,2023,08,13
111,Fantastic stay in Central London,"We visited this hotel in July for my Wife’s birthday. Checking in the reception staff were friendly and Mary the Manager also welcomed us to the hotel then took us up to our room which had been decorated with balloons and some chocolates put out which was a great touch. 

The hotel and room was clean and has a bar at the top of the hotel along with outside seating with great views over the city. The only bad point was the service charge on drinks despite sitting at the bar.

The hotel is in a great location and about 5 minutes from the nearest tube. We would definitely come back.",5,2023,08,13
111,Poor experience. Not 5 star.,"Very far from being 5 star. Had to queue to check in. Given an accessible room for no reason and no explanation. Only allowed 30 minutes in the spa which is barely time to get changed and then changed again, and at a time not suitable for us. Room had filthy windows, stained net curtains (yes net curtains!) rips in the headboard and otherwise completely uninspiring. Breakfast was the worst breakfast I’ve had at a hotel and then was chased to pay immediately rather than add the cost to the room (who takes their cards with them to breakfast in a hotel?). They advertise 50% off parking at the NCP but then knew nothing about it, despite written comments from front of house and no one even bothered to ask us how our stay was, hence voicing my opinion on TripAdvisor.",1,2023,08,13
111,Just perfect 5 star experience,"A perfect stay. A gorgeous hotel, made to feel special from start to finish. Mary on reception was fabulous arranging the room to be ready for my husbands birthday with wine, ballons and rose petals.
The staff here are immaculate, all excelling in their jobs. Mary and the manager even remembered our names!!
The rooms are stunning, the facilities are incredible.
We will definitely be back.",5,2023,08,12
111,Beautiful hotel and staff,"Everyone made us feel so welcome we Gad the most pleasant stay. 
Mary the manger was so kind and thoughtful to the children. 
The team could not do enough for us. 
Fantastic breakfast, beautiful and clean room, especially the bathroom and toiletries. 
Could not recommend enough!!!",5,2023,08,11
111,A peice of Heaven in London,What an amazing  hotel 5 star all the way from friendly  door staff welcoming smiles and all day welcome as you arrive and leavecthe hotel.  To the fantastic  reception  staff handling  all your needs and enquiries. CARMEN ON RECEPTION was a joy to meet and looked after me and my son from vheck in to REASTAURANT bookings sorted breakfast  and was a joy to meet. The Roof top REASTAURANT  is stunning fantastic  food amazing views and zgain friendly  staff and in morning  one of the best breakfast  ive had in London. Room was perfect  fantastic  sleep bed so comfortable and shower omg best ever. We will be back.,5,2023,08,10
111,Great home from home for business travellers,"Fantastic ‘home from home’ for a business traveller. The team is friendly and attentive, the rooms are well appointed (that early Teams morning call with the other side of the world can be completed from your room with no Wi-Fi issues) and the hotel is blissfully quiet. All this makes me a ‘frequent flyer’ with The Royal London. ",5,2023,08,10
111,A couples trip to London to celebrate our 8th Wedding anniversary.,"Me and my wife recently stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House when visiting London to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. I had mentioned in my booking that it was our wedding anniversary and the staff at the Montcalm were just incredible, they had decorated our room with balloons and petals and left some tasty macaroons for us to enjoy.
All of the staff were extremely accommodating and friendly greeting us on entry and happily agreeing to store our bags for us so we could continue our day in London. When we returned in the evening, we had a lovely drink in the Long Arm Pub situated at the rear of the hotel where we played a giant game of connect four then retired to our room. Unfortunately, there was an event on the terrace bar but that just gives us more to do on our next visit! The next day we spent some time in the spa before making our way back out for another day in the city, the concierge once again took our bags for us, I brought a delicious coffee from the Burdock Cafe on our way out which I also recommend! On our return to the hotel for our bags we were greeted by Mary Philippiah the Assistant Guest Experience Manager who wanted to check we had had a good stay and like all of the other staff in the hotel was extremely welcoming and polite. All in all, our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House was fantastic the location, cleanliness and staff were all top tier, and we will be sure to stay there again!
",5,2023,08,10
111,Best hotel experience,"This was the best hotel experience we’ve ever had. The team went out of their way to help us. We had our 10 month old baby and children with us and our room couldn’t have been more comfortable. 

We also had an employee staying with us as our trip was for business and leisure. Mary and the entire team were so lovely and helpful. 

We cannot wait for our next stay, that roof terrace as well…wow!! And the facilities, every year there is a new cool addition to the rooms/ hotel. Location awesome too! Thanks again, Elissa",5,2023,08,10
111,Anniversary trip,"We stayed to celebrate our one year anniversary and noted that in the booking. Mary and the team went above and beyond decorating our room and ensuring we had a lovely stay. We can’t wait to come back, the facilities are lovely. We are hoping to be able to book again for our anniversary next year, as well as possibly using more of the spa facilities and rooftop terrace. Thank you for the lovely service",5,2023,08,09
111,"January, Mary and Daniel .. thank you","I was in contact with both January and Mary, the guest experience managers and they were both very supportive and kind. As it was my marriage anniversary, January offered to put special arrangements at the room as well as a free upgrade. Mary kept checking on us and offered an additional 2 hours stay at the checkout. Daniel from service team were very professional and kind. He kept asking about anything we need as well as additional complementaries. All of them were very lovely and I recommend the hotel because of them. 

Alaa & Nisrin",5,2023,08,09
111,Another wonderful stay,"We have just completed our second stay at the Montcalm after enjoying a wonderful stay last year. January was really helpful with organising our stay and greeted us when we checked in.

Breakfast in the Aviary was delicious with plenty of options available. Evening drinks in the members club room were great and staff in there really helpful.

We had drinks and food in the Long Arm pub  on our last day - wishing we had visited this before. The IPA beer was very good!

Looking forward to returning again soon!",5,2023,08,09
111,Relaxing solo treat,"Thank you for a wonderful stay. 

Fantastic hotel and wonderful staff. Spa access must be booked but it’s lovely. Given a free upgrade to club lounge as I’d requested an early check in which was really nice. As a solo traveller you are often penalised by paying hotel prices for two people so this was a very nice touch. This was a special treat to myself. 
The reception staff were exceptional. In particular a lady whose name I can’t remember but it began with an A. She supported my check in and ensured my room was ready almost upon arrival. 

The club room breakfast was excellent with very good quality food. 
",5,2023,08,08
111,Amazing experience,The team at Montcalm Finsbury Square are amazing. January and Moin went out of there way to make our anniversary so special.  All the staff were extremely attentive and made us feel very welcome... tha k you team Montcalm,5,2023,08,08
111,Amazing first time stay,All staff very kind friendly must say one member of staff stood out he was called Waris very kind very helpful explained every more than one.was over first stay we will definitely come again.amazing breakfast and friendly staff🙂,5,2023,08,08
111,Amazing experience,This is by far the most memorable stay of my husband and I at a hotel. Great service and friendly staff. The vibe of the whole hotel is amazing not to mention the beautiful view of the city from our room. ,5,2023,08,07
111,Great customer service ,"The hotel is nice but the best part of my stay was a young lady called Otilia, she was so friendly and she remembered me when she saw me again! She had amazing customer service skills! The room and bedroom view was also nice ",5,2023,08,07
111,I love this Hotel!,"I love this hotel, specially the quiet rooms! It was the third time that I've stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House. Rooms have decent sizes, bathrooms are bright and spotless clean and the beds are very comfy. I will definitely be back.
The only thing that wasn't  great, was the breakfast service on the 10th floor. I had a room rate without breakfast and my friend and I just wanted to drink a coffee and enjoy the great view. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow and very disorganized. We had to wait 25 minutes to get our coffees - that's a no go for a 5 star hotel.  Other than that, everyone was polite and very friendly. ",4,2023,08,07
111,Business Trip - Montcalm Royal,"I was travelling for work and stayed in the Montcalm Royal for 3 days. The room was large and clean and bed and pillows were soft and comfortable. A bottle of water was replaced in the room every day and it also had all the standard items such as a coffee machine, tea, coffee, sugar etc. An iron stand and iron was also provided and the bathroom was also nice which included all the relevant toiletries. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, the bell boys at the entrance were polite and welcoming and there was a café at the hotel as well which was nice. I would probably add eggs to the continental breakfast to give guests more options as that would have been better. The tube was roughly a 5 minute walk from the hotel which was a plus. The hotel also had a spa but I did not get a chance to use it. ",5,2023,08,07
111,Breakfast,Really good breakfast! Dhauv and Nicoleta have been amazing and service 10/10. Hotel in general with the facilities is great for couples. The service itself makes you feel at home with ease and looked after really well,5,2023,08,07
111,"I arrived a guest, and left as a friend.","I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel and from the moment I arrived, I was embraced with genuine warmth and heartfelt care by the team.

Upon stepping into the hotel, I was met with welcoming smiles and a sincere reception from Lamine. After a very long day, the staff at Montcalm Royal London House truly excelled in making me feel valued and appreciated - and this continued throughout my stay with the exceptional service provided by  Camelia, Daniel, Mary and so many others. The staff seemed to genuinely like their jobs and wanted to do whatever they could to make my stay a great one - and this was perhaps the biggest difference between Royal London House and a much larger hotel. There was an  atmosphere of authenticity that I simply haven't experienced at other 5* hotels.

During my stay, I faced unexpected challenges as the side effects of  chemotherapy hit me like a train. It was far worse than I had experienced before. However, it was during this time that I deeply appreciated the kindness and compassion extended by the hotel staff. They went above and beyond to ensure my well-being, offering their support that made me feel more like a friend than a guest. Their understanding and empathy were truly remarkable.

The room I stayed in was spacious, modern, and very comfortable. Everything that should have worked, did (which might be a first for a hotel room). The attention to detail was impressive, ensuring a pleasant and inviting atmosphere without feeling stuffy or alienating.

Throughout the hotel, there were occasional nods to eccentricity that added character without undermining the luxury, and that made the hotel experience memorable. In the bedroom, one such quirk was a button on the control panel next to the bed, which allowed me to change the lighting color in the bed area. Although I remain unsure that red lights above a king-size bed are quite the vibe I want to go for, it was one of those little things that make a hotel room memorable. 

The staff at Montcalm Royal London House Hotel exemplified dedication to providing exceptional service. From the attentive front desk team to the friendly restaurant staff and the efficient housekeeping staff, everyone demonstrated professionalism and genuine care. I feel sometimes like I live in hotels, but the staff remembering me by name and being proactively thoughtful - one member of the team even looked up things that could have helped with my chemo and brought me some ginger tea. This wasn't just hospitality - this was humanity.

The bar had a welcoming, unstuffy, and diverse atmosphere that was convivial but not intimidating. 

Overall, my experience at Montcalm Royal London House Hotel surpassed my expectations. I've never before left a hotel in London already looking forward to having  an opportunity to return, but the genuine care and compassion shown by the entire team, especially during the challenging moments of my chemotherapy were exceptional.

A heartfelt thank you to the entire staff for their outstanding hospitality!

I arrived as a guest, and I left as a friend.",5,2023,08,05
111,Amazing,"Excellent stay, January was so lovely and helpful. She helped wherever possible, including recommending and booking our dinner (which was fantastic) The spa was so relaxing, and the room was clean. We also had a lovely view of the square in front which was great!",5,2023,08,05
111,Perfect Hotel stay,"Just returned from a special break away. From start to finish the staff were very warm, welcoming and helpful. The rooms and hotel are beautiful with a lovely spa too. Breakfast was lovely. Everything was to such a high standard. Would highly recommend and will definitely return - Thanks so much to the team. ",5,2023,08,05
111,A first class experience,"From the moment I arrived, the welcome hospitality was genuinely very pleasing.
I have to make a special mention to Both Edison and Mariano who made my checkin experience first class. Courteous, polite and attentive to accommodate my needs, I was given a top floor corner room and very thing was clearly explained. 
There's something to be said when you've just flown into London and you are greeted with friendly hotel employees, both are real credit to the establishment. 
THe room was great, fanatastic views, the Aviary which serves as a full bar in the evening, with a spectral terrace and views of the city and by morning a quality breakfast offering. 
For me the Montcalm is a luxury hotel and the experience is accentuated by the professionalism of the staff and a great location.",5,2023,08,04
111,Amazing hotel,"The best experience ever. Had the best and relaxing time. The staff are super friendly, especially January and Claudia, who helped us a lot. Thanks to January she decorated the room for my 25th birthday and made it extra special. Will definitely be coming back for more occasions",5,2023,08,04
111,Amazing customer service,"January stevens was an amazing host from the moment I stepped into the hotel to saying goodbye. She had great  charisma and was really helpful. Overall really good experience. We thought breakfast finished at 11 but it finished at 10. Although our mistake, the staff directed us to the right restaurant and still let us order. 10/10 service, i will be visiting again. Thank you January!",5,2023,08,04
111,Birthday celebration July 23,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Service was superb throughout our stay. The staff were friendly and always happy to help. Our room was spacious (for London), and breakfast was excellent. We'll visit again!",5,2023,08,04
111,Exactly what I was after!,Wow… very friendly staff. An amazing warm welcome. The team especially Edison & Mariano went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Thank you for making my trip. Very clean and luxury hotel. Will definitely be back!,5,2023,08,03
111,"One of the best, if not the best, hotel for business","I normally stay at The Montcalm for business, however this time it was a mixture of business and also a special occasion. The moment you arrive at the Montcalm, you are greeted and your luggage is handled by a friendly host and you are taken through the bar area to the reception.

The reception staff are very friendly and cannot do anymore to help you if they tried! I have dealt with the Claudia Mary on reception a few times now and she has been absolutely excellent and has always been majorly accommodating with whatever I needed. I was then met by the Guest Experience Manager and another member of staff, who both took us up to our room and handled our luggage for us. 

The staff went out their way to ensure we had a great room with everything we needed, and added extra special touches to make our stay even more appreciated.

The rooms are clean, amenities are plenty and most importantly, beds and pillows are extremely comfortable.

If you are someone like me who likes clean rooms, friendly atmosphere and consistency in everything, then I would not hesitate to recommend The Montcalm Royal London House. It's one of the best, if not the best, hotel I have stayed at for Business so far.",5,2023,08,03
111,Return visit,"This visit happened to be a very last minute one. We have been to this hotel several times before since it opened and when our other plans fell through for a big anniversary my husband contacted January for help. True to form, she sorted us a beautiful room with access to the club lounge and even greeted us personally and showed us to our room. The additional surprise of a bottle of bubbles and macarons in the room were very much appreciated. The rooms are very spacious with all the usual amenities and the bathroom is large with an excellent shower. The staff are all very friendly and it was nice to see some familiar faces, especially in the front of house. I'd also like to acknowledge concierge and the door staff who were very helpful, from sorting luggage to handing out umbrellas, to going and hailing a cab for you. The breakfast in the restaurant was ample with the 'main choice' freshly cooked to order. This hotel is not central London but close enough for it not to be inconvenient and as it is in the city of London, there are still several restaurants and bars around, should you want that option. As the title to this review suggests we will return when we are next in London.",5,2023,08,03
111,Good hotel,"Well positioned hotel near Moorgate tube, short ten minute walk from Liverpool St Station. An excellent hotel, very friendly and helpful staff. A really good size comfortable  bed,  excellent shower and bathroom. Bar and Cafe well managed, again with good friendly helpful staff. Not cheap but not overly priced and I’d say Value for Money. ",4,2023,08,02
111,"Great service, need improvement on room cleaning","We got independent misfortune during our London trip, and the service from reception, lounge, concierge and managers were impeccable and very supportive of us.

The missing star concerns annoyance related to room cleaning.

We were 3 persons, but only 2 pairs of towel were given most of the time.

Sometimes all the garbage cans weren't emptied after room cleaning.

There was some broken glass in the fridge.

The panel to control bathroom light/air conditioner/room service is annoying. It doesn't respond well to touch, sometimes lock down behind a password, crashes and it emits lots of light during the night... normal switches would be better.

We will come back, but we hope for better room cleaning for next time.",4,2023,08,02
111,Epic weekend!!!,"My stay at Montcalm was one of the best stays I’ve ever had. From the moment we walked into the hotel until the moment we left, all staff members were attentive and ever so helpful. 

More specifically Mary Philippiah, who was so friendly and during our interactions was forever smiling and patient regardless of how busy it was. She also added special touches to ensure my hotel room was contoured to the celebration of my 21st birthday. I’m extremely grateful. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a relaxed night away or more to unwind! Thank you Montcalm Royal London :)",5,2023,08,02
111,Amazing service,"From the moment I walked into this hotel I was greeted with such lovely amazing people 
Especially January whom made sure my stay was perfect 
I was also able to visit the spa which was also a very nice touch 
I will definitely be visiting the Montcalm again staff were very polite and helpful ",5,2023,08,01
111,Loved it!,"We had a lovely stay for my husband’s birthday. The staff were so kind and attentive, and they had decorated our hotel room with balloons, rose petals, and a bottle of wine. 

Our luggage was taken straight up to our room whilst we enjoyed a drink in the bar, and the food was delicious. 

We can’t wait to return!",5,2023,08,01
111,Amazing staff and a wonderful hotel.,"The hotel staff were amazing, so welcoming and incredibly helpful, the wait at reception was minimal, check-in was easy and the staff offered me help with my bag to the room. The room itself was very clean and well presented with an absolutely excellent bathroom that was spotless. The bed was exceptionally comfy which made the Noon check out time even better. The location is brilliant, about a three minute walk to Liverpool Street Station and some fantastic artistic institutions nearby. The roof top bar, The Aviary, was (considering location in London and the fact it's a hotel), good value and a lively atmosphere. Checking out too, the staff were incredibly friendly, offered me a taxi and directions if needed. I would absolutely stay here again.  Mary who checked me in and made a point to say goodbye too was absolutely excellent, truly fantastic staff, everyone I met was incredible at their job and really helpful.",5,2023,08,01

111,A solid 4-star stay in a great location,"Solid, four-star stay. Now they do call the house a five-star hotel, and that's a bit of hyperbole: rooms are small, ours had a view of wall and more wall of the neighboring building, the breakfast restaurant on floor 10 was closed when I went there, room service did not stock up on basics such as shower gel etc. On the plus side though, a very nice location, a clean and somewhat affordable room, and friendly people everywhere.",4,2023,08,01

111,Fabulous Experience,"We had a great experience at the Montcalm. I was checked in by Mary who was extremely welcoming and attentive.

We were greeted by the smiling doormen every time we came/went from the hotel and the reception staff were polite and quick to get us checked in/out.

The reception staff when checking us in were so attentive and informative.

The room was lovely and we loved the mood light ;) The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely and clean. 

We had breakfast in the morning which was okay,  before checking out. 

Claudia checked us out and she was lovely, she then got the guest experience manager January to come out as she wanted to meet us, and she was also very warm and welcoming and checked in on how our stay was.

111,Great impromptu stay!,"My teenager and I ended up needing a place to stay for the night after a late appointment at GOSH. We needed a twin room which are not easy to find at short notice. Montcalm had a room available so we booked quickly as we were worried that we wouldn't find anything else. Teen was very very impressed to turn up at the hotel and find a top hatted doorman who was really kind and helpful. The hotel is beautiful. Room clean, spacious and well equipped. We didn't make the most of it as it was all so last minute but I would definitely use again. It was especially nice for me as I lived in university halls just across the road many years ago although the whole landscape has changed since then! Really friendly and helpful staff on the desk. Turned what was a fairly stressful day into an absolute treat! ",5,2023,07,21

Mary called me the day after booking to confirm a few details which was greatly appreciated and felt reassured I had picked the right hotel. We were warmly greeted by the team and Mary personally showed us to our room to ensure we were happy with everything.

The hotel was about a 5 minute walk from Liverpool Street which was perfect for our stay. The hotel itself was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the room had great features. The rooftop terrace was fantastic and had a great breakfast here too!

It is very well situated in the City. On the top floor it has a great terrace which holds a restaurant and a bar, from which there are amazing views.

Ms January Stevens, is the most attentive and polite guest manager I have ever met, and I have traveled a lot!

We had let the hotel know we were celebrating our anniversary, and she gifted us a box chocolates, a bottle of Prosecco and a bottle of water. Also they decorated the room with balloons and petals! Such a nice gesture!

The breakfast was a cold buffet, with lots of delicious fresh berries, breads, cheese and smoked salmon.

But really the service was outstanding. We had a great stay. Look no further: this is the best hotel in London by far.

Thank you Ms Stevens for making this anniversary so memorable! Thanks to all the staff who were impeccable.

1)	Easy and speedy check in –  4 staff on the welcome desk at a very busy point in the day which meant that nobody was waiting. 
2)	The quality of the room never disappoints – linen / products/pillows/ tea & coffee/bottled water – all add to the experience.

Mary went above and beyond after telling her the special occasion she went that extra mile to help make it memorable. Upon checking in a lovely gentleman called Lamine attended to us from start to finish, he was very kind and keen, made us feel extremely welcome.

Pamela was a perfect manager that welcomed me at the hotel ",5,2023,07,17
111,Lamine the dream,"We were a walk in couple and the man at the desk, Lamine, was a pleasure to talk to. We came in around 1/2 am, but Lamine was full of life and had a great laugh with us, which made me feel more comfortable in a hotel I thought I would have felt out of place in at first. Going off of his Customer Service alone, I would recommend anyone who is looking to stay in that area to come to the Montcalm. ",5,2023,07,16

Assistant Guest Experience Manager Mary was very friendly and helped with all requests. The spa is wonderful with a comfortable water temperature.",5,2023,07,15
111,Perfect Anniversary Stay,I had an amazing Anniversary here at the RLH.

111,Outstanding Concierge,"The concierge was beyond exceptional. We were traveling from the US to the UK with no experience scheduling tours or transportation. Communication with the staff was almost entirely via email.  They were responsive, courteous, thorough and patient.  Sadly, this has not always been our experience when traveling internationally. ",5,2023,07,14
111,Definitely to come again!,"It’s marvelous; the staff is lovely and the location is perfect.

111,Excellent Experience,"We were welcomed into the lobby with a glass of prosecco whilst we waited to check in. All the staff we came across were very friendly and courteous. The room itself (Club double) was a good size and contained pretty much everything you would need. 

There were one or two improvements that could be made. Firstly, a dressing table area with mirror would have been useful for my wife. There was a dressing table, and a mirror, but not in easy reach of each other. Secondly, the bath takes an eternity to fill (30+ mins). So if you do fancy a bath then make sure you have allowed good time for it to fill! Also, the swimming pool on-site is well maintained and looks great but is more of a spa/lounging pool than a pool that you could swim lengths and exercise in. 

It was also a special birthday which was acknowledged by the hotel, which left us some really nice macaroons and a bottle of prosecco in our room - which was a really nice gesture. 

Would definitely visit this hotel again. ",5,2023,07,11
111,Not a 5 star as claimed,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel as described. Hotel was 45 minutes late in checking us in when we had to be elsewhere. Booked us into an accessible room without telling us, where the bathroom sink etc was all lowered. This couldn’t be rectified until the next day. There was rips in the interior fitting in the room. Included breakfast wasn’t up to anywhere near a 5 star, the containers the food was kept in were cracked. Do not stay here if you are after a 5 star experience. More like a 3 star.",1,2023,07,10
111,Fantastic stay for our wedding!,"We stayed here the night before our wedding and the night of our wedding. Could not recommend this hotel more.

This staff is amazing and I will only stay here in London. ",5,2023,07,09

The hotel staff were incredible and very accommodating all the way through our stay and the hotel room and facilities were up to a very high standard. I requested for balloon, petals and Prosecco to be put in the room for my partners birthday and the staff made the room look great! ",5,2023,07,09
111,Excellence and attention to detail -thank you,"We cannot thank the Montcalm Royal London House enough for the service and attention to detail we received on our stay. The room was decorated with balloons and petals as I had stated we were travelling to London for my husband’s 50th. 

Every aspect of service in the hotel, from booking to checking in, to the spa, rooftop bar and executive lounge was attentive, informative, luxurious and perfectly timed. Thank you helping creating some wonderful memories. Choosing a Montcalm too which comes with access to an executive lounge was excellent.We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and will be back.  

Many thanks especially to Mary Philippiah. Assistant Guest Experience Manager. 

Thank you

111,"Want to stay at the best Hotel in London, with the best staff- Montcalm Royal London is it. Perfect for all travellers!","Hands down one of the the best hotel I've stayed at. Amazing facilities, spacious rooms, Comfy bed and feather like pillow.

Conveniently located to bars, restaurants and Tube stations with Shoreditch a short walk away. 
 Also has an awesome rooftop bar!

However, The staff, are what sets this place apart! Attentive and there to help to whatever you need, before you even ask. 
I arrived late in the evening, severely tired and jet lagged after my flight was delayed few hours. A massive thank you and special mention to Lamine, Eddison, Mahmodul and Kai for sorting me out with an amazing Palm room with awesome views of London Skyline, as well as looking after me post check out, so I could freshen up before my long flight ahead- which made a world of difference. They didn't have to do any of what they did, however their generosity was greatly appreciated. 
It's when the staff goes over and above to make sure the guest has a memorable stay, is why I'll keep coming back everytime and you should too! 
Thanks again to all the staff at the Montcalm Royal London House. I'll be back. ",5,2023,07,08

The rooms, food, rooftop bar & views, pool downstairs are all as wonderful as they look on the website. This is my third stay & I am looking forward to returning again. The Guest Experience Manager January Stevens went above & beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful. Highly recommend the Montcalm ",5,2023,07,04
111,Amazing stay - no faults at all.,"Amazing stay at Montcalm Royal City London. I would personally say this was the best Montcalm out of all the ones we have stayed at. The spa facilities were great. You get 30 mins complimentary use. We also used the rooftop bar which is called Aviary. amazing views. The bathroom in the room was also so clean and modern. The beds were super comfy. We will definitely be returning. We did not have breakfast here however next time we will be.

A very good location as well, and such reasonable prices.",5,2023,07,03
111,Birthday,"Staff are very attentive soon as you arrive to the hotel and a special mention to Mary who made our stay perfect. It was my partners birthday and we were greeted with balloons, petals, snacks and champagne when we walked in to our room. We also received a room with a better view and later check out which was definitely needed. All staff were lovely and could not be faulted. Thank you for looking after us! And we look forward to staying here again.",5,2023,07,02
111,Lovely stay organised by Mary,"I arrived with a warm welcome at the hotel to a glass of Prosecco. Mary is so lovely and organised my stay for my partner’s birthday. The room was decorated with balloons and a roses by the staff, the room itself was so amazing with a very comfortable bed and clean bathroom. We visited the spa twice within our 1-night stay and it was amazing and just the relaxation I needed. We finished the stay with going up to the Aviary for brunch. I would most definitely go back here very soon!

Heaven",5,2023,07,02
111,A very special visit to an excellent hotel,"We stayed for our parents 70th birthdays and 50th wedding anniversary. January, the customer experience manager, could not have done more for us. The care the staff show is exceptional. The rooms are lovely, beds are super comfy. A truly excellent stay that made our parents celebration extra special!",5,2023,07,02
111,Great stay in good location.,"The Montcalm was a fabulous hotel for a short stay in a really good location. It was a celebration for an 18th birthday and the hotel had decorated the room with balloons and a bottle of Prosecco, which was a lovely touch. The beds are extremely comfortable and the pillow menu a lovely touch. Elemis toiletries are lovely and the bathrooms clean with lovely big showers. Breakfast was good, but slightly complicated, you could choose from a menu, but also select from the buffet, but if you wanted a full English, you could only select from the buffet, apart from the eggs which had to be ordered! My only complaint was that there didn't seem to be anywhere for a quiet drink. The Aviary bar was lovely, with good cocktails, but very, very busy and loud. A quieter lounge for after dinner drinks would have been appreciated. ",5,2023,07,02
111,Montcalm- The Royal experience,One of the best hotels with the nicest and most courteous staff. So glad to shift from the Hilton to this hotel at the end of my business trip...close proximity to a lot of bars and nice areas. Definitely staying here at my next trip,5,2023,07,01
111,Maybe my favorite hotel in the world as a frequent international business traveler,"This hotel is one of the best I’ve ever been to in the whole world, and I’ve traveled over 100 days in the past year. I’ve spent at least 15 nights there in the past 10 months, and have stayed all over London. Its location is prime, a short walk to Liverpool street station and Spitalfields, and relatively accessible to all of London. The staff have always been nothing but superbly exceptional. This hotel is great value for money.

The accommodations and comfort are top notch. Amazing beds, elegant rooms, luxurious carpets, amazing showers, and even heated bathroom floors! The rooms are always quiet and I always get the best sleep here. I’ve never even heard housekeepers in the hall. This might be my favorite hotel I’ve ever stayed at. 11/10 would recommend and this is my go-to accommodation whenever I’m in London.",5,2023,07,01
111,Amazing! ,"Warm welcome, location perfectly nearby Moorgate and Liverpool Street, very pleasant, friendly, amazing, friendly manager and butlers, facilities extensive, modern rooftopbar, excellent spa and nice rooms. ",5,2023,07,01
111,Great place!,Dumitru was excellent. Good attention — took care of me!  I’ll come back!  I love the Montcalm royal London hotel. Wonderful location. Great service.  Good staff. My 3rd time here    Enjoyed the daily happy hour!,5,2023,06,30

Morgan (the supervisor) was prompt in addressing our queries. ",5,2023,06,30
111,"Very modern and clean, at a ideal location.",Incredible service. Very grateful to Ms Swati for her professional demeanor. Will come back! Close to the Barbican center and guild Hall School. I don't have much More to say but Trip advisor expects 200 characters,5,2023,06,30
111,Marathon Weekend,"First time staying at this hotel over London Marathon weekend - it was one of few hotels without inflated room prices - and it was the perfect. 

My room wasn't available upon arrival as I got there early but within about 30 minutes I'd received a call from the hotel noting my room was ready. The room itself was great - excellent bed and pillows, good TV, spacious bathroom, iron and ironing board, tea/coffee facilities, etc. 

The location is good being 5 minutes walk from the nearest tube station. 

The rooftop bar was really cool and I enjoyed the sports bar too. 

Following the marathon, I was able to use the hotel facilities to change and collect my luggage before departing. 

Excellent all round stay. ",5,2023,06,28
111,Brilliant Birthday Visit!,"We had a lovely stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. We were greeted by Mary on arrival who made sure our stay was perfect. As we were celebrating my birthday, we received an upgraded and decorated room. We loved using the pool and spa facilities and had an incredibly relaxing stay. Thank you for making my birthday so special! This has become the only hotel we stay at when visiting London.",5,2023,06,26
111,Family trip,I'm a Hilton Diamond member and I can tell you that I would come back to the Montcalm if I was in London again. The first night we had some issue with the AC. It was not working I call down to front desk after about 1 hour and 1/2 they couldn't get it fix. The manager came to the room and told me that they would move me tomorrow so please leave all you bags packed and we can go out continue with you plans. When we return for the day I was moved to another room. I had the reception included in my room  and Dhryu and sneha were wonderful went above and beyond ,4,2023,06,26
111,Luxury stay! ,"Amazing stay at Montcalm for mine and my sisters joint birthday. From the minute we walked through the reception doors we were taken care of from someone helping us out with our luggage to the minute we checked out. The staff were so attentive and I really enjoyed my stay, thank you to Mary who made sure we had everything we needed. Deffo recommend! Will be staying again.",5,2023,06,25
111,Great service,"To be honest we were taken by surprise at the wonderful service and attitude by the hotel staff. We are so used to poor service in the many London hotels we frequent on a regular basis it was a reality check about what good service looks like. Therefore would absolutely recommend staying here. 
The only gripe would be the usual for London hotels - the extortionate pricing at the bar…..a glass of wine for the price of a bottle and the daylight robbery on a bottle of water just ruins all the good a little! Sorry but needs to be said!!!!",5,2023,06,25
111,Great hotel! ,Lovely hotel with very comfortable beds! Slight hiccup when arrived as the display panel for lighting / AC in the room was smashed and we had to change rooms. To make up for this the manager offered us a bottle of wine and refund on the breakfast! From that moment onwards the service was excellent and we very much enjoyed our stay! Thank you to Pamela and the team for making our 18th wedding anniversary so special! ,5,2023,06,25
111,Best city hotel,"This hotel is incredible!! 
Where do I start Pamela,January,Sai sneha,dhruv and aviary  team have been outstanding staff so helpful and friendly this hotel makes you feel so comfortable I would recommend this for any day ,The rooms are extremely clean !!",5,2023,06,24
111,The Montcalm Royal London House,This is our final hotel is our 12-day European trip thru London and Paris.   We were pleasantly surprised to enter our quad room which consisted of two bedrooms and two bathrooms with comfortable luxurious amenities.  We were really pleased with the happy hour where our party of 8 was served by Sai Snesha & Dheuv who were very attentive in a professional friendly manner.  We look forward to visiting the Montcalm Royal London House the next time we’re in London.,5,2023,06,24
111,Exceptional customer service ,"I’ve not been staying in The Montcalm Royal London House for a while (did stay a number of times in the past). After a long break, I came back to my beloved hotel. And I was so pleased with the way I was welcomed back!
Straight away on the check-in I’ve been told I will have a complimentary drink in the lounge (it was right on time – as I had my train delayed and it was quite a long and exhausting journey and the drink on arrival was exactly what I needed at that moment!).
I was also kindly offered to have a complementary breakfast in the morning - as been a regular customer.
And when I entered my room – I saw the macaroons on a platter and a card with a very warm ""welcome back"" signature – I was touched by such a gesture from the hotel! That is exactly what I would call “Exceptional customer service”!
Facilities, food, and room service – are excellent as always!
Will be very happy to come back to this beautiful hotel again and again.
Thank you for your amazing services!",5,2023,06,23
111,"Very good, but a couple of flaws.","Overall, the Montcalm is a very solid hotel. Staff are great, everyone is friendly, everyone wants to help and make the stay pleasant. Rooms are spacious by London standards, well-equipped and everything works fine.

That said...there are a few faux-pas that make this a 4-Star hotel in my opinion. We stayed 6 nights and 2 of those nights, our room was never made up. We asked to have that remedied on the way out for dinner and they always obliged. But one really shouldn't have to remind them of basic guest services.

The other issue is the lounge breakfast. Not only is the range of food options extremely limited, but the items at the buffet were always either out or so low that one could not get enough food. And the more expensive items, like smoked salmon, are cut into postage stamp-size pieces, which makes eating any of it tedious.

Lastly, we were delayed a day, so we asked to add an extra night at the end of our stay during check-in. While the hotel was sold out at that time, rooms were available for purchase a day or two before our departure, but nobody from the front desk ever gave us a call to let us know what they would or would not be able to accommodate. 

Like I said...overall a very good stay, but not at the level of many other London hotels I have stayed at. That said, I would not hesitate to stay here again as room rates tend to be a decent value.",4,2023,06,23
111,London Trip,Staff was welcoming and services were great. Breakfast is top class and the lounge area is great as well. The hotel itself is very close to old street subway station and there is a park right infornt of the hotel for entertainment.,5,2023,06,22
111,Amazing stay as always,My third stay at the Montcalm and it never ceases to impress . The staff go over and above any expectations and January always makes us so welcome and wanting to return again . Thank you January you and your team made our celebrations so special ,5,2023,06,22
111,Excellent Hotel! Kaloyan and Edison are the best! ,"Highly recommend this hotel! The base, the furniture, the conditions are more than excellent. However, what makes the real deal is the personnel! It is the staff members, who are extremely polite, helpful and eager to make every guest feel at home and to provide them with the best possible experience! I would like to express my gratitude specifically to Kaloyan and Edison, who were supporting me and helping with all my needs throughout my stay at Montcalm! I believe Kaloyan and Edison are invaluable part of the hotel and it is my hope their hard and excellent-quality work get reflected by the Management Team. Thank you for everything! I will make sure to come back very soon! ",5,2023,06,21

and her team for making our visit extra special for my partners birthday, we are really looking forward to visiting again!  ",5,2023,06,20
111,Amazing Hotel! Outstanding Customer Service!,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London on Saturday 17th June with my Husband and our friends. From booking this Hotel, to emailing a few special requests, from arriving there and throughout our stay the service was absolutely outstanding. Daniel the Head Concierge went above and beyond to ensure our stay was special. Everything we needed was there and no request was too big for the hotel. We had such an amazing time and will definitely be returning to this hotel soon. Highly recommended this hotel to everyone. Rooms are great, Rooftop Bar was amazing and a great breakfast to finish our stay. Beautiful Spa Facilities also. A big thank you to all the staff here and a special thank you to Daniel & Mary. Many Thanks Theresa Glenister x",5,2023,06,20
111,Family time in London,We have had a great visit in London! Our teen boys first time visiting. We stayed at the club level and we loved hangout in the club lounge in the evening. Moin and Usha took amazing care of us . They were fantastic! Everyone here has been so nice and helpful! Great suggestion for reservations and great central location! ,5,2023,06,19
111,Love the Montcalm,"I love hotel group.  The staff are amazing especially Dhsur & Sai Sneha.

I had no where to stay and I called and arranged a room for two days.

They are amazing all round!

I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel chain 

Thank you for everything",5,2023,06,18
111,Club special ,Hdruv and sai Senha looked after us so well and was absolutely amazing! Both made us feel so welcome. Such a good time you must get a club special when coming to this hotel they are so amazing! Thank you so much ,5,2023,06,18
111,Perfect hotel in a perfect location!,"This hotel is superb… looked after start to finish.. the rooms are brilliantly presented with all the home comforts we need. 
Mary the assistant guest experience manager made us feel so special would highly recommend. 
The Aviary roof terrace and bar was a lovely touch we enjoyed views of the city with a relaxed but lively atmosphere it really is with a visit.
A short walk from the tube makes London really accessible.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough… this was my second visit and we still haven’t got around to using the spa facilities… the perfect excuse to return! ",5,2023,06,18
111,"A short break to remember, can’t wait to return.","Was blown away by this hotel was treated so well and looked after by Mary Philippiah she upgraded our room gave us complimentary wine and made our break one to remember for my 40th birthday. Can’t wait to return the facilities, the staff 5 star",5,2023,06,18
111,Higly recommend The Montcalm if you are touring central London,"The staff were friendly, informative and very professional. I wooud like to give special recognition to Mary Philippiah(the assitant guest experience manager). She goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable.

The room we booked was great. It was spacious and well designed.

The hotel is also located in one of the most prime locations in central London. Its near hotspots like one of Gordon Ramsey""s kitchens (8 to 10 minutes walk away) and ome of the British musuems. There is a range of grrat restautants to choose from which are nearbybas well.

You also get a complimentary 30 minute spa treatment with your room. Or you can choose to use the gym and/or the swimming pool and jacuzi. 

If you don't feel like walking around, the have a beautiful rooftop restaurant called the Aviary. You can choose to add an additional £19 to your room get their full comtinental breakfast.

Would highly recommend.",5,2023,06,18
111,Disappointing for many reasons,"Having stayed here a couple of years ago and had pretty a good experience, we were disappointed due to several factors also mentioned in a previous review - no robes in the room for the spa, an awful duvet with hard scrunched up lumps of feathers or either no feathers at all, a phone which didn’t work, a strong drain smell from the bathroom, dirty curtains and window and finally despite paying almost £300 for one night (without breakfast), being told we could only have a 30 min slot in the spa! This was so disappointing for a 5 star hotel and not what we hoped for at all. Definitely things seem to have slipped in the last 2 years. ",3,2023,06,17
111,Terrible,"My boyfriend Rolex watch was stolen from the hotel room by the cleaner. 

Myself and my boyfriend checked into the hotel on Friday 16th June at 15:30.  We had the spa booked at 16:30 so we went to the room and waited to go down to the spa.  We came back up to the room at 17:15 to find a cleaner leaving the room with no cleaning equipment next door to us, at the time we didn’t think anything of it. 
We got ready to go out and as we were leaving, my boyfriend checked the safe to get his Rolex watch which he left in there before we went to the spa.  To our surprise, the Rolex was missing.

After no help from the hotel staff, we phoned the police who turned up Saturday morning at 9am.  They checked the CCTV cameras and the cleaner had been in our room 3 minutes before we got back to it after the Spa.  The hotel also said that there shouldn’t have been any cleaners working on that floor during that time.  The cleaner had stolen the watch! 

If you do stay at this hotel, do not leave any valuable items in the room as they will be stolen.

The police are now investigating the situation and are going to the cleaners home.

Do not stay here!",1,2023,06,17
111,Highly recommended ,"The hospitality and service in the hotel is always exceptional. The staff are very welcoming, the rooms are always clean and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel for all business and leisure stays, looking forward to my next visit ",5,2023,06,15

111,Amazing birthday experience for my girlfriend!,"From the minute I entered The Montcalm Royal London House, I knew it would be an experience unlike one I'd had before. The concierge and reception staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating, & after a delay to check in caused by it being one of the hottest days of the year so far, I was personally escorted by Mary to my room, only to find I had received a complementary room upgrade which had been outfitted in celebration of my girlfriend's birthday, the reason for the event. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom facilities were beautiful & the location was perfect for our dinner plans. I cannot thank Mary & the entire team for the part they played in my girlfriend's special day!",5,2023,06,12
111,Fabulous hotel with attentive staff - a real treat!,"This was a surprise stay to celebrate a special birthday.

The room had been decorated and there was Prosecco on ice, macaroons and a celebration card welcoming us to the hotel. Everything was perfect and we were so impressed by the attention to detail and thought that had gone into this. On checkout, once again Mary came to meet us to check how our stay had been and offered to assist us personally on any future visits. A brilliant stay at a lovely hotel. A rare find in London so be sure to visit. Thanks to Mary and all the staff at The Montcalm for a fabulous stay, we will be back.",5,2023,06,12
111,"Best hotel in London, amazing staff","Our 4-night stay at the Montcalm was an outstanding experience. The staff was kind, helpful and courteous at all times. Our room was nicely decorated with the right ambien for our anniversary celebration, the  lights, the modern and minimalist vibes and the soft pillows made all the difference. A huge thank you to the staff, specially, Swati, who went out of her way to make us feel like at home with a nice welcome Prosecco or choices of wine, beer, water and beverages. Also grateful for Prithvi, Edison and Saris who made our last night very special by surprising us with a chill bottle of Prosecco. Simon and the concierge team were always welcoming, having always someone available to guide us with directions and great tips.

We had a noise from the 3rd floor we ended up moved to the 5th floor . 
The hotel employees and management did the out most to treat my friend for her birthday  balloons chocolate fruits and bubbles.

It’s in a great area near the tube and more then that quite area. The hotels rooms are spacious. 
They don’t have bath tubs in every room so you must ask for it in advance . 
Daniel was the out most accommodating and treat us  with white gloves service. 
Water and champagne❤️❤️❤️   
Thank you again will be back.",5,2023,06,10
111,Fantastic London,My recent stay at this hotel was absolutely top notch! All the staff could not have been more welcoming. The rooms were spotless and spacious. As I was travelling with my friend in a wheelchair we were put into an adapted room which I could not fault. Massive shout out to Daniel and January! Both of these made our stay so special and accommodated every one of our needs. They’re a credit to the hotel. If we ever return to London I would most certainly stay here again! ,5,2023,06,10
111,Great working location in London,"Very nice room, lots of space, great comfortable bed,  good experience on checking in and out.  Breakfast was very nice, and previous evening meal experience was very nice.  Comfortable and relaxing, with good facilities and location. ",5,2023,06,07
111,Fantastic,Brilliant hotel. Wonderful staff and service. Very stylish place. Great rooftop bar with an awesome array of drinks. Delicious breakfast. Superb room. Perfect location. Underground stop nearby. What’s not to like?,5,2023,06,07
111,Not what it was.,"This hotel must be at the low or entry level of 5 star; but even that status strains credibility. The overall facility itself is nice enough, but it's poorly managed. The room curtains were dirty, the windows filthy, no robes, no towel rack, no extra towels, no toilet brush, no tissue refill, no washcloth, no chest of drawers, and during my stay no one answered the phone -- not even the operator. (There's no button for reception on the phone.) The small spa area, including sauna, is so overrun, that guests are given 30 minute time slots. The singles bar and pub area just inside the hotel entrance is often loud and obnoxious, and Instagrammy. The clientele can be boorish, especially in the elevators.
If you relish Soviet-style hospitality, this is your place. Maybe they're trying to compete on price. But nothing in London comes cheap. This is an area of London undergoing huge transition. Montcalm will have to compete by lowering prices. Even then, service and cleanliness will need to be improved. ",3,2023,06,06
111,"Lovely experience, can’t wait to stay again!","I have stayed at the Marble Arch branch several times and was disappointed when I found out they were being renovated. However, I do not regret booking the Finsbury Square branch. We had a lovely view of Finsbury Square staying in the club suite. Great location to other restaurants and top tier service especially from Siana at reception and the manager and staff who gave us Prosecco on our way out. Thank you again team and you’ll definitely see us soon! ",5,2023,06,06
111,Amazing experience,"Had such an amazing experience at the Montcalm Royal hotel! They made special touches to our room as we were celebrating a birthday and was also offered an upgrade!

111,Perfect Location for a London stay,"This hotel is in such a great position,right near Liverpool Street and the transort links to get anywhere around London very easily. Have stayed here 3 times now and will stay again. Great hotel, great service, lovely rooms, highly recommended x",5,2023,06,06
111,Fantastic!,"Unbelievable stay at the Montcalm. Having never stayed before and usually using somewhere else in London we tried the Montcalm and won’t be staying anywhere else now when visiting London. Fantastic location, friendly and helpful staff who couldn’t do enough for you and a well equipped comfortable room with all the amenities needed. Special thanks to January the guest relations manager who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special. A real asset to the hotel, alongside the doormen who were always friendly and helpful.",5,2023,06,05
111,Lounge bar,Had a great time at the lounge access bar. Moin & Nicoleta were very helpful and friendly to us despite our last minute entry. I will be back again. Thanks for giving me such a great time in London!!!,5,2023,06,05
111,Amazing,"Had a lovely birthday stay at the Mount a calm royal London house, we were greeted by Mary and taken up to our room and as requested prior to the stay the team had left some balloons, chocolate truffles and a card for my boyfriend. Room service was amazing? They have a fabulous roof top bar with an amazing view of london ",5,2023,06,05
111,If only all hotels could be like this!!!,"We booked in here because we had been blown away on a previous visit. I booked via email with Mary as she had been SO attentive and kind to us on our first visit that I responded to her kind email following our first visit to book again. She personally took us to our room and had some lovely touches for us as we were just married that weekend. 
I stay in a lot of hotels and I absolutely cannot find fault with this hotel. The staff are out of this world. 
From the lovely doorman Alex who went down the street to hail a taxi for us, I had a sweet craving late at night and Alberto, Waris and Roman went on a hunt and got me a little box of chocolates! They are all just so friendly and accommodating and the staff are absolutely the reason we returned first and foremost.
The hotel itself is also amazing, located a five min walk to Liverpool Street station which connects to all major routes. Shops close by. The bed is probably the best I’ve ever slept in. I also had to leave a package to be collected by Fedex and concierge made me feel so at ease and reassured that this was no problem they would look after it for me.
A warm goodbye from Mary when we left again at check out left us thinking all we need is to find an excuse to go again. 
A deserving five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2023,06,02
111,Five Star,"Wow this was definitely the best hotel I've stayed in in the UK.
From the first welcome by the door man, to checking in, the bell staff took our luggage to the room and the manager introduced herself.
They made extra special touches to our room as we were celebrating a birthday.
Would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends and family.
So friendly, so welcoming, couldn't have asked for anything else! 
Shout out to Mary (Guest Experience Manager) and Claudia (receptionist).
Nothing was too much trouble. They went above and beyond for our stay, thank you to all the staff.",5,2023,06,02
111,First and last visit.  Not overly impressed,"To begin, this is an actual genuine review.
I feel that this hotel have too many reviews based on guests having left only 1 review and conveniently its 5 stars to Montcalm RLH.  

My wife and 2 kids stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.
To begin with we had booked a family suite through hotels.com, instead we were given 2 adjoining bedrooms.  The adjoining rooms were fine but the room was pre-paid.  I noticed that when signing the paperwork on check out they had gave me 2 adjoining rooms that were £400 less than what I had paid.  I said nothing as it was nice my daughter had a bed of her own but they could've refunded the difference.

We took our bags to the rooms and it was nice that the travel cot was made up for our son.  Our young daughter was amazed that she had her own double bed and large tv.
It was off to a really good start but then it started to go downhill.

My main criticism was housekeeping.  The rooms didn't feel clean at all.
There were several surfaces covered in dust, like the coffee making facilities in both rooms.  The plug holes in the bathrooms.  The carpets didn't look clean enough for our 1 year old crawling around and to top it off there were a pair of used boxers in our wardrobe from a previous guest!  Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel!
One of the days they didn't lift our rubbish when cleaning the room which had bagged neatly beside the bins.

The hotel has 2 lifts which can be very slow especially when some of the poser guests decide on using the lift as a photoshoot opportunity.  This happened me in one occasion that I eventually gave up after 15 minutes and used the emergency stairs.
I'm unsure if it was the hotel bar but we could hear music until 5am in the morning on the bank holiday Monday night.

The hotel has a rooftop bar which seems very nice but not really ideal for kids.  We stayed there for one cocktail and left.

Overall I would say this hotel is fine if you're staying as a couple but I wouldn't say it's child friendly or ideal for families.

111,MY SECOND HOME MORE THAN 5* HOTEL,"I have been using this hotel for over a year now for both business, pleasure and family days away at time with my little one. 

The Montcalm Royal is my second home, it feels like I’m just stepping foot in my own front door. 

I look forward to returning always and I am always so sad when leaving. Usually I end up extending my stay because the place is just too homely to leave. 

From the minute you reach the front doors (actually even before) the staff are at the door ready to collect your luggage, so that immediately you feel at ease and have the weight of luggage taken off of you. 

At reception you are always greeted so well, and not just myself because I am a returning guest (I watch from afar as I am very observant) and see that they go above and beyond for every single guest staying at the hotel. Sometime you are greeted with a glass of Prosecco and always asked if you would like a drink of their special water or tea and coffee whilst you wait at reception- although usually your speedily checked into your room. 

The rooms are beautiful (I have slept in nearly every type of room) and I would be happy to sleep in any, the rooms are very spacious and you have everything you desire (again if there is anything you do need) nothing is too much trouble and if you ring concierge they will rapidly be on route to help. 

January and Mary at guest relations look after me the most when I come to stay, and I know they build good relationships with all of their returning guests. They feel now like family. Dani also who works at the reception in charge of all the luggage staff always gives a warm welcome. 

As I say I have stayed at this hotel at least once or twice a month for over a year and I wouldn’t stay anywhere is in london- on every occasion. Even to the point I take my little one who is five now with me because she is even greeted like a little princess. 

The spa facilities, food, staff, rooms everything is just more than a 5* rating. I will continue to stay at the Montcalm as much as I can (as I just can not get enough). 

I am always greeted with added touches and extra special things each time I return, they even handwrite my name and add touches to show their appreciation for my continuing returns. 

I honestly would recommend if you haven’t gave this hotel a try then you really are missing out. It’s super central close to anywhere you need to get to in london. The tube Liverpool Street station is right around the corner and parking is within the square or just as you walk out of the doors across the road is parking. 

Thank you for always looking after me and any of the guests I bring with me. I look forward to seeing you again soon. I miss my second home already 

Lots of love and well wishes to all the staff 

Kalya  ",5,2023,06,01
111,Lovely hotel with good customer service ,Our second stay here was just as good as the first :) guest experience manager Mary made sure that we had everything we needed and were looked after during our short stay. Great location and warm atmosphere. ,5,2023,05,31
111,Exceptional,"Big thank you to Mary and January for making our stay special and being so welcoming upon arrival and through our our stay. Such an amazing hotel. All staff our lovely and will cater to your needs. They go above and beyond for all guests.
Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Shower is brilliant too! Will definitely be going back highly  recommend.",5,2023,05,31
111,Perfect City Break 👌🏾,"Omg the spa was good, we always get wowchers to go there just for treatments. We stayed there overnight and got a 50 minute massage which came as part of the stay 
&& like at the rooftop there’s this restaurant called the aviary n they do the hotels room service imagine 
Plussss it’s literally in Shoreditch so clubs are superrrr close",5,2023,05,31
111,Birthday weekend treat,"We have just enjoyed an amazing weekend away celebrating my wife's 40th birthday. This hotel was recommended by a friend and I can't fault their recommendation. 
From arrival we were treated to some complimentary fizz and greeted by all the staff from the doorman to reception team who were all very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. Check in was really quick and easy and were told about all the restaurants and facilities, we booked breakfast in the rooftop aviary restaurant when we arrived. 
We then were shown to our room by Mary the guest manager and the whole welcome made the experience seem like  the treat the weekend was meant to be for my wife. 
The room was spacious and very comfortable,  everything was well kept and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and made for two very good nights sleep. 
Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant was excellent with a good selection of continental and cooked breakfast options with further options available to order. Any dietary requirements were well explained by the well informed staff.
The views over the city were excellent from the restaurant on a morning while having a relaxed breakfast. 
We were only 4 or 5 minutes walk from Moorgate station on the circle line which made travel very easy to get around the city. 
We unfortunately had other plans for the evenings at shows so didn't book into the rooftop bar but would definitely book next time we stay as it looked like a really cool bar to go to. Also we would have liked to visit the spa if we had more time, maybe next time....
When we checked out we were greeted by another guest manager who checked everything had met our needs during our stay. Simply put it had exceeded our expectations and we look forward to staying here again. ",5,2023,05,31
111,Consistent Comfort with a Personal Touch,"When you enter The Montcalm Royal London House Hotel, it's clear that you're stepping into a space that values quality service and guest experience. A key part of this inviting atmosphere is Mary, the guest experience manager.

Having stayed here before, I wondered if my past positive experiences could be replicated. Yet, Mary proved, once again, that her standard of service is consistently excellent. Her approach is both professional and warm, making you feel welcomed and valued. It's remarkable that she remembered small details from my previous visits and used them to personalize my stay – it was a thoughtful touch that didn't go unnoticed.

Mary's role in enhancing the hotel's offerings is vital. The little things she does, such as ensuring rooms are ready and addressing special requests, add up to make a big difference. It's these elements that make her stand out in a hotel as prominent as The Montcalm.

Her knowledge of the hotel and local area is comprehensive and helpful. Her suggestions for places to eat, shop, and visit were spot-on and enriched my experience of London. Mary clearly aims to make each guest's stay better, and she does so with efficiency and charm.",5,2023,05,31
111,Perfect for a city break,We had a gorgeous stay in the Mont Calm on a recent city trip. The hotel is gorgeous and just a short walk from Liverpool Street Station so it’s perfect if you plan to do some exploring. We were celebrating a birthday and Mary and the team went above and beyond to make sure we had a special stay. Will definitely be returning. ,5,2023,05,31
111,Made to feel like a celebrity ,"My sister and I spent 3 nights at the Montcalm Royal Hotel in London.
It's a beautiful luxurious hotel with a lovely down to earth feel.
All the staff were very professional and friendly.
They went above and beyond.
It was my birthday so they put a few extras in the room including  a free bottle of wine.
The Assistant Manager Mary showed me to our room personally because it was my birthday.
I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely  be back again sometime in the future ",5,2023,05,31
111,Amazing customer service!,"We came here for a couple of nights away for our wedding anniversary and Alberto and the team have been nothing but first class with their service. They've been nothing but lovely and we're very happy. A lovely hotel!

111,Royal London House is really Royal .. and felt like home,The hotel stay was very pleasant .. nice room clean and functional .. check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient .. i left my bag at reception the day of check-out while going around before my flight .. great terrace bar Avery for after dinner  with music and drink selection .. price was OK if compared to hotel quality .. i have been in more expensive hotel with much less appeal than RLH,5,2023,05,30
111,Wonderful experience,"The staff have been ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! Extremely professional, kind, helpful, generous, welcoming, and beyond caring, going above and beyond for me and making sure my experience is a greatly memorable one.

Notable mention for January, Warris, Dhruv, Nicoleta, Carina, Pruthvi. Love you all ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰",5,2023,05,30
111,Club lounge- great experience,"We visited the club lounge as part of a family trip , staying in a family suite. Eleny Swati was a superb host, and provided ice cold drinks, tortilla and salsas, olives and wine- keeping both the children and adults happy. Calm quiet atmosphere very friendly .",5,2023,05,29
111,Great service!,"The check in staff was very helpful and friendly! Always checking if I need anything. 
Service from Swati serving snacks and food was excellent! Have been staying here whenever I come to London and will always come back. ",5,2023,05,29
111,Highly recommend Hotel Montcalm!,Lovely hotel with a great location and 5 star service from ALL who work there.

Thank You!,5,2023,05,29
111,Good location luxurious hotel with a good price ,"Such a lovely hotel, really welcoming from the doormen to the reception. We were checked in early with a lovely lady January, so friendly ! The hotel is luxurious and has high spec rooms, nice late check out at 12pm also ! Very central on good bus routes and close to several tube stations ! The restaurant on the roof looked lovely, but u fortunately was booked up and was not able to accommodate us for food ! Swimming  pool and spa every well kept and very clean ! Would definitely stay again ",5,2023,05,28
111,Fantastic stay again in the City of London,"Absolutely fantastic stay again at the Montcalm Royal London. We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived at the front door. Reception staff were very helpful accommodating our early arrival and late checkout. The club lounge is a great addition to let you chill out and grab a snack or continental breakfast. This was our 2nd visit and won't be our last. Vary much our hotel if choice when coming to London now.  (5min walk form Liverpool Street Station and 40 mins from Stansted!)

If you fancy breakfast out there is an up and coming area nearby (Broadgait) with some wonderful eateries too.

Highly recommend to anyone treating themselves to a luxury weekend in London.",5,2023,05,28
111,Superb 5 star service standards - best hotel in London,"This hotel is a throwback. Remember when it felt special arriving and you felt you didn’t want to leave? Service impeccable and attention to detail first class. This is 5 star and an example to others in hospitality, in admittedly the toughest sector in the UK.",5,2023,05,28
111,"Thank you, great service 👍🏻","From arriving with a late check-in, to signing out of the spa, we got humble, friendly, efficient service by the reception, breakfast (shout out to Swati) and spa team.

111,Super nice staff and clean room,"Montcalm was beyond my expectation, not only value for money, but the experience was great! The staff is super friendly, from the moment I got off taxi to the check in process to room rest (with free macarons as greeting), everything was smooth! They have nice spa for you to rest and the staff (Ms Morgan) even went out of her way to book the spa for me when I was out for dinner! It was overall a pleasant stay and I will come back again!
",5,2023,05,27
111,Exceptional service from Prithvi,"We stayed here on a business trip and was greeted by Prithvi on reception. Prithvi organised our breakfast, talked to us about the hotel facilities and showed us how to book the spa. His knowledge about the local area was excellent and he made us feel very welcomed after a long drive and a day of meetings. We managed to upgrade our room at reception with Prithvi and the room was beautiful, really spacious, clean with all of the things that you would need. He even organised extremely fluffy warm dressing gowns for our visit to the spa sent up to our room. He really did make our stay. We visited the beautiful Aviary Rooftop bar while we were there and met with the manager and sampled our range of gins and rums and the wonderful Joao made us some beautiful cocktails. Everyone was very friendly and the service throughout was exceptional. ",5,2023,05,26
111,"Good Hotel, bad breakfast","Fairly priced and conveniently located close to Liv Street. Good building quality and large rooms. 
Breakfast was quite disappointing with an extremely limited selection of food at the buffet. I'm against wasting food, but there should be much more variety and quantity to satisfy the international demand this hotel is targeting.
Gym and sauna are ok, small and not premium in quality but still in line with market offering at this price tag",3,2023,05,25
111,Lovely hotel experience,"Lovely stay at Montcalm Royal London House during my solo trip! The breakfast here is lovely! Special thanks to Scoati, Nicolata! Lovely and sweet staff! Highly recommend to stay here if you are coming to London!",5,2023,05,23

January Stevens was exceptional in helping us with everything we needed - special thanks to her.",5,2023,05,23
111,Fantastic weekend stay,"I booked a stay at the Montcalm over the weekend to celebrate my partners birthday. The stay was amazing, the hotel is beautiful and the facilities are fantastic. We were greeted with glasses of prosecco and taken care of by the excellent duty manager January. She was so kind and decked our room out in happy birthday decorations and balloons whilst we were in the spa when she found out it was my partners birthday. The bedrooms are wonderful and the bed is extremely comfortable. The rooftop bar is also a great addition to the stay. Would definitely recommend a stay at the Montcalm! ",5,2023,05,22
111,Great hotel for business and pleasure!,"This is a wonderful hotel - well located, very warm welcome, excellent service and comfortable beds! January and Mary are always super helpful.

You really can tell a good hotel by how they deal with feedback - and their response to any query or request is always with a ""can do"" and friendly attitude.

It's a home away from home!",5,2023,05,22
111,Business stay,"Excellent service by Swati, Vatsel and Nicoleta at the breakfast. Smiling faces are the real breakfasts of the day. Montcalm as a whole has a great customer experience focus. Congrats to the team. My first stay and surely will not be the last one.",5,2023,05,22

111,"A stunning hotel in a great.location, service needs a polish","A very nice hotel conveniently located in the city of London, stunning roof top bar and restaurant with great views of London landmarks.

Room was clean and incredibly comfortable. 

Front of house was slow with the check-in and first room was not upto standard, however the 2nd room was perfect.

Lovely touches with the smart systems for lighting, heating.

Speaking with Alberto the following morning, changed by opinion from a 4* plus to a 5* hotel, genuinely he takes the customers very seriously

One last thing from me, the spa hS to be booked in advance if you want a swim? Given that covid is now over this does seem a little restrictive.. ",5,2023,05,19
111,Excellent Stay,"First stay here at the montcalm royal hotel. its a very nice hotel with a excellent location. The staff is very friendly and we had a very lovely welcome. Particularly the staff at the breakfast Dhruv, Nicoleta, Krasi was so nice and the service was top.

I think we will come back next time..
Thank you!!",5,2023,05,19
111,Outstanding Guest Service,"Hotel is centrally located and close to fantastic restaurants and bars (definitely check out Manteca for Italian food and Smoking Goat for Thai cuisine). Rooms are spacious but slightly dated. Fun rooftop bar as well! Highlight of the stay was the incredible Front desk/concierge service. Prithvi Kaloyan who worked the front desk when I stayed was OUTSTANDING!! He went above and beyond to answer any questions, to provide a highly comfortable stay and is just a genuinely good human being who truly knows the meaning of hospitality. Thank you, Prithvi!!",4,2023,05,19

111,"Luxury, Comfort, and Impeccable Service","Our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House was truly memorable. The check-in process was smooth and hassle-free, thanks to the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Despite arriving early, they had our rooms prepared and waiting for us. The cleanliness and comfort of the rooms were exceptional. The highlight for me was the indulgent rainfall shower, which added a touch of luxury to our stay. The Elemis shower products provided a delightful sensory experience. Highly recommended!""",5,2023,05,17
111,"Amazing service, fabulous staff, fantastic hotel","We are just on our way back from this hotel after selecting it for my sisters birthday celebrations. I can honestly say I can’t remember the last time I’ve encountered such genuine hospitality from every staff member we came across. Nothing was too much trouble, the guest experience manager January was super efficient at replying to any requests I had before our arrival, was on hand personally at check in and again on check out. Shay in the aviary was also fab in accommodating us changing reservations etc. You can clearly see why this hotel is rated so highly on service. We will definitely be returning again soon. 

Thank you all so much for a wonderful stay 😊",5,2023,05,14

The amenities, especially the spa, were so relaxing I didn't want to leave, as well as the staff - January the manager, was exceptionally warm and friendly and went out of her way to welcome us from start to finish. All the staff was extremely accommodating as well to help you out. 
Would highly recommend as a place for a staycation or even just to use the facilities for a little treat, it even includes a wonderful restaurant and rooftop bar with lovely views of central London / shard! 
Can't wait to come back again!",5,2023,05,10
111,Great hotel….not so sure about the area ,"This is a lovely hotel, we had a club room which included a continental breakfast and access to the lounge for complimentary drinks for a couple of hours. The staff were so friendly, in particular the doormen who always had a ‘welcome back’ for us. The only reason for marking this hotel down slightly was for the area, whilst Moorgate tube is only a 5 minute walk away, we didn’t feel there was much in the area in terms of bars/restaurants for people of our age (late 40’s). The rooftop bar had great views but a very young vibe. ",4,2023,05,09
111,Great Stay,"The staff at reception were friendly and efficient. I found the room to be quiet and comfortable. The gym was well equipped and clean, albeit in a fairly small space. The  breakfast and views from the top floor were very good.",5,2023,05,08
111,Fantastic Stay! Top Class! ,Fantastic stay - we were very well looked after. What a treat and surprise to have Coronation biscuits and chocolates as well as Prosecco and special balloons for our anniversary.

111,Quiet and nice,"Front desk manager (thank you!!) was most reassuring making my 16-hour journey a lot more bearable. Staff are friendly, helpful and professional. Sign up for the club benefits. The team at the club lounge are very welcoming. Special shout out to Daniel and Swati.",4,2023,05,05
111,Top quality for both facilities and staff,"A truly fantastic hotel with excellent, attentive and professional staff. My first stay here but what a great nights sleep.

The Montcalm staff gets it right!!",5,2023,05,02
111,Place to Celebrate special occasion.,"We stayed over this hotel to celebrate our anniversary. The whole reason behind us choosing this hotel again is last time when we have stayed over here the hotel  guest manager Ms January made so much impression by being so professional and helpful also was very swift with responding our needs which made us happily to choose this hotel again. Everything was GREAT !!! Staff were always around you and  professional, polite and eager to please you.

111,Tiny rooms and in a desolate part of London but not a bad hotel,"Location of this luxury hotel is in Shoreditch which closer to Liverpool station is becoming the next Soho. Smack in the middle across from Finsbury square is this luxury hotel attached to Long Bar shuffleboard bar, and close to getting very active Liverpool station area, with lots of bars and clubs. The hotel itself is not too large but has a downstairs bar and restaurant and smaller lobby. The rooms here, much like a lot of London hotels are tiny, smaller rooms, with just the bed and a small bathroom. The rooms here however are on the high tech side with touchscreen walls pads for all your heat and air, lights etc. I have to say the housekeeping and turndown service here is excellent and a pleasure to see a hotel that still cares about that. Beds are comfortable and the staff here is very pleasant. Prices are decent, even though this is in a quieter part of the city. I would recommend this hotel if you are staying here for business, not sure I would stay in this part of the city if I was not here on business..",4,2023,05,01
111,Great stay with partner,"Had such a great time with my partner. We used the executive lounge and Dhruv was an absolute pleasure- so helpful and honestly made our night so special. Service was great and some of the best we have encountered in London! 

Thanks so much! ",5,2023,05,01
111,An excellent stay and definitely to be repeated!,"An excellent stay and definitely to be repeated!  Easy walking distance from Moorgate tube, concierge was pleasant and courteous on our arrival.  Check-in was seamless and Mariano could not have been more helpful or more welcoming.  Room was slightly smaller than I expected (one doesn't aways have a picture of exact dimensions when one books!) but more than adequate for our needs.  The Aviary rooftop bar was very fine with views over London - if any criticism could be levied it would only be at the cocktail waiter, who really needed to be just that little bit less 'inconvenienced' by his customers!  (If you don't like the job, get another one!)  A perfect breakfast with lots of decent hot and cold food, and the best vegetarian sausages going.  (These things can be a bit hit-and-miss with hotels, but not at The Montcalm.)  Overall, an outstanding visit and we will certainly be returning to stay here; cannot recommend it enough.  Well done The Montcalm!",5,2023,05,01
111,Fabulous hotel top class service,"Stayed here for a conference the staff were amazing and service excellent 
I have stayed in many hotels but this was up with the best of them. The bed was so comfortable that I asked what brand it was so I could get one myself 
I would highly recommend this hotel and location was great",5,2023,05,01
111,Great hotel with good food and very friendly staff,Great hotel to stay in London. Especially front desk and Concierge Daniel helped us organize many things incl. a private Chauffeur to the Manchester United Soccer game. All five stars and 100% recommend.,5,2023,04,30
111,Recent stay for 60th birthday,"I took my mum for an overnight stay at the Montcalm  for her 60th birthday. I informed the hotel of this prior to my stay and they added lovely little touches to the room to make the stay extra special. Upon arrival to the hotel you are greeted by very welcoming and helpful staff and a glass of fizz upon checking in. We were shown to our room and our weekend bags brought up for us. As we entered the room, there was a lovely array of happy birthday balloons set on the bed and two mini bottles of wine with a handwritten welcome note wishing a pleasant stay and happy birthday celebrations. The hotel is a good location from the theatres. We took an Uber from the hotel to the theatre which was about 15 minutes. All staff were very polite and helpful throughout the stay. Room service was quick and I would recommend the burger. On check out day we used the spa facilities (needs to be pre-booked and 30min slots each day of stay)  but a little disappointed that the jacuzzi was out of order. You are instructed to take robes and towels from your room to the spa but no robes were in the room. Nevertheless, as soon as I called the front desk to inform them of this, two robes were brought up to the room. A pleasant stay overall and lovely experience for a special occasion. ",4,2023,04,30
111,Dhruv is the man that will make us come back...,Great location. We were so well looked after in the lounge that it made it all worthwhile. Dhruv and Daniel are the best. Thanks a lot for making our stay so enjoyable. Without Dhruv it would have been drab :),5,2023,04,29
111,Excellent,"I've been to many hotels all over the world and since spending the weekend here I've discovered somewhere ill come back to in future. Such lovely staff and care taken. The 10th floor bar with the views is cool. I have not come across a single issue. The lounge is also a great addition to the room I booked. Special mention to Dhruv, and Daniel. ",5,2023,04,29
111,Just amazing.,"The most amazing welcome and stay!!
The entire team are just wonderful and can not do enough for you. 

The concierge are brilliant. They are so knowledgeable and helpful. 

I love this hotel and has become a home from home. ",5,2023,04,28
111,Far too few staff for the numbers,"Stayed here last night as Part of a conference
I left my bag early in the morning for ease of check in
When it came to checking in, it took well over half an hour
Really badly organised with far too few staff
Room was nice and bed lovely and comfortable.
The window was absolutely filthy and you couldn’t see out of it
Meal in the evening was really badly organised used with again, far too few staff on.
The meal came out warm but not hot but tasted nice
It’s a shame but for such a big hotel it was let down by lack of people",3,2023,04,27
111,A ray of happiness for a weary traveller,"Don't usually write reviews because I travel and stay in hotels so frequently and to be honest very few stand-out.

However, I turned up last minute to the Montcalm after a booking error with another hotel feeling stressed and anxious, 

The team on the front desk were simply fantastic and Lamine was a delight. My whole experience here was at another level (big hotel groups Hilton, Mariott, Radisson etc)  should look closely at how well their service staff are trained and how they deliver service excellence.

Final shout out to the breakfast restaurant M'aitre D' because delivers great service.

Well done Montcalm.. keep it up!",5,2023,04,27
111,Montcalm Royal top notch experience in a luxurious hotel,"It was an absolute treat to stay at the Montcalm Royal  last week. Mary Philippiah welcomed us with a warm smile and made us feel very special. The room was cozy, the  beds comfortable, good shower, breakfast really good and the service outstanding. A special shoutout to Daniel in reception who was a fountain of knowledge about the neighbourhood and transport. He directed us to some fabulous restaurants and I will be sharing that information with my friends who live locally. I will definitely be back. ",5,2023,04,27
111,Great location and comfortable room,"We enjoyed a two night stay at the Royal London. The location is great, easy to walk to the tube, the City, and the East End. We selected the club room and enjoyed the continental breakfast and the happy hour, but probably not enough to make it worth the added cost. Out room was large with high ceilings and nice decor. The only thing that wasn't great were the pillows, but I'm sure we could have requested different ones if we had been there longer. The staff were all very friendly and in addition to their own restaurants there's a sports pub/brewery attached to the hotel as well.",5,2023,04,27
111,Underwhelmed.,"I stayed one night for business and booked my room on an Expedia deal, so I wonder if I was deliberately given a poor room and experience because of the discounted price paid (£228 for a single room/room only on a weeknight). 
Check-in was fine, although they were quite insistent about wanting to see photo ID, which I didn't have. 
I did not experience/wasn't offered any of the hotel's advertised amenities e.g. no offer of a pillow menu. 
The welcome card in my room was made out to a completely different person. 
The bed in my room was very soft and had a noticeable dip in the middle of the mattress, which really isn't good enough for 5*. 
The hotel is supposed to have 24 hour room service, but there was no paper menu for room service in the room and no electronic menu on the TV, so I actually ordered delivery. 
Despite me checking with Reception in advance that it was OK to order delivery of food to my room, when my food arrived I received a call from the Concierge telling me to come down and collect it myself.
The bathroom was shower only and no bath. 
The net curtains in the room were grimy and sticky. Aside from this, the room was very clean.
I arranged a late check-out for 12pm in order to do an important Teams conference from my room. Despite having arranged a late check out and put Do Not Disturb on the door, Housekeeping *hammered* on my door three times between 11am and 12.30pm, badly interrupting my conference. 
Really not a great experience overall. 
Positives were the location, pleasant staff and Elemis toiletries.",2,2023,04,26
111,Fantastic customer service,It was my boyfriend’s 25 birthday and I booked a stay at the Montcalm. The manager (January) and the rest of the staff were absolutely fantastic. Extremely serviceable and always with a smile. One of the balloon decorations were being difficult and January was able to get it fixed and hand delivered to my room. My boyfriend had the best time. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much,5,2023,04,25
111,Loved the whole experience!,We had a great stay at The Montcalm Royal London House. Mary greeted us on arrival and escorted us to our room. We were celebrating a birthday and they had made a great effort to help us. The spa experience was amazing and so was the the bar on the top floor. The views were beautiful. Thank you to everyone at Montcalm for making our experience so enjoyable. ,5,2023,04,25
111,Great stay for family celebration,"We stayed with our 3 kids (18,21,22) - great hotel, staff really friendly and helpful. Great rooms and great rooftop bar - but make sure you book if you want a seat! Fantastic location for city, west end or night out in shoreditch.",5,2023,04,25

111,Just WOW!,"It was our anniversary and the hotel left balloons on our bed and chocolates woth a card. 

The hotel is beautiful and stylish. The service is impeccable, rooms and facilities are lovely. We used the spa area and this was clean and tranquil- you must remember to come down in your gown and to bring your own towel from your room. Dinner in the Avairy was delightful and the restaurant/bar had a good vibe with gorgeous London roof top views. 

Check in and check out were straight forward with no ques and we were offered refreshments. A manager, Mary came to say goodbye and to personally check we were happy with our stay.

We enjoyed our stay so much we have booked again for two nights in the summer! This is an expensive hotel but so worth the cost!",5,2023,04,25
111,Restaurant and Spa day,"We had a wonderful day at this restaurant and hotel. The cuisine was delicious, and we enjoyed the relaxing pool and Jacuzzi. It was a great day spent with family, and we highly recommend this place.

111,Fantastic Stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Montcalm. From the moment we arrived, the staff were super friendly, helpful and accommodating. Our luggage was brought to our room and there was a glass of Prosecco on arrival which was a lovely touch. Our room was very comfortable and had a lovely view of Finsbury Square. The rooftop bar had lovely skyline views and breakfast the next morning was fabulous. A special mention to Claudia at Reception who made sure we were well looked after during our stay. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and will defiantly be returning to The Montcalm in the near future. Thank you! ",5,2023,04,24

We will be coming back in the future but I cannot recommend this place highly enough ! Definitely worth it ☺️",5,2023,04,23
111,If your on the fence where to stay it is a must. Very close to train station made getting around London a breeze.,"We stayed for a few days at the Montcalm Royal London House and had a an incredible experience. Francesca was at the front desk and checked us in, walked us personably to our room to ensure everything was as it should be. She was present when we checked out encouraged us to  email her next time we came to London as she would make sure we were well looked after. It was our anniversary they had our room decorated with balloons, rose petals, chocolates and a sweet card from the staff. The room was very clean and comfortable. Bed and pillows were amazing. The rain shower was amazing with HOT water loved it after a day of touring, it felt so luxurious as did the Elemis shower products. The room was well appointed with a Nespresso machine, (amazing biscuits which I asked for extras every morning!)  There was a large bottle of water which was replaced each day, refrigerator, robes, slippers and several other necessities. Bell staff, was so gracious and always remembered our names. David Todorov the concierge was so very kind and professional. On our first day trying to get our boundaries he helped with maps and transit, it  was truly a pleasure to see him as he always had a smile and a greeting for us our entire stay.  We at in the restaurant and it was very good and there cocktails were amazing. Picture of us from the rooftop lounge.  We ate breakfast out on our own. All in all, I had a wonderful stay at this hotel and will definitely return next time I'm in London. The staff at this hotel really make your stay in London that much better! Highly recommended.

111,Showing long lost Canadian cousins around London.,"We decided to have a short break in London with a view to visit Spitalfields and the east end. This hotel is perfect, with great deals and friendly staff. It’s a short walk to the underground station for people wanting to go a bit further.
The rooms are well appointed and quiet.",5,2023,04,17
111,The Montcalm-London’s premier hotel,"The service was pristine and our luggage was handled with care. Each employee treated us with respect and made sure that our needs were addressed. The room was spotless and filled with the amenities of a 5 star hotel, and the spa and gym had all the signifiers of a hotel that is handled only by the best of the best. Checking out was made easy by Mizuki and other staff made sure we had a great experience. 10/10.",5,2023,04,17
111,Really recommend,We booked here as it was my boyfriends birthday. We were given champagne on arrival and the staff were so friendly and welcoming. I called in advance to arrange balloons in the room which they said is complimentary. They put petals on the bed along with balloons and a box of chocolates with a birthday card. The staff couldn’t have been more friendly to us.,5,2023,04,16
111,My partner’s birthday,"This is our 2nd stay at the Montcalm hotel, me and my partner’s first time staying with them, I couldn’t ask for anything more, the staff were very welcoming and friendly, as soon as we walked in the front door. They made us feel like we walked into our own home so to say. When coming back for our 2nd time, I couldn’t say anything change but became even more friendlier and welcoming. They made sure that we knew where everything was and knew if we wanted to book for the spa or restaurant, we knew what to do and how, on departure on both stays, we were greeted by one of the hotels managers who, was very friendly and asked how our stay was etc. but I could say, that we would always recommend this hotel for a stay first or many more, as a place in a great spot, too see the sights of London with easy transportation or even walking distance away from the hotel, there’s nothing I could say bad, as it was tip top and couldn’t ask for them to change anything ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2023,04,16
111,Calm nights at Montcalm,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel as part of our silver wedding celebrations. This was an excellent choice, because we could not have had a better experience. From the moment we arrived, all staff members were welcoming and wonderful, and Mary and her colleagues had been busy arranging our room with celebratory gifts. The staff is this hotel's biggest asset. We dined at the Aviary Restaurant, which was also very good. The hotel is quite modern, and in a central location, especially for access to the City. We would definitely stay again. ",5,2023,04,16
111,Superb Saturday night stay,"We had an amazing stay for my Fiancés Birthday, don’t the moment we arrived the staff were all extremely helpful and professional. Vito Masi helped organise the stay and was on hand to show us to our room and welcome us. The Aviary bar and terrace was a superb place to enjoy a cocktail in the afternoon sun. We also had club lounge access which offered a great selection of drinks and an extensive continental breakfast in the morning. The room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. We used the spa facilities in the morning also which again was excellent. Nothing to fault at all about our stay and will most definitely be returning. ",5,2023,04,16
111,"Great place, great staff","We only stayed for one night, but the team were so welcoming and made us feel special. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The swimming pool and Spa facilities were great but what made our stay special was the atmosphere created by the staff. Daniel,Head Concierge, made us feel at home. Reception staff were great. Nothing was too difficult. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to friends and family. ",5,2023,04,16
111,Excellent service,"I had an amazing time. 
The service was great  and I really appreciate Prithvi and Mahamodul for their excellent service throughout my stay!

111,Great Stay and Great Location,"Had a brilliant stay over the weekend. Great service, amazing rooftop bar and restaurant. Room was very nice and spacious. The night team of Prithvi, Lameen and Waris catered to our every need and we’re super helpful and accommodating. Definitely be back. 10/10",5,2023,04,15
111,Great place to stay in a good location. Good for business.,"Just a good hotel. Not trying to be super stylish or ultra trendy, just does the basics very well.
Good size rooms, quiet, nice bathrooms, good lighting.
Restaurants are good, and it's in a good location so plenty of options elsewhere anyway.
The WiFi in the rooms is also really good, which is perfect for business stays.",5,2023,04,14
111,Work Stays,"I always stay in the Montcalm when I come to London and I am never left disappointed. The Aviary breakfast is lovely, the comfort and options within the rooms are amazing and not to mention the lovely staff - especially Mahmodu who always ensures I have a great stay, along with Waris. Couldn’t recommend it more and I look forward to my next stay. ",5,2023,04,14
111,Amazing staff!,"Fantastic service, all of the staff were incredibly helpful and polite. They went above and beyond to make our stay memorable for my husbands birthday (decorated the room with balloons and left a small box of chocolates and a birthday card) and just generally really impressive service for such a good value priced hotel. They could not do enough for us and made us feel very welcome, from the front door staff to the check in/reception staff to the management that personally came and wished my husband a happy birthday and a pleasant stay. Actual room was very clean and modern and the hotel is in a good location too.",5,2023,04,13
111,Kids are about as welcome as a fart in a space suit,"Great location. Welcoming and attentive staff. Lovely rooms. The continental breakfast was spot on. The room we were given hadn't been cleaned yet when we first went into it, but the staff were very apologetic and it wasn't a big deal, mistakes happen. 

However, it was a pity the stay and experience was ruined as kids are not welcome. I stayed with my wife, daughter (9) and son (14). There was more time spent explaining where kids were and were not allowed to be, and when, during check in than anything else. For example, children are not allowed in the pool after 1200 (!), this was explained at check-in. There is a Bar (always empty) at the front entrance of the Hotel that children are not allowed in, at any time, but they are allowed in the restaurant located <6 feet from the Bar area. Totally bizarre. This was sadly not explained at check-in, but explained by the Barman as ""your kids are not allowed in here"". I assumed he was joking, it was 1800 and the Bar was empty. Hotels are meant to be inclusive and welcoming places, it is the 21st century after all. 

I recommend if travelling alone or just with adults. But unless you want your kids treated as if they have lepresy, avoid it. ",3,2023,04,12
111,Staff,"The Hotel was outstanding.
The Service was very good and everytime we needef help Lamine and Breetve was there for us. The facility was clean and it had a very nice rooftopbar. The spa was also clean ",5,2023,04,11

111,Best stay in London!,"Wow! My partner and I have stayed at a few hotels in London but this is by far the best.
From the warm welcome, to the amazing night sleep in the most comfiest bed. 
The manager, Mary saw us to our room with the bellboy who willingly carried our bags. Mary’s people skills are amazing, the rest of the staff were on point. The doormen were extremely polite and a lovely young gentleman welcomed us with a glass of Prosecco. We didn’t get to use the spa facilities or visit the rooftop bar, however that gives us an excuse to come back! 
We let the hotel know we were staying to celebrate our anniversary and they decorated the room which made the experience that little bit lovelier, they really catered to our needs and made us feel comfortable.
The room was spacious, with underfloor heating in the bathroom, and smart lights. The cleaners ensured to tidy our room upon request and did a brilliant job of it.
I’d recommend this hotel to anyone. ",5,2023,04,11

111,"STAFF BRILLIANT, GREAT LOCATION AND VALUE FOR MONEY",I have to say the staff at this hotel are amazing. Nothing seems too much trouble for them. The rooms are nice and clean. I would say the TV's need to be updated with Netflix ect but that's only a small matter. It's in a great location for Liverpool street tube station and Mooregate station so it's very easy to get around. Overall I'd recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again,4,2023,03,28
111,Great hotel,"Great hotel, staff is really nice, rooms are comfy. Prithvi, Lameen and Roman at the reception are great people! I stay there approx 2 times a month and the staff is always welcoming and helpful. I recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,03,28
111,Great hotel with wonderful staff,"My friend and I stayed here for three nights last week. A lovely place to stay within a 5 minute walk of Moorgate Station. The doorman, concierge and reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful on our arrival and although early, our room was made available to us. It was spotless  and very comfortable with Elemis products in bathroom. The staff are amazing and nothing is too much bother. 
 We enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the club lounge waited on by Swati, Krusi and Andrey who made sure all our needs were catered for. We were always warmly welcomed each morning.
In the evenings we we were also greeted warmly by staff in the club lounge, a special mention for Aakriti who made sure we were comfortable and well looked after. All in all a very positive and pleasant experience. I would certainly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,03,27
111,Luxury 5* experience ,"Wow where do I start. 
Booked  The Montcalm for my mums 50th birthday and boy did they deliver. Our experience from start to finish was top tier. They treated every guest with respect and luxury. From champagne on arrival to late checkout, they were very accommodating. I need ti give a special thanks to all the staff but mainly January Stevenz. She made sure our experience was amazing, she paid attention to detail and it was exceptional. She made sure the balloons were well placed, the rose petals were perfect, the champagne was chilled and fruits and macaroons were beautiful presented. She went above and beyond to make sure my mum had the best day. I really appreciate it and I genuinely couldn’t recommend this place enough. Thank you so much for making our weekend special ❤️",5,2023,03,27

The stay was for my birthday and they kindly set up balloons in the hotel room and macaroons laid out with a hand written note. We were greeted at the door by a doorman who took our bags. Checked in all smoothly. We were then escorted to our room by the manager January Stevens who was so lovely, all the staff are actually. For the price point you honestly are getting 5*+ service. Definitely will be retuning. Thank you for making it so special.",5,2023,03,27

111,Wonderful hotel,"We have just returned from an outstanding one night stay at royal London house Montcalm. We would firstly like to thank Mary Philippiah
Assistant Guest Experience I think, what an amazing lady, all the requests were fulfilled and delivered plus more. The hotel staff are all next level and very helpful, the rooms very clean. One  minor issue was the iPad which controls the heating was not responding, the breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The spa was again very clean and sauna steam room and hot tub all nice and warm unlike some other spa hotel we been where they are not as warm as they should be. We forgot a tooth brush and razor we informed reception who kindly delivered to our room within seconds, nothing was too much to ask , will 100 percent be coming back to this hotel in the future. Regards Chris ",5,2023,03,25

111,AMAZING stay!! ,"What a fantastic stay we had! When we arrived we were taken to our room by Mary the manager. They had decorated our room for my birthday, such a lovely touch with macaroons and a birthday card. The room was spotless with a gorgeous bathroom and huge bed!! We visited the aviary bar in the evening and the cocktails were amazing alongside the view, definitely worth a visit. We also used the gym and spa which was spotless and really easy to book. We would 100% visit the Montcalm again. Mary also took the time to wish us well when we departed. The staff were absolutely incredible and Mary’s customer service was outstanding, she is an absolute credit to the hotel! Thank you for such a wonderful birthday trip I will never forget. ",5,2023,03,25
111,Lovely hotel & staff,"Lovely hotel and super staff. 
We were there for my wifes birthday and the staff arranged a lovely surprise in the room on arrival. 
We also had a mini crisis where I thought my wallet was missing - staff were super helpful even though it transpired (embarrassingly) it had got wedged between the side of the bed & bedside cabinet.
One of the managers, January, came to check with us personally on check out everything was ok. Would definitely stay again.",5,2023,03,25

111,Can’t complain,"Nice clean rooms, wonderful staff, unfortunately the sauna was not working and pool had too much chlorine. I breathed in too much chemicals ended up with a headache. Also breakfast could have been better .. needs variety not same thing everyday,  but all in all lovely place in central location. Easy to access transportation links( underground and bus).  Rooftop restaurant was lovely.. ",4,2023,03,23
111,Home from home,"Best Hotel in London for sound-proofed rooms, comfort and service in its category in my opinion. 5 minutes walk from Moorgate station. A warm welcome awaits. Staff are efficient, well-trained and friendly. Can't fault it. ",5,2023,03,23
111,Great stay 😀,"My wife and I visited for a weekend in March 23 and the experience was fantastic from start to finish.  A great hotel in a great location.  The staff are warm and welcoming.  Mary at front of house was professional and ensured our stay was perfect (making the room look nice for my wife's birthday on arrival). The Strawberry Water in reception is amazing too. Absolutely nothing negative to say about this place..it's just great, and will visit again. Thank you Montcalm, Mary and staff :) ",5,2023,03,21
111,Best staycation in London!!,"January is AMAZING. My first stay here, chose this hotel for my partner’s birthday. Our room was upgraded and decorated with birthday balloons and rose petals.

Loved it, would definitely stay again!!

111,"Some parts five star, others not so much","Overall, we had a great experience here. The room (on floor 7) was clean, modern and comfortable. It was quiet and the bed was comfy and there are lots of extras like a tv that is easy to use, under floor heating in the bathroom a mini coffee machine and free water. The spa is tiny and needs to be booked, but it is really nicely done and was never too busy.

The staff in the actual hotel were really nice and helpful and the breakfast room and lounge bar was great. It was particularly nice to go and get a complimentary drink with snacks in the evening before heading out. 

There were some elements that didn’t feel quite 5 star. Firstly the bars as you come into the reception were noisy and crowded with really drunk people. It wasn’t exactly a welcoming environment. Appreciate that the hotel staff can’t really do anything about that but it detracted from the experience for us. 

Secondly we ordered breakfast in the Aviary the first day. Again, appreciate that it might be a different company, but we felt that this was encouraged. The actual experience was a bit chaotic. Although I ordered veggie breakfast, there was was nothing out and I had to go and order it and wait for it. Also had to go and ask for a spoon then ketchup. It felt a bit like their first run at hosting. The vege breakfast, when it arrived was beautifully presented but we much preferred breakfast downstairs where you could get a good selection of a continental breakfast and it felt unhurried. It seemed like they were very keen for us to pay the extra for the Aviary. 

There were some minor niggles that could have easily been sorted with better communication. For example, we weren’t told that you had to take your own towels to the spa and had just put on the robes and drop all the way up in the lift. As there was no heated rail in the bathroom, the robes stayed damp for the whole of the stay. 

The panel that controlled the heating glowed blue all night, meaning the room was never completely dark and disrupted our sleep. I read in other reviews that you could ask for a cover. Why not just leave the cover in the room? 

Overall a great experience. The staff were impeccable, always saying good morning and offering to help. This was not only reception staff but all the staff including the maintenance staff and cleaning staff. The spa was a nice addition and overall room quality was good. It’s missing a little bit of the exclusivity that you would expect in a truly 5 star hotel but I would definitely return.",4,2023,03,20
111,Amazing 6 nights stay at the montcalm,"I am writing this review on my last day of my stay of 6 nights at the montcalm. Its been an amazing stay. All the staff doormens, reception staff and especially the lounge staff has been really helpful. I would specifically like to mention the always smiling staff at the lounge like Akruti, Dhruv, Swati and Daniel who specially made all the efforts to make my business trip much more enjoyable. They always had the best suggestions in terms of attractions and food when I had a chat with them. In terms of suggestions, I would request the hotel management to consider including some Indian breakfast options and to add more veg and chicken based options for room service.",5,2023,03,20
111,Awesome lounge,The service is excellent. Dhruv and Aakriti are super helpful. The drinks are absolutely up to the mark. We'll definitely recommend this and sure to visit place. Hoping to stay here my next trip. Thanks for the hospitality.,5,2023,03,20
111,Top London stay,"Lovely hotel in a convenient location for routes to the West End, great rooms, excellent bar. Would recommend the Club Lounge, where we enjoyed superb service from the delightful Swati and Dhour. Highly recommend.",5,2023,03,19
111,Service was wonderful,"A lovely hotel in the heart of London. The service we received here was wonderful. We were greeted with a glass of Prosecco on arrival as it was St Patrick’s Day. The hotel had also arranged balloons and Prosecco in our bedroom as it was my birthday. 

We used the spa which was really lovely. You do have to book this but understand why, as it’s relatively small so imagine it’s to ensure it doesn’t become too busy. 

We also had some cocktails on the roof top bar. A lovely view but quite pricey, but then I guess you’re paying for the view 

It was the service which made this hotel. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2023,03,19
111,Loved my experience @,Best customer service especially in the club lounge by Swatting & Dhour ! Loved my experience here the Montcalm hotel .. definitely coming back again to stay as I believe it’s one of the best five star hotels in london,5,2023,03,18
111,Amazing hotel with amazing staff,"The hotel is beautiful and the service perfect nothing is too much trouble
The room we have is amazingly comfortable with everything you need and more 
The staff are all really helpful and friendly and accommodating to any special needs during our stay",5,2023,03,18
111,All around great hotel!,"We have now stayed at the Montcalm a few times, and it has since become a favourite. The facilities, rooms and location are great. The staff amazing and January made are stay even more special as we checked out, ensuring we had a lovely stay with them. This time it was for a birthday, the staff decorated the room with balloons and we had some complimentary chocolates! I cannot rate this hotel enough, we will defiantly be coming back next time we have a trip booked.",5,2023,03,18
111,One day family treat,"Good facilities and nice rooms. Great location for an east end London experience.
Some of the staff like Bhargav was excellent at helping and being courteous throughout our one day special stay.
The pool is small but ok although the service could be sleeker and more welcoming from some staff, kids may not be very found on in the spa/pool. ",4,2023,03,16
111,Awesome experience at the club lounge,"The ambience of the club lounge was very nice and the service was quick. Special shoutout to Aakriti who managed the evening well, and gave good recommendations since we were new to the place. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends. ",5,2023,03,15
111,THE BEST EVER!!!!,"From the warm welcome to the time we left. The staff were just absolutely amazing! Mary made our stay just the best. This is the second time here for us and we’ve already booked a third! 

We want to stay every weekend if we could!!!",5,2023,03,14
111,Experience,"Brilliant Hotel, would recommend to anyone who’s visiting London! All the staff were amazing! Special mention for Dhauv brilliant service everyday. Food was great, as well as free drinks from 17:00 -20:30",5,2023,03,14
111,A quick stop over …,"I arrived early evening, checked in which was very efficient and went to my room. The room quality was first rate, the bed superb and all you need available. I was meeting colleagues for dinner; I asked for a taxi, take a seat sir and within 5 mins I’m on my way. Now this all may seem run of the mill, but it’s about feeling welcomed and appreciating a seamless service. Top draw I reckon. Thank you.",5,2023,03,13
111,"Great stay, wonderful service","Great hotel, book if you can you won’t regret it. Good hotel facilities, nice spa and excellent service. Particular mention to Swatii Dhouv for her service in the breakfast room. Well done 👏🏻. Make sure you spend some time up in the Aviary, roof top bar  Will stay here again soon",5,2023,03,13
111,Perfect weekend,"We stayed at the Montcalm this weekend and felt compelled to comment on how lovely our stay was. 

The hotel itself is beautiful inside. We were given Prosecco on arrival whilst we checked in, then the head concierge took our bags and gave us a tour of our room, showing us how to use all the facilities. Believe his name was Daniel, he was lovely! 

The room itself was perfect for what we needed. The beds were so comfy, we slept brilliantly during our day. The room was equipped with everything you’d expect from an upmarket hotel; rain shower, underfloor heating, coffee machine etc - everything we needed for a comfortable stay. 

The staff are an absolute credit to the Montcalm. Everyone we came into contact with was so polite and friendly - they really can’t do enough for you, even offered us tea and coffee whilst we waited for our taxi. They looked after us and made it an experience right until the moment we left. 

Located in Finsbury Square, the hotel is perfectly located for Shoreditch and two tube stops - just a 5/10 minute walk to both Old Street and Moorgate. The square is a nice quiet spot so feels more peaceful than central. 

Two things to note - 
1. When we checked in we were advised we’d have some complimentary time in the spa. It would be great if this was made clear at the time of booking as we’d definitely have brought a swimming costume to use the sauna if we’d have known 

2. The “long arm” bar is very… interesting. The sports bar style feels very out of place with the rest of the hotel. Would be lovely if that was more of a relaxed upmarket spot. They do have the roof terrace but we didn’t use that during our stay due to the cold weather. 

Overall a brilliant stay at the Montcalm. Would visit again and definitely recommend!",5,2023,03,12
111,Saimon,"Saimon has been excellent throughout our stay from start to finish, he has made our time here very comfortable and enjoyable , he couldn’t have been more helpful. 

We will definitely come back again and that’s thanks to saimon.",5,2023,03,12
111,Absolutely delightful stay! Genuinely happy to recommend.,"We are from the US and have stayed in many 5-Star hotels. This is now one of our favorites! We have never had a hotel be so attentive to our needs whether we needed a room clean after the standard time, linens, water, information, anything! And always making us feel it was their pleasure to do so. We especially appreciated the help of Prithui and Kaloyan at the front desk with many special requests from a late night convenience store to bandaids and train strike work-arounds. Just fantastic! 

It was rainy and cold while we were here and every time we left the hotel, umbrellas were offered and doors opened. When we returned we soaked in the hot tub in the spa and truly it was the best way to warm up having walked everywhere in London and getting chilled to the bone. They asked that we make a reservation for spa time, but that was easy and allowed us ample time to ourselves. 

We decided on a taxi last minute the morning of our departure and they immediately had a large custom sized car within minutes for us. Saimon arranged everything for our travel to the airport so that we wouldn’t have to hassle with changing trains  carting our luggage around. They treated us like royalty. There was no way a week could hold all our ambitious destinations but hope to be back and to stay at the Montcalm Royal London House again!",5,2023,03,12
111,Great experience,"Had a lovely stay at the Montcalm Royal London. The rooms were spacious and clean. And we received excellent service from the moment we checked in. Staff were very friendly and helpful, special thanks to Swati from the club lounge. ",5,2023,03,11
111,A lovely stay framed a wonderful weekend!!!,"This was all built around proposing to my girlfriend, so there'd been a quick conversation with reception when I checked on the booking. So it was a nice surprise to see they'd made a heart on the bed with rose petals.

Everything about the stay was perfect, Mary and her team really did go out of their way to make us feel welcome. Swafij in the members lounge as well. 

The bed was extremely comfortable, and underfloor heating in the bathroom, we would most definitely come back!

And, I should say, she said ""Yes"" :)",5,2023,03,10
111,Delightful stay,"A lovely friendly greeting on arrival. Helpful staff with luggage and very relaxed booking in at reception. Every member of the team were warm and friendly, there for our every need and nothing was too much trouble.
Hospitality / service of very high  quality. 
Bedroom / bathroom all clean and very comfortable, with all facilities  provided. The igloo and fondue food an amazing experience. We highly recommend the exceptional stay, to my friends. Very grateful for your care and detail of making our stay Happy. Thank you.",5,2023,03,09
111,The staff is absolutely amazing!,My husband and I had the best time staying at The Montcalm Royal London House. It is in a perfect location. The rooms are amazing. We added the Club Room to our stay. It is well worth it. Andreea & Daniel were absolutely amazing. They care and it shows. Their hospitality went above and beyond our expectations. They are both truly an asset to The Montcalm. We look forward to coming back here to stay on our next visit.,5,2023,03,09
111,Fantastic romantic birthday stay with my husband,"I booked this hotel for my husband's birthday for one night after searching for many spa hotels this hotel caught my eye. 
We are warmly welcomed by staff as soon as we set foot into the hotel. 
We were upgraded to the suite room, I had initially booked the montcalm club double room. I requested for balloons in advance and the room was decorated so beautifully, we also received macrons and a birthday card which was a sweet touch. Mary was very attentive and showed us to our room which we found very hospitable.

The room: well where do I begin. The room was extremely comfortable to be in. The mood lighting was one of our favourite features of the room. The underfloor heating was great as it was pretty cold outside. The bed was soft and cosy and the bathroom was very high end with a makeup mirror which I found very useful. Everything was nice and clean. 
I loved the tablet feature outside the bathroom where we could change the lights/heating I've never seen this at any other hotel.
The tea and coffee provided was of high quality and good variety and we loved the biscuits that came with it. 
It was nice to have a bottle of water and glasses there for us too.

We loved the fact that we were able to watch sky TV for a while before setting off to explore the hotel. 
The only thing I struggled with slightly is that there wasn't a full length mirror or any mirrors in the room so getting ready meant going into the bathroom and doing my makeup there.

The restaurant: We went to the Aviary restaurant where we were welcomed by the lovely staff. We had the teriyaki salmon, chips and drinks which were all delicious. A lovely lady named Sakina asked if she can make a drink for me as I wasn't sure what I wanted. She made me the most delicious drink and also have me the recipe when I asked for it. She was really sweet and accommodating. A special thanks to her I was unable to meet her at breakfast. The views from the restaurant were absolutely picturesque and we managed to get some lovely pictures. Loved the entire bird theme especially the peacock. 

The spa: I was slightly surprised that we didn't have robes in our wardrobe as its a spa hotel however once we called reception the robes were sent to us straight away.
On arrival, a lovely gentleman (didn't catch his name but please do thank him) asked us to sign in. He was very accomdating and even got us orange juice which was very kind of him. The steam and sauna was really relaxing and it was nice as there weren't too many people which gave us the 'couple feeling'.
We managed to spend over an hour in the pool and jacuzzi. Magical and soothing is an understatement to describe the feeling in the jacuzzi and pool. The lighting, seating and cleanliness was impressive. We also loved the decor like the plants. There was lemon and 
cucumber water available which was extremely
 refreshing. 

The sleep: we had an extremely cosy and relaxed
 sleep. No noise. The bed was soft and there were
 a range of pillows to sleep on. 

The following morning: by now I wished I had booked 2 nights but couldn't as husband was due to go back to work. Checkout was quick and Mary met with us as we left to see that everything went well which was very professionally and caring of her. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone for any occasion or just to relax and unwind. Husband was very impressed with the hotel and my choice of hotel :) which wouldn't have been possible without the kind staff. 

We  would like to thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for being so welcoming, attentive to detail and warm in nature. We had an amazing time celebrating the birthday and shall be back soon. 

Keep up the 5 star work. We can see how passionate you all are with your roles and visitors.",5,2023,03,08
111,"? Breach of trust/security, discriminative guest treatment and sub-par customer service for a 5 star hotel","What went wrong? Breach of trust/security, discriminative guest treatment and sub-par customer service for a 5 star hotel
Montcalm Royal London Hotel: Check-in: March 2, v2023; Check out: March 6, 2023
Summary: We had poor service at check-in, our money was stolen from the room and for any request or complaint we had, the hotel made us feel like we were being difficult or we wanted to get something for free. By the end of our stay, we did not feel secure in the room and felt like we had to check through our personal belongings every time we left the room and came back to ensure that nothing was missing. 

Details:
1.	Sub-par customer service for a 5 star hotel: March 2, 2023 –
•	Check-in: Upon arrival, we were given the wrong room without the amenities promised and there was no heat in the room. After reaching out to the front desk to get the situation remedied (wrong room and no heating), the front desk representative wanted me to produce an email verification of the upgraded room and questioned the validity of the room having heat. It wasn't until I told her (front desk rep) that the maintenance folks had already come to the room and verified that there was an electrical problem where the floor/room wasn’t heating and I produced an email verifying the upgrade conversation - was she willing to remedy the situation. When I asked if this treatment was uniformly applied to all their guests, the front desk representative changed her attitude and tried to justify herself. Eventually, we got an upgraded room at 7:30pm – this is after a checking into the hotel at 12:30pm after travelling overnight from Miami to London on an 8 hour flight.  Mind you the hotel check-in is 3pm.
•	Maintenance staff: The room's thermostat, lighting, room service etc. are digital and operated from a single panel. We called the front desk and requested someone from maintenance to come to the room as we had issues operating the lighting and controlling the temperature in the room. The maintenance staff sent, came to the room very agitated,. He was unfriendly and rude. He scolded us like kids for being unable to work the digital panel (which by the way is not very intuitive). He begrudgingly fixed and set the temperature to what we desired. This incident and behavior was unbelievable. It felt like he was doing us a favor for requesting something necessary for our well-being in the hotel room.

2.	Discriminative guest treatment:  March 2, 2023 - While being served at the front desk – this is when I was going back and forth with the representative assisting me, I witnessed a different guest being checked-in. He was well received, explained to the amenities of the hotel etc., and whisked to his room by the hotel concierge. When we checked in, none of this occurred. I was surprised at the level of service and attention to this guest such that I complimented the front desk representative helping this guest and asked if the guest was receiving preferential treatment with additional amenities because he was paying more for his room or if the hotel had a membership/loyalty program since clearly that was not the reception or services I received at check-in. The front desk representative told me that those services and amenities were extended to all guests staying at the hotel. It was clear that there preferential treatment and discrimination on how services were provided. 

3.	Breach of trust/security: March 4, 2023 - Missing money. We left the hotel room and asked the front desk to arrange for the room to be cleaned. When we got back to the room late that evening, the room was clean but we realized that there was money missing from our purses/handbags. We had left the handbags/purses stored in the hotel closet/wardrobe. In any hotel at this level, a guest should not feel the need to lock up their purses, laptops, documents or tablets in the safe when they briefly leave the room. Having these items in the wardrobes or closets in the room should give the guests comfort that the room service folks will not rampage through the guests suitcases, purses, handbags etc. stored out of sight. Anyway, immediately we realized that some money was missing, we called the front desk to report the incidence and spoke to the night manager (Catalin) who was rude and very uncourteous. He advised that since it was late, he had no access to the CCTV records and nothing could be done until the following morning (Sunday, March 5, 2023). He had details of my reservation wrong and when I corrected him, he claimed that he had no access to the hotel system to see my reservation. He simply did not want to help and made me feel like I was bothering him. He also questioned the complaint like I was making it up. His treatment and demeanor towards me was uncalled for, unempathetic and nonchalant.
•	The following day, March 5th, the Day Manager (Pamela) called me to notify me that she had received the complaint and that the hotel would carry out an investigation. The investigation would take 48 hours.

•	That evening of Sunday, March 5th we got back to the hotel and spoke to the night shift front desk staff. There was Simon and one other newly employed staff who were both very courteous, helpful and very pleasant. I told them about our experience at the hotel and the missing money and that’s when they called the night duty manager (Catalin). Catalin walked me through the investigation process and advised that even if they found the culprit, little or nothing could be done by the hotel in terms of replacing the money or reprimanding the staff responsible for the loss. He said that even though the hotel has liability insurance, in such instances the hotel would not cover any loss or reprimand staff unless there was a trend or evidence that this was a repeat occurrence. He told me that  I should file a police report if I wanted to press charges. Mind you, I do not live in London nor do I have the capacity on my 4 day vacation to handle the police. Catalin explained to me that there is skepticism with the hotel around guests who file complaints – apparently, due to the 5 star rating, the hotel deems that there is a very low percentage of their guests that are not satisfied and  there is perception that guests who complain are not being truthful and are looking for free things or complimentary services. 
•	Once again, I felt that Catalin and the hotel did not take my report of the missing money seriously and they were just going through the motion. Catalin the night duty manager indicated that there was nothing the hotel could do for me as far as the missing money was concerned but he could offer us any complimentary beverages on the house. This was around 8:30pm on Sunday and we had a flight the next day, Monday, March 6th . I felt like this was an insult. I reiterated that I did not want anything complimentary from the hotel, all I wanted was reassurance that the hotel would address the theft of missing money from our room to ensure that this did not happen to any other guest at the hotel. I highly doubt Catalin heard what my concern was. Deducing from our conversation and his actions afterwards, I was certain that nothing was going to be done about the missing money or my complaint. I am sure if I was from another ethnic group, perhaps white or of European descent, I would have been handled differently, my integrity would not have been questioned and my patronage at this hotel would have been valued.",1,2023,03,07
111,AP WATCH STOLEN FROM ROOM,"I am so devastated I to write this. 
I booked out the spa for one hour
I hid my expensive watch out of the reach of anyone 
I had my dnd on which meant NO ONE SHOULD HAVE ENTERED NY ROOM
On the cameras two staff members entered my room and my watch is not missing £30thousand just gone
The police are involved and there is an ongoing investigation! But I’ll never be returning to this hotel again",1,2023,03,07
111,Wonderful one night stay in London.,"Wonderful one night stay in London. Very warm welcome from all staff.  Check in very swift and accompanied with a choice of complimentary welcome drink which was lovely.

Approximately 5-10 minute walk from nearest tube station at Moorgate.

Hotel very well kept. We had what could effectively be called a standard room but it was well appointed, spacious, lovely comfortable bed, heated floor in bathroom and excellent clime control.  Supplied with tea and coffee making facilities including nespresso machine.

Ordered room service both in the evening on arrival and at breakfast, both times food was lovely and delivered promptly despite being warned of long waits on both occasions.

Great choice of leisure facilities, we didn’t sadly get chance to use on this trip but have no reason to doubt they would be excellent.",5,2023,03,06
111,A lovely stay,"Good swift and informative check in, lovely gym/well being facilities. Club lounge on the ground floor was excellent and staff there couldn’t do enough for me.

When we entered the room the staff had put balloons and a card for my partner as I informed them we were staying to celebrate his birthday. He and I were both so impressed by this and really appreciated the thought. 

We ordered room service the next morning which was delivered very fast and efficiently and was very enjoyable. 

I was met by the manager Mary on departure who wanted to insure we had enjoyed our stay, which again we found really thoughtful.

We didn’t get a chance to visit the other bars but we could hear the great atmosphere during the rugby game. Thank you for an amazing time. Really hoping to return for my 30th in a few months!

111,The Good Manners is the basis of the success,"I have stayed in the hotel for 26 days and the most noticeable thing l have faced here is the nice manners that I got from the employees especially from RANEEM and Aakriti. plus to that, the good location of the hotel which is close to most of the attractions and how it is near to metro stations.",5,2023,02,17
111,Amazing hotel with superb service!,"We had a wonderful time during our stay- I went for business, my friend went for leisure and we both agreed that this was a great hotel, in a great location. Walking distance to lots of shops, a few Underground stations and many restaurants, it’s ideal for travelers. The free waters, chocolate and most importantly- the free cocktail hour every night at the hotel was AMAZING.  Starting at 5:30 you can order a variety of spirits, cocktails and wine and light appetizers FOR FREE. Shout out to Swuti, Vatsal and Daniel who were prompt, courteous and so very kind- it made our week long stay that much better and they all made us feel welcome- best service in London !",5,2023,02,17
111,A luxurious family break!,"Montcalm Royal House is truly a fantastic hotel to stay! 

Firstly, our family room was very spacious and we had interconnecting doors which was lovely. It gives some privacy at night between the two rooms and the rooms are really sound proof! So quiet at night! The beds are super comfortable and we had one shower room and one bathtub which helped in the morning. You have Nespresso machines and water bottles amongst everything you would expect. The digital panel with mood lighting, underfloor heating was very easy to use as well as the connecting points for the tvs.

If you can add for the access to the Club house, do. It is situated in front of reception with tables and comfy seats and it’s opened from 5.30-8.30. You can have a drink and some nibbles there which is nice to have before going out. This area was quiet and intimate.

You can also book the SPA at check in if you wish. They accept children from the age of 8 but parents need to accompany them. They can only go there in the morning. It’s a beautiful relaxing place with a jacuzzi and a swimming pool with jet swimming if you wish. On the left there is a steam room and a sauna. The gym is next to it as well.

The aviary on the top floor is very well decorated with peacocks and other birds. Some plush leather seats and tables around the bar. You can also go outside in the igloos for a drink.
They serve the hot breakfast there from 6.30am-10.00am. A nice buffet selection of cold continental or full English with any specialty coffee and teas. You can also order special eggs if you prefer.

Finally, I want to highlight how incredibly professional, kind and helpful the whole team was. From Claudia in reception to Aakriti and Dhruv in the club lounge to the amazing doorman who could not do enough to help us!

I will definitely recommend Montcalm Royal House London to all . Well done and hope to come again for my next visit in London.",5,2023,02,17
111,The Best,"Me & my mum stayed here on Thursday the 16th of Feb & checked out on the 17th it was the most amazing experience!

111,Not as magical as the first time ,"So myself and husband stayed here back in July 21 and omg it was faultless!!! But this time round not as good! 
I booked back here for one reason …the breakfast back then I was gobsmacked with how much selection there was the table was a big u shape with everything you could imagine full English , salmon , pastries fresh fruit , oh it was spectacular….this time 1 small table with the most boring unappetising selection ever! The hot offering was a lot smaller undercooked , bland and cheap looking , the bread was stale ….the pastries were also as if they were sat there the previous day ….nothing luxe about this breakfast and it really really disappointed us!  Premier inn breakfast is honestly better 
The couples massage we booked was in a cold hotel room very strange set up … 
The sky remote in our room was overly complicated…and think of myself as someone who can use a basic remote control !!!! Just couldn’t get it to turn the channel 
Reception desk were as kind and welcoming as ever ….. this time round just didn’t quite have the magic as the first time and sadly I think that will be my last time. ",4,2023,02,16

111,A comfortable stay with attentive staff,"This was our first few nights staying away from our baby and what a wonderful stay it was. From the very start the staff were helpful and attentive, helping with our luggage, escorting us to our room and explaining the various bits of tech in the room to ensure that our stay was comfortable. We made full use of the spa facilities which were fantastic although if you want a treatment make sure you book in advance as there were not slots available unfortunately.
One of the highlights of the trip was the staff assisting me when I needed to keep an item in the fridge. It was perhaps an odd request but they were happy to help me which took a huge stress from my shoulders. 
Thank you again for a wonderful stay",5,2023,02,12
111,Staff were great,"Stayed here for my partners birthday, Mary looked after us during our stay and made my partners birthday extra special by leaving balloons & snacks in the room.

Thank you so much ! :)",5,2023,02,10
111,"Friendly service, issue in lounge was avoidable","Used this hotel on many many occasions. Staff are always friendly and professional. Also as a club member platinum status I should be allowed access to the club lounge. On the first night I approached the lounge to be told I didn’t have access. I asked the member of staff to check while I took a seat in the lounge, unfortunately they came back and again told me I did not have access! Very annoying so I asked if she could speak with her manager, manager then appeared and apologised. I really shouldn’t have had to ask.  The loyalty reward club scheme needs to be able to recognise a member and not embarrass them in front of other guests. That said once sorted service was fine. Room was clean and spacious, gym was ok, albeit some equipment is broken and should be replaced",4,2023,02,08
111,Make sure you do not get a dungeon room,"We booked two nights for a weekend trip to London. On arrival we were allocated a basement room, with no windows and no natural light. I was not happy. You do not stay in a 5* hotel to stay in the basement. They claimed they had no other rooms available and tried to make amends by offering complimentary breakfast, which was no good as we needed to sleep beyond 10.00 am but what I want when I stay in a 5* hotel is a room with windows that is not in the basement. These rooms should never be used for paying guests. Really, really disappointed.

And the cleaning wasn't up to much. I found used bottles of nitrous oxide just under the bed. Again, not what I expect of a 5* hotel.

Edit: the hotel contacted me after I posted this review, and said that they were disappointed that my stay was not what I was hoping for.  To their credit, they have compensated me for a disappointing stay, but to my disappointment, they will continue to use the basement rooms.",2,2023,02,08
111,Loved the hotel & staff,"Booked this hotel for my partners 25th birthday celebrations. From the minute we entered the hotel, we had such a welcoming and luxurious experience with prosecco on arrival for my partner, supplied me orange juice and whilst we waited for room to be ready we had the loveliest lady (so sorry I don't remember her name!) offer us macaroons, chocolate etc - She was so welcoming and friendly. The hotel had decorated our room for us with balloons and complimentary fruit and water. Every time we spoke to someone in the hotel they couldn't have been more accommodating! We had a spa package booked for my partner and he said it was a great massage but lacked a luxury spa feel ie: basic room, no calming sounds/music etc which he said would have elevated the overall experience. 

Upon checkout we again had a lovely experience with water and juices provided, again the lovely lady from check in supplied us with some macarons. The hotel held our bags for us all day whilst we went out into london & provided everything back safely.",4,2023,02,08
111,Fantastic couples hotel.,This is a fantastic hotel. I had mentioned at the time of booking that it was my friend’s birthday and they left ballon’s and some deserts. The gas a private spa which we didn’t use because of lack of time but I appreciated the facility. The breakfast was a bit ordinary but roof top bar was great. The room was very comfortable and clean.  The check out was lovely as the lady gave me a complimentary cappuccino whilst my phone charged. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and I really appreciated this. I would gladly recommend this and stay here again. Infact I’ve just signed up to their loyalty programme. Thank you for a lovely stay.,5,2023,02,07
111,Wonderful stay,I took my wife for her birthday and had the most pleasant stay. Our room was decorated with balloons and macaroons it’s was beautiful I also brought my own cake and Mary from the guest experience team was soo lovely she kept my cake safe till it was time for my wife’s surprise. Definitely will be coming back again soon. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2023,02,07

They are always available to help with your bags, the lemonade they have in front of check in is the best lemonade I’ve ever tasted in my entire life!

The night concierge, Saimon, was so helpful and courteous and surprised me with a wonderful birthday treat! I am traveling to London from New Jersey for a business trip that happened to be on my birthday. Saimon surprised me with thoughtful treats and chocolates. But not only were the staff thoughtful for my special day, but would also check up on me and my needs throughout the week.

The room is incredibly spacious and very comfortable. The Montcalm Royal house is located in the heart of London, very close to Moorgate station and Liverpool station. The bars are very classy and cool, and everyone I had encountered has been kind and incredible (I would like to shout out to Mahmudul for the courteous staff during my stay) I am looking forward to coming back and exploring London a bit more here at the Montcalm.",5,2023,02,05

111,Super satisfied!!!,"This hotel is one of the best ones I have ever been and by far the best hotel you can find in London! You can get all your needs excellently taken care of by the professionals in the hotel and you can rest assured that you will have great time. 
A special THANK YOU to Kaloyan and Edison who work on the Reception desk! Their work, demeanor and attention to detail are remarkable and I am safe to say that Montcalm is worth visiting just to meet Kaloyan and Edison and to get serviced by them! These two young men have the skills, knowledge and approach to meet all your needs, to make you feel comfortable and to ensure you are getting the highest class of service and the hotel as well as you are having a superb experience in Central London. I can never thank them enough and I hope more people are able to have the joy of interracting with them! Thank you, Kaloyan and Edison, for making my trip pleasant and unforgettable! ❤️❤️❤️",5,2023,02,02
111,Terrible,"Read some amazing reviews before I booked and have been left wondering if we stayed at the same hotel.
Booked for my partners birthday, told them in advance but no acknowledgment or extras in the room like I’d read on the reviews. 
We chose this hotel for the spa, no acknowledgment on their website or booking site about pre booking the spa and the tight 30 minute slot so we rang down from the room, we were sent robes and told to come down then called a liar when we arrived. I wish we didn’t bother, the sauna was broken, pool tiny, steam room FILTHY and mouldy, rude staff when we mentioned the dirt. Stayed 5 mins and left never to return.
Room tablet and lights kept breaking, we had an inwards room which was directly opposite a busy office so no privacy when curtains open, constant loud noisy fan ( I think from the spa) outside even when window was closed.
Uneven double bed made of 2 singles where one was hard and one soft.
Marks on the walls and carpets, paint flaking in the bathroom, mould around the loose shower seal, no towel rack. Tv and remote didn’t work, no bin liners, these are the basics of any hotel.
We left very disappointed and upset, 
This is not a 5 star hotel.",2,2023,02,02
111,Amazing Hotel,The hotel was amazing and the staff were lovely. Mary took care of us and helped us with everything we needed. The rooms were nice and clean too. Would recommend to everybody and certainly will be visiting again.,5,2023,02,02
111,"Everytime I checked into Montcalm Royal London House, I feel very relaxed.

The location is central to business locations, the hotel is clean and conducive",5,2023,02,02

111,Christmas Visit,Lovely time spent at the Montcalm. Special thanks to Aakriti who made us feel very welcome at the Lounge. Check in and check out were efficient. Lovely spacious room with access to the spa which unfortunately we couldn’t take advantage of. Would definitely return.,4,2023,01,30
111,Wow! A complete 5 star experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"I flew from Ireland for an overnight in London. We got the train to London Liverpool Street, the hotel is approx a 7 min walk from there. 
The staff were among the kindest I’ve ever met. They could not possible do more for us. They were attentive pleasant and so desperate to help and make us comfortable. I dealt with Eddison (I think 🤔) Helena and Mary. 
The room was so beautifully warm and cozy. With fab mood lighting, smart tv, lots of wardrobe space underfloor heating in the bathroom, fluffy robes for the spa which was peaceful and beautiful. 
The continental breakfast was so fresh and delicious. 
When it came to check out the staff were incredible once again. It was no problem to take our bags for the day, they gave my child an activity book and pencils, gave myself some Prosecco and a orange juice for my child, the Assistant guest experience manager Mary personally asked how the stay was and if there was anything they could do better and gave her card to say if we wanted to stay again to contact her etc.
Myself and my partner were just blown away by the whole experience AND it was super affordable.
We don’t need to go to London again for any particular reason but we are already looking for an excuse to get back to this hotel! 
Special mention to the wonderful doormen 👏👏",5,2023,01,30
111,Lovely!,"Had a lovely one night stay here. Special thanks to larissa who treated us like royalty from the moment we walked in the door.

111,Perfection,"We had a lovely stay at The Montcalm Royal London House. It was to celebrate our 25th anniversary and our Sons birthday party in a venue nearby.
The room was lovely, such a comfortable bed. Also very quiet even though there was a party above us.
Everything you need was there, plus balloons, petals and macaroons were a lovely surprise arranged by our son.
The early check in at 2pm and later check out at 12pm was a welcome bonus.
We did not have the opportunity to use any other services but all the hotel staff we met were so friendly and very courteous, we felt like VIPs.
I would definitely stay again and highly recommend it to everyone.
Thank you so much 🙏",5,2023,01,28
111,Excellent as always,I always stay at the RLH on frequent business travel. Excellent location and fantastic staff. Aakriti and Daniel provide exceptional service in the club lounge.

The rooms are perfectly clean,  very well equipped and a good size for London- we always book a Club room, which might explain the size. On our most recent stay this week, we stayed in room 707 which had a marvellous view over Finsbury Square. The Club room breakfast is continental, but delicious. The staff  throughout the hotel are excellent, but special mention must go to Aakriti in the Club Lounge who really looked after us! Thanks also to Camelia in the Front Office who always makes sure we're happy with our room. The Spa is gorgeous but you do have to book a slot and it does get busy. We love this hotel and we'll be back again in April, if not before!",5,2023,01,26
111,When can I come back? ,"Firstly- The bed is unreal. I almost stripped the sheets off to investigate exactly what I was sleeping on!!! I’m slightly regretting that I didn’t! No noisy hallways, I couldn’t hear the roads (stayed on the 7th floor) so I was glad about that! The robes were nice and fluffy- more like fleece than towelling which I preferred.
The staff at the door/ reception/ restaurant  were soooo helpful and welcoming. I was helped by Francesca on reception who went above and beyond to make sure I had a good reservation in the Aviary restaurant. What a view! Great food; On the pricey side (£40 for the lamb main course) but I couldn’t fault it. 
Another special mention to Vlad, the staff member who helped me to my room after I checked in, and explained the lighting/ heating panel and on check out brought me some water while I waited for my taxi!…. 

Lovely hotel, would stay again ;)

111,Great Hotel,The staff was so nice and friendly. The room was so beautiful and clean. The location was very convenient. We loved the design of the building as well. We will be delighted to come back to stay with other friends ,5,2023,01,25
111,Best experience- highly recommend *****,"i stayed at this hotel for the 1st time back in October. and i cannot wait to come back! the hotel was stunning, room was perfect, comfiest bed ive ever slept in!, beautiful elemis products, bath robes and the spa was beautiful for a morning treat the next day. me and my partner had the best and most relaxing night here, we could not fault one single thing just that we didnt stay for 2 nights! we still talk about how lovely the whole experience was 3 months on! I have to specially mention Mary- Guest Experience Executive, i wanted a treat for my boyfriends birthday which she made sure was all done and ready in the room it was such a nice touch and what a lovely, helpful, kind lady she is and an asset to montcalm royal london- she went above and beyond to make sure we had a good stay and personally greeted us when we arrived and took us to our room. 5 stars on every level, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I am currently planning a date to visit in Feb. Thank you to Mary and all the staff at Montcalm Royal London house :)

111,We are absolutely coming back !,"My husband booked a one night stay as part of a whole amazing weekend of experiences for my 50th birthday. He booked via Expedia but then contacted the hotel where he spoke to January who very kindly upgraded us and offered to decorate the room and make it special for us. On arrival, we were checked in very quickly and our luggage taken from us while we did so, then the receptionist asked us to wait briefly and January came out and I was none the wiser but thought how wonderful that we were being escorted to our room by one of the Managers and she took us to our room, opened the door and I was blown away!! There was a huge balloon sculpture set up in the corner, a bottle of wine, bottle of water and some beautiful treats on the table!! She showed us how to operate the in room controls and asked if there was anything else we needed, I was just bowled over and was made to feel SO special !! There was a Nespresso machine and pods in the cupboard with a kettle and extensive choice of hot drinks, the room was beautifully clean and huge and don't even get me started on the bed ! It was literally like lying on a cloud, covered by another cloud (the duvet!!) Our luggage quickly followed up behind us by the porter. We had planned to go 'out out' that night but literally only managed a meal at a local restaurant, but we did go to the rooftop bar for drinks, a really cosy, lovely and relaxed environment. We ventured to the spa the following morning where we had a quick dip in the pool, although its small, there is a 'swim against' current produced at the end of the pool so you can swim a good distance if you want, there's also a jacuzzi which was lovely on weary old back bones ! They also have steam and sauna rooms which we didn't have time to use as we had a couples hot stone massage booked by hubby too, which was lovely, the two staff who did our treatments were very respectful, kind and courteous and we could not have asked for better. On check out we were greeted by Larisa who is one of the Guest Experience Managers and asked about our stay, asked if there was anything that would have made it any better and there really was nothing we could think of, she offered us bottled water to take on the train which we gratefully received and had a drink of homemade lemonade before we departed. Had we not have been meeting up with someone, we would have stayed longer for a drink in the rooftop bar, taking in the views, maybe next time eh ! To each and every person who made our stay amazing and made me feel very special, we thank you all and cannot wait to come back and stay again",5,2023,01,25
111,Definitely a experience to remember,"We are a couple who got engaged recently and wanted to celebrate my fiancée's birthday too.

January Stevens went through the booking process with me and offered to decorate the room herself, plus offering some extras: beautiful roses bouquet, prosecco bottle, red velvet cake... she really went an extra mile to satisfy the occasion.

On our arrival, Mary Philippiah greeted us and took us personally to our room while engaging in a really nice conversation.

Suffice to say, my fiancée was speechless when she opened the door. The room itself was gorgeous, which a beautiful London Skyline view on the 8th floor, massive windows, bed frame adjustable color lights and huge bathroom. 

The rooftop restaurant (The Aviary) was beautifully decorated, offering delicious food. Extra points for the cocktails!

Long story short, OUTSTANDING customer service, lovely stay, delicious food and best stay ever!

Definitely will come again. Her words: ""thank you for making the best birthday of my life"".

Thank you Montcalm team!

The rooms are a great size with a very comfy bed. 

One special mention to Mary, guest relations, she goes out of her way to be helpful, very professional!

Can't wait for my next visit",5,2023,01,24
111,Amazing hospitality,"Upon arrival, I and my partner arrived earlier than expected. We both checked in and were provided great service by Mary who was able to check us in earlier and had prepared our room for a surprise as it was for my birthday. She had given red wine as a complimentary service for our room as a celebration and written a celebration note. It was the perfect birthday celebration and well spent at the Montcalm Royal London House. 

It was a quick check-in and out, with the help of Marys hospitality. 

Cons 
- The sauna room was not in service which we were pretty gutted by.
- Steamer room had malfunctioned 5 minutes into our session

Pros
- Great hospitality
- Customer service was great when calling from our room
- The swimming pool was a great experience with the hot tub.

Great place to stay at and would recommend to others.

The staff were very attentive and listened to my requests, putting extra effort to make this stay special. Mary took great care of us, even decorating the room and making it known that we could reach out if we needed anything.

We used the club lounge for the first time too which was very relaxing and again impeccable service.

111,"Disappointed, not recommended for the price.","I had very high expectations for this place since it's supposed to be a 5-star hotel. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. When we went to the bathroom in our room, we discovered our bathrobes were full of dark hair of someone else. The carpet in the room was full of stains. The pillowcase had stains too. The tablet to control the room's lights etc wasn't working half of the time. The tv stopped working the second day too. It's the first time I have seen these things in such a luxury hotel. They shouldn't happen.
In addition, nobody told us the bar upstairs (the one with the view) isn't available (not ever for hotel guests) after 10 am. 
The good thing was the staff was all very nice and kind. Probably the only really good thing I have to say about this place in addition to its great location. Very central and very well connected. There are 3 tube stations close by. 
You can find better at a better price.

111,Perfect for solo/business guests especially women,"I stay at this hotel most weeks for 1 - 2nights. It is a consistently great experience. Particular highlights are location, access (incredibly well lit position on an open square) Ideal for female solo stayers. I arrive late and leave early so often in the dark. If its raining you are offered a curtesy brolly. More importantly the personnel rarely change so you are welcomed back sincerely and authentically. How this hotel manages to make you feel special is the recognition and familiarity of your greeting on arrival and departure. Also the willingness to go the extra mile. I often have a lovely welcome note and gift left in my room. These small gestures mean a lot - I am sure if I failed to honor a reservation, simply didnt show up that there would be concern and perhaps an are you okay call.

What a lovely hotel made better by the care and attention taken by the front of house staff.

We was greeted on arrival by staff, polite attentive and happy. The manager arranged Ballons and free bottle of fizz for our room when they found out it was a birthday celebration.

I had booked a suite with sofa bed but we was given adjoining rooms with was much better as we had two bathrooms. 

Rooms are great and loved the underheated flooring in the bathrooms.

We had complimentary drinks and snacks in club lounge between 5.30 and 8.30pm which was an unexpected delight! We headed to rooftop bar and was really pleased to find an uplifting bar with funky music and amazing views. 

The only down side I would say is that they don’t provide you with towels in the spa, they presume you will know to take your room ones,  but I find this unhygienic. The spa could do with some TLC sauna was broken and tiles in steam room old and worn. 

Apart from this I would 100% highly recommend this hotel, if you do stay at a weekend you will find that the area is quiet due to it be located within the city area and more of the hospitality businesses are for office workers mon-fri. It’s easy distance by tube or cab to other areas though.  ",4,2023,01,16
111,Highly recommend,"The most amazing hotel I have stayed in. The staff were extremely friendly from the start, the hotel was clean, the room was spacious and the staff checked in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend and we will be going back again!",5,2023,01,15
111,Great Hotel amazing staff,"Beautiful Christmas stay. We stayed from 22nd December till 25th December 2022 in room 702/703 junior suite. Room spacious and all the amenities you need. 

Mary was super lovely and helpful. Greeted us and took our bags to the room. She made us feel very welcomed. The staff are so pleasant and always remembers us. The staff and service is the reason we stay every year. Deepak was very accomadating to make sure our requests were fulfilled. Thank you so much- he is also our main reason to stay at this hotel. 

They were able to accormadate a early check in and late check out. And to be honest what ever you ask the staff they all have a yes attitude and will try their best. The hotel staff at reception goes above and beyond 

The spa has improved massively more availabilty than before. Well managed too. The sauna wasnt working but was not an issue for us- as we really enjoyed everything else. 

Had a few hiccups booking the Avairy for dinner but breakfast is always good. Will advise booking in advance and in person if you have questions as it was a nightmare trying to get hold of someone. 

The hotel overall has such a lovey welcome feel and the staff are all so pleaseant! We have already booked our next stay at this hotel!",5,2023,01,14

111,Very nice!,"Lovely spa area, good fitness centre and very comfortable room. Good location as well. Would definitely recommend.

From the moment the door was held open for us, to the time we checked out, we were treated like vip’s! 
The hotel is beautiful, and the staff are amazing, with a particular thanks to January who made us feel so welcome!
We were escorted to our room to find rose petals, balloons and a complimentary bottle of Merlot left out for my birthday, which was so appreciated!
The room was huge, with a bath I could swim in, and spotlessly clean. 
We headed to the spa in our fluffy robes and slippers, and the facilities didn’t disappoint! It was so relaxing and not overcrowded, due to allocated time slots and a maximum capacity. 
We ordered room service (the food was very tasty!), and after a wonderful nights sleep in the comfiest bed, woke feeling super refreshed and relaxed!
The complimentary continental breakfast was excellent, particularly the smoked salmon and croissants!
We can’t thank the staff at the Montcalm Royal London House enough! It was you guys that made our stay so special!

We spent the start of our stay in the spa with a hot stone massage, then enjoyed the pool and hot tub. 

Then we headed to our room where we had Prosecco and water waiting for us plus robes and slippers which we immediately snuggled into. 

Whenever we rang reception (which was more often than we’d like to admit) we were helped in every way and so quickly too!

111,A great relaxing Christmas getaway in the heart of London City.,"We booked Montcalm Royal for a Christmas break. The overall experience was great and we really found the service and rooms to be high quality. 
The check in procedure was quick and efficient and the person at reception was very happy to explain all the features and amenities. We had a family suite on the 6th floor which also gave us free access to thr club lounge for breakfast and evening snacks from 1730 to 2030.  While.checking in, the staff handed out some gifts to the kids which was a very nice gesture and highly appreciated. 
The room itself was very spacious and comfortable. There were a few small issues with upkeep such as window handles being a bit loose and a drawer opening on its own but the staff were able to fix most issues quickly upon request. The view we had was of Finsbury Square and given the floor we were on, it was quite a good view.
Breakfast in the club lounge was a continental breakfast with quite a few options for all tastes. The staff were always present and helpful. We had a great experience with Krasi who was particularly attentive to the needs of the kids. This was really nice and made us feel very well taken care of.
Snacks in the club lounge were served in the evening, where you get a choice of a small snack and a drink. This is a really good feature and one that makes The Montcalm Royal stand out as not a lot of hotels offer this facility. The staff, Aakriti and Ramona in the club lounge during the evening were really great and stood out in terms of their service attentiveness.
We ordered room service one night and there were quite a few options for both adults and kids. The food itself was very good as well.
We stayed a total of 5 nights and felt really at home during these days. The staff made sure we were felt welcome at every interaction and the facilities were really outstanding. ",5,2022,12,28

111,My stay in Montcalm hotel,"I am staying at the Montcalm Hotel with my partner. I have been amazed since I’ve arrived. The lobby boys are very helpful and friendly as well as the receptionist, they have checked us in as well as giving clear instructions. The rooms are well cleaned. I have experienced some very nice nibbles and a great glass of wine well served by Aakriti and Ramona, they are friendly and such nice people to chat with. Much better than the front Barman who looked very annoyed and no eyes contact the last night. This place is amazing. I am not regretting my Christmas holiday 🎄🎁",5,2022,12,25

111,Belated 40th birthday celebrations,"To belatedly celebrate our 40th birthdays because we were not able to do it during lockdown, my friend and I booked a twin club Montcalm room.
On arrival we were pleased to discover that we were able to check in slightly early and on being shown to our room, we were so excited to see that the hotel staff had recognised our belated celebration and had decorated the room with balloons and left a welcomed bottle of wine for us to enjoy.  
The staff were attentive but not intrusive.  Drinks in the evening were lovely and as a result of being in a club room we were able to enjoy sone complimentary Proseccos before going out.
On returning after our night out, we were surprised to see that the bar was closed.  Instead we ordered room service drinks via the QR code in the room,  these were slightly slow in arrival (they took approximately 40 mins) but were beautifully served.
The following morning we enjoyed our complimentary breakfast.  The offering was a light continental affair but we were aware of this prior to booking.  Our two suggestions for improvement at breakfast would be to have a rotating toaster as people had to wait a long time for their toast.  Also to provide pots of coffee or a filter coffee jug, as these took a while to arrive.
Finally, we had emailed and called the hotel several times before arriving to try and book our 30 minutes free spa access.  However, this had not been successful and so when we raised this as an issue the managers were more than happy to liaise with the spa and arrange a late checkout free of charge so that we were able to take advantage of it.
This hotel was the perfect option for my friend and I and we would thoroughly recommend to others.",5,2022,12,24
111,Girlie London Break,We have just returned from a fabulous night at this hotel. The staff were attentive and even decorated the room for my daughter’s birthday. The room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. Nothing was too much trouble. We have stayed before but this was definitely the best experience we have had . Thank you to Mary and Amal ! ,5,2022,12,23
111,Amazing stay before Christmas,We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel couple of weeks before Christmas. Mary at the hotel reception checked in on us and checked us out. Our room was luxurious and comfortable. Kids loved their own bedroom and we loved the heated floors and complimentary drinks and breakfast was perfect. Can't wait to return!!,5,2022,12,23

111,Amazing Hotel,"This was our second time staying at Montcalm Royal London House and they never disappoint. We were welcomed by very friendly and professional front desk staff and check in was a breeze. Upon entering our room, we were greeted with Christmas stockings and other treats. Mary P. has always made our stay extra special and full of great memories. The hotel's amenities are great - the pool, the gym, and spa. Aviary is on the 9th floor of the hotel as well which showcases a gorgeous view of the city. You can also reserve their igloo pods for dinner and enjoy a drink or two by the bar. We cannot wait to book again for next year.",5,2022,12,22
111,Possibly one of my best stays in London - I will be back!,"The perfect stay which exceeded my expectations! 
Francesca greeted me on reception and was incredibly polite, helpful and very attentive. Without asking she was able to move me to a nicer room after i mentioned I felt a bit unwell ( chest infection) - totally unprompted and I certainly was beyond grateful. 
The rest of the team were also impeccably turned out and really lovely. 

I was stopping over whilst I unfortunately wasn’t feeling very well and honestly the team members in the restaurant during our meal were incredible and so sweet whilst I was having a coughing episode at the end of my meal. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, ambience, I really wished I’d asked for names. The gentleman serving upstairs in the restaurant on Tuesday 20th December - just wonderful. They deserve to be recognised. 

The room was clean, smelt fresh and the shower was so powerful,and the underfloor heating made such a difference. 

Everything about my stay was perfect - except for wishing I could have stayed longer and enjoyed the other amenities.

I would also like to mention the gentleman who was on the door the next morning - he was very kind and helpful and polite whilst I waited for my Uber. 

It is fair to say this is the standard you should expect however, the team made it feel so personal and I had one of my best stays in London so far. Thanks to this beautiful hotel - perfectly located with an excellent team.

Thank you so much! I think because I was a bit nervous about being away from my creature comforts - the fact that everything was readily available and it was so warm, cosy and the bed was so comfortable I woke up feeling refreshed and grateful. 

Overall, I had an excellent stay and will definitely be back.",5,2022,12,21
111,do not get blinded by other reviews here,"This is not a 5 star hotel, hardly can reach 4. Staiuns on the carpet and floor, filty room, items missing upon arrival, had to ask for robes and fruit twice. It was a birthday occasion,  dissapointin",3,2022,12,19

We arrived before check in and we were given access to a room early which was much appreciated. We later spent a couple of hours in club lounge before heading to bed and Aakriti made this such a relaxing experience for us. She was so attentive and kind to George, alongside providing us excellent service (drinks and snacks). The hotel is also so conveniently located especially if your train comes into Liverpool St. A short walk to drop off luggage on arrival and departure, but also well located on the tube map. We wouldn’t look to stay anywhere else going forward! Thanks Montcalm and especially the lovely Aakriti.",5,2022,12,17
111,Birthday,AAKRITI is an amazing host!! She even remembered our order from the previous night! The Montcalm sees hundreds of ppl a week and for AAKRITI to remember us abs greeted us with a smile I had to give her a shout out!,5,2022,12,16
111,A lovely birthday stay,"I had a lovely time at this hotel for my birthday. I had advised beforehand that I was coming for my birthday, when I checked in I asked if I could upgrade my room as I wanted to spoil myself a little and the receptionist let me know that my room had already been upgraded to a suite with complimentary breakfast. 
The room was very nice and spacious. Very modern but still comfortable. I dropped my bags and went to get my nails done and left a key at the front desk for my friends to get into my room when they arrived which was no issue. 
I had booked the winter igloos at the Aviary that evening for my birthday dinner and it was delightful experience. Though the fondue menu was abit expensive and the igloo was a little cold. The staff were very accommodating and even got us an extra heater. I missed breakfast because I’m not an early bird And headed straight to the spa. It’s a shame we only get 30 mins in there but hey Ho. Overall I had a lovely time and can’t wait to visit again",5,2022,12,16

111,My Birthday stay,"This hotel is amazing, I had a fantastic experience. As soon as I informed receptionist Francesca and Mizuki that it was my birthday, Camellia the manager upgraded my suite to a Luxurious superior suite, I was sent a bottle of the finest champagne and chocolates. I had immediate access to spa facilities and complementary breakfast the following morning. The roof top restaurant bar was exquisite! This is definitely my favourite hotel in London. They tailored my stay to perfection. The decor and the designs are outstanding. The staff are very friendly and professional. I loved every moment,",5,2022,12,07
111,Stylish and Comfortable. Pleasant service.,"I stayed at Montcalm Royal London House for five days. What I like most about the hotel is the pleasant service. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Smartly dressed staff are always available to guide you. 

The room I stayed in was very cozy and luxurious. Large TV, a well-designed bathroom, and a comfortable bed were as expected from any five star hotel. They gifted a few  tasty macaroons on my first night of stay, which was pretty cool.

A special about out to Mary, who helped me with my requests. Anna, Dany ( I hope I'm remembering the name correctly) we're also very helpful. There was also another man who helped me with info on how to store my luggage at the hotel while I was away. Can't remember his name unfortunately. 

The hotel is close to Moorgate underground station. So, it's easily accessible. I like to take long walks. So, I was able to visit major landmarks like the London eye, Big Ben, National Gallery, Shakespeare's Globe, the Buckingham palace, etc by walk.

I loved the food too. Especially, the Belgian waffle breakfast was super tasty. There's a cool pub too. Montcalm also has a brewery of their own. So you get to taste some unique stuff. 

Will I stay here again? Hell yeah!",5,2022,12,07
111,Staff are superb,We were meeting our daughter in London who was visiting from the states. We realised straight away that the staff were superb and very helpful especially the doorman who helped us several times. The room was ok if a tad small but was well appointed. The bathroom was good. We couldn’t take off the do not disturb sign as the electronic pad wouldn’t change. As a result our room was not serviced but when we rang for fresh towels they arrived very quickly. Breakfast was ok but very busy and a queue. As I am vegan and gluten free it was quite hard to find much but it was nice enough for the price. GF cereals are always appreciated but there wasn’t any. The bar and reception in our opinion need an upgrade. It’s a bit rowdy. All in all though the staff make this hotel. Superb !,4,2022,12,06
111,Niamh OLoughlin,Mary Philippiah who is the guest experience executive at the hotel is an absolute star. I am so thankful for how she went above and beyond  into making our stay so special.

111,Great service and very helping attitude.,"The service was great. Everything comes in 1 minute of call at the reception. Dhruv, swati and the sweet young guy at the door were all very helpful. They made sure I get my tea the Indian style, which was super sweet. The whole staff is very sweet and helpful in general.",5,2022,12,05

111,Club lounge review,"Had an amazing time last night in the club lounge at the Montcalm royal London house.
Rushi and Aakrjti really looked after us. They went above the call of duty and attended to us all evening. 2 of the loveliest people you wil ever meet and really know how to look after their guests ",5,2022,12,03
111,Excellently located hotel for the City,"Stayed for one night on a business trip. Arrival and check in smooth. Asked for a quiet room and this was accommodated. Room was spacious (610). The second tv in the wardrobe seemed very loose and about to fall off hinges. Informed the front desk. 

Lounge was a little depressing. 1730-2000 complimentary drinks. Limited selection of snacks and party wine. Pinot was not great. Did not finish. Lovely staff but I decided to go to Long Arm which had much more atmosphere. 

Excellent breakfast spread. Great views from Aviary at the top. 

Asked for late check out to 1400 and they said okay for a reasonable fee. I agreed. From midday on the dot housekeeping knocked to see if I was ready to vacate. Then again at 1230. Both times informed them of late check out. Then at 1315 a porter came to take my bags and again I informed him of late check out. Each were apologetic but clearly front desk had not informed. 

On check out the late check out fee was waived due to interruptions.  Other than this the location is great and the stay was good. Oh and Burdock has a fab burger - do try.",4,2022,12,02
111,Wonderful hotel and staff,"I stayed at the hotel as I was hosting an event nearby. I was greeted by very friendly and helpful door staff and reception. My room was ready early as I requested this due to setting up early for my event and the staff kindly let me check in earlier.  The room was clean, lovely and comfortable. I also got to enjoy the wonderful spa facilities in the morning before I checked out which was a lovely bonus to my stay. Thank you for a very pleasant stay.",4,2022,12,02
111,Wonderful attentive staff,"Great central location - Moorgate station 5 mins walk. Broadgate shopping and eating 7 mins

We arrived at a busy check-in time at 3 pm. We were offered complimentary prosecco. When we asked if they had a chilled bottle the young waiter immediately got a chilled bottled to pour to us. 
Reception desk lady welcomed us with a big smile. So even though it was busy and we had to wait for 15 mins, it felt that the atmosphere was calm and positive and not stressy and like they were just rushing us off.

Beautiful room which they had decorated for our anniversary.

I would also say thank you to Dhruv at breakfast and the smiley young lady at reception for their professionalism and friendly customer service. Well done to all the staff.",5,2022,11,30
111,Excellent,"This hotel is amazing, the staff are all so friendly, they couldn’t do enough to make our stay special. The guest manager and staff went above and beyond to make our stay special. The spa is lovely and relaxing. Rooms were clean and the club rooms are lovely well worth paying a bit extra. You don’t have to check out till 12 witch is lovely. The roof top bar is stunning and so Christmassy. We have already booked for December. I have not got one bad thing to say about hotel and can’t wait to go back. ",5,2022,11,30
111,Very good,"Aakriti was a lovely lady could not do more to help, even offered to move a table closer so I could reach my beer.

Everything else was fine, small gym and pool but it is a health spa so I guess that's expected.",5,2022,11,28
111,Simply exceptional.,"Where to begin? The people. 

From the moment you walk in, the staff at the Montcalm take incredible care of you. Deepak, Daniel, January were all an integral part of our stay, ensuring our every need was met and going well above and beyond to host us with class, grace and such warm hospitality. Daniel may very well be the best concierge not only in London, but in Europe. There wasn't a day he wasn't trying to make sure we had all of our plans outside the hotel all sorted and no phone call he wasn't willing to make on our behalf. 

The Aviary and really all of the food offerings throughout the hotel were a true delight. Fresh, healthy and generous portions. Service was speedy and any special accommodations met without a hitch. This was especially helpful when we hosted a group business lunch and all was executed flawlessly. 

I reckon some of the best sleep I've had all year came in my room on this trip. The Montcalm and the amenities of the room were the next best thing to being home. Being able to use the gym and pool were added bonuses. 

I cannot recommend the Montcalm Royal House more confidently. If you're looking for a well-placed, marvelous place to crash in London, do yourself a favor and look no further.",5,2022,11,28
111,Good stay; recommended,"Great location ; excellent service ; Mary and Alessandra were helpful at checkout, sorting out a late checkout request. Rooms were adequate size. Bathrooms were decent sized and water pressure was decen. Housekeeping was good, but could be more attentive.",4,2022,11,28

111,Thank you!,"Me and my partner stayed here for a birthday weekend and the best time. The staff were very helpful and accommodating and helped us with anything we wanted. We went for the breakfast buffet in the morning which was really delicious! You never know how buffets will be but it exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately we didn’t get to the swimming pool but my partner had a pregnancy massage in the spa which was very relaxing. 
Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2022,11,27
111,Book this hotel NOW!,"What a fabulous hotel! Amazing facilities (spa is lovely) and Mary made our stay extra special with her impeccable customer service. She acknowledged our anniversary with balloons and rose petals in the room plus a complimentary bottle of wine. 
Only issues we had was the light control in the room was very bright …. We were informed by Mary this can be switched off by request. 
Plenty of things like coat hangers, slippers, tea and coffee, full sky package etc. 
would recommend but if you stay email Mary before hand to ensure your stay is extra special.",5,2022,11,26
111,Girlie treat away,"Aakriti was the most gracious and attentive waitress in the Montcalm Club when we visited, so much so it would have been lovely for her to sit down and join us. Thank you so much for making us feel so very welcome indeed 😊",5,2022,11,26

111,Amazing experience!,"I had such a great experience at the Montcalm. 
I arrived on nov 21 and on nov 22 was my birthday. one of the staffmembers that helped me with my luggage got my room filled with balloons and i got a nice little gift from the whole team. The rooms were being cleaned like every 2 or 3 hrs i think. Wifi worked perfect aswell. And i loved that i did not have to check out really early, which gave me the time to swim in te spa, and have breakfast before leaving. I definitely know where to stay once i go back to London. Pamela and Claudia and everyoneee who helped me, thanks so much. ",5,2022,11,25
111,Brilliant stay!,"I booked the hotel for one night as a surprise for my partner and notified the hotel it was a surprise sand Sara did her absolute best to make the day perfect! 

Once checked in, Sara thoroughly explained everything that I needed to know and assisted me throughout the evening when my partner was going to arrive.

Our room was amazing! There were balloons, macarons and a card in the room when I checked in which made me feel very special that the reception staff paid attention to reason of staying. 

Thank you very much to the reception staff and Sara especially from guest experience for making our stay as memorable one :)",5,2022,11,24
111,Amazing stay,"Stayed at this lovely hotel a few times now and every time it gets better and better. The hotel staff and the manager January who I might add is beyond amazing, are very helpful and pleasant they go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable in your stay 

Our stay there was perfect to say the least

The room immaculate and room service was spot on 

We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable pleasant stay away",5,2022,11,23
111,Human Touch,"I was lucky enough to meet Imran who runs hospitality. He took such good care of us, 
that we felt we had our own private hotel to relax and socialize in. He was so tentative, honest and friendly. He really made our stay so special that I hate to leave. 

Thank you.

111,"The only place to stay, amazing hotel","Myself and my partner stayed here for two nights over her birthday and it is now the ONLY place in London we will consider.

111,30th birthday stay,"Stayed at The Montcalm for my 30th birthday. I have mixed reviews about the stay. My husband wanted a luxury experience for me and it didnt quite hit the mark. The service from staff is inconsistent some are super friendly some ignore you. Check in process was smooth but i found out about my suprise spa experience at the hotel because the person checking us in blurted it out even though i heard my husband asking them not to say anything about any other add ons to the stay in front of me. The room, for the amount of money you pay i was expecting something different. My husband did pay extra for balloons to be added to the room which was a nice touch. The furniture was a bit dated and didnt go well together felt very cold, sofa and carpet had seen better days. Stains and holes etc. Wallpaper coming apart in areas. You control the lights in the room by a tablet on the wall but it didnt turn off at night so kept us up. In the morning we asked if it could be turned off somehow and were given a cover, why wasnt that done on check in? Breakfast was a bit of a faff, i found out the 2nd morning i could ask for different eggs and additions to what they had out on the buffet, that also wasnt explained. Spa facilities were nice and our massage was lovely however. I have had better experiences at lower priced venues. It was a bit of a let down.",4,2022,11,20
111,Why you need to book here when you visit london,Was transferred there after a booking issue with another hotel and they looked after me VERY well with annupgrade of a very HUGE room with the finest continental breakfast and the staff were FANTASTIC,5,2022,11,20
111,Great Hotel,"We recently stayed here for my husbands birthday, it was a lovely hotel with great staff. Very clean spacious rooms, very nice shower. The staff were great on arrival and very helpful. They also supplied a bottle of wine, and decorated the bed with balloons and rose petals for my husbands birthday. We Will definitely be back.",5,2022,11,19
111,Amazing service,"This was one of the very best London hotels I have stayed in.  It was clean and modern - and the rooms were spacious.  However, the best part was the amazing service.  The entire staff was kind and very eager to help in whatever way I needed.  I sprained my ankle during my stay and they were always ready to bring me a bag of ice and help me with anything.  A great place to stay - will be back.",5,2022,11,17
111,5 star stay for my wife’s birthday.,"I booked this hotel for my wife’s birthday weekend in London and emailed through earlier to ask if it would be possible to make her birthday treat that little bit more special and they didn’t disappoint.

Mary greeted personally with a glass of Prosecco and showed us to our room where they had placed balloons and a bottle of wine (thank you again Mary for the personal touches)

As the hotel was central to everywhere we needed to be, close to tube and bus stops, we were able to get around very easily and within a short bus trip from Kings Cross (right outside hotel).

All the staff were polite, greeted us warmly and we always there to help.

The room we had was a deluxe double, very clean, modern and a very comfortable bed.

Overall our stay exceeded our expectations and we would definitely use the hotel again in the future.",5,2022,11,16
111,Good stay,"good stay. Claudia at the reception was particularly available and kind. In general all the staff was nice. The spa is good, the roof restaurant impressive for the view and also the restaurant at the entrance was good. Rooms are comfortable while mine was without view on the square. Hope the next time will be more lucky!",5,2022,11,16
111,Exactly as you would expect for a 5 star experience ,Had a short stay in London before a work event in the city so the location was perfect. Hotel facilities were excellent and we'll kept the staff were very helpful.  Didn't get a chance to try the aviary but hopefully another time. Lived up to the high bar for a 5 star hotel,5,2022,11,16
111,Amazing experience - highly recommend!  ,"I recently stayed here for a few nights for a series of business meetings and I was blown away by the incredible experience! 
I worked very closely with the manager, Deepak, in the month leading up to the events to organise the multiple days needed for meeting rooms and the meals in the various restaurants. Deepak was fast to reply and loop in other staff who were all professional and efficient. A special thank you to Elizabeth who helped ensure all the meeting guests' meals were preordered over the multi-day event, the head concierge Daniel who was so kind to accompany guests on a walking tour, and event host January, who was so pleasant and ensured all went smoothly for everyone. No task was too much for the team at Montcalm RLH! 
We dined in the Atrium and Burdock, and the food was delicious, the ambience very nice, and of course great, attentive service. The business suite I stayed in was spacious, clean, and comfortable, and the products were lovely! I would absolutely recommend staying here - there are many hotels in London, but the staff is what makes this place truly stand out. Sadly I didn't get a chance to use the spa, but I did have a look and can't wait to return soon so I can do so. 
Thank you again to the incredible people at Montcalm RLH for giving me and my guests in town an amazing and memorable experience. Best, Sarina

111,"Relaxing,modern hotel with excellent staff/service ",Excellent stay at the Montcalm Hotel. Very attentive staff who go the extra mile and allowed me to check in before the usual check in time.  The room was modern and relaxing with the most comfortable bed I've slept in in any hotel before. The Aviary restaurant was delightful with it's magnificent City view. The breakfast is continental style only (not hot options). Will be checking back in again very soon for another business trip !,5,2022,11,14
111,Fantastic family stay in London,"We have never stayed in a Mountcalm hotel before but following our stay we would definitely return! Prosecco on arrival, some complimentary drinks and a continental breakfast buffet, this hotel goes above and beyond from the moment you arrive.  The staff are so friendly and helpful with nothing being too big an ask.  We travelled with my 8 month old daughter and my mother in law so went for the family suite. This was excellent as we had two adjoining rooms and the cot was all set up when we got there.  The rooms are a brilliant size and we had a lovely view over the square. My husband was delighted that the TV’s even had sky tv (we have never seen this before in a hotel!) 
The view from the rooftop at night is also breathtaking. 
Finally you don’t have to go far for facilities with a spa, cafe, restaurants, two bars on site and the rooftop bars! What else could you want from a hotel! 
Special shout out to all the incredible staff here that made our trip especially the lovely Mary!",5,2022,11,14
111,Would definitely recommend,Came to this hotel for my boyfriends birthday and the treatment we received was amazing! They decorated our room with birthday balloons and rose petals! Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of Prosecco and a kind man even gave us a stool to rest them on whilst checking in. We were assisted to our room with Mary who was very attentive and another man who carried all of our bags to our room. The beds were large and extremely comfy!!! Would definitely recommend and we will definitely be back! ,5,2022,11,13
111,Fantastic night away ,"Excelled service from Mary from the moment we arrive up until check out, 10/10 for her and the hotel staff. 

Had  bother at the roof top bar. I was  over charged for drinks we didn’t order, I was only  giving a bill after questioning the price which seems a bit dodgy to me as I’ve always been giving a bill before payment.

I was then asked to pay for my drinks again so I could get my refund and I refused to do so, after 20 minutes of arguing I was then told I would be refunded fully without any second payment needed.

Other than that I would like to say again thank you to Mary for her and the hotel staff for making our stay at the hotel fantastic and I will definitely be retuning but maybe give the roof top bar a miss.

111,Wonderful place,My stay at the Montcalm Royal London House during a business trip was fantastic. The venue is stunning and the view on the roof top amazing.

111,A pleasant and warm welcome to the Montcalm hotel,It has been a long time since I stayed in London. Myself and my partner chose to stay at the Montcalm hotel 21st-23rd October for a special occasion where we were visiting family who are over from Australia for the opening of their shop near by. I would just like to say that I was really pleased with the level of service I received from concierge Daniel and the rest of the staff at the Hotel. In the future for trips in London we will choose to stay at the Montcalm hotel and continue to recommend to family and friends specifically because of Daniel and his teams level of service.,5,2022,11,08
111,Phenomenal - Mary and Francisco were AMAZING.,"This definitely  my new favourite hotel to stay at when in London. I often travel to London for work trips and business conventions. I have stayed in various  hotels and Airbnbs, however the the Montcalm Royal London House is a step above the rest. From the moment I arrived until I checked out the service was impeccable. I cannot thank Mary and Francisco enough for their attention to detail and diligence throughout my stay. No ask was too big for them they were extremely helpful accommodating. Not to mention the location and amenities it really is a no brainer for those who value qualify and exceptional service.",5,2022,11,06

Breakfast in the Aviary is a nice way to start the day.",5,2022,11,06
111,Anniversary stay,"My boyfriend surprised me with a night away in this beautiful hotel. We have stayed in many luxurious hotels but this one seemed special. 
Firstly, we was welcomed by two gents that took our luggage and showed us to the check in. We was then treated to a glass of Prosecco which was a lovely touch and made the experience feel more like a celebration for our anniversary. (Which they didn’t know about at this point).
On the way to our room a gentleman asked us if we was celebrating anything. We just mentioned in conversation that it was our 10 year anniversary. 
A few moments later we received a knock on the door a lady from the experience team came up with a complementary bottle of wine. Which was so lovely of them. Again making it feel that more special. 
The hotel in its self is amazing, rooms are fabulous, rooftop bar was unbelievable with amazing views of the city and fabulous drinks. We didn’t have dinner her but next time we definitely will. 
Upon check out Mary for the experience team came out to wish us her best which really topped of the day. 10/10 for service, experience and stay. We will definitely be returning.",5,2022,11,06

All the staff we encountered during our stay were friendly, helpful and attentive.

Mary from Guest Experience welcomed us on check in and personally showed us to our junior suite which was well appointed and a good size. We were really touched by the balloons and rose petals in the room for our birthday celebration and activity pack for our daughter.

The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job of keeping our room clean and topped up with toiletries we needed. On one of the days we were back in the room when they came to clean so they checked we had everything we needed and came back later to clean.

The staff in the club lounge were really welcoming and on one evening when we were having evening drinks one of the ladies on duty brought our daughter some chocolates to go with her hot chocolate which she was excited to receive.",5,2022,11,06

We received a free upgrade to a suite on arrival as the trip was for my birthday. The room was fantastic with a lot of modern tech like lighting control, TV etc.
I would definitely recommend the rooftop bar - great views and atmosphere. Despite the bar being full online, the hotel was able to sort us a table for the time we wanted. 
A special mention to Daniel (Head Concierge) as his customer service was absolutely impeccable and he made the stay feel really special for us.
Perfect hotel stay and we will definitely be returning!",5,2022,10,30

My daughter is a coeliac and the reception staff could not advise if she could eat at the hotel! I tried to go swimming but was told I had to go down to pool area to book a slot but when I got there the desk was empty and it looked a total mess!

Room was pretty shabby. I travel a lot and Honestly this hotel is not 5 star more like 3.",2,2022,10,30
111,"Good hotel, excellent staff and very comfortable beds.","The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Incredibly helpful, friendly, polite and professional. The rooms are very nice too (view not so much, but I’m sure other parts of the hotel have fantastic views). Bed was very comfortable-slept incredibly well. The bathrooms are very good (excellent shower). 
I have no idea if the hotel was very quiet or if the rooms are soundproofed, but we couldn’t hear any kind of noise from outside of our room. 
The buffet breakfast was of good quality too. 
We chose the hotel because of its close proximity to the Barbican-you can walk there in under 5 minutes. 
Moorgate tube station is also only a short walk away too. 
If I needed to stay in this part of London again I would definitely stay here.",5,2022,10,29

Bathroom was tiny but all new and nice enough sink and shower unit.
Lovely spa and gym. Gym quite small but has a large variety of cardio machines, cable pully and squat rack machine with adequate weights.
I had a facial with Ria, absolutely wonderful. She went the extra mile, arm massage, neck massage really thorough and tentative and what a lovely lady too! Highly recommend her!",4,2022,10,29
111,"First class hotel, great location!",Reviewing from the perspective of a Londoner having a two day staycation.  Great hotel at a very reasonable price.  Great location to explore historic london while having access great restaurants and all the convenience you might need.  Staff is first rate!  Highly recommend!,5,2022,10,29
111,Home from home with first class service,"I never get tired(the beds so comfy) of praising this hotel and the staff. It is a home from home.  Great location and the staff are very attentive. From post work drinks in the club lounge to breakfast in the aviary...all very pleasant. The manager  Deepak, is amazing. Can't wait to be back.",5,2022,10,27
111,Great hotel,Stunning room in a convenient location. Parking across the road and easy to access. Friendly staff and good bar. My only complaint would be the confusing and often contradicting advice from staff. Requests I made prior to arrival were not met resulting in a room upgrade to a suit. I then called hotel to find out about room service. This turned out to be wrong later on so plans had to change again,5,2022,10,27
111,Birthday weekend,The best weekend EVER! As soon as we arrived to The Montcalm we immediately felt relaxed! I can’t thank all the staff members enough. Everyone was so kind and catered to our every need nothing was too much! The hotel had a really nice vibe to it & everyone was so happy which made us feel so welcome!,5,2022,10,26
111,Wedding Shopping Trip to London,"The Montcalm Royal is well placed for both business and pleasure trips.  It is close to the area of Shoreditch with fabulous restaurants, street markets and boutique shops.  It is well served by public transport being near Liverpool Street Station and not very far from London Bridge station, there are many tube stations around the area.  Many great areas are in walking distance, Shoreditch, Brick Lane and other city areas.

My daughter and I were on a Wedding Dress shopping trip, from the moment we entered the doors of the Montcalm Royal hotel we were treated like royalty.  We were guided to reception, offered a cooling glass of their signature lemonade while we checked in.  During that evening, the skies above London changed from a mild drizzle of rain to a total downpour just as we were leaving for our dinner reservation.  The front desk staff were so helpful and caring, they arranged for the doorman to run out in the awful weather an get a black cab for us.  

We used the fabulous spa facilities a couple of times, consisting of steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and pool which you have to book which ensures the area remains perfectly restful.  

The bedrooms are extremely spacious and comfortable, the bathroom is lovely, the shower so luxurious.  

After our checkout, we left our luggage with the hotel and needed to plan our day Wedding Shopping.  The front room staff were so lovely, they offered us coffee, presented a wonderful box of Montcalm truffles and a refreshing drink of lemonade to ensure our day began with the type of start any prospective bride would be thrilled with.  From the moment we entered the calming atmosphere of the Montcalm, a little travel frazzled until the end of our relaxed departure, the Montcalm staff were so attentive and helpful.  There really was nothing that was too much trouble, I recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to London and I look forward to visiting with them again.",5,2022,10,26
111,Fantastic hotel,"Outstanding experience. My wife booked 2 days at the Montcalm for my 35rd birthday and what a treat it was. So many polite staff ready to help from the moment you walk in. As we approached the hotel we were greeted and asked if we’d like our bags taken to reception; another member of staff gave my wife and I a complimentary glass of Prosecco and as we checked in, the manager January (that’s her name) came out to say hello and make sure we had everything we needed for our stay.

The roof top bar is mega-impressive with beautiful views. The decor is very 20’s Gatsby feel, which is right up our street. Really nice cocktails on offer and tasty food too.

Room was very clean, nicely styled, big TV, in room fridge and very comfy bed. Underfloor heating in the bathroom and a MASSIVE shower head, which was very pleasant to use. 

We will undoubtedly return. ",5,2022,10,25
111,Exceptional,"We arrived in the pouring rain looking bedraggled.  The door man immediately took our umbrellas and while we checked in he dried the umbrellas off and returned them to us.
Every member of staff at this hotel is exceptionally attentive and seem to care very much about customer service.  They make you feel like royalty but it is absolutely not the kind of place where you are made to feel like you don't belong there.  I overheard similar interactions between other guests and staff.
I never usually stay at the same hotel but I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London.
The room was stunning and everywhere is immaculate. 

thanks again to Mary and Alexandra who remembered it was my daughter's birthday as we were leaving.
I can't speak highly enough of this hotel",5,2022,10,25
111,My Time in the Kings Country ,"The shower experience was absolutely awesome, totally enjoyed my sleeps, the breakfast was excellent and customer service was brilliant. Thank you Daniel for going out of your way to make our stay enjoyable. I will certainly look you up whenever I get a chance to return. ",5,2022,10,23
111,Anniversary stay,Recently me and my wife stayed at this wonderful hotel. I will totally recommend staying here. First greeted by the lovely staff with a glass of fizz which was lovely. Then greeted by January who was very helpful and kind to us when we arrived and throughout our stay. She even decorated our room with nice rose petals and balloons without charge which was lovely. All the staff were very kind and helpful. The bedroom was gorgeous and clean and comfortable. The shower was good and the bed was brilliant. Room service was excellent and enjoyable. This place is very friendly and had a great experience. Will be going back in the future for sure!,5,2022,10,23
111,Excellent Hotel for Business and Leisure Trips,The hotel has become my London home for business and leisure trips. It's staff is extremely nice and helpful.

The entire experience was awesome, service was excellent and all staff have been friendly and assisted us during our stay. We’ll definitely go back! Thank you guys.",5,2022,10,23
111,Nice service ,"The hotel was fine, it had some details for a 5 star hotel (the windows were very dirty, the light system doesn't work properly) but the service, particularly Mariano's, was excellent. Very friendly and attentive, it is really appreciated.",5,2022,10,22
111,Absolutely awesome!! ,"We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House last weekend and what a fantastic stay it was! From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty. We were welcomed warmly and the wonderful staff helped us with our luggage. We were offered yummy lemonade. We arrived into London early and was so thankful that we were able to check in early and get ready for our matinee West End show. We met the lovely January who couldn't do more to help us. We were upgraded and she showed us to our gorgeous studio. It was my friend's birthday weekend and she was thrilled to find birthday balloons in the room as well as yummy macarons. We were running late for the show and January made sure we had a cab ready and waiting. Unfortunately I was a bit under the weather after the show so we didn't get a chance to check out the spa facilities but definitely next time! We had dinner at the Aviary restaurant in the evening and it was yummy! The bed was SO comfortable, the shower was amazing and the full English the next morning was delicious! 
Every single thing about the Montcalm Royal London House was 5*! A huge thank you to January who made it so awesome. We will be back! ",5,2022,10,22

Thanks to you all at Montcalm - especially January and Mary! You both helped make our special few days absolutely perfect!,5,2022,10,21
111,"One night stay for work trip- lovely hotel, staff and comfortable stay","I stayed at the Montcalm for a one night work trip in London. The hotel experience was pleasant and I could not fault it. Upon arrival I was greeted by Vlad who checked me in. He realised there was an issue with the room i was due to stay in and promptly arranged for another room. He apologised for the incovenience and gave me free breakast however I did not wait longer than 5 mins and it was really no incovenience to me. He was a lovely member of staff and I thank him for his help and kindness during my stay. 
The room was immaculate, has under floor heating and the bed and bathroom were lovely- i slept really well. Breakfast the following morning was nice with barista coffee.",5,2022,10,21
111,Great stay at Montcalm,"Stayed for 1 night whilst visiting London and had a very pleasant time at Montcalm hotel. Friendly staff, cool, modern rooms and good transport links. Safe area as well, good for business or solo travel.",5,2022,10,18
111,Good location,"It's hard to assess the value due to the location (which is perfect - close to two tube stations). If you are not used to London prices you will be disappointed. It is however good hotel, rooms are small but usable, and bathrooms are very small but clean. Overall experience is quite pleasant.
I need to point out that the staff is very friendly and helpful, everyone is smiling and polite.
Breakfasts have quite limited options but everything is fresh and tasty, ideal for a quick bite before series of meetings.
Best highlights:
- good and clean iron in each room
- a lot of coffee and tea in the room
- two kinds of pillows for each person in the room",5,2022,10,18
111,Girlfriend bday,"I attended motcalm hotel on my own to surprise my girlfriend and was approached by many people on way in. My partners bag was already at the hotel through a friend and Mary (guest experience executive) over heard it was my girlfriend bday and the room got made up for this very occasion, they have a great roof top bar and spa! I can say I didn’t have breakfast as it was £19pp and had already payed £220 plus which was little annoying but for the occasion my partner couldn’t get up in the morning anyway cause she was hungover. But the hotel and service and location id say all in all is 5 stars.",5,2022,10,17
111,10/10 would give more stars if we could!,"Absolutely best service ever, Daniel in particular made our experience exceptional! He brought our bags to our room and showed us everything we needed to know about the room before leaving us. He stopped and spoke to us every time he saw us during our stay and was just all round a lovely guy. The hotel itself is in a brilliant location, it’s facilities were exceptional and the tube is only a 5 min walk away so everything is easily accessible.",5,2022,10,17
111,"Beautiful Hotel, Amazing Attentive Staff","Had the most amazing stay, from the moment we arrived at the hotel the staff did everything possible to make the stay special.

The room was amazing, comfortable and secure.

This Hotel will always be special to us as we got engaged during our trip to London.

Definitely will be back!",5,2022,10,17
111,Amazing stay,Amazing stay as always. Amazing room & customer service never disappoints. We were hosted by Mary phillipia who was lovely and assisted with all I needs. She made the stay excellent for us. Provided us with her details for future reservations.,5,2022,10,16
111,Stunningly Beautiful,Oh my goodness ! MRLH you smashed it out of the park for our stay. I requested a top floor room decorated for my partners 30th birthday and we got exactly that with a bottle of wine too !!! Greeted at the door by a wonderful gentleman who took our bags from us and walked us to reception where we met Mary who took us to our room. Everything was perfect from start to finish.

111,Exceptional and Relaxing Stay,"First I would like to thank January and her staff for being generous enough to us.
It’s my friend birthday and she helped to arranged a surprise by putting a balloons , Prosecco and Macaroons on our room.
Not to mention that the view of our room is exceptional.
We had also a relaxing stay by using their Swimming pool and SPA.
Definitely we’re going to stay again in this hotel.",5,2022,10,15
111,Last minute weekend stay,"We booked last minute for a weekend away.  Every member of staff and I mean every member go out of their way to help, are very friendly and polite.  The service is impeccable.  We had a few issues with room but these were swiftly dealt with and rectified.  

I cannot express how much the staff attended to our very need.  Nibedita the manager on duty was amazing.  Daniel head of concierge was also amazing.  Thank you all for a great stay, highly recommended.",4,2022,10,15
111,Excellent service,Excellent service from Kaleyan and Vlad couldn't of asked for a friendlier service! Made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond! Gorgeous hotel couldn't of asked for better to be honest! Thank you!,5,2022,10,14

111,I could get a golden NFL’s ticket just one  day before the game with very reasonable price through the super concierge.,"Thank you, Daniel who is the best concierge I met in my life.
He could have made an impossible issue a possible one, then I could have a marvelous experience at Tottenham Stadium.
Thanks Daniel,again.
I’ll be sure to stay at the Montcalm Royal London House for future’s visit ever.
The Montcalm is my house in London.",5,2022,10,13
111,Lovely hotel :),"Stayed here to celebrate a graduation. 
Staff were amazing and made the occasion feel very special. They were very friendly and accommodating to any needs we had during our stay. 
Spa facilities were perfect, and room was modern and clean.",5,2022,10,13
111,Very enjoyable visit.,The stars of the show were the staff - all brilliant - in particular Mariano was especially charming as I was checking out. Many thoughtful touches in room. Good internal sound insulation. Many different options for breakfast and great wellness facilities. Hotel is very well placed for use of underground.,4,2022,10,13
111,Nice but expensive,"Mary from Guest relations was wonderful! However, room was not worth the price. Was very shocked that there was no mini bar considering the price. The rooftop bar/restaurant is a fantastic touch and such a great atmosphere to be a part of. Overall a nice experience but a bit expensive considering the amenities in the room.",4,2022,10,12
111,Top Experience,"The Montcalm employees were outstanding, going above and beyond for every service requirement. Marjano was especially welcoming and put me and my mrs right at ease from the first interaction. The room and hotel itself was amazing with a great skyline view of the city.",5,2022,10,12
111,Customer Service 10/10! and very comfortable.,"I surprised my friend for a late belated birthday treat. Check in was for 2pm however there was a delay in getting the room ready so ended up checking  in an hour late.  But the guest experience manager - January ( yes that is her name) kindly  made sure our stay was 5 star. We were given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco to make up for it and they kindly arranged the booking of our Spa. 

The Staff were very helpful and always greeted you with a smile at the reception desk.
I will definitely be coming back this time with my husband and son!

Could not fault their service -  thank you for making the stay enjoyable.",5,2022,10,12
111,Great few days,"We stayed for 3 nights. I booked it for my husband birthday. On arrival we were kindly greeted and assisted with our bags. We were early and was going to ask if we could store our luggage and head out until check in. But the check in service was fantastic. No issues with us being early and was offered fresh juice whilst waiting to be checked in. 
Mary then came out and showed us to the room. Mary asked about our journey and what plans we had (felt like she actually cared and was interested in our answers). As we entered the room our luggage was already waiting, and they placed balloons on the bed. (What a lovely touch)
We had fresh water waiting and some lovely macaroons! Mary went through where everything was and how to use the tec of the lights and under floor heating in the bathroom. Great start and beautiful welcome, thank you!
On the Sunday I decided to have a day chilling in the hotel while my husband went out to watch the NFL game (reason why we were in London). I used the spa facilities (got slightly lost) as the lift I took sent me the other end where the conference rooms were. But once there I had a few hrs relaxing.
I decided I would order room serve, it came quickly and the food was great. Was nice just to relax and not get ready to go out for food.
My husband and I popped out for a evening walk and thought we would go back to the hotel and relax with a cocktail on the roof top (we hadn't made it up there yet). But when we got there at 10.10pm we found out it closed at 10pm (fair enough). We went to the bar and a gentleman handed us a drink menu. Then he never came back! We stood for 10 minutes feeling awkward when finally a lady served us! We sat down near to the roof top just so I could try and see a little bit of the view through the window. But all I could see was a door man securing the roof top door. On his mobile, face like thunder and clearly bored. Then a couple of lovely ladies smiled and asked him to allow them to go out and take pics (which he did) but then I saw him refuse others!!! We had one drink and went back to the room. What a damper on the service we have had so far. This is why I have marked 4 stars. The staff  downstairs were amazing  especially Mary who wished to say goodbye when we left. This wouldn't stop me staying again. But that service from the bar upstairs put us off going up there again the next evening, choosing to spend our time and money out in Soho where the vibe was brilliant. Thank you Mary for being such a lovely welcoming person. To your front or house staff where nothing was too much trouble. And the team on the front door that always made you feel welcome coming in and out of the hotel. ",4,2022,10,11
111,A very good address,"Very good stay in this hotel. I stayed there one night for a business trip and Mariano was attentive to every request.

The beds are particularly comfortable. Don’t forget to have a look at the top floor view. ",5,2022,10,11
111,Another amazing stay,"This was our 5th stay at Montcalm and was another fantastic trip, although unfortunately we were only able to stay for the one night on this occasion. 
It's a great location and the facilities are great. What really sets it apart though is the staff who go out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect. 
Can't wait to return.",5,2022,10,10
111,Great stay!,"Excellent hospitality, smiling and welcoming attitude of the staff, good food and location, rooms are tastefully decorated with all modern amenities as well as being spacious. Thank you to all the staff and managers of the hotel for making our stay memorable. I sincerely thank Deepak Penikar(manager), Elizabeth, Veto and the night manager for offering us great hospitality. Thank you, all. ",5,2022,10,09
111,Lovely!,"Brilliant, room was lovely and staff were so friendly. Always there best interest to make sure your stay was perfect. January was lovely. Highly recommend staying here. We will sure return! Thanks very much:)",5,2022,10,09
111,Marriage Proposal,"I booked the Montcalm so that I could propose to my Girlfriend. I messaged the hotel in advance to ask if they could set the room up and make it look special for the occasion.  A lovely lady called January saw that the room was set up with rose petals, balloons and Prosecco and the room was absolutely brilliant. All the staff were very attentive and polite. Breakfast at the Aviary was lovely and the roof top bar had amazing views.  We had a brilliant 2 night stay and we would definitely go again.",5,2022,10,09
111,Missed the mark,"Whilst the hotel is quite well appointed and the reception staff very pleasant, there are some basic elements that fall short of a luxury experience. Yes, there are Elemis products in the bathroom, but only one light switch to illuminate all four dazzlingly bright lights (great for doing makeup). Not so great if you want a quick wee in the night, as you are nearly blinded by the brilliance of the light bouncing off the white tiles and sanitary ware. Pristine white fluffy towels and robes, but I personally like a flannel too. There are some nice touches (complimentary water in the room, decent hangers that can actually be taken out and used independently, nice big widescreen tv). There is the usual tea/ coffee station, but only three coffee capsules to choose from (decaf, ristretto or lungo so you have to pull straws to decide who has what) and just the two half fat and two full fat little long-life milk cartons that you get in a service station, and the water glasses are actually plastic. There used to be a mini bar, but now just an empty mini fridge. And a drawer which looks like it could have held other goodies, but sadly no more. Apparently you can call down to ask for these items, but it all feels a bit self-service. 

The high tech wizardry in the room is slightly baffling. You can’t turn on the 1001 lighting options unless you are standing by/ sitting in bed. There are also unlimited air con configurations, if you want to tinker with the climate controls for ten minutes. And the Bluetooth music system only works if you know the password - again I’m sure a call to reception would sort it but life’s too short. On the positive side, the room was clean and spacious, the bed was large and comfortable, and the obligatory pillow menu is also on offer. The complimentary continental breakfast offering is meagre, and they could do with a self-serve coffee station to help speed things up. The coffee itself was bitter and burned on both occasions.  Generally there is a distinct lack of choice of anything. Odd set up generally with lots of waiting staff buzzing around, but nothing really happening. Cue constantly empty food platters and breadbaskets, and a lack of glasses or plates. The tables are left bare so the cutlery is brought out separately each time, resulting in much time wasting.

The facilities in the spa were clean, although the hot tub was overheated and uncomfortable. A half hour slot isn’t conducive to a relaxing experience and there were no towels available (apparently should’ve brought them down from the room, but then would have had no towels to use in the room later). 

Overall, everything felt very pared back and minimal, which combined with the low level lighting and dark decor gave a rather melancholy atmosphere. We shared our thoughts with Front of House and they were very receptive, although I’m not sure it was enough to entice us back again.",3,2022,10,09
111,BEST HOTEL EVER STAYED IN!!!,"I honestly Can't Thank You All. Mary & Camila and Guest Experience Team absolutely Fantastic, So understanding and Helpful. This hotel has the most friendly staff and they actually care about you and that your needs are met. Thank you for making my mother feel so welcoming and a lovely stay rooms we're Lovely. Daniel too was extra friendly. It really felt like one big happy family and I've never got this feeling from a hotel!!! We can't wait to stay again... From the bottom of our hearts we thanks you all so much your all a huge credit to the hotel and business.

Thank you
Denise",5,2022,10,08
111,If Christmas were a hotel…,"Hotels of this calibre can feel a bit snooty. You're not wearing your smartest coat, you wish you'd worn your shiny shoes. Not so here. 

One of the most beautiful and well-equipped hotels I've ever stayed in—and yet it felt like home straight away. Everyone we spoke to was warm and friendly and couldn't have been more helpful and welcoming. 

Our room was spotless, room service was simply superb, and we slept like logs. 

And then there was breakfast. 

A rooftop terrace overlooking the City with panoramic views—and great coffee.. Oh, and the sausages... and the pastries... and the sourdough. 

Absolutely brilliant value for money and I felt as rested as if I'd been away for a fortnight. Thank you, Montcalm. I hope to be back soon.",5,2022,10,08
111,Movie star treatment awaits,"A warm welcome with Prosecco, fantastic customer care, the best rooftop bar in town and the cleanest, most comfortable rooms. Ideal location close to Liverpool Street. Our regular London getaway when we need some pampering.",5,2022,10,08
111,"Modern rooms, but style over substance","A great location, with modern rooms, but it seemed like it was more style over substance. The rooftop breakfast was interesting, although this seemed to be a separate company to the hotel, and so depending on the way your checked in you can’t change breakfast to your room. Check in was complicated but I’m not sure if that was my travel agent or the reception team, but even check out seemed complicated. I probably wouldn’t stay here again, but only because I know there are other options in the area that I think I’d prefer.",3,2022,10,08
111,Nice hotel,"Nice guys, Nice room and nice service for me in the midnight. It lets us feel like we are in the home. Real nice reception I met. I will choose this hotel again one day. The breakfast is nice and many kinds of food. We really enjoyed this night.",5,2022,10,07
111,Amazing visit!!,"I absolutely loved my stay at Montcalm. The staff was friendly and professional, the property was spotless and the location can’t be beat.  The Aviary Bar on the 10th floor is a must visit. Beautiful ambiance great views of the city and if you’re lucky enough to come when Carmine is behind the bar you will not be disappointed. I’ve been all over the world and he’s hands down the best bartender I’ve ever met.",5,2022,10,07
111,Amazing hotel,Stayed 2 days prior to cruise and could not have asked for a more perfect place to stay. The staff are outstanding and certainly deserve 5 stars. would not hesitate to recommend to friends or stay there again when in London.,5,2022,10,07
111,Weekend break in London.,"Excellent place to stay, lovely room and the food was superb. Staff were very helpful for finishing our way around London.  Not the cheapest place to stay but not the most expensive and well worth the money. We will be booking to stay here again when we return to London.",5,2022,10,06
111,Above expectations,"I had a wonderful stay for a couple of nights in this beautiful hotel. The staff work as a team and make you feel welcome. No question is too much. Special thanks to Sara. She explained me all amenities and helped me out with my phone charger at a professional and personal level. The art of working in the hotel industry is being professional with a personal touch in order to make you feel at home.  This art is her nature. Compliments!  The room was excellent. A very comfortable bed, a huge TV, floor heating in the bathroom, spacy bathroom, everything has been thought of. I loved the rooftop bar. It has very nice sofa's, an awesome view, very good food and tasty cocktails. Next time I have to check out the pool & wellness. I am sure that these aminities are as good as everything else. The location of The Montcalm Royal London House is excellent. Easy accissible and near by great attractions. Can't wait to return. Thank you very much Royal London House for making my stay at your place unforgettable!",5,2022,10,06
111,Amazing Hotel Ichwa!,"All was great! while the hotel as an excellent location at Paddington (near to the station and the main market), the helpfulness of the staff goes a long way in making one feel comfortable and welcomed
Will strongly recommend the hotel for location, hygiene, and an amazingly friendly staff!",5,2022,10,05
111,Spa break,The hotel and spa was lovely. The concierge staff were always helpful. Alexandra and Daniel were especially helpful and made sure that my visit to the Montcalm was relaxing and care free. Big thank you!,5,2022,10,05
111,What a treat!,"Well we were made to feel like royalty! Greeted at the door, bags taken off us, offers of a seat, drinks, escorted to the room, complimentary water and wine in including balloons and petals on the bed for a special birthday. Cannot fault the hotel at all. Beautiful inside and although we didn’t stop for a drink on the rooftop it was absolutely stunning! The views and decor was gorgeous and the Aviary restaurant had the most beautiful decor and bird decorations. I spoke to Mary prior to arriving who was so friendly and welcoming making nothing was too much trouble. Sara also helped us on our visit but every member of staff we spoke to was so professional and helpful. Would love to stay again. Its a higher price than your standard hotel for the night costing nearly £300 however it is a 5* hotel and very special. Spa area was lovely too",5,2022,10,02

111,Brilliant & faultless - recommended,"As a Londoner, I've never actually stayed in a London hotel! But, to celebrate our wedding anniversary we decided a stay at a nice hotel was in order.

From the moment we walked into The Montcalm (Royal London House) we felt welcomed and relaxed. Check-in was speedy and friendly, Mary from the Guest Experience team was amazing and really brightened up our day. (A real asset to your team!)

The room was spacious and kitted out with everything we needed for our short stay (coffee machine, hair dryer and iron). 

We loved the roof terrace and views across the city. The evening relaxed vibe and music made us feel like we were abroad rather than 5 mins from Moorgate!  

The evening team, Raul and Kaloyam, were friendly and super helpful. They helped make our stay even better :)

I've already recommended The Montcalm to friends. We hope to stay with you again in the near future.

111,Amazing honeymoon stay,"My partner and I recently got married and as part of our Honeymoon, decided to book a couple of nights stay in London on the 24th of August 2022. I completed thorough research to which hotel to stay in, as we wanted our trip to be special, and after reading many top reviews we decided to book the Montcalm Royal London House-City of London. This hotel did not disappoint and was above our expectations. The service we received was absolutely amazing. As soon as we arrived we were greeted at the door and our bags taken straight to reception. We were made to feel so welcome straight away by the friendly reception staff, in particular the tall lady (apologies as we didn’t catch your name) who checked us in was so professional and kind, complementing my wife on her dress. A huge and special thank you goes to Mary Philippah (Guest Experience Executive). As when we mentioned it was our Honeymoon, she had upgraded our room to a suite. Mary then kindly showed us up to our room where our bed was scattered with rose petals and balloons. We were also provided with a complimentary card, bottle of wine and chocolates. The hotel catered to our every needs, for example it was raining one morning and the doorman who had greeted my partner and I provided us with a hotel umbrella to use. We cannot thank the Montcalm enough for our amazing experience on our Honeymoon. We have been to London may times, but this is by far our most favourite and memorable trip thanks to the warm welcome and service we received from all staff at this beautiful hotel. We will definitely be returning and have already recommended the hotel to many friends and family. Thank you. Mr and Mrs Johnson",5,2022,10,02

There was also some beautiful macaroons and a bottle of red wine  left for us.  After our theatre show we came back to the hotel and enjoyed the club lounge. With only staying one night we didn't get chance to use the spa facilities but we definitely will next time!

111,"Great hotel, definitely recommend!","I booked a one night stay for my husbands birthday and the Montcalm RLH team were very accommodating. The reception staff were really welcoming during our check in. They kindly upgraded our room for the special occasion and even decorated the room for us! This also included a breakfast upgrade to the Aviary rooftop. 

Once we checked in we were taken to our room by Mary who was lovely and was happy to help with any questions we had. The room was really spacious and clean. We made the most of the complimentary spa which was nice and not too busy which was a bonus. 

Once we checked out, January Stevens checked on how our stay went which was a lovely touch.  

Unfortunately we forgot our charger in the room and called many hours later to check if it was there (which it was). We were able to pick it up the next day, thank you to the reception/concierge team for their help with this!

I've already recommended this hotel to my friend for her wedding night stay. I would definitely return for future stays.

After booking this, I spoke to Mary and she clearly advised me of all the things the hotel could do to make the stay extra special. 

When we arrived, the room was decorated how I imagined it to be and it was just amazing to see my husband smile the way he did. The balloons were just perfect.

We had our couples massage which was amazing. We visited the pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room as well as eating dinner at the average and even enjoying breakfast in bed after waking up in the morning.

Mary and her team went above and beyond to make our stay special. I think they all require significant recognition as they dealt with every single request with professionalism and attention to detail. 

We will definitely be back to stay at Montcalm as it has been one of our best memories by far. 

Thank you to all for a very lovely welcome, hospitality and stay.

Mary, I cannot thank you enough. You definitely made our stay one to remember. You deserve the most recognition and are a credit to montcalm. Thank you.

111,Fantastic stay from start to finish,"We booked the Montcalm for a weekend trip away for my partners birthday. We have visited London many times previously but this was our first stay at the Montcalm. It absolutely transcended our expectations. The staff were so warm, welcoming and accommodating, especially Mary who we met at the desk. We arrived early on the first day, hours before check in and the staff kindly took our Bags so we could explore. On arrival back, our bags were in our room ready and waiting for us. The bed was so comfortable and the room was sizeable and very clean, with luxury features such as mood lighting. We didn’t want to leave! The spa was a lovely extra addition which we visited twice during our stay. The best part of this hotel was the roof top bar where we enjoyed some truly delicious cocktails while looking out over London.

January the guest experience manager was very accommodating and called me to arrange  everything prior to our stay.. January planned everything down to the prosecco, chocolates and balloons in our room to the bookings for the spa and aviary terrace for both days. Word of advice make sure you book in advance for these as the spa and the roof top are well worth the visit 👌 The bathroom was well equipped, there was fresh towels bath robes and slippers and complimentary amenities and the bed was super comfy. I had one of the best night sleeps 💤 due to the comfort of the bed.  Whilst we was staying I ordered room service and it was very quick and efficient and we was greeted by a lovely member of staff. From start to finish this stay was a memorable one and again I'd like to express my gratitude to January and all the amazing staff at reception for going above and beyond to make this stay special, we will be back ❤️ ",5,2022,09,20

111,Absolutely awesome!!,"Montcalm has proven to be an exceptional stay - an incredible first class stay. I first visited with my husband for our anniversary and after having such a beautiful time, we decided to return for a family visit with our teenage children. They equally loved it. 
What is so excellent you might be asking - from being greeted at the grand entrance, to personalised customer service, to being escorted to your room, to being welcomed by a bottle of wine and sweet treats - I can go on.  The sauna,  gym and steam rooms are very well maintained and quite classy. Buffet breakfast is served in a bright and spacious room, with a selection of British and Mediterranean options.
Staff just went out of their way to serve you and make your stay as memorable and as special as possible. 
Top class hotel. 👏",5,2022,09,18

111,Simply Amazing!,"I had booked a one night stay to celebrate my partners birthday over the bank holiday weekend and the entire experience was honestly second to none. 

From before I had even arrived to check in, Mary Philippiah had already set the standard for my experience so so high. I had expressed a small concern and she went above and beyond to fix it and more. From the smooth check in, to the room upgrade to the complimentary personal touches added to the room for my partner, it was honestly lovely and I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating a special occasion or if you just want a break. 

I often stay in hotels so my standards are already set quite high but my experience at Montcalm Royal London House has raised the bar. 

I’d like to thank everyone in guest experience who contributed to my partner having such a lovely birthday ☺️",5,2022,09,17

was clean and well organized

111,Pleasant and comfortable stay,"Stayed here for 1 night for my boyfriends birthday. I let the staff know before our arrival that we would be celebrating my boyfriends birthday and they kindly left balloons and complimentary truffles in our room which was a nice touch. We stayed in the superior room, the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable we both had a good night's sleep in this bed. Some aspects of the room were abit disappointing such as the bathroom light control panel which was touch screen and  didn't work sometimes-we had to press it a fair few times for it to work. Also, there was a few Stains on the carpet which we didn't expect for a 4 star hotel, however this did not effect our stay, we were still satisfied with the hotel and the room.  We had the continental breakfast in the upstairs retaurant which was delicious, there was a wide selection of food and pastries. 

The customer service in this hotel is very good, all of the staff were friendly and always willing to help. We used the spa facilties which were lovely and kept very clean, the only down side to the spa was that you only got 30 minutes which didn't feel long enough. Overall we had a lovely stay and would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,09,14
111,Spa/Coffee/lunch with a view located on Finsbury Square near Liverpool Street station,"Thoroughly enjoyed a trip to the spa with my daughter today, located in the basement of The Montcalm Royal Hotel.

111,A night in Montcalm,"We stayed for a night in Montcalm waiting for a flight the next day, greeted by an extremely professional and nice gentleman Daniel who offered my nephew and us some juice on arrival. And then a very kind lady Sara took us to our rooms. They really made us feel welcomed from the start, service was excellent, hotel room was fantastic and the hotel had a great gym spa area to take advantage of. Just want to say thank you to the whole team for an excellent stay!",5,2022,09,12
111,Partners Birthday,"I visited the Montcalm hotel for my partners birthday. On arrival we have received fresh beverages and we were welcomed by the friendly staff which helped us bring our luggage upstairs. We were given a 30 minute slot for spa where we could use the steam rooms, sauna, pool and the hot tub. The rooms were amazing and the bathroom came with a heated floor. As it was my partners birthday we received a phone call from reception and were given a free bottle of rose which was so nice. I have never had such a delightful experience and it couldn’t have been better.",5,2022,09,12

I had frequent communication with January who arranged for our room to be decorated, she was so helpful and the room looked amazing! Tiyah checked us in, she was so lovely and friendly and made checking in so easy! Mary showed us to our room and she was so lovely and ensured the room was just how we had requested, which it was of course! Alex the doorman was also fabulous, he is so friendly and such a warm welcoming face to the hotel! overall had an amazing stay here with a room with amazing views, would definitely return and recommend it to friends and family!",5,2022,09,12
111,Disappointed,"On arrival we were helped out of the taxi by the amazing doorman.  A lovely start.
We arrived around 1.30pm which is earlier than the suggested 2pm check in.
However, my daughter who had arranged this had been in contact with January to make her aware we had a lunch booked for 2.15pm and an earlier check in was agreed.  Also that it was my 50th birthday.
We were advised the room wasn't quite ready and it would be another 10 minutes.  We sat down and waited.
At 2.05pm I approached the front desk to check if the room was ready, and advised it was.
We went up to the room and to my daughters disappointment the room hadn't been decorated with balloons, no wine or chocolates.  
The maid arrived 5 minutes later with everything!!
Which was more than I can say for our suitcase, which hadn't turned up!!
I'm afraid for such a high rated hotel, and the extra my daughter had paid, it wasn't acceptable.  
We didn't have time to get changed for lunch and because we arrived late didn't get the table we reserved with the view over the city.
The hotel is beautiful, breakfast was delicious.  We were obviously just unlucky as other reviews seem to show exceptional service.
They did try to make amends when I complained, but it didn't make up for the initial disappointment.",3,2022,09,11
111,Anniversary Weekend,"When I booked I had sent a message stating it was for myself and my partners 10 year anniversary and asked if they could make our stay anymore special, please do. I honestly didn't expect anything. However, when we arrived we were personally taken to our room by Sara who couldn't have been nicer. Our room had been filled with 'happy anniversary' balloons and there were rose petals scattered across the bed. The room itself was great and the bed was really comfortable. For someone who doesn't usually sleep well in any other bed than my own, it certainly done the trick. The room was really spacious as far hotel rooms go and it felt fairly high tech with the tablet controlled lighting system. It offered a 55"" smart TV with sky which offered a wide range of entertainment. The hotel had a rooftop restaurant called the avery which we didn't get chance to try out. However, it did have great reviews and we will definitely try it out on our next visit. There were two bars on the ground floor which we did have a drink in. They had good atmospheres and seemed like you could probably spend the full night in there if you wanted to. Overall, we couldn't complain about our stay at the Montcalm and all of the staff there seemed to go out of their way to make the trip feel special. Even upon checking out, Sara, personally came to ask us about our stay and if we enjoyed our time there. This will now be my go to hotel when traveling to London.",5,2022,09,11

The hotel was elegantly presented and is in a great location to explore London.

The spa and pool area was stunning and we had such a relaxing time there, you have to remember to book as they do get fully booked up.

The team went above and beyond and I could not ve more thankful. It really is the staff that make this hotel so wonderful. 

My husband and I are repeeat guests but this was our best stay yet. 

Don't forget to check out the rooftop bar at Aviary in the hotel. It is the perfect spot for evening drinks.

Thank you all for making my birthday stay so special.

See you again soon.

111,Fabulous hotel,"We arrived here earlier today and we are completely overwhelmed with how amazing this hotel is 
From your concierge, receptionists, and the waiters in your members lounge we have been treated exceptionally well . Swati has gone above and beyond with her service for us .",5,2022,09,09
111,Wonderful Stay,"I have to say that from the minute I arrived at your hotel it was a fantastic experience.  The door men could not be more help, the receptionist was efficient and the young man who took me to the room was very kind and polite.

The bathroom robes were the best I have ever used. 

We had drinks in the roof top bar and the manager bought us our drinks.  We travel extensively and in all our travels this has never happened to us.  We have told so many people how our trip was made amazing.  I am currently looking to rebook before Christmas and I will be staying here.",5,2022,09,09
111,Worst Hotel in London,"Room of door not working, room change needed, other room was dirty with smoking smell, other room with party music above, television not working. Whole issues lasts 90 min. Horror hotel, not a great experience before midnight.",1,2022,09,08
111,Amazing place !,"I had a very nice moment in this wonderful l’hôtel ,very friendly.All was perfect !

A special thank you to Mary and Daniel ,so nice and helpful with me and my daughter .
I highly recommend this hotel ! 
Thank you to all the team !!",5,2022,09,08
111,"Staff were lovely, but we had a few issues","Hospitality and hotel itself absolutely beautiful. The pool is tiny and unkempt to be honest. Things floating in the bottom. I slipped at the spa and bust my toe open. The accident book and notes weren't logged until around 5 hours after the incident as I had to request a plaster, due to my toe constantly bleeding. My toe has only just recovered now a month later. I cannot fault the ataff though as they were amazing. We had issues with our TV in our room, two women came but spoke little English and did not understand what I was explaining to them, so I just told them they can leave it. They spoke in their language and said sorry and left...the concierge then arrived an hour later but also could not fix the problem.",3,2022,09,07
111,Best Staycation In London,"I wanted to give you guys some amazing feel back, I have really enjoyed my stay .. I’ll start of by pointing out great the customer service and attentiveness of your staff, Morning - noon or night you will see staff smiling, high vibrations, always making sure you are okay. They will go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need taxi - directions - restaurant recommendations- taking your bags- refreshments whilst waiting.I really felt like I was living in luxury for 7nights . I was a little anxious to let reception know about my minor room problem but it was dealt with smoothly and solved quickly. The manger came out,  introduced themselves and apologised for the inconvenience caused which again was really nice. If I remember correctly the mangers name is January( so sorry if that’s completely wrong) . All the check in staff 10/10 when dealing with me extending my stay every other day and letting me stay in the same room. I felt special/spoiled haha.. I really didn’t want to check out. Housekeeping services my room was always spotless, I’m OCD so I would do my own little checks and just one night  out of 7 nights I had to point out minor stains on the bedding, when I mentioned it. I had someone come in straight away and change the bedding no hassle - I never got a sense of what does she want now.  Hallways - lifts - reception toilets always clean and smelling fresh. I called for room service twice pizza was good and came within the 30min window.  I did have teething problems connecting to the WI-FI so I was using my own data for my stay but for me it was a minor - Smart TV sticks now and then that was giving me the ick ( annoying) but that’s technology for you. Overall I LOVED my stay, I’ve written lengthy positive reviews about my stay for the 2nd time. Location is 10/10 - 
Customer service - 11/10
Cleanliness - 10/10
Resolving minor problems- 10/10
Room and the features - 11/10 
obsessed with the underfloor heating and night lights in the room. My first visit I was on the  9th floor, room and view was 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾 second room windows that open more then just a crack - loads of space to do a small work out to get my day started. Oh the Spa - I didn’t use it but I went down to have a look around. Decor in the reception and waiting area is lovely especially the chandlers. I’ve taken pics to upload",5,2022,09,07
111,Great stay,Helped by very friendly staff ( Swati) Loved the hotel. would reccomend to any one.Arrived yesterday Room was  perfect nothing out of place Wonderful Continetal Breakfast.Room is very clean and a wonderful layout,5,2022,09,07
111,A lovely treat,"A friend and I were in London as a pit stop on our travels and decided to treat ourselves to a stay at Montcalm. The location is perfect and is within quick walking distance from Moorgate and Liverpool Street.

It is a lovely hotel with amazing service. Concierge team happily took our luggage early before check in and we found them already in our room when we came back. The room was comfy and clean. We also had complimentary access to the spa facilities and enjoyed a hearty breakfast at the Aviary.

Would absolutely return and take some time to enjoy other facilities such as the rooftop bar the next time we stay.",5,2022,09,07
111,"Great stay at the Montcalm Royal House, and not for the first time this year","I've stayed at the Montcalm for the third time this year, and really enjoyed it - Great service, especially from Roxana, who helped me with all of my needs and asks in the dining room, as well as with guidance and willing to assist with the smallest request. I will for sure return there next time I'm in London!",5,2022,09,07
111,Nice hotel,"I have previously stayed with Montcalm RLH in the past & I did not have the best experience (as stated in previous reviews) however I returned despite feeling rather skeptical! However I just want to say I was BEYOND impressed. 
The staff were incredibly attentive they gathered our bags at arrival and made sure they were waiting in our room at check in - they kept our bags safe whilst we explored all the amazing things Central London has to offer & Sara from the guest experience team did the most amazing job showing us to our room & made it a birthday to remember. 
We had balloons gifted as we were celebrating a special birthday, we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and truffles which were a wonderful and unique touch! Our room was absolutely stunning, very spacious and clean! The only downside to the room was the view wasn’t amazing however I’ve overlooked it due to the other outstanding amenities. The breakfast was nice however I do wish I got to try a full English I was unaware that the full English breakfast started at 10am and only a buffet breakfast was available from 8am onwards - that was a downside but would have been good information to keep in mind. 
The Aviary bar is gorgeous with stunning views of the London skyline however can get rather busy and crowded and the staff weren’t as friendly as the staff I dealt with previously (in the lobby & reception) the drinks were absolutely delicious, fairly reasonably priced as well. 
I did use the spa facilities (pool, hot tub, sauna and the steam room) during my stay and I was very impressed, they informed me during my check in that you do have to pre-book the facilities and it was extremely easy to do so. The downsides to the spa facilities was the lack of time - we were told we were only allowed a 30 minute slot in the area which I did not find was enough time to enjoy all RLH had to offer. As well as that we weren’t provided with any robes in our room or downstairs which was not ideal as I was wearing swimwear, I do appreciate that they gave slippers however a robe would’ve been more beneficial in order to protect my own and others privacy as well. 
All in all - a lovely hotel, will hopefully be returning very soon.",4,2022,09,06
111,Excellent Central London Hotel,"My wife and I had an excellent weekend stay at this central London hotel for our wedding anniversary.  The room was large, modern, clean and contained everything we required for our stay.  The nearest tube station (Moorgate) was a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  Could not have wished for a better weekend",5,2022,09,06
111,Last minute overnight stay,"This place is a gem. I am a Londoner and have just stumbled across this place. Firstly, it's great value for money and the bed is so comfortable. A vert calming and deep sleep. The rooftop bar is classy yet comfortable and the food was 5/5 (I am a food critic). 
Aleksandra served us and she was so kind, polite and welcoming, I would definitely stay again. Didn't get to check it out as limited time by they have a pretty nice spa/swimming pool also.",5,2022,09,05
111,Birthday,"Stayed with the hotel last week for my Fiancé’s Birthday and from start to finish I can honestly say we haven’t been treated as well (apart from in Dubai) we were meeted and greeted with such warmth and genuine care which seems to be rare these days. A thank you to all of the staff but a special thank you to Mary who went above and beyond to look after us! Also the staff in the Aviary especially the breakfast manager  who again was so friendly and helpful and truly made us feel welcome, I have forgotten his name. Will definitely be booking another stay before the end of the year!",5,2022,09,05
111,Weekend birthday celebration,"I can say that the staff were brilliant at accommodating me and my partner! This was exceptionally great service and for the occasion it was the Montcalm hotel were amazing at providing this service and fulfilling my requirements! The staff were very lovely and helpful
Through out making it an amazing stay! 5* all round and would definitely come again!!",5,2022,09,04
111,"Outstanding, excellent, and fantastic staff","Great location, quality hotel with appropriate amenities, but what sets it apart, is OUTSTANDING AWESOME STAFF. 

All were professional, pleasant, and competent, however, three went ""above and beyond"" -  reservation staff person  Alex , doorman Alex, front desk person Mariano, and concierge staff Daniel & Francisco.

Special thanks and recognition to Head Concierge Daniel Todorov who provided five star service in every way.",5,2022,09,04
111,Enjoyable stay at the Montcalm,"Myself, my wife, and our 9 month old daughter had a great stay at the Montcalm. The rooms were clean,  comfortable, and spacious for the three of us. The staff was fantastic from the front desk to the bellhops. Roxana from the breakfast was helpful, kind, and accommodating of our family. We’d love to visit again!",5,2022,09,04
111,Fantastic London stay!,"I had a fabulous two night stay here and could not fault anything! The bed, the linen, the room, the heated bathroom floor, everything was just Lovely!  The restaurant is also excellent downstairs near reception, and breakfast was next level served in the beautiful Aviary lounge on the rooftop. Service from all the staff was just amazing, all in all a very lovely experience of London,would book here again!",5,2022,09,04
111,Amazing hotel & exceptional staff,"After hearing really great reviews, I booked an overnight stay at the Montcalm hotel for a surprise 30th birthday trip for my other half. We was stunned at how beautiful it was and was greeted and accompanied throughout our stay by all the staff. Mary topped off our stay by all the little finishing touches she made to our room. We also made use of the spa, restaurant and rooftop bar and was not disappointed in the slightest. The views were incredible and everyone was so lovely, helpful and friendly. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we enjoyed every moment and can’t wait to share our experience with all our friends and family. It was definitely a birthday to remember. I’d highly recommend this to everyone - walking distance to so many beautiful attractions. We can’t wait to come back and visit you all again. Thank you for making our stay so memorable!",5,2022,09,02
111,Best hotel and value for money!,"Absolutely love this hotel! I have stayed here a few times now but my most recent time was definitely one to remember. We stayed in a club room with a view of Finsbury square for my boyfriends birthday. 

The hotel staff were very accommodating by allowing a lady to set up balloons for the occasion before we arrived and Mary in particular was a fantastic host! She greeted me from start to finish and even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and buffet breakfast.

We had the best night sleep as it was so comfy and quiet!",5,2022,09,02
111,Great location for the city...Club lounge not so great,"My wife and I usually stay in other 5 star hotels when visiting London which are predominantly in the West End end.  We were celebrating our 15/16th wedding anniversary and as the trip advisor reviews were very good, we decided to give the Montcalm Royal London hotel ago and booked 3 nights in their Club Room.

The location is very good for the city of London. A short walk from Moorgate Station and close proximity to Liverpool Street, Spitalfields and about a 20 minute walk to St. Pauls and Borough Market.

On arrival we were upgraded  from the  Club Room to Montcalm Club Room...the difference being a slightly larger room and had a view of Finsbury Square. A nice gesture by the hotel was the bed being decorated with hearts and balloons in addition to a complimentary bottle of wine, Obviously this is due to us celebrating our wedding anniversary. The room was nice but the bathroom floor wasn't as clean as it should be. We did ask for this to be cleaned but nothing was done. Therefore my wife took ownership of the issue and cleaned it herself. Not what you expect to do when celebrating our wedding anniversary. 

On a brighter note, the Aviary roof top restaurant is excellent...food, service and a great view. I could not fault it. We used the pool every morning and the process to book this is very user friendly. Once you make your hotel reservation there is a link to book the spa facilities and what you need to bring with you (robes, towels, slippers...all provided in the room). 

Staff are very friendly, some more than others, but not really any issue. What is disappointing is the Club Lounge. The lounge offers limited drinks and even more limited snacks (crisps, olives, almonds, and one other I can't recall), however there was no hot food. This was the same for breakfast...again very limited cold food of ham, salami and salmon and a few other items included yoghurts, bread, rolls and croissants. Again no hot food. One wonders if this is the result of the pandemic!!

Overall our stay at the Montcalm was a pleasant experience but it didn't 'blow us away' as we certainly thought it would be based on trip advisor reviews. However, saying this I would recommend this hotel mainly due to the location, the roof top restaurant and bar, and the majority of the staff.",4,2022,09,02
111,"Great hotel, great staff!","We stayed for a few days at the Montcalm Royal London House and had a very pleasurable experience. The check in staff was so gracious and friendly and took care of us very quickly. Although we arrived prior to check in time they had our rooms ready and available to us. The room were very clean and comfortable. I especially enjoyed the rainfall shower, it felt so luxurious  as did the Elemis shower products. The room was well appointed with a Nespresso machine, a large bottle of water which was replaced when it was used, refrigerator, robes, slippers and several other necessities. Bell staff, especially Ibkohim, was so gracious and always remembered our name. It was truly a pleasure to see him as he always had a smile and a greeting for us. ALL the bellstaff was friendly and going out of their way to help us! Although I only met Mary on my last day at the hotel, I really enjoyed speaking to her. She seemed genuinely interested in my stay at the hotel and told me to email her next time we came to London as she would make sure we were well looked after. It was also a pleasure to speak to her about our travels around London and the travels that were ahead of us. All in all, I had a wonderful stay at this hotel and will definitely return next time I'm in London. The staff at this hotel really make your stay in London that much better! Highly recommended.",5,2022,09,02
111,"Excellent location and facilities, staff verbal communication could be better.","This is a lovely hotel, in a great location for The City, the Barbican etc, a short walk from London Liverpool Street station. Great room, great bed, lovely rooftop bar and breakfast area with amazing views. There is a small but well maintained pool and spa area, which wasn't overly busy when we went.

In all cases the staff were helpful, professional, friendly and very pleasant. The only thing which let it down, a bit, was the almost universally poor standard of English of pretty much all the staff we interacted with. We had to repeat ourselves several times to ask the most basic questions (""What time is breakfast?"" for example), got the wrong drink in the bar (shandy rather than chardonnay! :-) ) & staff had real trouble even reading out some numbers at one point to someone on the phone when there was a booking problem. I totally get that many staff are from overseas, but why not invest in them with some classes to improve their English a bit? 

Oh and the bar shut at 11 pm, when it was fairly well occupied, which we thought was a  bit poor in a hotel of this class in the middle of London, even on a weeknight. I'd expect to be able to get a drink up to midnight frankly.

All that said, above all it was a lovely hotel and would definitely go back.",4,2022,09,01
111,Fantastic city stay,I had a great stay here last week. Mary from the Guest Experience team was fantastic. In fact all the staff were. Comfy bed and clean bathroom.. Would def recommend and re-visit next time I'm in town.,5,2022,09,01
111,Great Stay,Had a great stay in the hotel. Was here for an anniversary and was surprised in the room with petals and balloons. Was shown to the room by Mary who was very helpful and showed us the amenities of the room. We had drinks at The Aviary and the view was amazing. Thank you for a great stay. Will definitely be back.,5,2022,08,31
111,First class as always,Stay here regular for work and the place is fab. Staff are extremely friendly and go out of there way to make you feel welcome. Special mention to Mary one of the managers who always goes above and beyond to make sure I have all I need and am comfortable. It’s the little differences like this from staff that make all the difference. Highly recommended for both business and leisure,5,2022,08,31
111,Birthday Weekend Stay,"Thanks to January Stevens and the team at the Montcalm hotel, booked a weekend stay for my wife’s birthday and I was welcomed and shown to our room and could not do enough for us to make us welcome.

There was even a lovely touch in our room with balloons and a complimentary bottle of wine.

Fantastic stay breakfast was lovely, the hotel was amazing and clean throughout, the staff were always very helpful and polite and our room was perfect too with a great nights sleep so comfortable.

Thank you very much for a wonderful night.",5,2022,08,31
111,Birthday Visit,Me and partner stayed for our birthdays and had the best stay. We was upgraded with balloons and macaroons in the room.  The complimentary spa was a nice touch.Thank you Mary and team for looking after us. We will definitely be back.,5,2022,08,31
111,A Special Stay!,"My partner and I stayed here to celebrate his birthday and the team at Montcalm Royal went above and beyond to make our stay special. A fantastic location, lovely room and the staff even decorated the room for his birthday. Special thanks to January and Mary who made sure we had everything we needed. We loved the spa facilities and  will definitely be back, a 5 star experience!",5,2022,08,31

Will definitely be back",5,2022,08,30
111,Relaxing weekend away,"Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough! The staff went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. Breakfast was delicious with a huge section to choose from. The pool and jacuzzi was so relaxing and rooms are immaculate and have all the mod cons. It’s location is perfect for getting around London with Liverpool st station and Margate station both a very short walk away. 
I will certainly be back again.

111,One of the best stays we've had,"Me and my boyfriend came here for my birthday surprise yesterday booked by him and I loved it from start to finish he done well in choosing this hotel, great service by the staff very friendly and helpful greeted us and took our bags off us into reception where we checked in, had a complimentary lemonade drink which was lovely, clean and very comfortable room with lovely mood lights which was a great touch and very quiet too which was a bonus, enjoyed the rooftop bar with the wonderful views which really makes the setting, enjoyed the pool and spa facilities, finished off with a very tasty meal in the evening, overall experience is excellent and I can definitely see why it is a 5 star hotel totally happy and will definitely be returning :-).",5,2022,08,29
111,Birthday trip,Me and my partner came to stay for my birthday and Sara helped us to our room and organised for wine and macaroons to be delivered to our room. She went the extra mile to make sure we had the best time.,5,2022,08,29
111,Birthday stay,"I decided to pick Montcalm due to its extremely central location and travel connections. The fact it is a 5 star hotel sealed the deal as it was after all, my wife's birthday. We were greeted by Mary at the desk, who was extremely friendly and helpful. In fact, she managed to get us checked in early, even though I did not expect this to be possible! I simply came to drop off my bags so I could check in later in the day. So straight away, it was a possitive. Upon noticing it was my wife's birthday, Mary made the day even better by arranging a bottle of bubbly for our room. And might I add, it went down really well. Top marks. Every day we were greeted by Alex, the Moldovan concierge. He was a delight to talk to and he was happy to help with anything. If you are staying here, be sure to talk to him, and mention my review! The hotel room was very comfortable. The bed was soft and I've had the best night sleep compared to others I've stayed in. The location, Finsbury park was somewhere I've never stayed before, but I'm glad I did. Theres 3 main train and underground stations a  stone's throw away which means you can get to anywhere you want in London within minutes. I highly recommend staying here for business, sight seeing, or just for a relaxing break, as it is a spa too! Next time we will stay for the hotel and go out less so we can make use of the facilities.",5,2022,08,28
111,Best hotel I’ve been to in London,"I’d like to personally thank Mary Philippiah. From the start she made my stay very easy and comfortable. She decorated the room so nicely. Everyone was very helpful and the room was absolutely amazing. 
Thank you so much",5,2022,08,28
111,Beautiful hotel and very helpful and friendly staff,"I have had a very lovely experience whilst staying at the Montcalm hotel. It was very relaxing. The rooms were very neat and clean. All of the staff members were very friendly and welcoming.

I have met a lovely lady at the reception desk called Mary. She was very welcoming,friendly and super helpful! 

Thank you for a great experience. 

I will definitely be back soon!",5,2022,08,27
111,5 star stay,"It was a very pleasant stay. The location is very nice, Finsbury Sq is a refreshing spot in the middle of busy city. The staffs are very polite and willing to go for extra mile. Cleanliness is top notch! Requested something for my 25th birthday and all staffs went above and beyond in making me feel special. Really appreciate this from Montcalm!",5,2022,08,27
111,Perfect anniversary stay,"We had a wonderful stay from the moment we arrived. Without any prior arrangement by us, guest services had noted it was out wedding anniversary and decorated the room and left some fresh macaroons. This was a lovely thoughtful start to our visit. We had a couple of drinks in the roof top aviary bar, the views are stunning. The room was large, comfy and above all dark and quiet to sleep. All the staff we met were professional but friendly. We hope to return very soon, thank you",5,2022,08,27
111,Bliss,"Decided to stay here for a night it was a nice day and ive previously been and used the rooftop. 
Welcomed in by front of house and managed to speak with Miriam the manager who is not only helpful but friendly to 5 stars service, thank you miriam she initially helped with sorting my accomadation.

The hotel also have great food, security. By the way, it is convenient for me to call the Uber eats.",5,2022,08,27
111,Perfect residence in London,"We spent 2 days for our anniversary. 

The room was very clean. Upon my request, our room was perfectly decorated. The whole team was very obliging..

Special thx to the doorman, the definition of exceptional client service.

Definitely our address going forward",5,2022,08,26
111,Great stay for 3 days,"The hotel and especially all the staff are outstandingly great and the service is excellent. Rooms, meeting rooms and public areas are very clean, luxurious and stylish. 
The Bars and Restaurants are brilliant - especially the roof top bar Aviary Rooftop Bar & Restaurant is a must visit at any time.
Congratulations for the whole team for creating such a uniquely great experience",5,2022,08,26
111,"Great welcome, amazing people","We stayed at this hotel for our 16th anniversary. Staff at front desk made our stay a very enjoyable one. When they heard that it was our anniversary, they went over and beyond to make our room as romantic-looking as possible.

Thank you Mary, and your front team for giving us such a memorable experience. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,08,26
111,"Great hotel, wonderful staff","I can not say enough about the friendliness and professionalism of all the staff at the hotel. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. The hotel itself is in a great  central location. The check in area is spacious and there are hotel staff everywhere trying to help. The hotel rooms are very spacious, modern, quiet, and clean.  Room service is fast and efficient, and breakfast is fantastic. There is a very nice restaurant on the the top floor with great views of the city. The concierge service is extremely professional and helpful. They go above and beyond expectations to make sure you are provided with your needs. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and family and to everyone who is looking for a great stay in London.",5,2022,08,25
111,Comfort and a warm welcome,"Just back from a lovely two-night stay in this very friendly city hotel. Obviously designed for business clients, so the look is unfussy but high quality. Excellent shower, spotless room, nice pool with jets. 
The rooftop is the star, with comfortable sofas inside and out and a large bar inside, where you also get a good breakfast with views over the city (not the prettiest bits, but walkie talkie building, shard etc.) I ordered bread and oil nibbles from the bar which were excellent and very generous.
The staff are the other wow factor. Everyone was friendly and helpful. I must mention especially Tyia and Mariano on front desk and smiley doorman Alex who obviously has a heart as big as he is. 
From there we walked to the Barbican, the Museum of the Home and Shordeitch. 10 min walk from Liverpool St.",5,2022,08,25
111,Superb,"Had a lovely experience the man greeting us at the door was so helpful. We went to the roof top bar and it was beautiful inside and outside. Beni our waitress went above and beyond and when she found out we were visiting for a birthday treat made it extra special. 
The spa experience we booked was lovely and so relaxing, unfortunately the steam room was not available but the rest of our time their more than made up for this. All the staff we encountered were professional and very approachable. Would defo recommend the spa day.",5,2022,08,24
111,Disappointed,"Expected great things Bed was comfy room quiet everywhere clean and tidy but these are min. requirements of even a 1 star
Angry at being told we would need to book their rooftop AviaryBar even as guests only to find it fully booked.To make matters worse,  reception level bar was closed off for buildwork & the downstairs, off the street pub style bar is just that! If you are a paying guest in a hotel, all its normal facilities should be available to you.
The ""tablet"" controlled lights etc in the room is a nice modern idea....until you need the loo at 2 am & just want that light on..not the whole room, not call reception, not set an alarm!What's wrong with a switch Tablet itself emits light all night.Told reception on checkout to be told ""you could have had a cover for it if you'd asked"". How were we supposed to know that was an option....leave the cover in the room then.
There was no chair at the desk/dressing table area in our room. You'd think this was an oversight & would be met with ""Oh im so sorry Madam, we'll sort that immediately"" I had to speak with 3 people at reception to get them to understand what I was saying & although a chair was delivered (a huge swivel office type thing) I felt like I was somehow in the wrong and had asked for something really difficult.
Breakfast average.  Not exactly a wide selection .
There are just some the things. It's in the details. On balance we had a lovely weekend but 3 stars is where I would put this hotel, certainly not 5",3,2022,08,24
111,Perfect days in London,"The hotel is great - we had a familiy suite (2 rooms have been  put together)  - 2 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms… very nice…
The employees are so friendly - especially to note is head concierge Daniel.
A hotel to recommend.",5,2022,08,24
111,ABSOLUTELY LOVED OUR STAY,"My partner and i stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House on July 20 to July 28 2022. I am from Australia and i wasn’t sure what to expect, but their premises definitely exceeded it. They also arranged pick-up and drop off taxis for me from and to LHR. 
As soon as i checked-in i was welcomed by their lovely front desk staff, and my bags were immediately taken up to my room by their concierge. The facilities were then explained to me and i purchased the “breakfast included” package they had on offer. Breakfast was superb! Fresh fruits and selections were nice. 
The housekeepers dropped by our room everyday to make the bed, empty the bins and towels were changed everyday. They would then come back to do roundings to make sure we were happy with their service and if we needed anything else. I would also like to commend their laundry services! My clothes were neatly packed in a box and nicely pressed. Sad we didn’t get to try the spa as we had other plans during the day, and would come back pretty late at night. 
When we checked-out, we were greeted by who i assume was the guest services manager. She was super lovely and asked how our stay was. I travel all the time and not every time i get greeted by someone higher up, so i really appreciate how she made it her priority to do so. My flight back to Australia wasn’t until later in the night and they were more than happy to keep 4 of my bags so i could explore a bit more until i had to come back to their premises to be taken to LHR by the taxi they had booked for me. 

The trip was very special for me as it was mine and my partner’s first time meeting coming from years of being in a long distance relationship. The staff of Montcalm RLH made it extra special for us and would forever be grateful. I would never think twice of booking them again next time i come back to the UK.",5,2022,08,24
111,Fantastic service at RLH!,"I booked a weekend surprise for my girlfriend’s birthday at Montcalm Royal House London, after having a great experience at the Montcalm East a few months prior.

The staff at Montcalm Royal House London went above and beyond for the birthday celebrations I had planned, with balloons adorning the bed, a touching card from the hotel, and a complimentary assortment of chocolates to boot.

The room was amazing, in terms of presentation and cleanliness. The only minor complaint I had was with the touchpad in the wall to access air con/bathroom lights. It was a bit slow, and made weird noises a few times, but overall, the room was in top condition.

Mary, one of the members of staff, took very good care of us, she was so kind in pouring lemonade for us that was available in the lobby on a warm summer’s day! She was so sweet. Then you have Daniel, and also Sara (Sarah?), who were, too, very kind and pleasant members of staff to interact with.

Just by chance, in the lift, I had a brief convo with another member of staff who worked at the hotel. He suggested I head to the terrace and really made me feel welcome. His name escapes me.

Unfortunately, due to our busy schedule we weren’t able to make use of the variety of facilities; the  aforementioned rooftop terrace, the hotel pub, the bar, the spa, or gym, but we most certainly will on the next visit.

Highly recommend this hotel! It’s in a great location, very close to Moorgate and Liverpool Street stations, and has loads of restaurants in the vicinity if you don’t want to eat at the hotel!",5,2022,08,22

We got taken up to our room and wished a lovely stay. All staff were very accommodating and had our best interests at heart the entire time. The rooftop terrace was also a lovely add on. Lovely view and delicious cocktails! We also went for dinner about 10 min walk from the hotel at the alchemist which has AMAZING FOOD! Honestly the food was superb so definitely give that a visit if you stay nearby! Really had a great evening and can’t thank the hotel enough 😊,5,2022,08,22

111,Amazing Stay at The Montcalm Royal London House,"I stayed at The Montcalm Royal House the night of my birthday and I had such a fabulous stay. I enjoyed everything from the room, to the service, to the amenities and even the room service. The staff were all incredibly nice - they decorated my room for my birthday which I was really grateful for. The spa area is also really nice - I had a massage, used the jacuzzi and sauna and highly recommend it. I also ordered room service and the food was top tier. Overall I would highly recommend this place to any looking for a short or long term stay in London. This hotel has everything you need and they will not hestitate to go up and beyond to make sure you're having a plesasant stay. I also felt very safe at this hotel as well, which was very important to me. Overall I give this hotel a 9.5/10.",5,2022,08,20
111,A great place for a luxurious stay,We visited for our anniversary and the staff couldn’t have done more for us. The service was impeccable and the room was lovely. We were looked after by Mary who was helpful and showed us to our room. We used the pool which was lovely and relaxing. The upgrade to Club room meant we had access to the Club area in the evening and at breakfast.,5,2022,08,20

111,MUST VISIT HOTEL.,"I booked this hotel for my partners 21st and it was money well spent. The facilities are really nice, the bedroom Is also really lavish. I was delighted to see that the bathroom had underfloor heating. 

On top of that, I want to give a huge thank you to Mary. Mary is part of guest experiences, and I wanted her to decorate the room for my partners bday. She was so so lovely and she really brought my vision to life of how I wanted the room to be. She is extremely welcoming and so friendly and honestly she made my experience at the Montcalm hotel.

In addition, the staff are really welcoming and the service was impeccable. If you needed anything, they were the first to come through very quickly! 

I would really recommend staying here, for whatever the occasion, as It was a really relaxing stay!",5,2022,08,18
111,Friendly and comfortable,"Was very pleased I could stay here for the night, as the staff here were very professional and hospitable. 

The room was well looked after and very clean, however there could have been a bit more information in the room for guests. 

Besides this, I was impressed by the service and room and look forward to returning soon.",5,2022,08,18
111,A perfect stay,"Fantastic hotel in a great location but it is the service that makes the experience special. The team are great, attentive and professional. The bar staff, reception and breakfast teams as well as those in the spa. Can’t wait to come back. Thanks again.",5,2022,08,18
111,Absolutely Amazing!,"So feedback…. 

 

Alex - Was absolutely first class! He made my stay an absolute pleasure! Personal service! Professional & just perfect! 

 

Sarah ( Iranian lady ) I’m sure her name was Sarah & she showed me to my room & was an amazing host! 

 

The concierge guy from Bulgaria! Very personal & good at his job! 

 

All of the ladies working on the front desk were amazing! Someone who stood out to me & I can’t remember her name but she was so pleasant & nice I asked her how long she’s worked there & it was only 2 weeks I think, small petite lady but everyone was amazing. 

 

Gym was just enough for what I needed, I never got chance to use the spa but looked amazing!

 

The room was perfect! The floor-to-ceiling windows really made it for me! 

 

Honestly, I really enjoyed my time & had a successful business trip & I’d like to thank you all.",5,2022,08,17
111,A wonderful time,"My husband and I spent two nights at the hotel and had a wonderful time.  Everything was to our liking; the weight staff, the restaurants, the complimentary breakfast, our room and the view.  Plus especially the pool and spa.  In particular Mariano was very attentive and went out of his way to ensure that we were pleased.  The one thing I would mention is that we stayed around the weekend  such that the hotel top bar was quite the party scene.  This means it was hard to get a seat since there were larger group parties.  To be sure; it is definitely a hot spot. But small matter, we came to tour London and would definitely recommend this hotel.  ",5,2022,08,16
111,Wonderful luxurious hotel for our minimoon!,"We stayed at the Montcalm for 2 nights for our “minimoon”. 
We mentioned this on our booking in the hopes that we’d get a nice room with a nice view. When we arrived, we was escorted to our room by Mary. The bed had “congratulations” balloons with red rose petals and a bottle of Prosecco on chill in a bucket! There was also a lovely little handwritten card wishing us a pleasant stay. The window faced Finsbury square where we could see a beautiful grass area.

The room was incredibly clean! Very modern, spacious and nicely decorated. The bed was very large and comfy, the bathroom had a big shower too. 
The room aircon, underfloor heating, (some) lighting, cleaning request/do not disturb is all managed on a screen - you just tap whatever setting you want. Really great, saves you fiddling with settings accidentally making your room an uncomfortable temperature. 

We used the spa both days which was an absolute dream! Went up on to the rooftop bar for some drinks one afternoon which had a great view. We also did breakfast at the hotel too which was delicious! The downstairs bar had 2 shuffleboards which we thoroughly enjoyed after a few drinks and dinner. 

We was very well looked after and Mary provided great customer service! We will definitely be going back!",5,2022,08,16
111,Another superb visit,"I cannot praise the hotel and the staff enough. Right from the main entrance, every member of staff you meet is friendly, helpful, chatty and genuinely makes you feel so welcome. The rooms are always excellent, have a range of upmarket toiletries and accessories, and a lovely welcome card on the table. The shower is to die for.

There is a wide range of cocktails in the bar and nothing is too much trouble. We had dinner in the Aviary restaurant.  It was an absolutely first class meal. We shared two main courses, the Turbot and the Madagascan Prawns together with a superb bottle of Pouilly Fusee wine. It was the best meal we've had for a very long time.

I do not often write praise like this but it is genuinely deserved. It is the most relaxed and enjoyable experience we have had.",5,2022,08,16
111,Good value for money,"Went for Our first anniversary. Parked in the barbican 10mins away from hotel. Good welcome and staff were very helpful at reception.
Room was nice but very built up area so not a great view of the city.
We booked in the avery upstairs for dinner. Food was amazing prices were reasonable. We expected a higher dress code as we phoned and were told the rules but many people were not informed like we were so felt overdressed,  my wife got changed.
Bar prices are high and breakfast in the morning was back I'm the avery and the English breakfast was a good selection but could have been warmer. Would definitely stay again but would dress more casual in future.",4,2022,08,16
111,Great Time at Montcalm,"The area was quiet on the weekends because of the locale, which was great for us and getting away from the crowds.  Still close to multiple underground stations.  Our room was really nice, and it included the buffet breakfast.  The club level was worth the free afternoon cocktails for sure.  The hotel service was great.  The hotel hallways are dark - felt a bit like Vegas because of that, but the rooms are well appointed and spacious.  I would highly recommend.",4,2022,08,15
111,Fabulous Birthday Treat,"My Sister and I chose this hotel for her birthday and it was the most amazing hotel in every way.  We like to treat ourselves when we visit London and it exceeded our expectations.  The staff are all amazing and make you feel like royalty.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and modern with all the detail you would hope for in a 5-star hotel. The rooms are quiet and we had a great nights sleep which is rare for me.   

I asked whether a cupcake could be included in the room as a surprise for my Sister and we were greeted with balloons and a bottle of wine.  Mary Philippiah greeted us upon arrival and came out to greet us on our departure.  All of the staff are attentive and professional in every way.  We will definitely come back.",5,2022,08,15
111,Miss the preCovid standards,"The standards seem to have dropped the cleaning was not up to standard the towels felt  hard and a bit old .
There are no refreshments in the fridge and the club lounge access no longer serves-hot food so it’s no longer value for money 
The AC was working properly in the room 

RMH before Covid was amazing sadly the last trip will be our last trip",2,2022,08,14
111,Birthday weekend,"Amazing hotel, we stayed for a birthday weekend in london and were both really surprised by how good the hotel was.

Throughout our stay Mary always offered her services to try improve our stay and went above and beyond in the setup of our room with happy birthday balloons and roses.

I definitely will be returning and would recommend.",5,2022,08,14
111,Family trip was a success.  Concierge made the trip- Daniel went beyond to make our stay an amazing time,"Hotel is as expected. Clean and comfortable rooms.  We had the family suite which is effectively 2 rooms connected with a door which worked well.  Hotel is not the best set up for children as they have pool and other policies which limit child access; however, we were able to make the most of doing other things besides using the hotel pool or lounge on the roof w the family.

Daniel the head concierge was extremely helpful.  He went beyond in setting up car service to and from the airport, dinner reservations at michelin rated restaurants, recommendations for tours and other attractions and even helped with audibles for last minute changes.  I can't speak any higher of his commitment to making sure we had a great time.

Look forward to returning soon.",5,2022,08,14
111,Amazing service,"We spent a night at Montcalm in celebration of our wedding anniversary.
On arrival the staff werrme friendly and welcoming. We were ushered to our room by one of the managers Mary who was absolutely amazing and went out of her way to make the room  beautiful with some ballons, wines....

I will definitely recommend the hotel as the staff were amazing, food was good and room was comfortable.",5,2022,08,13
111,A fabulous weekend break!,"My Mum and I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel to celebrate my Mum’s 74th birthday. We had the best weekend. January Stevens, the Guest Experience Manager, went out of her way and above and beyond to make our stay so special. We arrived early to drop off our bags and were delighted to learn that our room was ready. We were greeted at reception by January who gave us the best welcome and cooled us down with ice cold raspberry lemonades which were very welcomed given the London heat. Check in was smooth and efficient and we were shown to our room. I had booked a twin Montcalm Club room which was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows. We had a great view overlooking the city. January had kindly arranged for balloons, chocolates and fizz in the room. My Mum was so happy. We didn’t eat dinner in the hotel but had complimentary drinks downstairs and drinks upstairs in the rooftop bar before heading out. We had a great nights’ sleep as the hotel was very quiet. Breakfast in the morning was excellent. We were upgraded to breakfast in the rooftop restaurant which had plenty of choice. Overall we had a wonderful celebration weekend in London which was made all the more fabulous due to January. Thank you Montcalm! We’ll be back!",5,2022,08,13
111,Fabulous hotel in a prime location.,"Deepak the manager prides himself on the professionalism of his staff and the high level of service delivered by all his team.

111,Best customer service I have ever received,"I had been emailing guest services prior to arrival, and they upgraded my room for free and added Prosecco and other amenities on to the room for us, as I had a problem doing this with members of staff on the phone. 
The guest experience executive Mary was an absolute star. She made sure everything was perfect for our stay and I could not be more grateful. The room was lovely, a great hotel and breakfast was delicious. I would 100% recommend and I will be excited to plan my next stay!",5,2022,08,13
111,Surprised with a proposal!,I honestly don't know where to start! The Montcalm were amazing from the very beginning! Not only did they decorate our room but they upgraded us too! Very very attentive and customer friendly. Always had smiles on there faces. The whole trip was incredible and it was made even better with the Montcalm. Rooftop bar was beautiful! Unfortunately didn't get to use the pool as you have to prebook. We will definitely be coming again and highly recommend them!! The breakfast was gorgeous also! So much choice and fresh too. Thank you so much to Mary who helped arrange everything. We had a fantastic time and my fiancé didn't want to leave haha they even kept hold of our luggage on our last day so we could do more sight seeing. Incredible hotel and incredible staff! 5 stars all round and a big thank you from 2 of your happiest customers ❤️,5,2022,08,13
111,Relaxation in style for unbeatable value,"I was in need of a conveniently-located hotel where I could kick back, relax and engage in some self-care and am so glad I found this place. Not only did they have a great (earlier than most places) check-in time of 2 pm, perfect after a long journey, but they were also willing to transfer my reservation at no cost after I had mistakenly booked for the night before I arrived. Once I got to the front desk they very quickly and professionally sorted the issue and had me to my room within minutes. Staff were friendly and greeted me courteously along the way.

The halls and decor were very stylish and modern, somewhat like a club lounge, as was my room. There I found a tall bottle of water waiting for me, as well as (upon further inspection) a well-stocked cabinet with a Nespresso machine and pods, high quality teas, cream, sugar and biscuits. The room also had, for which I was grateful, air-conditioning, underfloor heating in the bathroom, an accessible rain shower and a very soft bed. It was very quiet.

Upon arrival, I was also able to book a time to use the pool and jacuzzi, and was even able to book a massage at the last minute. The pool area was beautiful and quiet, and the jacuzzi was the perfect temperature.

My experience with in-hotel dining was also great: since I was injured and did not want to walk far, I ordered room-service for both dinner and breakfast and was very pleased with the quality of my meals and how quickly the food arrived.

All in all, this was a great stay. I’ve already recommended it to family members for future stays in London, and will look forward to returning myself.",5,2022,08,12
111,Lovely,I booked this foR my partners birthday and everything was lovely but I have to give an extra special thanks to Mary and Shwarta. Mary was very helpful and greeted us on arrival as well as when it was time for us to leave. We will definitely visit again.,5,2022,08,12

I will definitely come back and can only recommend the hotel to everyone!,5,2022,08,11
111,Birthday stay,"We stayed here for 1 night in the deluxe room, the rooms are lovely and so clean! the aircon worked, the bed was very comfy our room was a decent size. The reception staff were helpful and welcoming with smiles, we went to the rooftop bar at around 9:45 and we didnt have the best experience the security guard wouldnt let us outside just to see the view as it shut at 10pm and we got 2 malibu and pineapple juice’s for a whooping £32! But our stay at the hotel and the breakfast in the morning was amazing, the spa was quiet and relaxing. again the staff were great will definitely be returning.",5,2022,08,11

Lovely touches like decorating our room with balloons and leaving a complimentary bottle of wine were greatly appreciated. We will definitely stay again.",5,2022,08,09
111,Reasonable hotel for a short stay in London,"The hotel is reasonably well located, since it's reachable by walking from either the Moorgate tube or the Liverpool Street Station.

However, the staff is not particularly friendly, the hotel seems a bit outdated, and the breakfast is extremely expensive for its quality, with a small amount of products and some of then not being fresh at all, like the bread.

The room, though comfortable, has a double bed that is smaller than I'm used to in other hotels.

All of this on top of an expensive price and a 5 star hotel which doesn't seem 5 star at all.

Though it was not an awful stay, the hotel has much to improve.",3,2022,08,09
111,Great place to stay!,"Had a lovely stay here. The staff are really friendly. The roof top bar is perfect with stunning views, and the bedrooms are really well kitted out. Will definitely return. 
Didn’t eat here but I’m sure the food would be good. The pub at the back of the hotel shows sport which is a bonus.",5,2022,08,09

It is located in a lovely section of London very close to Moorgate tube so getting to and from Wimbledon and all over London was easy. There are shops and eateries nearby, and the hotel has two bars with food. The breakfasts were very ample and we were always welcomed by friendly staff. This goes for the hotel staff in general - always greeting us and checking in as to how our stay was going.

They went above and beyond to help me get my boarding pass the night before leaving which meant no standing in the lines out the doors at Heathrow!

The room (a double) was amply big and we had a huge tv with a great selection of channels. The closets were large and there was a small refrigerator, too.

I'm definitely staying at the Montcalm Royal London House in the future and suggest you do, too!",5,2022,08,04
111,Amazing stay,When we arrived we was greeted by the manager January. She was so welcoming and went above and beyond for us. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for 5 star quality and service. Every penny was well worth it.,5,2022,08,04
111,Excellent!,This hotel is beautiful and staff very friendly and helpful. I felt like a queen. 😄 We had a family suite and it was excellent because we had actually two similar size rooms with big bathrooms separeted by a door. Perfect when travelling with teenagers! rooms were big and tidy. Beds super comfy! Hotel had amazing roof terrace with super nice view.,5,2022,08,03
111,Great stay and excellent breakfast,"We had a great stay in Montcalm RLH. Everything went well and the hotel met our expectations perfectly. We had booked a family suite for 2 nights. It was a nice surprise that this was actually 2 combined rooms, which meant we had 2 bathrooms. Room was spotlessly clean. Bathroom had a good shower and nice toiletries. The location of the hotel was good, only a short walk from Liverpool Street tube station. Breakfast was excellent. There were 2 breakfast options; you could opt for the continental breakfast on the ground floor or have the full English breakfast on the top floor (great view!). The staff was very friendly and helpful. Manager Pamela was nice and made us feel welcome.",4,2022,08,03

111,Fantastic staff and management!,"My partner and I booked a weekend away as a treat before our baby comes in October and had a fabulous stay. We had a couple of technical problems with our room so were moved to another with no issues at all. All of the staff went above and beyond to make up for the problems with the room and were so kind. We’d particularly like to thank January and Camelia who really gave fantastic customer service and made us feel special the entire weekend with their kindness. There was also a gentleman on reception who went above and beyond to assist us, unfortunately we forgot to ask his name but he was fantastic. 
My partner proposed to me on the Saturday evening after we had dined in the aviary restaurant and we’d also like to thank the lovely manager there that helped him to do this and eased his nerves too! It really was perfect.
I would not hesitate to recommend a stay here to anyone and we are looking forward to returning anytime we visit London again.",5,2022,07,31

111,My birthday weekend in London ,"This was our first stay at the Montcalm Hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
Once we arrived and said it was my birthday we received a bottle of red wine in our room courtesy of the hotel.
We had some lovely pre dinner drinks in the avery bar on the rooftop (very Instagram friendly) and then for dinner we hadn't booked anything and the Concierge suggested a restaurant and made the booking for us. At the restaurant we received 2 glasses of champagne which were gifted by the Montcalm!
Also to say the bed is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, in any hotel I have stayed in. Wonderful stay, great location and very friendly staff. We will be back for sure ",5,2022,07,31

Would definitely recommend it.",5,2022,07,26
111,Happy regular business visitor,"I have been coming here once a month on business since October 2021. I have built an excellent relationship with the staff on reception, at breakfast and Alex Stroie.

I am vegan and initially the breakfast offer was a bit limited. However the hotel has worked so hard with me to make it better. I think a hospitality business that can respond to feedback and work with the customer is brilliant.

I also love the little touches. They know I’m vegan so they no longer provide chocolates on arrival. I get a lovely plate of fresh fruit, as well as a bottle of wine.

I also love the robes that are now provided in the rooms. They’re super fluffy and so nice to put on after a long day.

I also frequently use the gym for running. The treadmills are top notch and I like it that the gym now has longer opening hours.

Thank you Montcalm RLH.",5,2022,07,26

111,The most lovely stay!!!,"My friends and I have had the most exceptionally lovely stay here. The front desk staff was so warm and welcoming from the start. The hotel manager, January, made our trip so memorable. She makes every guest feel so welcomed and special and helps in any way she can. She is the best!!! 

The rooms are so comfortable, clean and nice — very comfy beds, air conditioning in the summer is wonderful, beautiful bathrooms. Located near tube stations and cafes/restaurants. Highly recommend!",5,2022,07,25
111,This is a rare find in London. It has it all at a good price,"We went with some friends. Everyone was friendly, the location was perfect to connect you to the rest of London via Tube, only a short walk to Liverpool Street and Morgate
The room was spotless, food great and spa was really good.

Highly recommend.",5,2022,07,24
111,Very disappointed,"Upon arrival there were big renovation works at the entance. Our room was not ready and as a ""5* hotel"" I would expect a complimentary glass of bubbles offered for the inconvenience. We were shown to our room and I was wished happy birthday, there were some balloons, a card and a bottle of red wine (which we don't drink). 

Initially we thought the room smelled a little weird but the giant glass windows do not open, so we just got ready and headed out for the evening. There was no shower gel in our room so I called concierge, the wait to be answered was unacceptable. The room was also very warm, inspite of the air-conditioning being set to maximum. 

The next morning we awoke to the foul stench of sewerage in our room. We phoned concierge, again with a long call wait time, and two staff arrived to investigate. They sent a cleaner to put a tablet in the toilet and we headed out for lunch. Unsurprisingly, upon our return the stench was still there. We headed straight down to the front desk and complained. We were ""upgraded"" to a junior suite which faced inwards and had the awful humming noise from the spa. We were not satisfied with this ""upgrade"" but we could not stay in our original room because of the horrendous sewerage smell. 

The breakfast was basic and the spa was very small. Staff didn't seem particularly interested in us as guests. We were very disappointed, especially seeing as I have previously stayed in Montcalms and been very happy with them. We definitely won't be staying again.",1,2022,07,24
111,Perfect girls weekend,"This hotel was everything I wanted and more than I expected. 
Wonderfully helpful staff. Beautiful decor and rooms. Tranquil spa. Chic rooftop bar. Easy commute into central London. 

The deal we had was such great value for money.  Will absolutely look out for future deals as I’d be very happy to return for an equally fabulous girls weekend break.",5,2022,07,23
111,Lovely stay,"Very nice for my partner's birthday. Was upgraded to a lovely suite at no extra charge. The staff were friendly and helpful. Aleksandra was polite and very welcoming. 

The spa was lovely and we will definitely be coming back",5,2022,07,23
111,Over night stay,"Very nice and relaxing stay. I called hotel after finding a deal online. Spoke to mandeep in sales who was fantastic! He set me up with that price match and additional perks. The room was clean, up to date and very comfortable. Best nights sleep I a long time. The roof top bar had a great view with friendly and helpful staff. Front desk was also efficient. Recommend for anyone who wants a great hotel which is close to the tube station and a small
Walk to bars and restaurants.",5,2022,07,23
111,"Good hotel, Great staff, AVOID THE SPA!","My wife and I were staying here for the weekend for our wedding anniversary.

We found all the staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. They’re a real asset tot the hotel.

We arrived early and our room wasn’t ready which wasn’t a problem. We enjoyed a drink at the rooftop bar and then headed to the west end for a Matinee performance and the hotel held our luggage. 

Once we came back, we collected our room key and the lovely Mary from the customer care team took us up to our room where our luggage was already waiting for us. During our chit chat we mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and she wished us a happy anniversary and added complimentary full English breakfasts to our booking for our stay. Very nice touch and appreciated. 

The rooms are nice and generally pretty clean and tidy. I always find some people are super critical when it comes to marks/damage to decoration in rooms etc. and if you’re one of these people, you will see some. We are pretty relaxed as long as it’s clean and tidy. There was a pretty unsightly stain on the carpet but other than and a few wall blemishes here and there, it was perfectly adequate.

Unfortunately our first nights sleep wasn’t as peaceful as we would have liked - not the hotels fault I hasten to add. I appreciate we’re in the city but we had some drunks shouting for a couple of hours in the early hours of the morning. As our room was 204 this faced the front of the hotel and not far off ground level so it woke us up. The bed was very comfy though. 

We went up for breakfast which was very enjoyable and of high quality. The croissants and sausages were excellent. I’d say some stuff can feel like it needs warming up at times but it’s a self service buffer and it can be hard keeping stuff piping hot. I’d just keep an eye out for when they put out fresh items and grab them while they’re hot. 

After breakfast we went to reception about a change of room and stressed that it wasn’t their fault but if there was anything they could do. The receptionist went out back to speak with a manager who not only personally came out and apologised but saw to it to have our luggage moved to a new, quieter  room while we were out for the day and we’d just have to grab new keys when we were back. Fantastic customer service. The spa manager should take note (more on this below). 

Once we returned from our day out, grabbed the keys, we went to check out our new room. This room faced internally between buildings (so no view but that was perfectly fine to be a bit quieter) and on the 4th floor. When we walked in, we were surprised to see they had upgraded us to a suite. Very kind and much appreciated. Was a great room and we slept solid the next night. 

So after all these great points, why only 4 bubbles?

Well, that’s easy. The spa. 

I had called the spa a few days ahead to book in a couples 50min hot stone massage at a cost of £95pp @ 10am. I was told at the time of booking, strictly no refunds/cancellation policy. Fine.

We were told to be down 10/15mins before to fill in consultation forms which is fairly typical. We made our way down from our room in our robes. We were greeted and filled in the forms where we sat and waited… and waited. 

We weren’t particularly in a rush so it was no big deal. What was a big deal though is that our massages started 20mins late and they finished promptly at 10:49am. What’s even worse is they didn’t even mention it, they just carried on to see if we noticed. Very underhanded. 

The massages themselves were very poor. My wife and I enjoy spa breaks and have had massages all over the world and I’ve never experienced anything like it. A hot stone massages where stones weren’t used for half the massage. Very painful and poor technique left me with visible bruises and both of us in pain for a few days after. Hardly relaxing.

I raised this with staff as soon as we came out of the treatment who called a manager in a back office and then proceeded to try offer us a lesser massage for shorter time to fill the gap. I wouldn’t let them touch me again anyway but the fact was we had a train to catch from Paddington. 

I said that’s not possible as we were leaving London and he phoned the manager in the back again but couldn’t get through. Told us to take a seat and I said you may as well just have them come out, it’s easier. 

The manager came out and frankly didn’t seem that bothered and just offered us a glass of fizz to smooth it over but we politely declined as we were about to leave the hotel due to the aforementioned train. I said I was looking for a partial refund because I hadn’t received 20mins of the paid service which is 40% of the time! Staggering.

She apologised but said she would need to raise it with head office as she didn’t have the power to do any kind of refunds. I’ve never heard anything so crazy as a manager basically having the power to do nothing. She said I’d get an email in 2-3 days and I had a gut feeling that wouldn’t happen and they just wanted to fob me off.

Low and behold, no communication. At 6 days post treatment I’ve reached out to them via email for a follow up and resolution which is frankly, unacceptable. 

We also heard receptionist talking on the phone and it seems the spa is on Groupon etc. Make of that what you will. All it means is we paid far more than anyone else.

I’m guessing I won’t hear from them again and will have to initiate a chargeback. I will update this review if anything changes. 

The spa IS a separate business to the hotel but as it’s in their grounds and basically part of it, ultimately it partially falls on their head too and I expect better from this kind of establishment.

To sum up;
Good hotel. Great staff. Avoid the spa at all costs.",4,2022,07,23
111,Always Lovely,"Lovely weekend away. Beautiful clean rooms and efficient staff. When I stayed you could openly use the gym and pool as long as you wished, however there are now COVID-19 restrictions in place which means you can only use the facilities for half an hour. This is their own rule and as a hotel cannot expect guest to pay the same room charges if this is the case. Other than that, always a great stay and would highly recommend for a city break/ business trip / romantic weekend away. Ordered 2 double Hendricks & 2 double Tequila shots as room service and this cost just over £100 - not the cheapest of places but so worth it!",5,2022,07,22
111,Definitely not 5 star,"Went here years ago and had a brilliant time, I returned with my partner for our 2 year anniversary and it was just a huge disappointment. Things have definitely gone downhill with the hotel which is probably why they are advertising spa days on Wowcher. There was no welcome drink or offer to help us with our bags (which I had previously had the last time)

The hotel has the potential to be great but had a bit of a run down feel in certain areas. Our hotel room looked tatty and run down with marks on the carpet. Definitely looks like things need a bit of a renovation here or an upgrade. 

The clientele here is not what you’d expect . Whilst we were at the spa, there was a large group of 18-25 year olds who were clearly intoxicated and were screaming, belly flopping into the pool and splashing each other. Definitely not the relaxing experience I’d hoped for and the staff did nothing about it. 

The worst part was, we booked a spa day then was told we were only allowed a 30 minute slot for the pool. I understand due to covid that there are limitations but what is the point of paying for a spa day of that length. There were no robes in our rooms so we had to wait for someone to bring them up, they took almost an hour which meant that 20 minutes of our time was lost and we were only allowed 10 minutes in the pool. Another weird part was some people were wrapped in towels, or half naked in bikinis and would get in the lift.. Which would then stop on the floor of the bar. So you’d see people dressed to the nines in bandage dresses and heels to get into a bar with loud music playing (club type atmosphere) and then if someone pushed the button on that floor, the door would open up and everyone on the floor would stare at you like you’re an alien. 

Thankfully we managed to get a partial refund thanks to the manager who was very helpful but it didn’t do much to fix the rest of the issues. There are lots of decent spas in London for a similar price, so would definitely recommend going elsewhere. 

Positives - The restaurant was decent and provided a good breakfast in the morning, the waiter also offered us complimentary drinks at dinner to make up for the bad experience at the hotel.",1,2022,07,19
111,Amazing!!,"Me and my partner visited  at the weekend for our 1 year anniversary and had the most amazing experience. 
January from guest experience looked after us and never failed to let us down, she pulled out all the stops to ensure our anniverary was special.
She upgraded our room, included breakfast for us and the room was beautifully decorated with balloons, also a bottle of wine with macaroons :)
They also have a rooftop bar called the Aviary which gives you beautiful views of London, food is also great and they have spa facilities too.
This is also not our first time here, we visited early in the year and also the sister hotels too.
I would highly recommend staying here. 
You will certainly be looked after and I highly recommend speaking to January who will make your stay memorable.",5,2022,07,19

111,Amazing birthday visit,"I arrived to the hotel on my own with some balloons as it was a surprise birthday stay for my partner. I was met by a lovely lady called January who upgraded my room for my partners birthday. She showed me up to the room and asked if I could give her 15 minutes to decorate the room for the birthday. This was a lovely gesture. Once I met with my partner we went back to the hotel room that was decorated with more birthday balloons. Overall we had an amazing stay. The spa was delightful as well as the rooftop bar and I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. All the staff were super lovely, the room was beautiful and the bed was so comfy, we felt very relaxed the whole time.",5,2022,07,17

111,A fabulous 2 days of birthday celebrations.,"The Royal London Hotel Montcalm. 
What a lovely hotel and amazing staff. 
Greeted at the main door on our arrival, led to the reception by hotel staff and our luggage was attended to on arrival. 
We didn’t have to wait too long to check in and 4-5 staff available on the reception desk, we were met by one of the managers ‘January’ she introduced herself and showed us to our superior room. 
As it was my best friends 50th birthday, January had arranged for balloons and fresh macaroons to be added to the room! Nothing was to much trouble. 
Right from the reception staff to the managers every member of staff was approachable and friendly. 
We particularly loved the fresh juices in the reception area, it was a lovely touch and bonus when you have come in from the hot weather. 
The hotel is well located for the underground at Moorgate and bus networks. 
The room was very nice and all what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. January informed us of what we had in our room and how to use the electronic control panel for the air con, the lighting tea and coffee making facilities and the Elemis products in the bathroom. When we returned each evening our towels had been replenished and our beds had been turned down and mood lights switched on. The mattresses and pillows were very comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. 
The roof top terrace area is lovely and we enjoyed our first evening admiring the views from the roof top. 
We booked the spa on our last day, nice sized pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. The changing rooms and showers were very good. 
January met us on departure to check everything was ok with our stay, she made us feel like VIP’s. 
5/5 for our stay at the Montcalm at Finsbury Square. We enjoyed it that much we are in the process of booking for next year.",5,2022,07,15
111,Our wonderful stay at Montcalm,"Our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House was excellent. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, especially the bed! The housekeeping does the maximum to make our stay pleasant. The hotel’s front desk people are absolutely amazing. The two concierges were truly the BEST. They were there to help us is every possible way. Daniel Todorov, the head Concierge was outstanding, and so was Raul ( I hope I remember his name right), though he told us he was new. The hotel is extremely well situated. Room service is possible till late at night. Breakfast is available, but there is also a small cafe, where you can just grab a croissant and a coffee. Very convenient. A few minutes walk from the hotel, you have a Mark and Spencer where you can eat and buy a snack. Wonderful location, but more than anything, the welcome and service at this hotel are exceptional! I don’t have to research anymore to find a good place!",5,2022,07,15

111,A Royal Montcalm Experience: Amazing service distinguishes them from any other London hotel,"We have come to London or through London on transit numerous times.  This was our best London trip ever because of the concierge Daniel’s pre-trip communication handling our airport pickup & return, site seeing transportation, multiple dinner recommendations and dinner reservations he made on our behalf. 

Each day he would greet us in the morning and at night by name, check on our needs and plans. His kind, positive and infectious attitude is noticeable on his staff and all patrons. 

In conclusion, he made our stay amazing.

111,lovely hotel,"just stayed here for 2 nights for our first wedding anniversary. lovely hotel, staff very helpful...was greated by the lovely Mary who couldn't do enough for u,then Daniel who took our bags to our room and explained everything we needed to know and also the lovely man yordon who managed the aviary bar upstairs who made our stay more special.
the room had a lovely view looking out the front, but wasn't anything special. not massive room, bed was a double but would have expected a king. had an ipad to operate all the lights which we had to cover over at night as was too bright.
we found hairs on our towels too 🙈
I thing that annoyed us the most though was the 12.5% service charge at the bars EVERYTIME to ordered drinks!!!!!! and if your there 2 nights like us this adds up....even if u stand at the bar u still have to pay it...I would prefer to give my own tip. we did ask about this the second day...and was told managers would need to be called over to authorise to take it off and was made to feel guilty that the staff don't get tips as they are cashless.

but don't want to put the hotel down as location was great...walking distance from Liverpool St.
staff were so so helpful
food and drinks were lovely 
and the views from the aviary bar were incredible
we would love to go back....but I think they just need to make a few adjustments to keep their 5 star review",4,2022,07,10

Before our stay, the team advised us on transportation (during a train strike weekend) and booked us a black cab to pick us up ate the airport with a baby seat. Concierge, front desk and specially Mary were amazing, taking care of every single detail and by giving us hospitality at its best. The location is great, room are quite comfortable and they provided a baby cot which was perfect. After a long trip with the baby our room was ready earlier, and already organized for the baby. On our next trip to London we will definitely comeback to the Montcalm. ps. Make sure to have breakfast there, the restaurant/bar upstairs has an incredible view and ambiance.",5,2022,07,10

Unfortunately, I experienced a hiccup with my booking confirmation from a third-party website however, the front desk team particularly Camelia were exceptionally professional. 
They truly went above and beyond to accommodate me despite a shortage of rooms.

The Concierge there, Daniel Todorov, was the best Concierge we've ever experienced. He booked several different experiences for us and all of his recommendations were spot on and his service was amazing. Our stay would have still been good without Daniel's help, but because of his service he made our trip much more than just good, he made it unforgettable. I would highly recommend the Montcalm and Daniel!",5,2022,07,08

 From the moment we arrived, we were overwhelmed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff who went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one.  Daniel, Mary, and January should be recognized as nothing was too much trouble, from helping us with directions to booking us into fine dining restaurants.

Location is perfect because restaurants and shopping malls are easily accessible. Also celebrated my wife's birthday there on one occasion and the staff were very helpful with room decoration and made it a lovely experience.  Their roof top bar is  also a nice place to relax and have a drink in the night time. Beautiful and spacious rooms. I will definitely be staying there again on my next London visit! Thank you Camelia and all your colleagues for your amazing service.,5,2022,06,29
111,"Large comfortable rooms, great lounge team","Nice area, close to both Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations.  Enjoyed the large rooms with lovely picture windows but they are starting to look a little tired and aren’t quite as clean as we would expect. Lounge was a treat but only because of Swati and Victor who were excellent hosts, so a huge thank you to both of them.  Let’s see what breakfast brings!",5,2022,06,27

In particular January was amazing and I want to say 'Thank You' to her again, I can’t emphasize how special she made me feel as she knew my proposal was at the Aviary which is in this hotel. She allowed us to replicate the proposal photo with all my hens. This hotel was booked for my hen weekend with all my friends, they placed our rooms close to each other, upgraded the hen room, decorated the room and made every moment at the hotel feel unique and special. I cannot recommend the hotel enough. I will definitely be coming again and I am already looking forward to it.

111,A beautiful stay with a team that is a credit to the hotel!,"We booked a 3 night stay in the Montcalm, our first time as guests here, the hotel in itself stood out with the service we recieved from the moment we walked in. 

On arrival we were warmly greeted by Mary, who we can't thank enough for making our stay perfect! 
We were a little early for check in and was just going to drop our luggage off for the time being, however Mary found us a room that we could check into straight away. 

The rooms were beautiful and clean, very spacious with everything you need provided in there. 
We were accompanied to our room by one of the hotels team who ran through everything we needed to know about the room. 
Rooms were cleaned to brilliant standard each day too with turn downs of the bed in the evening. 

With a full packed schedule we didn't have time to use the hotel facilities, which next time we will definitely make time for as a morning in the spa sounds perfect followed by a evening at the rooftop bar.  
I have no doubt about it that they will match the standards of the hotel! 

On check out we were personally greeted again by Mary who made sure we had a perfect stay. 

Personally i need to remember to take names of the team we come into contact with, as they all deserve recognition! 
This team is a credit to the hotel! 

Thankyou to the Montcalm for a lovely stay & we are sure to be back staying here again soon!",5,2022,06,26

The room was extremely clean and came with multiple items which played to our benefit such as a shoe horn, makeup removal kit and a mini fridge.

111,Can’t fault it !!,"First time staying at this hotel and I will defiantly be back. I was bought a night stay from my partner as my surprise birthday gift and the minute we stepped in we felt so welcomed. Sara and Mary from reception and guest wellness department explained everything so well and really made our stay special. They surprised us with balloons and truffles in the room and they always put there customers first and could tell they where very professional and enjoyed there job and there own love for the Hotel.

111,Excellent service,"I’ve stayed here once before and decided to come back this weekend to celebrate my partner’s 30th. I contacted reception in advance to let them know we’re celebrating a birthday not really expecting much but I was instantly contacted by Mary in the guest experience team who went above and beyond to make it really special! Upon arrival, we were greeted by Mary at reception who was so welcoming and attentive. She showed us up to our room and had given us an upgrade to a large corner room which was a really lovely surprise!! The room was decorated with balloons, there was a personalised card wishing my partner happy birthday and box of chocolates.

The beds are unbelievably comfortable and the room has nice little touches such as mood lighting and underfloor heating in the bathroom. At night we spent some time at the rooftop bar which has nice views. We had room service for breakfast and I went to the spa which was a great end to our stay. 

The service at this hotel is what makes it so special. Every member of staff we spoke to was so friendly and attentive and we wouldn’t hesitate to return again. My partner had a fab birthday. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!!",5,2022,06,19
111,Wonderful weekend stay!,"My friend and I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House for two weekend nights to celebrate our birthdays with a quick London quick. The hotel staff were phenomenal - incredibly welcoming and helpful. Mary and January, in particular (I hope I have their names right!) worked to make our stay a fantastic experience, including a wonderful birthday welcome set up in our room upon arrival. We had the most comfortable sleep and had everything we could have asked for! Easy location to several tube stations (a few minutes' walk). I will stay here any and every time I come to London!!",5,2022,06,19
111,"Great service, end to end","The moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles. The front desk service was very friendly and professional. I made a few requests and they were very gracious about it. 

At breakfast, the staff is been very flexible and goes out of there way to bring me water, coffee, or whatever I may need. Specifically, Roxana has gone the extra mile for me. She’s very aware and even remembers how I like my coffee. The entire staff is friendly and has gone over the top. 

I will be staying here again.",5,2022,06,18
111,Great place to stay for a special treat,"Back from a day/night at the Montcalm. Fab hotel with outstanding staff, each and everyone of whom go out of their way to make you feel valued & special. Special mention to January who hastily arranged for our room to be decorated with balloons & left macaroons for my friend’s special birthday after not receiving a message I’d left for them on Booking.com. We were also invited by January for complimentary drinks/snacks from 5.30pm which was a fabulous special touch, which we enjoyed before our night out! Fab bar on the rooftop also.",5,2022,06,17
111,Amazing Central London Hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights for a business trip. It was less than 5 minute walk to our main office which was a plus. The rooms were spacious, clean and a bottle of water waiting for you. 

The hote offers a continental breakfast with a good selection of breakfast items and some great coffee. Best part of the day was the included happy hour. Soft drinks, wine and a light snack. This was a great way to wind down at the end of the day.  Victor, Ramona and Amy were all amazing hosts that made us felt like a member of the family.   They took excellent care of me and our colleagues. 

Daniel Todorov was spectacular the entire week assisting us with dinner reservations and answering all of our questions with patience and a smile. 

This is now my default choice every time I am called back to this beautiful city.",5,2022,06,16
111,Excellent customer service and spacious rooms,"The team at this Montcalm have really upped the anti on customer experience in the last 6months. 
The reception and guest experience teams are super helpful and go out of their way to ensure a comfortable guest stay. 

I stay fairly regularly and they do their best to give me a lovely spacious well appointed room. The added bonus chocolates are amazing!

Love grabbing a quick breakfast in the Aviary and the Burdock bar is great for a relaxed client lunch in a nice airy light bar.

One final pre-covid return I would like to see is a face flannel in the room as standard (they can be requested along with bath robes) - avoids getting make up on the lovely fluffy towels!",5,2022,06,16
111,If Casberg did hotels.,"I booked an overnight stay for my daughter and her boyfriend in London for her birthday , and the Montcalm could not do enough for her ...upgraded the room threw in a complimentary breakast plus wine and chocolates .

The room was big and spacious. We had booked into the spa but it was peak time and super busy so we didn’t stay long. We arrived back to the hotel at 2am after a night out very hungry and thirsty and the staff sent up snacks and water to our room. The club lounge access with drinks was an added bonus! 
We had a great stay and all of the staff went above and beyond to make it the best stay possible, thank you!",5,2022,06,15
111,"Great hotel, amazing customer service","I had planned to propose to my partner on a special London trip we had planned. After booking the Montecalm Royal London house for our stay I emailed them to see if they could help with making the occasion special. To my surprise I received a phone call from Mary the next day, who was very lovely and could help me plan. After some deliberation with how I would propose, I called back Mary who took care of everything, from booking the spa and roof top terrace for us and arranging for rose petals and a bottle of bubbly in the room so I could pop the question. I was very impressed with the second-to-none customer service they offered, ontop of that our room was lovely and modern, looking out over london sky line. The spa was heaven to relax in and they did a banging breakfast buffet the following morning. I highly recommend. Oh and she said YES!",5,2022,06,13

Lovely roof top restaurant and bar and breakfast was also lovely. 
We also used the spa which was nice & clean. We felt nice & relaxed after using.

111,Fantastic as always,I stay at the Montcalm Royal London House about once a month when I travel to London for business. January and her team can't seem to do enough for their guests. The service is always amazing and the the hotel is always clean and comfortable with modern amenities. The spa and rooftop are phenomenal.,5,2022,06,12

111,A wonderful stay,"We stayed for 7 nights.  The hotel is beautiful and was very clean, modern, well appointed and everyone was extremely nice and helpful.  It is also in a great location with both Liverpool street station and Moorgate Station a short walk away.    Highly recommended.",5,2022,06,11
111,OUTSTANDING.,"What an outstanding hotel. We were lucky enough to stay in a junior suite and the room was superb. The bed was one of those that does not make wish for your own…now that is high praise indeed! The staff could not have been more helpful. The Aviary. WOW. what a beautiful roof top terrace, what a wonderful view. How the London sky line changes. The hotel is obviously well managed and the attention to detail is evident. From the toiletries in the wonderful bathroom to the all round cleanliness of the hotel. The attentiveness of the staff and welcome from the doorman. It always starts front house. Wonderful. The breakfast menu was large from cereals to a full English and everything in between. It was also superb. The coffee was superb also. To be honest my wife and I wanted to stay another night or 5 😊 We only had the one night but will gladly return. Thank you for a great and memorable stay.",5,2022,06,11
111,Wonderful stay ,We stayed for a couple of days midweek and can’t rate it highly enough. The bed was so comfortable the room was lovely and had all the amenities we could need. The Aviary on the roof is a lovely garden and the spa was so relaxing. Breakfast had a good choice and tasted lovely.,5,2022,06,10
111,My experience seems at odds with reviews!,"I can only speak as I found and my stay at the Montcalm Royal London was not five-star experience at all. Five-star hotels conjure up a sense of luxury and the price reflects this. I don’t like to complain but when I pay for five-star, I think I should get it. I do not expect the catalogue of issues I had on my stay. Broken amenity box lid, deep scratches in the wardrobe doors, soap scum in the shower corners grout and door frame, broken door stop in the bathroom hanging off the floor, thick dust layer on the door frames. As we were only staying overnight and spending time in London, we never experienced anything other than the check in, the room and check out. Camelia was the duty manager and when I showed her the pictures of our room, she was very apologetic and offered a partial good will refund. She was so confident that this was a one-off experience she offered another nights stay, for my birthday, at a reduced price and a complementary upgrade to a junior suite plus breakfast. We exchanged emails and she confirmed all she said in an email including the price for the new stay 6 months on. Sadly she would not honour this when I finalised the booking. I will not consider any Montcalm or Shaftesbury Group hotel again.",1,2022,06,09
111,"Fantastic Hotel, Staff and Facilities",Stayed for one night with my wife for our honeymoon. The manager January and her team greeted us when we arrived and made sure we were taken care of. Room was clean; bed was comfy and food was great. Couldn't ask for anything more - would recommend.,5,2022,06,08
111,Excellent!,January and her team were so welcoming from the minute we entered the hotel! They genuinely wanted us to have an exceptional experience. The hotel facilities and our room were amazing. So close to the centre of London also. Thanks so much for making our weekend very special.,5,2022,06,06
111,Our experience was  lovely from the pool area to our treatment and the beautiful caption we took at the roof top bar marking our,Everything but the breakfast was great I feel the breakfast could of had more options perhaps more fresh fruit and cereal varieties and self serve hot drinks machine. The customer service I recieved throughout our stay was of gratitude and care standards thank you soo much for that. ,4,2022,06,05
111,Amazing hotel!,"I couldn't recommend this hotel more, on arrival we were greeted and escorted to our room personally and there were complementary snacks and drinks in our room as the staff were aware it was my birthday, the experience overall was so lovely and it was the most memorable stay in a hotel due to the amazing staff and lovely facilities!!",5,2022,06,05
111,Forget the Royal Family we were treated like royalty!,This has been such nice stay. The staff were so attentive polite and pleasant  the room had everything you need breakfast was fantastic weather cooked or cold cuts and cheese or cereal. The bar is relaxed and not overly lit. For such a busy weekend tge quality of service did not appear to be affected. Loved it!,5,2022,06,05
111,Mary and January,Our stay was a positive and memorable experience thanks to both Mary and January. They went above and beyond to cater for my new born by letting us check in early. Their smiles and positive attitude made us feel valued. They are a credit to the business and great representatives of your brand. I will recommend this hotel based on these two ladies.,5,2022,06,05
111,Mr,Miriam has been the biggest help with out stay and enjoyed every minute of it by far one of the best hotels we have stayed in and will be coming back. The rooftop bar stood out to me and the view was stunning,5,2022,06,05
111,Fabulous hotel,"Myself and my daughter stayed here for one night as a treat after she did so well with her masters degree. I had called before to let them know it was a special occasion. When we checked in we were welcomed by January, a lovely lady who couldn’t do enough for us. She personally showed us to our room. She’s upgraded us to a beautiful suite. They had congratulations balloons on the bed. Was all so beautiful. We had an hour in the spa which was lovely and clean. We visited The Avery rooftop bar which had fabulous views of London. All staff were professional and warm. We had a lovely relaxing stay. Thank you for making it so special. Paula & Rosie",5,2022,06,05
111,Best hotel in London!,"The hotel staff were so lovely. Especially the hotel manager, January. The manager greeted us as soon as we were at the check-in and showed us to our room. They decorated the room with balloons and rose petals since it was for a special occasion! They didn’t have to do all this but they did it anyway. 

The spa facilities are excellent and I’ve never gone to any other spa as soon as I found out about this one. It has a swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room as well as changing rooms and showers. They also have free shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the changing room showers so you don’t need to bring any! 

We stayed for 4 days and whatever we needed was brought to us by the staff. When we were checking out, a staff member called Sarah approached us and asked how the stay went and if there’s anything that we needed. She even offered to hold our bags for the day if we were still going to be out and about which is so useful. I would recommend this hotel 100%, it’s the best one in London and is close to so many bus stops and train stations. There’s a bus stop right outside the hotel and the nearest train station is a 5 minute walk. Thank you guys for the pleasant experience, I will definitely come again.",5,2022,06,04
111,Good place to stay,"Really easy to get to from Liverpool Street Station, with a safe walk to it. The staff where exceptional, friendly, informative and helpful. The room was immaculately clean with a modern vibe. Great bar on the roof which has good views. Used the pool and facilities, good idea about booking it as it’s small and would get crowded if they didn’t. My only grumble two single beds pushed together which dipped badly in the middle, I would have expected a better bed experience! Otherwise really good hotel to stay in I will definitely go back, as I said staff where superb.",4,2022,06,04
111,A starlit night,"My partner & I stayed @ Montcalm for our anniversary. After initially booking the room with Booking.com, I called the hotel to make some special requests. This was when I had my first encounter with Francesca, the star of Montcalm. She arranged for the room to be reflective of the celebrations we were having - she booked us in for a spectacular breakfast & treated us like complete royalty. What a fantastic example of a great human being. 

The room itself (upgraded) was warm, cosy & romantically arranged. The spa was luxurious & although advertised as 30mins - we were never once told to leave (we arrived on a Friday so we expected it to be busy). It’s deposited in a well accessible area at whatever time of day. The breakfast in the morning was luxurious with an impeccable view of London. 

We will most definitely be staying at Montcalm again. If not for the room, for the wonderful treatment we had from our new friend Francesca. I wish her all of the best in her future endeavours - a true dime at Montcalm. Thank you once again for being apart of our beautiful memories.

111,Amazing Experience - thank you to January,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House with my boyfriend in April 2022. We booked a 1 night spa stay through Wowcher which included late check out, breakfast spa access. I would honestly say this is the best hotel I’ve stayed in in London.

I phoned ahead and spoke to Mary to let them know it was for our anniversary. When we arrived we were met by Guest Experience Manager January who told us they had upgraded us to a suite and took us personally to our room where there was a dessert on the table and rose petals scattered on the bed. January was so so so welcoming and lovely and even asked us to wait when we checked out so she could personally check on us and ask how our stay was. She even followed up with an email to wish us well. Nothing in the hotel was too much trouble, every staff member was so attentive and they went above and beyond. We ordered the vegetarian breakfast to our room which was so tasty.

We were told the Aviary rooftop bar was closed for renovations however January said we could use the club lounge and when we went in the evening we could order snacks and alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks from the waiter for no extra charge and was such a nice place to sit and relax before went out for dinner. If I came back again and booked a room I would definitely choose a club room as the club lounge was a nice touch. We also used the spa which was included for us which was nice, had a beautiful swimming pool and small sauna and steam room. You get a half an hour slot on each day you stay, so we went twice. We pre-booked this beforehand by phoning the spa direct after we’d booked. Honestly couldn’t recommend this hotel enough. So close to everything, the city, Shoreditch etc. if you’re travelling however for us we barely left the hotel as it had everything within it! Can’t wait to stay again and visit Aviary rooftop restaraunt / bar.

Thank you so much January and team!",5,2022,06,01
111,4*** would go again!,"We stayed here for my girlfriends graduation which was at the Barbican Center. 

The hotel is clean and crisp all across the board from check-in to the bedrooms.

Some of the technology in the room is very new with led lights and heated flooring in the shower which were nice touches.

Staff are very welcoming and happy to go the extra mile and the swimming pool is just top tier.

Would highly recommend.",4,2022,05,30
111,Wonderful time - Thank You!,"We were truly looked after by January and her team, this was the perfect place and location for a night away celebrating my wife's 40th Birthday. From my initial booking and requests to check-out, there was nothing I could fault and for this I'm very grateful. Roof-top Bar was a perfect setting for Saturday afternoon drinks, followed by drinks in the lounge pre dinner.  
I look forward to returning again some time soon after our memorable stay at RLH.

111,The most extraordinary hotel with the most excellent service London has to offer! 10/10,"It was my 4th time staying at the Montcalm Royal London House, and what a special place it is. 

The entire Montcalm team were so lovely and welcoming.
Every staff member was very nice and helpful. The hospitality of the staff was incredibly warm and you could feel their sincerity.
The location was great, easy walking distance to restaurants, bars and the underground.

I can't say enough good things about The Montcalm Royal London House. The vibe is always smiles and how they can help your experience. 
The room was spacious, super clean, very comfortable, and we were assigned on the 7th floor and had a wonderful view. 
The breakfast had EVERYTHING you needed. The rooftop bar was super amazing.

If you want to experience the best hotel and staff London has to offer, this is the place to go to.

Special thanks to duty manager Camelia Rujan, Mary, Peter and Daniel. You all were super amazing and fabulous. Thank you again and see you very soon!!",5,2022,05,24
111,Best 24th birthday treat!,"January, Sarah and their team were brilliant and left me feeling extremely happy and well looked after during my visit from start to end! I arrived early to find my room had been thoughtfully decorated by January’s team and the help I received throughout was phenomenal. The spa is absolutely top tier and I spent a relaxing afternoon getting a massage and going for a swim. The staff at the spa, the reception and at the restaurants were attentive and helpful. I wouldn’t doubt for a second to recommend this hotel to anyone else! The amenities and above all the staff are absolutely excellent. Thank you January, Sarah and everyone else at the Montcalm RLH for making my 24th an unforgettable birthday.",5,2022,05,24

I will surely recommend this hotel",5,2022,05,23
111,Lovely hotel with amazing staff,I came here for a night for my anniversary with my partner. The hotel was really attentive and the staff were lovely especially Sara who looked after us and sent us a bottle of wine as a gift :) would recommend! Location is fab too,5,2022,05,22

Lots of good vegetarian options at restaurant. Location is close to great public transit options. Staff were all very nice. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,05,21
111,Excellent Customer Service,"We stayed for 1 night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. When checking in we were immediately upgraded to a suite. The room was lovely and spacious with a kitchen and sitting area. A bottle of wine was sent up to the room for us to celebrate.
The staff were all so friendly and efficient. Special thanks to Mary who arranged the upgrade and wine and also met us at check out to ensure we had a nice stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to visiting next time we are in London.",5,2022,05,20
111,Respite in the City,Accommodations and services are 5 star.  Staff treats their guests as if they’ve been waiting for them to arrive.  VERY attentive and VERY professional.  Doorman Sergei went out of his way to arrange transportation on a very busy night in London.  We stay at Montcalm Finsbury every time we come to London (twice a year).  We only travel 5star.  Would not stay anywhere else.,5,2022,05,20
111,Business Trip to London,"Wonderful hotel and staff.  I visited each of the restaurants at the hotel and all were excellent. Roof top bar one of the best in the area. Morning breakfast was a pleasure. 

Checkin /checkout was swift. The front desk helped me locate a covid test provider minutes away.  Convenient location close to tube stations as well. I will select The Montcalm for my next trip to London.",5,2022,05,20
111,Excellent Customer Service,"We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House a fortnight ago for a birthday celebration. I had communicated with Camelia - the duty manager beforehand so that everthing was arranged and set up for my daughters arrival. Camelia assured me that everything would be fine.  We checked in with a lovely lady by the name of January who very friendly and welcoming. January took us up to the suite which was absolutely beautifully decked out with balloons, chocolates and prosecco. The suite was huge which was kindly upgraded.  This was way beyond our expectation and we are very grateful for all the efforts of the staff. I must mention the only gripe to the experience was the Spa staff. The spa receptionist insisted that we could only visit the spa for 30 mins although Camelia had booked us in for 1 hour.  Its a shame the spa staff feel they have to manage the spa in such a way even at the time it was not busy. I realise that the spa is run by a company called Beauty and Melody that has nothing to do with the hotel management. I hope that people realise this and it does not bring down the hard work that the hotel staff put in to make the  guests have a wonderful experience. A huge thank you to all the hotel staff for making my daughters birthday special. Thank you Camelia and we will of course be back. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,19
111,Anniversary,"We went for our anniversary and the treatment was nothing short of amazing. We were looked after by a lady named January Stevens who pulled out all the stops & we will surely be returning! highly recommend.

111,"Gorgeous stay, I absolutely loved it.","I originally booked for one night but ended up extending it for another because it’s so lovely there. The staff could not have done more to help and I can’t recommend it enough. When I checked in they moved me to a bigger and quieter room when I explained I was autistic, then repeatedly checked in to make sure I was enjoying my stay. The food and drinks were lovely, the views from the roof are just amazing and the beds are so comfortable. I slept really well. The spa is also really nice and though the sauna was out of order, the steam room, pool and jacuzzi were lovely and they provided me with complimentary breakfast to make up for the lack of sauna. Francesca, January, Sarah and Comelia were so kind, fun and helpful. Cannot wait to come back, thanks for making it a really special weekend ❤️",5,2022,05,15
111,Stay in hotel,"Hello, I am writing this review in support of the hotel staff, and in particular the reception staff. Since my business trip took place in London, I stayed for a few days at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and welcoming, which is very pleasing.

111,Best hotel stay ever!,"I do quite a lot of staycation so I’ve been to quite a few hotels around London. This is by far one of the best and most luxurious. The customer service is exceptional, they went all out even when I mixed up my spa booking. 
Mary was absolutely helpful and they helped my husband to have a special amazing birthday by decorating the room and also leaving a lovely note.

We also got free drinks and they catered to our every need. I can’t wait to go back there, truly amazing experience!",5,2022,05,14
111,What a Fabulous Experience!,"Everything is wonderful at the Montcalm - it's such a joy to stay there.  My partner and I are regular guests and we couldn't feel more welcome anywhere!  The staff are so very friendly and helpful, they always welcome us like long lost friends.
The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, spacious and spotlessly clean.  The Restaurant is spectacular and the food is always delicious, with a menu that is creative and delightful. Our favourite place to stay without a doubt!",5,2022,05,11
111,Great Last Minute Stay,"We booked this with four hours' notice for our anniversary, and we had a lovely stay. We were checked in by Miriam who was friendly and chatty, when she asked us about our stay she upgraded our room for our celebration which was a nice surprise.

The hotel has a good central location, with short walks to Old Street/Bishopsgate and lots of public transport options on your doorstep. Finsbury Square is nice to look out on too.

The room itself was clean and well decorated, the bed was super comfy and the bathroom was spotless and well designed. I slept like a baby and woke up feeling refreshed. The room had a touch-screen light control on the wall which was cool, and the side lights and the mood lighting was controlled by buttons on either side of the bed, a nice touch!

The staff around the hotel are pleasant and always say good morning with a smile.

I would recommended staying here if you are in the area.",5,2022,05,10
111,5 stars⭐️,"Myself and 3 friends stayed in the Montcalm for my birthday, the staff were so attentive and friendly and went to lots of effort to make our stay pleasurable.

111,"Great Experience, thoroughly pleasant stay! Cannot wait to be back!","Just spent the last week at this hotel, I am a regular visitor here but I must say, this trip was the best so far. The service was incredible, all the staff were happy, smiling, so pleasant and really went over and above. We got a complimentary room upgrade with breakfast and our interactions with all the staff was really nice. The room was huge, with al the amenities you could ever need, Elemis toiletries, coffee machine and a bathtub! 
The breakfast at the Aviary was a real delight, stunning view, a varied breakfast choice and the best service! The staff were so welcoming, polite and generally made us feel so welcome everyday! We were so impressed.

A special thanks to Camelia for making the stay as smooth as it could be, as well as all the concierge staff for always smiling and being so friendly, Mladen, Francisco, Daniel and Delawar.

111,Lovely Stay,"We booked a stay at The Montcalm Hotel for one night in April. Every staff member, from the valet to the check in staff were delightful and eager to help. Our guest experience manager, January showed us to our room and made sure we knew how to operate the lights, under floor heating and aircon from the very impressive touch/smart screen on the hotel bedroom wall. 

There were facilities available to us in our room to make tea, coffee as well as an espresso machine with coffee pods, and a bar fridge. 

The room was immaculate and spacious. The bed was large and comfortable which provided us both with a restful night's sleep. The breakfast was out of this world with more than enough choices for any pallet. Even though we had checked out the next day, the hotel staff were kind enough to offer to keep our bags while we discovered a little bit of London without having to carry heavy bags around. We returned to collect our luggage and it was kept safe the entire time. 

This hotel was a lovely experience and we will definitely return for another stay. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to travel into London an experience a 5 Star stay. 

Thanks again to January and the staff at Montcalm London.",5,2022,05,08
111,Incredible stay,"We booked the Montcalm for one night.  Location incredible. Staff friendly and efficient.  The rooms were ideal, very comfortable bed and a powerful shower.  Heavy blackout curtains got a great nights sleep.

Used the spa which was spotless and well organised.

Highly recommend this hotel, next time we will bring the children!",5,2022,05,08
111,Amazing stay 10/10,"Absolutely wonderful staff, especially Mahmodul!!

111,"Lovely facilities, room and staff!","I stayed here on Thursday night with my friend and the following night with my husband, having got married on the Friday. 
I had requested a room with a full length mirror so I could do my make up and get ready for the wedding. The hotel not only responded by doing this, they also upgraded my room, gave me complementary breakfast and Prosecco. 
The facilities were brilliant and the staff were wonderful. 
I met January as we were leaving and she was warm, helpful and friendly.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to others.",5,2022,05,07

Would definitely recommend and will 100% be back!!,5,2022,05,04
111,Lovely Hotel!,"We had a great time staying in the Montcalm royal. 
Our room was on the fifth floor. The room was spacious and quiet. 
Room service was very good and the order process was very smooth and considering. We’re Vegan and there were vegan options. 

We had a very good experience with the staff, everyone was nice and welcoming. Didn’t feel fake like you feel sometimes in hotels. 

The only let down we had was the breakfast, First, we weren’t aware that our deal/price was including breakfast, no one mentioned it when we arrived. We found out only on the last morning. Secondly we were very surprised to see there wasn’t any vegan options. Not even a soy yogurt. Al we could have was cornflakes with out milk or bread and jam, or fruits. In my opinion it is a very poor breakfast, they could add tofu pieces, vegan cheese, soy yogurt, vegan butter. Just the basic. Just some plant base protein for breakfast. 

But overall it was a good experience and i would consider coming back :) ",4,2022,05,04
111,Wonderful Two Night Stay,"I chose the Montcalm Royal Hotel for a 2 night stay to celebrate my partner's 30th Birthday. I received absolutely wonderful and attentive service from January who ensured we had everything booked for our stay and ensured things were done to make it extra special. Thank you so much for this January, we both really appreciated your time and effort. 

The room was gorgeous and we so appreciated the decorations that were left. The spa was lovely and relaxing and was never too busy which we really appreciated. Breakfast was buffet style so great if this is something that you enjoy. One lady at breakfast was particularly helpful and welcoming. 

This is definitely a hotel I would recommend and somewhere I would happily stay again.",5,2022,05,03
111,Beautiful hotel with Amazing staff and great connectivity.,Spent 2 nights on a vacation at Montcalm Royal London House and stay was absolutely incredible as always.

111,Lovely Stay,"From the beginning of the stay right until the end.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Valentina checked us in and Mary checked us out.  The room was decorated for our anniversary, not tacky at all, everything as requested.  Will definitely be booking another stay as the 1 night was not enough.  The spa was lovely, only wished we could have a little more than half an hour.  Breakfast had a lot of variety and helpful as always....would highly recommend.",5,2022,05,03
111,By far the best hotel we’ve stayed in!,"As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were made to feel so welcome! All staff were so polite and helpful, they couldn’t do enough for us, and kindly upgraded our room as we were there celebrating my boyfriend’s birthday! 

The rooms are so spacious and they even decorated the room for us with a little birthday treat and balloons 😊 

They can provide you robes and slippers and offer you 30 mins for the spa for free which is more than enough time to relax by the pool. Breakfast we had at The Aviary which is at the hotel and it was so delicious! Worth every penny so we recommend to eat there if you can, they do continental  and cooked breakfasts so something for everyone.

Location wise we found it was spot on as we were able to get to the part of London we needed. It’s not to far from the tube either, maybe about a 7 min walk. 

We had such a wonderful time staying at this hotel and if we had some spare cash we would have booked another night then and there! 

If you can please go stay at this hotel because you will thoroughly enjoy it!",5,2022,05,02
111,Justice For Grenfell Victims. Hold Arconic Pittsburgh responsible.,"From the start to end I had the most incredible stay at Montcalm. The staff and service felt like I was visiting old friends greeting me with sincere warmth everyday.  I will actually miss Sara, Peter and Aleksandra whom are reasons enough for me to stay on future visits. To stay at a wonderful hotel like it catering to most of my needs made one of the best experience I have had in a long time. I loved Montcalm and looking forward to returning there in the near future.",5,2022,05,02
111,Amazing stay,"First of all this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at, it definitely feels like a luxury 5 star experience. I booked this trip for my partners birthday so I emailed ahead of arrival. January assisted me with all my queries and was so helpful. When we arrived our room was upgraded and we were shown to our room which was a lovely personal touch. January also kindly allowed us to check out one hour later than check out time, which was really appreciated. Mary checked us in and was very friendly and attentive, I cannot fault the team at all. They were so happy to help and made us feel so welcome, they go above and beyond! The room had been decorated with balloons and there was a hand written card wishing my partner a happy birthday. The hotel itself and room was very clean and well managed. We also went to the aviary in the evening which was amazing, definitely recommend! We also went to the pool and spa, it was fantastic, so clean and was a perfect end to a very relaxing stay. I would definitely love to come back soon! Thank you so much January, Mary and team :)",5,2022,05,02
111,Brilliant,"Absolutely fantastic stay from start to finish, we were incredibly well looked after by Mary the guest experience executive from our arrival up until check out. She went above and beyond for my partners birthday which really made the stay personal and very special so Thankyou Mary! We will absolutely be booking again, extremely comfortable, great room and again Mary was exceptional!",5,2022,04,30
111,Perfect stay,"Couldn’t have been more accommodating, some of the best service. Came for graduation and Mary at reception was extremely personable and gave us a free bottle of wine sent to our room. 
Kaloyan also at reception was friendly and informative.",5,2022,04,30
111,Not impressed,"we were ‘upgraded’ to a different room which I was thrilled about. However upon entering the room it was essentially a huge room but with very little furniture, it didn’t exactly feel Luxurious. The sofa bed was broken with one arm hanging off, the bed had a badly fitting mattress topper which didn’t reach the top of The bed and a dip in the middle of the bed which was not comfy. The wall panel also seemed to be broken which left us trying to sleep despite a blue glow all night.",1,2022,04,29
111,Never experienced anything quite like it - awful experience,"Stayed here for two nights with business mid week. Room was not cleaned throughout the duration of the stay. They forgot, which is kind of 101 in the hotel hospitality industry, so somewhat amazes me. Customer service is non existent. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone nor would I rate it above a 1 star hotel.",1,2022,04,26
111,Absolutely fantastic stay.,"I took my partner to London for a few days to propose  and stayed in the Montcalm which was amazing. The Hotel meets its 5 star standard at every stage from unloading the luggage when we arrived, to loading up the luggage when we left. 

From the start the staff were friendly and made us feel extremely special with no request being to big, I informed January who is the customer experience manager that I was planning to propose to my partner and she took care of everything like our very own fairy godmother. 

We had a lovely modern and clean room with a view of the shard. The room had a large tele with modern tech and great extras. I forgot to order breakfast when I booked the hotel which January spotted without me mentioning and made sure it was covered in our stay which shows the attention to detail the staff take and the detail of care and attention they take to make the stays the best as possible. 

We didn’t get chance to try the spa facilities as I booked to many activities for us to try which we still didn’t manage  being London and unfortunately the aviary bar was being refurbished over the time of our stay but we intend to try one day when we can return. 

Overall a fantastic experience which made our stay super special and made the engagement that extra bit special. Thank you again for all you done.",5,2022,04,26
111,Excellent stay in lovely hotel,"The hotel was very welcoming and the accommodation was clean, tidy and had great facilities. The whole hotel decoration is very nice. 
We visited the Spa whilst there which was nice and relaxing. 
Breakfast was also of a good standard.
Slightly disappointed the roof top bar was closed but would like to go back to visit that",5,2022,04,26
111,Very Very Good Hotel,"Hotel is very clean and well equipped. Clean property and location area is good with train station very close, Hotel staff were very kind flexible and helpful that made our stay more special. Guest Relation Executive Mary was very professional and friendly. Ales , Miriam and Pamela also  looked after us very well.  Room size was quite big to accommodate 3 people and sofa bed was very comfortable. We had club lounge access as well for particular hours which was added advantage to our stay  and made our stay more special and we did not need to go out as lounge had all the drinks and snacks facility . I will definitely  going back again and highly recommend to others.",5,2022,04,26
111,"Fantastic hotel, great staff, would stay again!","I stayed here for my birthday at the beginning of the month, and the staff made sure that we had a great stay, we had such a nice time! We'd definitely stay here again in the future and look forward to coming back!!",5,2022,04,25
111,Amazing stay!,"We loved our visit here from the minute we walked through the doors, everyone was very welcoming and genuinely friendly. Daniel from head concerige showed us to our room and demonstrated how everything worked etc. Daniels customer service skills are fabulous and he is a credit to the hotel. We were very impressed with the facilities in the room, also the room itself was spotless! We enjoyed amazing cocktails in the hotel bar made by Tommy and got to meet the lovely Carl who was fantastic!! We have been to London many times and have never returned to any hotel, this time though, we will definitley make sure, we return to the Montcalm. Would highly recommend!",5,2022,04,25
111,Staff,"The staff is an asset for this hotel, very well trained and professional, especially Kaloyan, who helped me with confusing breakfast pricing and locations. I would stay again and would recommend to others, it was a good choice, as it was only 10 min walk to Barbican Center, where we had my daughter’s graduation ceremony.",5,2022,04,24
111,Good Hotel,"Booked a spa deal with this hotel through WOWCHER, check in was easy as well as Hamid at concierge was very attentive and explained everthing in the room as well as letting us know if we needed any extras for anything, just to ask, he was very helpful.  Ngandi from Burdock/Aviary resturant at Breakfast time was very sweet and helpful and was very attentive and had a little chat with her each morning, which was nice. Very good service at this hotel, with paying attention to detail.  If they did another deal again with WOWCHER, but a massage included will be back to this hotel. Overall a good stay, it was a shame the Aviary was having a refurb as there is a rooftop and would of loved to dine at the resturant. Please pass on our thanks to Hamid/Ngandi for all their help.",4,2022,04,23
111,Best hotel quality,"Stayed in many london hotels but Montcalm will be one of the top stays, the guest services are top notch. Check in was smooth and quick, Francesca was very helpful and welcoming and went above and beyond for customer service- reception staff all had smiles on, this makes a huge difference especially in a busy city like london. 
The room was generous in space, clean, the view was amazing. The bed quality was excellent, sheets were soft and silky. Right amount of bed bounce and pillow thickness. The room temperature was easy to adjust, additionally,  the TV service was also very varied and easy to function.
The spa facilities were also very good, booking was straight forward. 

Montcalm is one of the best quality hotel in London based on my previous stays.

111,Very Smart Hotel,Very smart and clean hotel . Did a Friday night stay and spent the evening drinking champagne at the roof top bar . It is being remodeled  but looked pretty good as it was to me. Plenty of people around to carry your bags to your room or ask questions of. Most were exotic Europeans  that were well dressed. Its a great location for some sight seeing in the city. Would stay again in a heart beat .,5,2022,04,22
111,Birthday/spa stay,"I stayed at The Montcalm royal london house for my boyfriends birthday and the service couldn’t of been any better, the staff are so helpful and the service is faultless. I was helped by memebers of staff to decorate the room with balloons and lights who were amazing. The room was very clean with a view. The spa and massages were also amazing. I will definitely be returning soon.",5,2022,04,21
111,Affordable Luxury,"I was welcomed by Kaloyan and Maria at about 22:15. At such an hour service comes in handy. And I got loads of it. Very welcoming and warm and an upgrade no less. The rooms can use a touch up, but the rest makes up for it. Location (if you're here for business) is very strategic. The square in front of the hotel, even though it's a gathering place for local double-deckers, is fairly quiet. I would visit again.",5,2022,04,21
111,Excellent 1 night spa stay,"What a beautiful surprise. My daughter and l really enjoyed our 1 night spa break with club access, free Prosecco and snacks. Shout out to Mary at reception anD Daniel for really looking after us, explaining how to make the most of our stay, what the hotel has to offer guest and their attention to detail. Will definitely be back. Hotel near restaurants and Moorgate station. What a delight!",5,2022,04,20
111,"Another amazing stay, so good we extended for an extra day","Walked back into reception for the first time infix months and immediately recognised and welcomed by the front of house reception team and concierges.

Checking was effortless taking less than a minute and we were taken to our room by Hameed from the concierge team.  On entering the room, the sofa bed had been made up for our 10 year old and everything was perfect!  On closer inspection we found a little welcome gift on the table which was very welcome after a long train journey.

All of the staff without exception had smiles on their faces and made us feel completely welcomed.

If you need anything here speak to Daniel and the concierge team.  Taxi's within minutes, Restaurant recommendations and booking, they make everything happen.

The members area for Montcalm club members is a little oasis of calm where you can kick back and have pre meal drinks and nibbles.

Breakfast was rather fabulous.  If like me you are a veggie, just ask and alternatives will be provided.

I feel I should be writing more but it really was a perfect family weekend and we can't wait to go back.",5,2022,04,20
111,Five Stars!,"Always a pleasure to visit this hotel. Could not be happier with the room, pool and the absolute cherry on was the customer service I received. Especially from Kaloyan and Maria at reception and Ricardo from Room Service.",5,2022,04,19
111,Weekend away,"Top class in all aspects..staff incredibly friendly and the concierge team, led by Daniel, could not have been any better. Area was quiet and it felt you were not even in a city at all.No problem coming back",5,2022,04,19
111,Great Hotel,"My son and I visited the hotel for two nights on a sightseeing trip. It was ideally placed for walking to many of the things we wished to see and visit with the Barbican Centre a 5minute walk away and the nearest underground station even nearer. The hotel itself has great facilities and clean rooms with very helpful and courteous staff. Whenever I revisit London, I will consider this hotel before any other. Highly recommend it.",5,2022,04,19
111,"Excellent location, reat staff","We stayed here for a long weekend break in London. The location is perfect and, being set back from the road, the hotel is also very quiet considering its central location.
The staff were all very welcoming and chatty. The hotel had a big breakfast spread and also a spa.
Nice big spacious rooms and large bathrooms too. We'll definitely be returning!",5,2022,04,19
111,Great value,"Better second experience. Not in the best place for wandering around the city but nice rooms , close to underground stations, great staff and good wellness area.
Breakfast however was terrible, this was probably due to temporarily closure of the aviary but just basic buffet with little choice and finished bread, jam etc  not refilled served in a basement-like setting. We went out to have breakfast elsewhere which should not be considered when staying at a five star hotel.
Overall high standard service with the best value for your money.",4,2022,04,18
111,Simone the energy queen,"Couldn't be more than satisfied with the incredible service the hotel provided. Simone couldn't be a happier manager very helpful and full of fun and love energy is so amazing, wonderful person and the entire team. Can't wait to to visit again, with the wife and kids. 
Hotel facilities very the best, spa and room very impressed.",5,2022,04,18

111,Great hotel,"My partner and I had a wonderful experience at Montcalm Royal London House. Every staff member we encountered, from the front desk to the lounge staff to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help! The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing. Mary went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable as it was my birthday weekend; she was off on the day we checked in but we still felt warmly welcomed and taken cared off by January. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone in London. Thank you!",5,2022,04,17
111,Eastern trip,Great hotel for a trip with friends. A lot of restaurants near here and a good place to go out. If you need anything the amazing hotel team is delivering to you. Especially Mahmodul is the best wingman ever.,5,2022,04,16
111,Best Hotel in Town,This is for sure the best hotel you can get. I really appreciate the outstanding service of Mahmodul and his team. Thank you very much for your awesome work. This will definitively my first choice whenever I come back to London.,5,2022,04,16
111,Amazing stay,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for one night, check in was quick and easy, the reception staff and concierge were very professional and friendly. After a great night out we come back to the most comfortable bed! You have the options of mood lighting and climate control in the room, great facilities included. 
We didn't use the spa facilities so unable to review this.
I really didn't want to leave and wish we had another night stay. I'd definitely come back again and recommend this hotel.",5,2022,04,16
111,Not Five Stars,"The Montcalm claims to be a 5 star hotel, and from the outside at least you may think the same. But after having stayed recently for 2 nights with the family, I would strongly disagree.

Let’s get the positives done first, it wasn’t all bad. Some of the colleagues we interacted with over our stay were super helpful, the room was done out very well, and the pool and steam facilities were also very good.

But that doesn’t offset against the many negatives that we chalked up over our stay. Probably the biggest gripe was that we’d partly booked this hotel as it had a roof top terrace and restaurant which looked awesome on the website. However, when we arrived at the hotel, we noticed a sign in the lift telling us this was closed for refurbishment. When I expressed our disappointment to the young lady behind reception, she just told us what we already knew, no apology. This could, and should have been flagged when booking. We then found our room and let ourselves in, only to find the cleaning staff still hard at work in the room. Finally after nearly 20 minutes I then had to go down to reception to find out where our bags were. They were still in the luggage office. We would have been happy to carry them ourselves. 

Another big disappointment was the bar. This closed at 11 with last orders at 10.30. TEN THIRTY! This is a hotel in central London. In our younger days we’d have left to find a bar, but having our children with us for our family weekend break this was not an option. And getting back from a show with our girls just after 10.30 gave us little option.

Overall our experience most definitely didn’t live up to the promise of the beautifully shot images and well crafted copy on the website. Not sure we’ll be checking into a MontCalm anytime soon.",3,2022,04,16
111,Excellent stay,"Brilliant stay. Very well looked after, nothing was a problem and hotel in great condition. Went with wife and 2 kids (8 and 7) and everyone loved it. We had a studio site which was excellent, gave us enough space (we stayed 5 nights) and room was spotless. Thank you",5,2022,04,15
111,Such a lovely stay,Myself and my partner stayed in this hotel for our anniversary and felt so warmly welcomed by the lovely January. We had complementary rose petals on the bed and delicious macaroons and a card. The spa was great and so relaxing. We will definitely revisit again someday! I would highly recommend.,5,2022,04,14
111,A gem in the City,"I stayed at the Mont Calm for my 50th birthday and I was treated like a queen. The hotel was amazing and staff were exceptional. Our room overlooked Finsbury square with views across London. Complimentary bottle of wine,macaroons and balloons to give the room that extra special touch and a late checkout. The spa and rose oil massage was exactly what I needed to relax and the service again was professional and impeccable.Special thanks to January who went out of her way to make my day extra special and nothing was to much trouble. I will definitely be returning.",5,2022,04,13
111,Luxury spa hotel stay with wonderful staff and modern rooms,"We stayed for our anniversary and were made to feel so welcome. There were balloons and rose petals on the bed and even a card and some macaroons in the room. We were checked in by Anastasia, she was so friendly and kind and even gave us complimentary breakfast. Every member of staff we met was super friendly and helpful. 
The pool and spa area is so luxurious, clean and modern - not easy to find in central London. 
We enjoyed our stay so much we wish we were there for longer!",5,2022,04,13
111,Fantastic,Absolutely fantastic. The service was exceptional. Contacted before due to a birthday. The staff greeted us and took us to the room. Balloons were on the bed. Really memorable one. Spa good and again the staff were very good. The level of service that we experience was genuinely 5*.,5,2022,04,13
111,The perfect spot for a girly weekend!,"Now this was booked in preparation for my best friends hen and our group of 9 could y have had a better time celebrating. 

The rooms, stunning.

Views, fantastic.

Location, convenient to Liverpool Street & Moorgate station.

Cleanliness, outstanding.

Food/drink spots in-house were more than you could ask for.

But, I have to give a massive shoutout to two members of the team that ensures we were taken care of all weekend. From the very first moment we entered/checked in, to when we checked out, Adelina & Sarah offered a five star service. 

Such helpful young ladies who were knowledgable, bubbly and so very welcoming. I would honestly come back to stay here just to see them. Impeccable customer service. 

A big thank you to Mary also as she arranged a special surprise in our room for the bride to be. 

Thank you, thank you for making this such a special occasion!",5,2022,04,12
111,Excellent Stay,"I booked this hotel for my fiancés birthday weekend away in London & it was perfect, from the moment we stepped through the doors until we checked out, the staff couldn’t have been any nicer, or more helpful, the rooms are beautiful and clean! We had to wait slightly longer for our room keys, as I had made a note on booking that it was a birthday celebration (they decorated the room for us) due to this Mary, who we dealt with start to finish, added a breakfast onto our room complimentary. Will definitely be back, made a special weekend perfect!",5,2022,04,12
111,Amazing weekend celebrating a birthday,"We have recently just returned from our 2 night stay. Extremely impressed with the facilities and staff who went above and beyond to make my boyfriends birthday special. Only thing that could’ve been better was a bit longer than 30 minute slots per day for the pool as the facilities are so incredible it would be nice to spend more time there, other than this I couldn’t fault anything. Food was amazing and the rooftop bar was stunning, incredible views and a lovely way to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday, when we were shown to our room by one of the managers there were balloons on the bed which is a lovely addition and thoughtful gesture. The hotel itself is situated in a perfect location, walking distance from Liverpool Street Station and also lots of bars, restaurants and activities nearby. Definitely would recommend and will be returning for other special occasions.",5,2022,04,11
111,Montcalm - A lovely place to stay,"Thank you to the staff at the Montcalm Hotel in Finsbury Square (especially Aleksandra). They made us feel very welcome and the hotel was excellent. Room was very comfortable, location good for getting to London's sites.",5,2022,04,11

111,The best in London in its category,"I stay in this hotel between 4 and 10 nights per month and so do many of my staff and colleagues. It is a hotel hard to fault (maybe it can be too popular at times). The staff are the best, always cheerful and pleased to see you. Deepak and Mary are great hosts and very helpful, and this is reflected in how the rest of the staff respond.
If you are looking for a hotel in London then book this one, you will not be dissapointed.

When we arrived at 12pm and my boyfriend explained it was my birthday, Mary was more than accommodating and gave us a free upgrade to a suite and we could check in 2 hours before the usual check in time. Mary also arranged a free bottle of Prosecco. The hotel was beautiful, clean and all of the staff were friendly and welcoming!

111,Excellent birthday weekend,"Mary went above and beyond to help, decorating the room with balloons and petals and  setting the cake I had delivered ready for when we arrived.

111,Nice London Hotel,"A lovely modern hotel set in Finsbury Sq. We were booked in a room with a great view of the Square. Stay included continental breakfast which was fine. Hotel has a rooftop bar which is great, and has a pool, jacuzzi & some spa facilities which we made use of. We had an issue when we first checked in, AC in room wasn’t working but they sent someone to resolve the issue. Wouldn’t say staff were the friendliest but that can be said for a lot of London hotels",4,2022,04,06
111,Excellent customer service!,"This was second visit to a Montcalm hotel. My firstwas for a spa break with afternoon tea with a friend at the Marble Arch hotel and the organisation did not disappoint. Everyone from the door man to the receptionist to the cleaners to the spa staff, name it, was so pleasant, they made our 27th anniversary weekend extremely memorable. I can't wait to take my daughter on a spa break with afternoon tea just so I can visit again. This, an any other Montcalm hotel, is the perfect place to relax and be papmered and relaxed.

111,Fantastic Friday night!!!,"Had a great time at Royal London House. Excellent service and food at Aviary and we had a suite for the night which was perfect for the three of us. Super comfy beds and luxurious bathroom with an exciting city view. Fab breakfast. Efficient check in/out staff. I can't wait to go back and try the spa, had a quick look at the facilities and was very impressed.",5,2022,04,04
111,Family break in London,Walking in we were made to feel incredibly welcome! All the staff seemed delighted to see us and it was clear nothing would be too much trouble. The Aviary was great for a Sat lunch and the spa was great (though do need to book in advance and clearly a weekend morning is going to be a busy time). Rooms / beds were all very comfortable. Can't fault the stay and would definitely look to stay here next time we are in London for a weekend,5,2022,04,04
111,Great Hotel,"Reception staff are friendly and professional 

Rooms are clean, functional and equipped with all necessary tools for a comfortable stay

Hotel location is great and nearby all possible logistics 

Have been impressed with with my stay

Surely will stay there again",5,2022,04,04
111,Perfect stay,"Myself and my wife had a 2 night stay at the Montcalm and I could not fault it. 
We had a club double room which was of such a high quality. Full Sky TV package available, an incredibly comfortable bed and heated bathroom floor contributed to a relaxing stay. We dined in the Aviary restaurant which I would highly recommend for anyone staying, and the room service food was fantastic. 
The staff were attentive and helpful and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. We have tried many different hotels on London and this is by far the best.",5,2022,04,03
111,A Hotel that is Pure Perfection,"Being in a hospitality and client Industry for over 25 years, my hospitality experience, I would say that I'm pretty knowledgeable. Its such a delight then - when I arrive at a hotel that really know their customer and have been superbly trained throughout. 
I paid for a Club Room and that's exactly what I got, state of the art tech, nice size TV and various other goodies. 

In the first 10 mins of me being in the room I did notice that the bed was very soft and too light for me as I'm a 6ft 5 large chap. It turned out that there was a problem with the bed anyway but it wasn't a massive issue, had I been 10 stone lighter, it would have been fine I think.   Within 20 mins of my light complaint I was upgraded to a Junior Suite, no problem, and a bottle of prosecco for the inconvenience. 
THIS IS HOW A CUSTOMER SHOULE BE TREATED!!  TAKE NOTE-OTHER HOTELS!!
I may have been an exception but to upgrade me to a better room when the hotel is full, is not only amazing but very thoughtful and considerate. 
It shows that this hotel has been trained to the highest standard and the staff know their clientele well. A big thank you to HAMED in Concierge who spent about 30 mins helping me with everything and moving my luggage, Ask for him when you next stay, he's a great guy, a real asset to then hotel.   
A big thank you to January Stevens The Guest Experience Manager as well for meeting with me and making sure all was well, and a thank you to all the staff.
I cant wait to come back soon!",5,2022,04,02
111,Lovely stay for my partner’s birthday,"Our second time staying at the Montcalm RLH and a very pleasant one at that.  
It was my partner’s birthday and the hotel prepared the room with balloons which was lovely. 

All of the staff we met were very friendly and helpful; couldn’t ask for anything more. 
The room was clean and an overall beautiful hotel. 

A special Thank You to Mary Philippiah who met us before and after our stay to make sure we had the best stay possible. 

We shall see you soon!",5,2022,04,02

111,Repeat Guests - Already looking forward to our next stay!,"We are repeat guests and safe to say we will be back again. 
The rooms are perfect with all the amenities you could need and serviced daily. The bar staff both downstairs and in the Aviary are welcoming and accommodating. On this occasion we didn’t get to visit the spa however have done so previously and would recommend a visit. 
The hotel boasts spectacular views and is in a prime location for eating out and drinking; not far also from Spitalfields Market which is a must on your to do list! 
Deepak the General Manager is always there to ensure the stay is as it should be and has a great team behind him; special mention to January who looked after us on this occasion. 
Looking forward to booking up again soon!",5,2022,03,31
111,Above and Beyond,"I would like to say a special thank you to January for going above and beyond not once, but TWICE! The first time I came to the hotel there had been a slight mix up with my booking, however this was swiftly rectified and I felt completely at ease. The staff were attentive and made sure I was looked after. I had such an amazing stay that I decided to return as a birthday gift for my sister in laws birthday. Again January went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable. 
Make sure you book dinner reservations at the roof top restaurant, the view can not be missed!",5,2022,03,31
111,AMAZING BDAY STAY,"My stay at The Montcalm Royal London Hotel was one I will never forget. I stayed here for my 23rd Birthday, after waiting 3 years to celebrate a Birthday outside of lockdown I am quite happy to say it was well worth the wait. The staff are unbelievably amazing, they go above and beyond to meet the needs of all guests and make you feel so special!
Some names to mention are Mary from the guest experience team and Hamid who is concierge. Mary took us to our beautiful room filled with birthday balloons, it was a complete surprise and I was so grateful the hotel did this for me. She always made sure we were happy and it’s safe to say we definitely were. Hamid was super friendly and just so lovely to me and my boyfriend, made us smile very much! He is a star!
The hotel was fab and the aviary was also just phenomenal, from the cocktails to the burgers to the all inclusive breakfast buffet! I would not hesitate to go back there at all! I’m already wanting to plan another visit…thanks to all the staff, hopefully we shall see you soon and enjoy the rest of your 2022!
Lots of love, Milly & James

111,Spectacular hotel with the best staff I’ve seen in any five star hotel.,"Probably the best run 5 star hotel I have ever experienced. The staff were exceptional in every way, even though it’s a popular hotel, the receptionists are so efficient that you’re checked in in no time. They were always there to accommodate any request, and were overall amazing. The hotel itself was very lively, from the bars and restaurant at ground level, to the rooftop lounge. Amazing facilities all over. Will definitely come back next time I’m in London.",5,2022,03,29
111,Amazing staff and amazing hotel .,"From the moment we stepped into  the Montcalm  hotel your staff couldn’t do enough for us very friendly attentive staff the doorman greeted us the person at the desk asked us to check in along the corridor and the check in staff were very helpful and efficient. We had all the information and went on up to our room 614 by the lift the room was amazing very well equipped we only had to to ask for extra milk and tea which came very quickly when asked.. we were booked into the spa so robes were provided as soon as we got to our room by the porter. We changed in the room for the spa then went down in the lift the spa was beautiful we had a time slot so found it wasn’t over crowded and we could use all the facilities in the time allocated. We went to the bar after getting showered and changed the football was on so was a little too busy but we stayed for a drink but decided to have room service for something to eat. I’m gluten free so I asked at reception of the options they were so helpful and put me straight through to the chef in the kitchen who gave me a list of dishes were he could change some of the ingredients that were gluten free. We rang room service when we wanted it and the chef said it would be with us in 20 to 30 minutes and it did arrive in about 20 minutes by a very friendly porter . The meals were delicious and hot. We slept very well as the bed was very comfortable and the room was so quiet .
Breakfast was on the top floor it was beautiful we were asked to choose a table and then choose what we liked from the breakfast buffet the staff were very friendly and again very attentive tea and coffee brought to the table straight the way the breakfast buffet had a very good choice of hot and cold food which was all delicious maybe my only criticism would be it was warm but not hot as the plates were cold and the lids of the holding dishes were opened and closed a lot as it was busy but not over busy . The rooftop was beautiful we went down to reception to book a taxi as we were going onto the Sunborn Yacht hotel for the next part of our stay in London again the staff couldn’t help you more and the gentleman behind the desk booked us a taxi for our checking out time as I had another spa session booked as it was Mother’s Day. We checked out and Mary the guest experience person was very helpful and checked us out promptly and wished us a  good stay at our other hotel overall it was a very memorable and amazing stay and we will be back when we can in the not so distant future so thank all your amazing staff as they are a credit to your hotel .",5,2022,03,29

I had a lovely time at the hotel, it is the perfect spot to relax and get away. I have to thank January and Marry for making my stay so comfortable. They are fantastic! always so attentive and friendly, a great example of 5 star service.",5,2022,03,28
111,What a great experience at the LRH!,"All staff members were helpful, kind and smily. 
The room is equipped with all one can ask for.
It's clean and tide.  Very comfortable bed!
Breakfast is good (but every day same options...).
The rooftop view and setting is gorgeous. 
Thx!!",5,2022,03,28
111,Best Stay! Book Book Book,"This is the best hotel stay I’ve had!!! The hotel
Itself if beautiful, clean, well situated and more, I honestly couldn’t recommend it more. I was initially greeted by Miriam, one of the nicest people I’ve ever met! She was extremely welcoming answered any questions I had, she asked what my stay was for I told her it was my birthday weekend and she upgraded my room; sent over complimentary wine and chocolate and helped me book the spa. We had conversations like we knew each other and I felt so comfortable! Honestly, Miriam was the highlight of my stay and deserves a lot of recognition (and a pay rise).

The room was clean, bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very modern. The tv had access to every sky channel, bbc iPlayer and my 5. No Netflix etc but you can play it from your phone and connect. The room was high tech with a device where you can switch the lights on or off; underfloor heating etc. 

The spa!!! Amazing pool and jacuzzi - nice facilities and is very quiet…just what you need to relax. 

Finally, when I checked out I spoke to Aleksandra who was so helpful, offered to keep my stuff and was genuinely so so lovely. Every single staff members I encountered was so lovely, kind and caring and couldn’t commend them enough!",5,2022,03,27
111,Amazing!,"We stayed here as a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by extremely friendly staff. During the whole stay the hotel staff couldn’t do more for us. It was perfect. We would love to come back to stay here. Location was perfect with a short walk to several underground stations and bus stops around Finsbury square which the hotel overlooks. Thank you for the extras in the room for us, it honestly made it perfect!!!",5,2022,03,27
111,Disappointed unfortunately,"Overall, the hotel is beautiful and very intimate. However, I was disappointed and saddened with my stay. I was really looking forward to my experience but left feeling very dissatisfied. Firstly, I paid for a spa treatment and due to a delay for emergency reasons, I was a little late but called ahead. I was unable to receive the treatment, didn’t receive a refund and was declined the offer of transferring to another day. Which means I Lost out on money for nothing, this started off my stay on a low.
Upon arriving (first time staying), I was very confused about where reception was as you are met with a bar/restaurant as soon as you walk in which is frustrating because it’s a bunch of loud, drunk people just shouting.
We then got checked in and went up to the room, to be met with a toilet that wouldn’t flush and made a lot of noise and a phone that would not work. This meant we had to use the toilets downstairs and call the spa and reception with our own phones.
When I checked in, I was told breakfast was included and made sure to ask if it was full English, which I was told it was. However, in the morning I was told in was intercontinental and would have to pay £30 to have full English breakfast instead, which again, I refused a transfer to the breakfast I had initially had about.
We had arrived back from the pool and was getting changed, ready for checkout. Housekeeping, kept knocking and banging on the door asking about checkout time, they did this 3 times before we grew frustrated and left. I’m so upset with the entire stay and would prefer to talk to someone senior in regards to this.",2,2022,03,27
111,The staff are very friendly when you walk in the lobby and show you were the reception is. The location is very good.,"staff was lovely and helpful, Sarah was very kind and took us to our room, helps with taking the bags to our room :) the room was lovely and a perfect size and had a lovely view,the bathroom was a very good size and has underfloor heating. We will definitely be back :)",5,2022,03,27
111,My 2nd Time!,"It was amazing! I was given the same room I had last time, with added Complimentary.
The manager named January, a lovely fantastic women who on both occasions provided me with the best welcome and stay!",5,2022,03,27
111,Perfect base in the City,"It was my second stay for work at the Montcalm Royal London House and it’s the perfect base in the City.

Special thanks to Mary and January for their excellent service upon check in and check out. 

The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with all the amenities you could ask for. Breakfast options on the 10th floor are varied and good quality. 

The only minor thing I can think of is a lack of healthy options on the room service menu… the double cheeseburger was great, but I could have done without it! 

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2022,03,26
111,Not bad for a 5 star - customer service made up for it!,"We stayed at the Montcalm - London Royal House for one night. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. The room was a tad disappointing - dirt and marks on the floor, the room control panel half hanging off the wall. Aside from these niggles, it was a comfortable stay. However where the Montcalm exceeds any hotel stay in London is the Guest Experience Manager - January. I informed January that the stay was for a special occasion and she went above and beyond to accommodate. We received a complimentary room upgrade and breakfast as well as balloons and some sweet treats in our room. Most importantly however, it was the care and attention provided by January which has put Montcalm London Royal House on the list of hotels I would happily return to for another stay.",4,2022,03,25
111,Home from Home,I keep coming back because the staff are amazing and that example comes from the manager all the way throughout his team!  Nothing is a bother and it makes being away from home a lot easier. Thanks Deepak! You are brilliant 👏,5,2022,03,23
111,Wonderful birthday weekend,"My family and I checked into the hotel on Sunday 20th to celebrate my birthday. Check in was smooth and both our rooms had been upgraded which was great and they also gave us a complimentary late check out.
We came into the room and there were happy birthday balloons and macaroons which was so lovely. The king size bed was so comfy!
We had a relaxing time at the Spa, although you have to book a 30 mins slot.
Everything was wonderful and we would definitely return for another stay. All the staff were very helpful and no issues at all. 
Great hotel, 5 stars for sure!",5,2022,03,23
111,I would rate it 10 stars if i could,"A massive thank you to Daniel, Valentina and Mary. You guys made my stay amazing, one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. The staff was very accommodating, the spa was relaxing, i had a great time.
I can’t wait to come back.",5,2022,03,21
111,Fantastic mini honeymoon stay 💍,"We checked in to the Montcalm Royal London on Saturday 19th March after getting married the day before. My wife and I had been planning for many years and decided as a last minute idea we'd enjoy a 2 night minimoon in London together. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by the warm and helpful staff in reception who checked us in and immediately congratulated us on our marriage. We were then handed over to Mary (Guest Experience) and Peter (Concierge) who escorted us with our luggage to our room. They were friendly, helpful and were keen to offer their assistance. Our room had been decorated with petals, balloons and a gift of prosecco was on ice. It was a lovely gesture and nice surprise. 

Throughout our stay we saw Peter who continued to be polite, supportive and always happy to help. We really felt like he was our personal concierge and that he knew who we were. Mary too was on hand to help whenever we saw her. 

We didn't have robes in our room however this was not an issue as reception quickly got some to us ... And they were incredibly fluffy! 

On Sunday we went up to the rooftop for a quick drink before going out for the afternoon. Despite telling the gentlemen on the desk that we would only be staying 20 minutes, he kindly offered us the igloo where we enjoyed an alcoholic beverage overlooking the lovely views. 

A real highlight was feeling as though we mattered and that Mary and Peter, along with the whole reception team, appreciated our custom. 

The only one piece of constructive feedback was that there was a miscommunication between two separate members of the spa team. One person said it didn't matter if we didn't enter the spa at our booked time however when we arrived the new person on the desk was quite blunt and dismissive of our explanation. She unfortunately did make us feel uncomfortable and didn't seem to care that we didn't intentionally break any time booking rules and so my wife suggested that she should take this up with her colleague rather than imply we were to blame. We were eventually allowed in but it wasn't without a debate. The chlorine levels also felt too high and our eyes were stinging after 45 minutes so we left anyway. 

We gave feedback to Mary about this who was really kind and reassuring that she would share this with the spa team. 

On the whole, it was a fantastic stay, private room, lovely views, complimentary Elemis products in room, great food, fantastic bar staff and even better service from Guest Experience, concierge, housekeeping and reception. 

We will be coming back for sure. 

Matt and Ashley",5,2022,03,21
111,Very accommodating!,"The team here are very accommodating and empathising. I booked this hotel for my partner's birthday and the team decorated the room with lovely balloons and macaroons. I met the lovely GEM and we got talking. 
I expressed that we had a bereavement and was looking forward to being away for the weekend to celebrate life. She kindly gave us a late check out and added a complimentary breakfast so we could make the most of the time we had away. 

Everyone we met greeted us, and were such genuine people. We cannot wait to visit this location again. Maybe for my birthday next!",5,2022,03,21
111,Anniversary trip to london,"Me and my boyfriend stayed for 1 night to celebrate our anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the manager called ‘January’ who escorted us to our room, which had been upgraded ! She then booked us into the rooftop bar for drinks in the evening. Amazing stay and great room service. NOTE: makesure to book a spa time slot to use the pool, sauna + steam room.",5,2022,03,20
111,Hen week3nd,"I have just returned from a hen weekend at this hotel, I would like to take a minute and thank January the guest experience manager who made the trip very special for us, despite all of my trials and tribulations and last minute changes of plans,  everything came together beautifully!

Mustafa (Nigh manager) and his team were exceptional, went above and beyond to make our stay memorable.

Mustafa and his wonderful team Muhammad, and Kalyoan were amazing all nights and made our visit to London ever so great. Thanks again Team and Hope to see you soon!",5,2022,03,15
111,"Terrible experience, left without staying","Booked a stay here for my anniversary in Feb 2022 but the room provided was dirty - large stain on the bedsheet, dust from the aircon vent stuck to the wall, hairs in the bathroom and chair in the main room and also an assortment of small debris in the bed itself.

I should have walked out at that point, but gave the hotel an opportunity to clean the room. I called reception but there was no answer so had go to down to the main desk physically to ask for the room to be cleaned. I was informed that the room would be cleaned ASAP, but 30mins passed and no one showed up. I phoned reception, again no answer, so again I went down to main desk and to my astonishment, the reception staff called the woman BEHIND me in the queue forward ahead of me despite the fact that I had been waiting over 5mins again to be seen (I am not one to play the race card at the drop of a hat but that was the only difference between me and all the other patrons at the hotel). When I did speak to reception, I was told that the room had been cleaned. I went back up to my room to find that it had not been cleaned at all. I tried calling reception again, but no surprise they didn't answer again so for the third time I went down myself and was told that the room had definitely been cleaned. It hadn't. No hotel staff had been in the room since we arrived.

At that point my 3 year old was shattered and throwing a tantrum because she wanted to sleep but I had no bed to put her on so I asked for a refund so that we could leave. The hotel called a black cab, didn't even offer to cover the fee to travel home which I thought would have been the very smallest of gestures after waiting over 1.5hrs for the room to be cleaned which it never was. They could have offered a different room too which I would have accepted despite the awful service received that evening but they didn't do that either.

All in all, it was a terrible experience and I will not be returning here again.",1,2022,03,15
111,So happy with the service we came back,"Me and my partner were greeted on arrival! The service provided was exceptionally great. We were able to use all the facilities. Clean towels and dressing gowns were provided. 

A sleep like I’ve never experienced before. The mattress was extremely comfortable and the room was very spacious. The shower facilities were clean! The lighting was very easily accessible as they are beside your bed and you can access all lights from there.

Mary made sure we were looked after, we received amazing service from her! Any issue we had was taken care of and rectified by her. Mary went above and beyond and we will definitely be back for a third time. 

Highly recommended.",5,2022,03,15
111,Amazing stay!,"Our stay at The Montcalm Royal London House was excellent. The staff were very nice and helpful and our room was lovely to stay in.

111,Amazing hotel,"Wow what can I say, from day one of booking this hotel nothing has been too much trouble for Mary and her team. Upon arrival we were greeted by a smily face and helpful staff, the hotel is beautiful and the room was stunning, the shower was amazing and the underfloor heating was an added bonus. I can’t fault anything with this hotel! Thank you for an amazing stay and we will without a doubt be back. Next time we will make sure we use the spa as we didn’t get chance this time. Thank you Mary.",5,2022,03,13
111,Amazing stay!,"My girlfriend and I came for 2 nights to celebrate a promotion and had an incredible stay.

111,Excellent,"Incredibly friendly and attentative staff- Myself and my partner visited for her 30th. Despite a few minor issues communicating requests before hand, staff were incredibly accommodating once we arrived. The initial issues where resolved very quickly and requests where turned around straight away. The hotel Guest Experience Manager January was just brilliant and made our stay and my partners 30th very memorable. 
Rooms are a very high standard, views are amazing and the food from the hotels Aviery restaurant is delicious!
Highly recommended!",5,2022,03,11
111,"Welcoming, clean, comfortable.","Exceptional staff - everyone was very pleasant and the front of house were great. Spa receptionist was brilliant as well and very accomodating.

The breakfast was a great selection to with lovely views of London. High recommend.",5,2022,03,10
111,Quiet and Luxurious.,"Can't fault the food, the staff or anything really. I expected central London to be noisy but couldn't hear a thing from my room. Staff were incredibly helpful, especially Miriam at the front desk. Beautiful view from the top floor. Would recommend without reserve.",5,2022,03,09
111,Incredible stay & amazing customer service,Had the loveliest time staying at The Montcalm! Mary couldn't have been more helpful and kind in helping to plan my partner's birthday surprise with me. The room was gorgeous and so were the restaurants. We can't wait to go back and stay again!,5,2022,03,09
111,"Luxurious, Relaxing and in the PERFECT spot.","The staff were so welcoming. Mary looked after us for our stay, she was very personable and accommodating. It was my boyfriends 30th birthday so the room was filled with balloons, a big 30 balloon, macaroons and a very personal welcoming card! 

It’s in a great location for food and activities also Shoreditch is just around the corner. The room was beautiful, very sleek, beautiful view. The spa is beautiful and the complimentary 30 minutes was lovely!

The only note worth saying is we didn’t realise we had to book the 30 mins spa session until I saw a booking.com review stating it. So maybe just a little email notification before the stay would be helpful! However, that really didn’t effect my 5 star rating. It’s a beautiful hotel. The stay really felt like a experience, even though we already live in london we wanted to come back the next night!",5,2022,03,08
111,Great hotel,"Thank you Mary at guest experience! 
She greeted us at the front desk, friendly guest services agent helped our bags to the room. Amazing facilities, great pool and sauna. Brilliant hospitality😊

111,Superb customer service,I don't think we've ever come across such exceptional service within such a reasonably priced hotel! From check in to check out we felt like extremely valued guests - the balloons and petals on the bed were an unexpected treat for a special stay but it was even more than that - all of the staff that we met absolutely know the principles of fabulous service - this extended from the wonderful Mary who made such special efforts to the lovely chap who delivered extra tea and coffee to our room (I'm so sorry I haven't got everyone's names). The concierge team were so very helpful too. The management team should be so proud of their staff - they are nailing it!!!! The room and facilities were just great too but it was the staff that blew us away.,5,2022,03,06
111,1 year anniversary,"Me and my girlfriend had an amazing time visiting this hotel for our 1 year anniversary! The facilities were great and the room was really comfortable to be in.

111,Birthday Stay,I recently spent the night at the Montcalm Royal London hotel as part of my 40th Birthday celebrations. My friend booked the room and informed them it was my birthday. The hotel upgraded my room and decorated it which was wonderful and very unexpected. The guest experience team were fabulous and nothing was too much trouble. The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. We had a fantastic stay. The only very slight criticism I would have was that the Aviary bar doesn’t seem to give preference to hotel guests. We went up as a walk in (couldn’t book a table online as it showed fully booked) and was told we would have to drink at the bar. 4 tables however remained unoccupied for the whole time we were there. We asked if we could use one and were told no. Also one of the staff took the bar stools we were sitting on to put back at an empty table which again remained unoccupied. This was a little annoying but we didn’t let it effect our overall view of the hotel which was that it’s fabulous and we  would definitely stay again.,5,2022,03,06
111,Sister’s birthday visit,"Mary, John and Hamid :)

This might be a lengthy review, but I must thank you sincerely for an amazing overnight stay. 

At first, I was apprehensive about our visit: you never know how kind or attentive staff will be and I wanted the best experience for my sister. However, I was completely wrong about this (gladly so).

On arrival, we were greeted by lovely staff who offered us beverages as we waited to check-in. The whole process was very quick which I was grateful for as we had already arrived late. 

I was then greeted by the most vibrant, and genuine manger (Mary). She welcomed us and  we was escorted to our room, alongside John who kindly took our luggage for us. 

The room had ballon's and a lovely treat alongside a card for my sister. I tell you now, that gesture brung the biggest smile to her face; this made me feel like the correspondence between the hotel was successful, and they did make an effort  for her. The room was stunning and the bathroom was big, clean and bright. They even bought us bathrobes. 

The whole evening and night was beautiful… oh, and I had the best sleep!! The bed was so comfortable, at one point my sister took up 3/4 of it. Honestly, I slept for 7 hours which is like catching stardust for me. 

Late checkout made us have a couple extra hours of relaxation. We went to the spa, swam around like babies and sweated out the cocktails in the sauna and steam room.

Checkout was quick. Hamid asked us about our experience and we even managed to say bye to John who was working hard as usual (such a genuine soul). Mary even came out of her office to say goodbye. That was extremely kind of her. 

How could  I not write this review! It’s the details that made the whole experience phenomenal! I’m humbled by everyone but especially these three individuals. Thank you and I look forward to seeing you guys soon! :)

111,Amazing service,"We stayed to celebrate our engagement last week. We had such a lovely stay. Mary made our stay extra special. We had an issue with the air conditioning in our room, but it was quickly sorted and we were upgraded to a suite. The staff was so welcoming and accomodating. We enjoyed the spa and the rooftop bar at the hotel too. Highly recommend :)",5,2022,03,04
111,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,I booked the hotel for my partners birthday which I made the hotel aware of they want above and beyond by putting balloons in the room before we arrived with a box of chocolates and a birthday card. The hotel was clean modern and staff were super friendly and helpful. Spa facilities are great too!! Mary ensured everything was smooth and we enjoyed our stay and personally came to see us when we checked out. Nice personal touch and great experience all around.,5,2022,03,03
111,Memories made By the Guest Experience Team,"Well where do I start… What an amazing stay from start to finish, for me , my wife and 2 daughters!

The Hotel itself is beautiful , real 5* luxury, in a nice area of London, everywhere was spotless and the facilities were fantastic , from the pool and spa to exec lounge where the continental breakfast was great and In the evening the wines beers and snacks and service was a lovely touch too. 

The Avery restaurant on the top floor had breathtaking views , the food was divine and my daughter Minnie loved having her 8th birthday meal their. All the staff were great especially Alexandra who was our waitress, she even platted my daughters hair as a birthday treat which made her day! 

The real difference that sets this hotel apart though, is the guest experience team. They are literally out of this world, Mary and Daniel delivered over and above with every promise made , every request and went over and above and made us feel like VIP’s from start to finish, we were always met with a smile and they were caring and compassionate like they had known us for years! 

The communication before was first class to help book the Spa and Daniel helped book the restaurant for us all and arranged for a birthday treat. 

We were allowed to check in early and leave our bags and  Mary arranged for my daughters presents to be set out in our nice Spacious family Suite room, along with some balloons and treats complimentary of the hotel.! Fantastic. 

Later on during dinner we got a visit from Daniel looking dapper in his suit  to check everything was going well with a nice firm handshake and greeting and he also give us a bottle of Prosecco on the house! Again this was exceptional service.

By the end of the stay I think nearly everyone had said “Happy Birthday Minnie” and knew the who the birthday girl was and she felt over the moon thanks to Mary and Daniel Spreading the word. 

I truly found it hard saying goodbye when we checked out saying goodbye to Daniel and also January and the team. 

Our stay at the Montcalm was amazing and the people at the hotel give this place a heartbeat. 
We’ll see you again soon! 

The Swain Family",5,2022,03,01
111,Lovely,"I booked this hotel as a birthday gift for my Mum’s 50th birthday. The hotel is beautiful the staff are absolutely lovely especially Adriana who checked us in/out and Mary who showed us to our room. The spa was amazingly. The hot stone massage was incredible. The only reason I’m not giving it a 5 is because the breakfast was so expensive at £50, and the food wasn’t very nice. Other than that we had a lovely time and would definitely go back.",4,2022,03,01
111,Girlfriends birthday,I had a wonderful time at this hotel. The service was excellent from when I spoke to them on the phone to when I arrived at the hotel to check. I was particularly grateful to how the decorated the room with balloons and a happy birthday banner and left a welcome note making my girlfriend feel very special. The staff were very approachable and communicative. Booking services like the spa and gym was very easy and convenient. Access to the rooftop for a city view and restaurant was fantastic. Cleanliness of the room was top notch as our towels and sheets were replaced each day. 10/10 experience will definitely recommend and go again.,5,2022,03,01
111,"Brilliant Hotel, Even Better Staff!!","We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as a rearranged birthday trip for my fiance's 30th and couldn't fault it! The hotel is well equipped and everything is of a high standard, but the real asset are the amazing staff!

I had messaged January, the guest experience manager before our stay and she made every effort to make the birthday trip as special as possible, even after we had to rearrange due to covid cancellations at Christmas. She arranged for the room to be decorated with balloons and for a personalised card and macaroons for my partner which she loved! It was also lovely to be greeted and shown to our room by Mary from the team on arrival, a great personal touch.

Everyone who helped us at the hotel from check in to check out were brilliant.

The hotel is in a great location just 10 mins walk from Liverpool street station and rooms are well equipped and spacious. We didn't use the spa or hotel restaurants / bars but they seemed to a good standard from what we saw.

We would definitely stay at the hotel again in future and thanks to January and the team for their personalised service!",5,2022,02,28
111,Daniel was phenomenal!,"My girlfriend and I only had the 1 night - had a few issues in the first room we were given, popped to reception and Daniel sorted EVERYTHING and even upgraded us to a bigger, better room! Can’t thank him and the rest of the staff enough. Thank you all!",5,2022,02,28
111,Very excellent place to stay,"The Montcalm Royal London House was a beautiful place where I enjoyed my vacation. Thats The spa is incredibly good. Rooms and Hotel is very clean, good looking and the staff was lovely and kind. Very helpful guys working there. I recommend it to everyone and of course I will visit it again. Thank you :) See you soon.",5,2022,02,27
111,Such an amazing experience from the moment you walk through the doors,"Wow what can I say, from the moment you walk into the Montcalm the experience starts. Your instantly greeted by friendly smiling staff who make you feel welcome straight away. After checking in we was greeted by Mary from the guest experience team who had clearly read my booking as it was a special occasion, she didn't mention it at the time as it was an obvious suprise and after having our baggage carried to our room and being escorted there once opening the door and seeing the decorations and the personal card just made everything feel that extra bit special so a very big thank you to Mary, instantly I've recommended the hotel to friends, family and colleagues as the first impressions for me are the ones that count. We used the room service option when eating dinner as we were going out in the evening and just wanted something convenient whilst getting ready, speedy service again greeted with a friendly smile by the room service attendant the food was delicious !!! And very well priced. To actually get the food is simple by using a qr code on the phone (makes life so much easier). Later that evening after attending a local venue for celebrations we headed up to 10th floor for some evening drinks and indulged in the amazing views from the roof top bar. Unfortunately we didn't get use of the spa facilities but I have already emailed Mary to book in a full weekend so we can definitely make use of them then. Thanks again to all the staff in Montcalm for a fantastic comfortable stay and I look forward to seeing you all again soon.",5,2022,02,27
111,Birthday Stay,"After having difficulties earlier in the week booking the spa as part of our Wowcher deal, which was promptly dealt with with my the experience manager January, we had the most special stay at the Montcalm.  

Our room was spacious, clean and the complementary wine and balloons that had been left by the experiences team were a lovely touch for my birthday. 

The spa facilities were clean, and spacious and not overcrowded, which meant we could comfortably spend time in the steam room and sauna. 

We enjoyed a lovely dinner in the Aviary restaurant and breakfast in the morning. 

Overall the staff were courteous, polite and couldn't do enough. The fact that January stayed to personally check that the stay met all my expectations afterwards was a nice touch. 

I will be definitely returning for another stay.",5,2022,02,27
111,Brilliant all round,would highly recommend! very comfortable stay and very high quality place along with helpful staff.  Special shoutout to mary who was brilliant for my partner and i making sure we had everything we needed.,5,2022,02,27
111,Lovely visit,"We stayed at the Montcalm in Mayfair previously and that was amazing, the best hotel Iv ever stayed in . So , I decided to book the Montcalm royal london house as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday.

We were greeted immediately upon arrival by a lovely welcoming and very informative receptionist. The room was lovely and spacious and was decorated by the guest experience team for my boyfriends birthday. I requested a Victoria sponge cake with fresh fruit for his birthday and they delivered, it was perfect.

We had a massage which was lovely and the pool /spa facilities were perfect.

The only negatives I had is that , the steam room floor was filthy , I had to wear my slippers in there . The heating didnt work so we were freezing , we got woken up at 8 am by someone at the door saying that we requested some water (we didnt), and we couldn’t get sky sports on the tv which I think is suprising  for a 5 star hotel .

Overall, this hotel is amazing in my opinion and I wouldn’t definitely stay here again . It’s great value for money and can definitely see why ur is 5 star . However if you are looking for somewhere that is the height of luxury I wouldn’t definitely pay a visit to the Montcalm hotel in Mayfair as this was in its own league .",5,2022,02,27
111,Above and Beyond service!,"I visited this hotel with my grandson for his 18th Birthday. From arrival to leaving, Mary on reception made us feel extremely welcome and valued. The staff had decorated our bedroom and made a lovely fuss of my grandson who has autism. Daniel was particularly knowledgable and informative regarding the amenities and ensured my special requests where carried out. We were on a tight budget, however all staff still treated us like millionaires! We had dinner in the Avairy restaurant, the food was delicious and the service from the restaurant manager Akra was again excellent! We will definitely return and highly recommend!",5,2022,02,27
111,Best hotel in North London!,"I would like to thank everyone for my stay! I had to reschedule twice because I was very ill (ring to change - DO NOT rely on booking.com app, it won't work). 
The staff on the phone were lovely, security was welcoming and the reception staff (my favourite people!) Just made my day. They kept making sure I was okay and had everything I needed and that I was feeling alright too. Made me so emotional! 
It was meant to be a romantic night but plans changed and my wonderful friends joined me instead. We spent majority of the night in the roof top bar which was beautiful!!! Staff in there are AMAZING too. 
We went to the downstairs bar for a drink and was rather disappointed by the service of the manager along with his language, behaviour and attitude - so we went to all bar one across the road instead! 
Checkout was easy, manager came to check I was alright and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again - I'm dying to try the spa out! 
Location is easy, although in congestion which is inconvenient - I parked in the euro park in Shoreditch (10 minute walk) for £28 for 24hrs. 
The double rooms are beautiful - shower is amazing too, the whole interior of the hotel is just beautiful. 
Thank you very much to the majority of the staff, I wish my stay was longer!! ",5,2022,02,27
111,Best hotel in London!,"I had a lovely time when I stayed at the Montcalm and I would highly recommend this hotel.

111,Birthday Visit,"We were incredibly satisfied with our recent two night stay at this hotel.
My partner organised it for my birthday celebrations and it was a wonderful trip.

The staff were incredible, happy and extremely accommodating, Mary was particularly wonderful.
They had prepared some extra surprises for my birthday in our room, which was very sweet and unexpected.

I was also very happy with the complementary, Elemis bathroom toiletries. 

The continental breakfast was more than sufficient, and delicious with an additional bonus of very tasty coffee.

The only area of comment would be that the decor and overall building maintenence could be upkept a little better, the bathroom floor was in need of regrouting, and the carpet could do with being relayed as it was very 'saggy' in some areas. 

Please note that these findings certainly did not distract from how lovely the facilities were, nor did they diminish the brilliance of our visit or how great our stay was.

Thank you.",5,2022,02,22
111,Came for My partners Birthday,Mary Philippiah was extremely helpful in ensuring our stay was perfect. Handled us with care and personally escorted us to our room with a personal conceierge. Amazing stay and hotel. Will defo be back.,4,2022,02,22

111,Such a special stay,"My boyfriend and I had an incredible stay at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel. From start to finish, we received the best service. The guest experience team gave us complimentary rose petals, card and a mini dessert platter for our valentines stay. Mary checked us in and also greeted us on departure. She and the other members of staff were so attentive throughout our whole stay, not only making us feel welcome but really making us feel so special. We will definitely be visiting this hotel again, thank you!!!",5,2022,02,20
111,Exceptional customer service!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the hotel. From the moment we arrived at the front door, we felt like VIPs by a team of staff who could not do more for us. 

This stay was to celebrate our recent wedding and my Husband had informed the front desk prior to our arrival that this stay was for a special occasion. I had the most lovely surprise to walk into our room to be greeted by rose petals on the bed and decorated around the room, it was such a nice touch!

Our room was on floor 8 which had very impressive views across the City skyline. 

We visited the Aviary bar twice and really enjoyed the impressive choice of cocktails and the service was great up there too. Breakfast was really good aswell, with the added bonus of the city skyline views.

We both had a great spa treatment (which I didn’t want to end) and whilst not a huge spa area, the pool area is a lovely relaxing spot to escape from the chaos of the City.

The hotel is within a short walk to Moorgate, Old Street and Liverpool St tube stations so it was very convenient location.

Special thanks to Deepak who really made this a very special stay for us, we can’t wait to come back again!",5,2022,02,20
111,"Good location, Best service, Great Staff",Stayed with Family for 2 days from 17th to 19th Feb. Location is good. Very near to moorgate as well as Liverpool street stations. Mary and John from guest relations were amazing. Check-in and check-out was very smooth. Breakfast was OK. Hotel staff does deserve full credit in keeping things moving in such difficult times especially post-covid recovery of our hospitality industry. Overall it was a great stay and we did enjoy our time at Montcalm.,4,2022,02,19
111,Best Hotel In London. Amazing Customer Service & Facilities.,"This hotel is hands down the best place we have stayed, and that is saying something as we have been guests of some of the best hotels in London and abroad. 

From the get go, Mary (from the guest experience department) was there to greet me pre arrival to arrange the room in orderly fashion for my wife’s birthday suprise. The room was absolutely incredible, akin to those set-up by professional companies (I would say better), and they even kindly organised some macaroons and a personalised card for us. 

When we arrived to check in we were given a personalised and warm welcome by Mary, and the same upon our departure. We truly were made to feel like we were the number one guests in the hotel. I must also say that Daniel Todorov (concierge) deserves a pay rise. His customer service was impeccable and we cannot thank him enough! It was like we were celebrities visiting London, and we were actually sad to leave. Please look no further if you want to stay in London. The price of this hotel is minuscule in comparison to the customer service that you receive from ALL staff members, and their facilities are gorgeous. 

Please remember to book in your time in the swimming pool as it can get very busy given they have a Versace Pool! You can use the gym without booking and it’s very well equipped if you are a fitness enthusiast. Honestly the pictures do not do this place justice, me and my wife will most definitely be staying again. Thank you Mary and Daniel, and best wishes to all the staff at the Montcalm, we will definitely be seeing you all again soon!",5,2022,02,19
111,An amazing 1st stay at the Montcalm!,"I had a great first experience staying at the Montcalm. I received great service and hospitality from all colleagues from reception to the spa, but I'd give a special shout out to Mary from the guest experience team, who made this birthday visit extra special by offering complimentary balloons and sweet treats in the room.  It was a great place to choose for a birthday. The facilities were great and very clean, and the room was comfortable and spacious.

I'll be back again and hopefully for a longer visit! 

Would definitely recommend visiting this hotel.",5,2022,02,19
111,Truly exceptional,"From the moment we stepped through the door at Montcalm Royal London House we knew this hotel was something very special, well deserved of its 5* rating. 
Our every need was catered for, Head concierge, Daniel truly went over and above to make everything super special for us.  He is absolutely a credit to this establishment and in his words, treated us all like family.
I would recommend a stay at this top class hotel in the centre of London and hope to return in the near future.",5,2022,02,19
111,Great stay,"This was a great hotel to use as a jumping-off point for the Barbican area for a conference.  Everything is modern and well maintained.  I will be using this hotel again the next time I am in the area, for sure!",5,2022,02,16
111,Great hotel and Friendly staff,"The hotel itself was great and perfect location for us. 

We went for my fiancé’s 30th birthday and the guest experience team (Mary) decorated the room and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine which was nice touch.

The only thing I would comment on is that we only had 1 big towel in our room. And also the Ipad thing that was on the wall to turn on the underfloor heating and lights etc was slightly temperamental (both issues rectified straight away by reception ).

Finally there was building work going on outside our window (Fixing the roof). So there was banging on Monday morning.

Having said that I would definitely return and probably will when we return back to London. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay",4,2022,02,15
111,Birthday and valentines,"The Montcalm Hotel was very lovely it was a very good place to choose a birthday and valentines stay, parking was very convenient as well as that the staff are brilliant got one staff that help me throughout my stay was January.

111,Anniversary stay,"I would like to personally send the Montcalm team a huge thank you.

The attention to detail we received once arriving at Montcalm was second to none, your reception team was extremely welcoming polite, and gracious. The bar staff couldn't do enough for us when we returned to the rooftop bar and hadn't booked a table on a very busy night, we were found a table which enabled us to finish the night exactly how we planned.

Then we had the immense pleasure of meeting January (Guest Manager) who in our eyes went well above any welcome we're received staying at many hotels around London.

On entering our room, the lovely display the hotel arranged for our wedding anniversary stay was so lovely and so surprising for my wife, she spent the rest of the weekend telling family & friends!",5,2022,02,15
111,Extremely helpful and great stay,"Had an amazing stay at this hotel. Booked it for an engagement proposal and they were so helpful from start to finish. From the little touches in the room to the extra benefits like breakfast included and late checkout.

111,Excellent modern Hotel with great rooms and great atmoshere,"I'm so glad to be back again at my favorite hotel in London and seeing that it operates fully again after the pandemic restrictions. The hotel has such a great atmosphere with its rooftop bar, restaurants, spa and friendly staff. Very short distance to Liverpool St. Station and Moorgate (less than 5 min) makes it extremly convient. 

The rooms are modern and spaceous. The breakfast buffet in the rooftop restaurant with a great view is amazing. The gym and spa area (which needs currently a free time slot booking to limited the amout of people) is very well equiped with pool and sauna.

The reception team is very friendly and extremly helpful. A special thanks to January and her team who gave me a lot of recommendations.",5,2022,02,12

I’d 200% recommend this hotel, will definitely be coming back😊",5,2022,02,10
111,"This incredible hotel, staff and service made for a wonderful weekend in London!","Having stayed at the hotel previously in 2019, we debated on whether or not to try a new hotel or to return. Considering the location, style of the hotel and our needs for the weekend, we decided to go ahead and book in once more for three nights. Prior to arrival, we booked a dinner timeslot in the Aviary Restaurant and spa timeslots for two of the days we would be there.
After our travels, we were warmly greeted upon arrival in the early hours of Friday morning and the check in procedure was quick which was ideal as we were beginning to get very tired. Our bags were brought up to our room for us and the concierge made sure that everything was in working order before bidding us goodnight. This is such a nice touch from the hotel. We were south facing on an upper level and the view was incredible. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean, sophisticated and opulent. The mattress was and bedding were super comfortable. We were falling asleep before our heads hit the pillows.
We woke the next morning for breakfast in the Aviary. It is a buffet style breakfast with a wide assortment of breakfast items. Eggs and hash browns could be ordered from the kitchen also and any other requests could also be accommodated. We thought the food was fresh, well stocked and well presented. The wait service was also impeccable. The Aviary is a beautiful restaurant and spacious with impressive views across the London skyline. Breakfast was of the same top class quality and service for the other two mornings.
The spa was luxurious and easily located. The timeslots were a great idea to avoid overcrowding and made the experience really enjoyable. It was a pleasure to enjoy the pool, hot tub and to relax on the loungers.
Dinner in the Aviary Restaurant was an experience. It was busy for a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. The pods on the terrace looked amazing and we wish we had booked some time in one; however, they were all booked out unsurprisingly. From the moment we sat down, the wait staff were very attentive, quick and friendly. We were made feel completely comfortable and this added to the experience. The menu had a great range of items and we ordered mains (steak fries and roast chicken), desserts, cocktails and bar drinks. Everything was of extremely high quality, well presented and absolutely delicious. Usually we would leave some food behind but we both highly enjoyed the courses. We expected delays in the service with the busy crowd but everything was running smoothly, a genuine credit to the restaurant team. We finished with a drink in the terrace and it was a great way to end the experience. The views, the atmosphere and the service truly made this one of our favourite experiences ever in London.
Throughout the stay, the hotel staff were very attentive, incredibly friendly and super accommodating. They were easy to get a hold of to contact and quick to respond to any needs. In particularly the concierges, reception staff and duty managers went above and beyond and it is clear they do this for all guests. To me, the staff are what makes this hotel experience one of the best we have ever encountered.
The hotel had all Covid protective measures in place and we felt safe and comfortable at all times. We could not recommend this hotel enough and have already recommended it to family and friends. We look forward to visiting again in the future.",5,2022,02,10
111,Incredible!,"My boyfriend surprised me to a birthday trip to London and he couldn’t have chosen a better hotel! From start to finish we were given 5* treatment. We arrived at the hotel and the staff quickly took our bags from us and gave us a warm welcome. We were then taken up to the room by the lovely Mary. I opened the door to an amazing room where there were balloons on the bed, macaroons and a personal handwritten card. The spa was lovely and the view from the top floor was insane! On checkout Mary personally said her goodbyes and made sure that we enjoyed our stay. The best hotel I have ever stayed in and wouldn’t think twice about returning. Next time I’d love to try the restaurant.",5,2022,02,09
111,30th Birthday - Outstanding,"We organised our trip quite last minute, and briefly mentioned that we were there for a birthday evening away.

111,Outstanding beyond wonderful,"Never have I experienced in all my years of travel all over the world (both as a flight attendant and as a tourist) this level of personal attention and service in a hotel. Every member of staff at the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel in Finsbury Square - no matter what their role, was absolutely fantastic! Yes, the hotel definitely lived up to it's description of being luxurious, and comfortable, however, it really is the staff that come out on top as the shining stars of this place. Whoever employed this team of attentive, kind, nothing is too difficult, remembering our requests and conversations and following up on them, escorting us to our rooms, being made to feel like a VIP... whoever selected and hand picked each of these wonderful, conscientious people to become a member of staff I send you the upmost congratulations. Your staff are to be highly commended. This hotel really is a special place to stay, an absolute gem. It made my weekend one of the happiest that I have ever experienced in London. I also observed something that I have never seen in a hotel before and once again singles them out as being highly committed... As people were checking out, they were warmly approached and asked if they had enjoyed their stay and was there anything that they felt needed to be changed to improve standards of the hotel. This really impressed me, and this is why I will never stay anywhere else for my future visits to London. Thank you to Mustapha, Camila, Hamid, Daniel and John, the night shift team and manager on Saturday night, the breakfast team on Sunday.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. I will see you again soon!",5,2022,02,07

111,Turned my birthday around! 5*,"I cannot thank the Montcalm Royal London House enough for making my birthday so special. I had plans to stay at a different hotel with my best friend for my birthday but unfortunately, my best friend caught covid. As I spent my birthday in lockdown last year, I really wanted to still treat myself so I decided to book the Montcalm for myself as it was affordable for one person but still luxurious. When I checked in, there was a small issue with my room (the window wouldn't close properly) so they promptly relocated me to a different room. When I shared with them that it was my birthday the following morning, they upgraded my room and offered me complimentary breakfast at the Aviary as both a birthday treat and an apology for the problem with my first room. Both of the rooms I saw that evening were stunning - the mood lighting and the underfloor heating in the bathrooms were such a lovely touch too. I will definitely revisit in the future. I cannot thank Mary & her team enough for the outstanding hospitality and for making my birthday really special.",5,2022,02,04
111,Loved this Hotel ,"We read the reviews before booking and I have to say, the Hotel and staff really live up to the great reviews that they receive.
The Service in all areas of the Hotel was amazing, nothing is too much trouble.
 I'd like to mention Camila - Reception Mgr and Mary for their attentiveness, they genuinely want you to have a great stay.
The Hotel has beautiful rooms that are spotlessly clean. It's also in a great location.
We will definitely return! ",5,2022,02,02

The staff set up the room for my girlfriends birthday with balloons and prosecco, the room was spotless and very comfortable for our stay. Mary was so beyond helpful and welcoming from check-in to check-out and really made our stay that extra bit special.
I would recommend the Montcalm to anyone looking for a luxury hotel for any occasion (and Mary's assistance!)",5,2022,02,02
111,Great experience!,"BRILLIANT! We stayed here for our 5th year anniversary. I was very impressed by the service. It is beyond what I expected. The security guards were very helpful. The concierge was very top notch and January the manager went above and beyond to make our time there memorable and it was.the rooms are very clean and beautiful bathrooms with a large bathroom.

We unfortunately booked a spa treatment which was a disappointment and we are still waiting for the manager from the Spa to call back. This is not a representation of the hotel as the spa is not part of the hotel. 

I’m very grateful to January and her team. :-)",5,2022,02,01

The pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna were all clean and the manager made sure to make it covid safe by keeping an eye on numbers. I've had such a lovely time...wish I was still there!

The room was decorated with a ‘16’ foil balloon and balloons around the room as well. We had the family suite booked and upon arrival there was a lovely red velvet cake and macaroons waiting for us as well as a selection of fruit juices and bottled soft drinks. 

We used the spa facilities which were lovely although the main pool was a bit cold but that didn’t really bother me. 

In the evening we went to the aviary rooftop bar and restaurant for a quick drink which was also really nice and had a nice view of London. 

All in all we had an amazing stay at the royal Montcalm and all of this was down to the guest experience executive Mary, She made the stay feel extra special and more personal! 

I couldn’t recommend this hotel enough and if you need any extra services for stay, Mary will go above and beyond to make your stay special. 

I look forward to returning

111,Not a five star hotel.,"I had read the reviews on trip advisor which were all really positive and was therefore expecting great things. Unfortunately it did not meet our expectations.
The outside of the hotel was dirty, broken glass, cigarette butts. I know the hotel can not control the street but it does not make a great first impression.
The hotel entrance is dark and it is not clear where the reception is located.
The room was only set up for one person, we had booked for two. There was only one towel, no dressing gowns and randomly the bed was missing two pillows.
We asked reception for the missing items and when they turned up the dressing gowns were disgusting. One was covered in orange make up. The second was exceptionally tatty and frayed.
On a positive note the room was lovely and in a quiet location. 
We had a club room which entitled you to breakfast in the club lounge. The breakfast was very disappointing.
I would not stay at this hotel again.

We booked an igloo for dining at The Aviary and this was amazing. A great meal and fantastic service. I can not fault this. It was our wedding anniversary and they went above and beyond to make the evening special.",3,2022,01,30
111,Quality Hotel,The Montcalm was a very high end hotel. I was visiting on business and the staff were all very attentive and friendly. The hotel itself was really clean and the room was bigger than other London hotels I have stayed at. I didn’t sample the food but they had a nice seating area where you could eat or grab a coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be visiting again.,5,2022,01,30
111,"Great visit, great service",I stayed as a surprise for my girlfriend’s birthday and received exceptional service specifically from January who made sure the room was decorated and she provided us with 10/10 chaperoning. We also wanted to visit the spa on the day we were leaving but couldn’t get a spot before checkout and the staff kindly extended our checkout time to enable to do so,4,2022,01,29
111,"Excellent stay, again","This is the second time we've stayed here and will definitely be coming regularly from now on. Check in was very easy and the Manager on Duty, Camelia, looked after us extremely well. I have nothing but praise for the attention she gave us. The gentleman who showed us to the room was very friendly, gave us some useful information, and made sure that we were completely happy with the room. The room itself was spotlessly clean, had a truly excellent bathroom, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. 
We went down to the bar and had some cocktails which were served promptly and very courteously. We chatted for quite a while with the waiter, had a bit of fun and banter with him, and he took a photo of us.
Breakfast in the morning was excellent. The seating was very comfortable and spacious, the service was excellent, and I would think there is something for everyone to choose from.
I don't often write reviews, and I don't think I have ever written one as positive as this. It is truly deserved, an experience of real luxury in a busy city, with top-class service.  Thoroughly recommended.

111,"Fabulous service, luxurious room, breakfast with a view","Fabulous hotel, service top quality. Stayed overnight for business, and Daniel in particular made sure the stay was special. Thanks for the upgrade which also led to the lovely surprise of breakfast on the 10th floor with lovely views of London. Highly recommend, will visit again.",5,2022,01,28
111,Hotel and dining experience recommended,"With a warm welcome at reception, a beautiful looking hotel from the go when you enter. The staff were very helpful and the rooms set up with different mood lighting and heated bathroom floor was a pleasant but lovely surprise. Complimentary tea and coffee is available in your room which is always appreciated for the morning. The beds were very clean, comfortable and we had a very good nights sleep. No noise and very tranquil setting for an optimal sleep. 

The price for our stay was very reasonable, we understand they spa, pool, steam and sauna facility’s but did not get the chance to use these, however if/ when we return we would most certainly look to use these.

A great bar and restaurant on the top floor, celebrating a friends birthday the atmosphere was great, pods on the roof top meant we could all stay warm and over look the London night life. The food was excellent and beautiful quaintly, again we would look to dine here again after our experience. 

A recommended hotel and dining experience we must say.",5,2022,01,28
111,Lovely 1 night stay at the Montcalm hotel.,"Stayed 9th-10th January for a joint anniversary and birthday weekend away. Service was excellent right the way through. Dropped our bags off at 11am where our bags were taken off of us and stored away. We did this before going to watch a football game (hotel is in an ideal location of a 10 minute walk to Liverpool station). 

A week prior to visiting, I had been in contact with a lady called January Stevens who is the Guest Experience Manager, I informed her of the occasion as to why we was visiting and she kindly added balloons on the bed and rose petals for the special occasion and left a plate of macaroons with a handwritten note.

When we return to the hotel after football around 5pm, we went to the desk to check in where January came out of her office to greet us. I had sent her a very last minute email at 7am on the morning of arrival asking if it was possible to have a room with a bath. When she met us at reception she explained that she had actually upgraded us from The Montcalm Club Lounge which I had originally booked, to the Junior suite which I was not expecting at all. So I think in standard rooms it’s just a shower and baths are only within the suites. She then took us up to our room whilst having a lovely conversation with us. Our bags were already in our room on arrival so we did not need to carry them around. She showed us around the room and explained some of the features around the room like the button panel with the under floor bathroom heating and the do not disturb sign and lightings etc. We was in room 703 and 702 (702 was the extension into the lounge with the extra bathroom with the bath and a lounge area) so we had 2 entrances into the room. 

The only problem we had throughout our stay was as we were getting into bed, making sure the doors were locked, we noticed that room 702 (suite area) would not lock. From the outside you did not need to tap the key to get into the room. You could just walk into the room from the hallway as if it was on a latch. So my boyfriend went to reception and explained it to someone and within 5 / 10 minutes, a man from maintenance came to the room to have a look at the lock and worked out that battery had died. So he just went to get another one to replace it and it worked after that. So everything was resolved very quickly. 

We definitely needed more than 1 night at the hotel as we ran out of time to use pool and go to the rooftop bar but we will definitely be coming back very soon and hopefully for longer this time ☺️. 

Thank you January and to everyone else who made our stay enjoyable.",5,2022,01,27
111,Husband's birthday,This hotel is amazing! Even before we arrived the team were so accommodating and amended my booking last minute as requested. Valentina especially went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service and made my husband's birthday extra special by adding a personal touch to the room.

111,21st birthday celebrations,I emailed the hotel prior to our visit as it was my daughters 21st birthday and wanted it to run smoothly a lovely lady called January arranged all our reservations and arranged balloons for my daughter and met us when we checked in . I couldn’t thank her enough . The aviary was amazing as were the spa treatments . I can’t fault the hotel and have booked again to take my best friend for her 50th .,5,2022,01,26
111,My Daughters Birthday,"I was at work looking for something to do for my daughters birthday and one of my work colleague suggested the Montcalm hotel at Finsbury square and explained it’s a great hotel. He said the spa and massages were very good and relaxing so I booked it for my daughters 19th birthday as I wanted her to experience something new and I wanted it to be a surprise. I called the hotel and spoke to January Stevens, she was very nice on the phone - had great customer service, was very informative and helpful. I explained what I wanted to do and she assisted me in doing it. I got a lovely big suite which was very clean! The bathroom was to die for - very spacious. January and her team sorted out the room decorations for me, the room was decorated with rose petals, “happy birthday” balloons, a cake, a bottle of rose and some chocolates. It was very nice! 

My daughter didn’t expect it and she loved it, the room was exactly how I wanted it to be, they did a great job. Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming, we went to check in and during the process January offered us a drink and told us our room will be ready shortly. I’d like to emphasise on the fact that the customer service was on point from start to finish; in the spa, in the restaurant and at breakfast. We loved it all and wish we could’ve stayed longer, we will definitely be returning. I have recommended this hotel to my friends and told them all about January’s amazing customer service and her amazing staff. Thank you again to all at The Montcalm Royal London House for such a beautiful weekend for my daughter’s birthday. Keep it up! We’d all give them 10/10, they deserve it.",5,2022,01,24
111,Birthday night away,"We recently visited on Saturday 22nd January, however my experience with the hotel started the week prior. I’d been in conversation with Mary Guest Experience Executive whom helped me plan my stay and arranged a lovely birthday surprise  for my partner. The bed was decorated with balloons and rose petals and we had a bottle of Prosecco chilled on arrival.
Mary ensured our stay was the best and it really was. 
On arrival check In was super easy and fast and the receptionist ensured we had all the info we needed. 
The bed was so comfortable I could sleep in it for hours. The room was large and roomy one of the biggest I’d stayed in, in london. 
Breakfast in the Avairy was a lovely way to start our Sunday beautiful views and a lovely selection of food. 
Overall we had a fantastic stay thanks to all the staff and Ofcourse Mary 
We can’t wait to come back for another visit.
Thank you all",5,2022,01,24
111,Hotel stay,"The staff at Montcalm Royal House Hotel just couldn't do enough for us. The bar staff in particular were fantastic,  upgrading our bar booking to a pod experience.

111,Romantic weekend break,"Our stay at the hotel was fantastic, from the moment we got there right to the end. All staff were polite and helpful, but our massive appreciation goes to January, for her fantastic service and efforts.",5,2022,01,23
111,"Incredible people, kind service","I visited on New Years Day with a close friend and decided to stay an extra night because the staff made us feel so welcome. Although a few elements of our room were not available, we were upgraded for no extra cost and every need taken care of. Daniel the concierge was amazing, from restaurant recommendations to seeing to it personally that we were able to book the spa, he was an absolute star - Thank you Daniel!!",5,2022,01,23
111,Amazing Staff & Great Location!,"Stayed here for 2 nights towards the end of January. Initially had a problem with our room, but the staff member Daniel and the manager Camelia especially were amazing in dealing with our issue and making sure we had a great stay. The rooms are incredibly spacious with massive TVs, the bathrooms have undertile heating which is perfect for the cold winter. The location is ideal if you want to have a night out around Old Street/Shoreditch/Liverpool Street/Moorgate, we recommend dinner at Dishoom followed by drinks at Boxpark!

The buffet breakfast at the hotel also hits the spot, and the staff there are also welcoming to any additional requests.

All in all, a big thank you staff at the hotel for making our stay!",5,2022,01,23
111,Montcalm at Royal London House,"Lovely hotel, really striking from the outside. We were given a room upgrade to a huge room. Fabulous view, super bed and lovely Elemis toiletries. 
The only comment I would make is that the room was freezing. If I had been by myself I wouldn’t have been able to work out the control panel to turn it up but fortunately my partner could. 
Valentina on reception was exceptionally helpful and attentive and made check-in and check-out speedy and efficient. 
Really good value for money.",4,2022,01,23
111,Amazing!!!,"Booked the hotel for 2 nights for my girlfriends 25th birthday and it was amazing. The room was clean and tidy and the facilities were amazing. The only thing I would say is that our room was located near a ventilation system outside our window and for a light sleeper, it did keep me up. A big shout out to Mary, who decorated the bed with rose petals and balloons, as well as a lovely card written and macarons left! Amazing service overall and will definitely be back regularly!",4,2022,01,21
111,Treated very well,"We chose to stay at the Montcalm for my girlfriends birthday and Mary and the team treated us very well. They made a conscious effort to go above and beyond to make our experience special.

111,Excellent stay,"Upon arrival i was greeted by Mary Philippiah, who was absolutely fantastic in welcoming me to the hotel and showing me to my room. I booked for a birthday/anniversary trip, and the room was decorated with rose petals and balloons, and a tray of macaroons- complimentary- which was a lovely touch. Mary, the guest experience executive was amazing and made our stay just that little bit better. Our room had a beautiful view of Finsbury Square and the London skyline, was spacious and had every amenity one would need. The staff were very helpful, and even brought bottles of water and extra pillows up to our room at midnight! We visited the Aviary bar and had a few drinks which had a lovely roof terrace and excellent service. The hotel pool & spa was also a great experience. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning- i wouldn’t hesitate to recommend The Montcalm Royal London House to anyone thinking about booking. Thank you!",5,2022,01,20

111,Staff training and services needed,"So disappointed. I’m an NHS nurse, and my husband and I booked a night at this hotel as a nice Boxing Day treat for me after I had finished working my shifts over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. We were obviously very aware about Covid restrictions and staff shortages. So I contacted the hotel a week before to ask if the pool and spa would be affected. We were told over the phone that it was open but they would contact me if they were any changes. On Christmas Eve I received an email stating that the pool was open but we would need to book a slot by calling the spa directly on a number provided.

We tried calling the number several times over the next couple of days but no one would answer. It would just ring and ring. It was Christmas eve, so understandable. But why ask people to call a number if you’re not going to to have anyone answer? I also emailed the hotel but no reply. On the day of our stay I managed to get through to an answer machine and left a message saying we wanted to use the spa between 3-5pm. But received no confirmation.

Check in was 2pm and we arrived around 2:30pm and had to queue to check in, only to be told that our room wasn’t ready yet. We said that’s fine as we need to book a slot at the spa. Got down to the spa and the receptionist there tells us that the slots for the spa were only 30 mins a day! So disappointing. Obviously not completely the hotels fault due to Covid. But why did we only find this out when we are literally at the spa? We also asked why an email was sent with a number that no one answered but the receptionist just said that they had been closed over Christmas. But why send the email given all these information if you can’t book?

We also had to push the receptionist to book another slot for the following morning. She kept saying that we should come back tomorrow to book! I thought this was really unprofessional. What if the slot we want is gone? We were only staying for one night! 

When we did eventually get our first 30 min spa slot there was no real welcome or explanation as to what was what. Just felt like the receptionist didn’t want to be there. Her english wasn’t great either so it was difficult to communicate. So we head in and spend some time in the pool. Quite a small pool, with a jacuzzi at one end. Pretty naff to be honest. Went to look for the steam room and sauna and then are told by the receptionist when I ask, that they are closed! Ok, we’ll just spend our whole 30 minutes in the pool then. No clock in the spa though so just have to guesstimate it!

To be honest we were just laughing by that point as to how badly run the whole place seemed.

The room itself was ok, some cracks on the bathroom tiles, but ok. Some little things added to our dismay at the place though. Firstly, the TV kept displaying a message saying something wasn’t working, then the remote would seem to lock and not work. Either that, or the batteries were running out. Luckily my husband had brought his laptop and hdmi cable so he hooked that up to watch Netflix. But we realised that we weren’t given the wi-fi password. Usually when we stay at a hotel this is given at check in, or at least stated on the welcome letter in the room. But there was nothing. No problem, we’d just call reception and ask. It’s around 7-8pm by this point and it’s like deja-vu trying to call the spa all over again. No answer. Also the phone in the room is a cordless thing but as soon as you pick it up it would go dead. So we had to use it on speaker. Now this is not an exaggeration but that phone must have been ringing 5 mins the first time and 15-20 mins the second time. Still no answer. In the end my husband gave up and decided to head down to reception to ask for the wi-fi password. When he got down there was still a queue. 

The rest of the stay was just us noticing more and more things wrong with the place. 

Here’s some highlights:
- Terrible signposting. Poor signage or directions to say where things are. Or where you currently are.
- No clear indication on how to get to 10th floor (restaurant) only one set of lifts go there.
- Corridors were so dark – it was hard for us to see where to place key card to get into room
- Using the stairs – unless you really look, no clear sign what floor you are on
- Breakfast was not worth the money. Minimal selection. Just go out and buy something there’s plenty of options nearby. 
- Reception was always very chaotic and noisy felt like I was in queue at the post office. No online check-in or check-out which would solve a lot of issues
- Alcohol sanitiser machine not filled so unable to use
- Although there were some very diligent and hard working staff, unfortunately they were rare. Sadly, in my experience this seems the norm for a lot of London hotels we have tried. A lot of staff we encountered looked miserable and like they would rather be somewhere else. Better training and pay would work wonders.

Considering this is a 5 star hotel we were surprised how badly things were running. Ok it was Christmas, Covid yes we get that and expect some issues and understand. But there were so many basic things which are so easy to get right and they failed on all counts. So disappointed.",1,2022,01,17
111,"Amazing hotel, perfect for a special occasion!!","We booked this hotel as a family of 7 for a special birthday celebration and was so glad we did!! We had 3 rooms, all of which were of a very high standard with super comfy beds and great black out curtains. A complimentary bottle of prosecco and some truffles had been placed in one of our rooms which was a lovely touch. The club lounge was the perfect place to relax and have a couple of drinks (free wine/beers/shorts with a wide selection available) before heading up for the Aviary restaurant for our evening meal. Some music would  have been a nice touch in the club lounge but this is only a small recommendation. Mary was superb, showing us to our rooms after check in and also speaking to us all upon departure. She is a credit and an asset to the hotel.",5,2022,01,17
111,30th Birthday Celebrations,"Amazing 2 night stay at The Montcalm Royal London House Hotel. Stayed here for my wife’s 30th Birthday and cannot fault the hotel. Quick check-in, taken to our lovely clean Club room. Breakfast in The Aviary was fantastic.

111,A beautiful venue with above and beyond service.,"We booked with the Montcalm for a special occasion, and couldn't have been more pleased with our experience. The building itself has a majestic exterior and is beautiful inside. It is tastefully decorated, clean, and tidy throughout. There is a sophisticated atmosphere and ambiance to the hotel, but it was also calm and quiet where it mattered. The rooms are clean, cozy, and warm, and the beds are comfortable. Where our room was situated, we had a partial view of the skyline, which lit up beautifully at night.

Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant couldn't have been a nicer atmosphere, and the views of the surrounding area made us reluctant to leave after we'd finished our meal. I do recommend booking for any of the hotel bars and restaurants early, as they all seemed to be very popular.

The staff were exemplary in their customer service. Every member of staff we encountered was polite, helpful, and genuinely friendly. We were assisted at check-in by Mary, who, upon learning we were there for a special occasion, went the extra mile and ensured that we were well taken care of. The gesture was thoughtful and very much appreciated. Mary continued to go above and beyond with her customer service for the remainder of our stay. The hotel was all we had wanted and more, but it was the staff who made our stay truly memorable.",5,2022,01,16

111,Amazing stay!,"We had an amazing stay at Montcalm Royal London hotel. From the moment we entered we were greeted by lovely staff who were very helpful and welcoming. We were showed to our room by Mary who was extremely helpful and made sure everything was okay throughout the whole of our stay. I mentioned in the booking notes that it was my partners birthday and we were greeted by balloons on the bed which was a lovely surprise and I am very grateful for the effort put in to make it so special. The room was stunning, as was the rest of the hotel. The mood lighting and touch-screen controls were such a lovely addition and the whole room was spotless! Our only fault was there was lump in the middle of the bed between the two mattresses and that we couldn’t find the times for breakfast anywhere in the room or on the website. Apart from those 2 minor flaws our stay is up there with one of the best hotels we have ever been to and everything about it was amazing. Before leaving, Mary came back out to say goodbye and make sure we had a good time - which we thought was a lovely touch!",5,2022,01,15
111,The best!,"Such an amazing hotel, amazing stuff and amazing stay. Special thanks to the experience manager January, who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.

111,AMAZING PLACE TO STAY,"I stayed here for an anniversary at the weekend and it was an amazing experience. We were looked after and really made to feel special and valued as a customer. 

We were looked after by Mary who was amazing at her job, always smiling and nothing was too much trouble. I put in some requests for the room to have certain things and this was sorted for me with no issues. (Which gave me big brownie points with the other half!)

The hotel is in a great location, with a fantastic Spa and a must visit rooftop bar. 

I would not hesitate to return and recommend this hotel to friends and family. 

Thank you Mary and everyone at the hotel for an amazing weekend.",5,2022,01,12

111,Such a pleasant stay,"Another lovely relaxing stay. We stayed from 22nd December to 25th December in a junior suite. From checking in nothing was too much for the staff. Jan (lovely staff member) welcomed us and took our bags to our room explained everything to us. 

Comfy bed, powerful shower and nice hot water. Comfy sofa too in the lounge area. 

Requested some champage for my partner birthday and two glasses was delivered to the room so kind. With some fruits. I also asked the hotel if they could keep his birthday gift and they kindly did.

We had a few hiccups with our room with temperature and after calling downstairs they sent someone straight away and help as much as possible to make sure its fixed and we was ok. Even after a while they rang to check into which was a nice touch so thank you to the maintanence team. 

Love the aviary especially for breakfast and going outside for a morning fresh air on the roof top is absolutely lovely. 

We cant thank the staff enough at this hotel as nothing is any trouble from ordering our taxi, getting us a umbrella, giving us a towel when we got soaked etc - thank you to everyone! 

Christmas decor was beautiful. Especially having mulled wined served at reception was a lovely touch.

Planning our next trip already!",5,2022,01,11
111,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON🤩🤩,"We had the greatest time at the Montcalm, January was a very great host and even upgraded our room for us. The staff are very welcoming and the whole hotel is just 1st class. They gave both me and my girlfriend such a warm luxurious experience. The food was absolutely amazing and although we were late to the breakfast we were still offered what was left (which was a lot) and only charged us for one person because we didn’t leave without paying. We were told there were no bath robes left, we had left the hotel to go out, when we got back we had noticed that some had been delivered. 

We thank you for our stay. & we will be back soon.

111,Best night stay,"This hotel is just amazing couldn’t fault the amazing staff, the highest quality rooms fully equipped and then the facilities were second to none with a amazing rooftop bar, can’t wait to come back. 

The view from our room was just amazing opening the blinds to all the London sky scrapers couldn’t get much better.

If your staying in London for a night or the weekend defiantly put this hotel first it’s brilliant and close to everything.

111,Superb Stay,"This stay was everything that we could have hoped for. The room was comfortable, modern and the bed luxurious. Our host Mary Philippiah was first class introducing us to our room and being on hand at any point during our stay. We had to make a last minute request to have our baby with us in the room and all of the staff went above and beyond to make that happen making us feel completely welcomed and looked after. We will definitely be staying at the Montcalm again and would highly recommend. Thank you.",5,2022,01,10
111,10/10 experience..,"We couldn’t have asked for a better first experience at Montcalm. We had special requests for a birthday and all of our expectations were met with extra measures. 

The staff were very polite and the attention to detail was immaculate. 

The hotel room itself was amazing, clean and was of a high standard. 

We will definitely be visiting again soon.",5,2022,01,09
111,"Lovely hotel with fantastic, friendly staff","My partner and I have just returned from an overnight stay here and we were very impressed with both the facilities and especially the attentiveness of the staff. Check in was quick and well organised and when we got to our room it was lovely to see they had decorated it with birthday balloons, card and cakes. This was a lovely,  extra special touch which added to enjoyment of the stay. This was quickly followed by a phone call from reception to check we were settled in okay. The room itself although not huge (are they ever in London?) was extremely comfortable and well appointed and the under floor heating in the bathroom was a treat for a cold January day! On our departure, check out was easy and the receptionist called through the manager who wanted to confirm we had had a pleasant stay, which again added to overall impression of concern for our happiness with the hotel. All in all, a great hotel, conveniently located and above all, fantastic staff. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,01,08
111,Fantastic value for money,"We selected the hotel because we wanted a quality hotel in the City of London. We stayed in a Montcalm Club Double Room and it was a spacious well appointed room. The guest service at the hotel is exceptional.

The location is just a short walk from Moorgate tube station which has four line to choose from. We found the Circle Line was perfect for all the places we visited during our stay.",5,2022,01,08
111,Beautiful,"Took my partner here for his birthday, absolute beautiful hotel, clean, nice staff, pool area excellent although sauna & steam room was closed due to covid, we had one of the best rooms, breakfast was amazing & spoilt for choice, location good- overall stay excellent & so looking forward to going back!
Best London spa stay",5,2022,01,08
111,Christmas present,We had an absolutely amazing time in this hotel. Valentina on reception was so helpful and made our stay extra special. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a central London location with fabulous staff and service. We will be back.,5,2022,01,07
111,An excellent Birthday stay,"We stayed for two nights at the the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel to coincide with my partners birthday. We received an upgrade on our room and and we had a lovely room on the 1st floor. For both days we had excellent breakfasts in the Aviary Restaurant/ Bar which has great views over the City of London. On my partners birthday, a bottle of wine and some macaroons where brought to our room along with a Birthday wish. A big thank you to Mary and all the staff at the Hotel for making our stay and my partners birthday so memorable.",5,2022,01,04
111,A SPECIAL NIGHT,"I booked a one-night stay in Montcalm Royal London House for our engagement night. January nicely made a phone call on the day before our stay.  She kindly offered to set up the room during our dinner at Aviary. Her help makes me feel less stressed during the night

The staff is also friendly and nice. They upgrade our room type and prepared the champion when we get back to the room. 

I am so happy to choose this hotel for a special night. I will come back in the future.",5,2022,01,03
111,Best hotel stay I have ever experienced,"I want to give a big thanks to Mary who gave me and my my friend the best hotel experience. She was so nice and made the trip very special. Also, all the staff were so nice and helpful.
I definitely recommend you visit this hotel!",5,2022,01,03
111,Top Notch Guest Experience!,"We stayed at the RLH over the xmas period for a special occasion and got an amazing offer on a junior suite. On arrival we were met at the check in by the friendly staff and took the elevator to our room which did not disappoint. The staff had gone way above and beyond, laying the most beautiful petals across the bed and in the corner waiting for us was a plate of the most delicious macaroons and a lovely bottle of red wine. A great first impression for the well run hotel. 

The room - 

Our room was immaculate and clean with a very comfy bed, large tv and bathroom. The tv was easy to use and had all the sky channels including all the familiar apps. The lighting system was also fun and easy to use with different coloured mood lighting and night lighting. Included on the bathroom lighting panel was underfloor heating which was a blessing on the beautiful but potentially cold bathroom floor and the bathroom also had a massive shower head!! 

The Staff - 

throughout the staff were hugely helpful and again, went above and beyond in most areas. At times we would phone up the concierge for more water/coffee or a bucket of ice which was delivered promptly and without fuss. 

The Pool - 

We swam in the pool on both days which we had to book using the easy online service. It was a relaxing and enjoyable experience due to having to book as the slots meant it never got crowded. A beautiful area and we are going to try the spa next time!!

Location - 

This was a foodie stay for us and we were never more than 30 minutes travel to our venues. The station is an easy walk and there are plenty of convenience stores and takeaways in the area if needed. The area is also one of the quieter but nicer areas in central London and felt safe and secure. 

All in all a great experience all round and we wouldn't hesitate to go back!!",5,2022,01,03
111,Amazing proposal!!,"I had planned a ""Sister spa weekend"" for my sister and I. Her boyfriend had told me he was planning to propose before the year ended (2021)  but as my sister is very inquisitive, we wanted her to be surprised of course. I told him about the spa weekend and said she would never guess a proposal taking place. 

The plan was for us to check in and chill,  go out for dinner while the room gets set up for the proposal  and then have dinner with family afterwards. 

The staff were simply amazing!! January and Mary really made sure everything was perfect!!! I was so stressed but they were so lovely and extremely helpful. They made everything happen so smoothly. Upgraded the room, gave a bottle of champagne and some macaroons in the room. 

One of the staff members even helped record the proposal as we only hired a photographer. 

I can't thank them enough. It could have gone pear shaped but if the staff were not on the ball , it could have all gone terribly wrong. 

Thanks so much to the wonderful staff at Montcalm Royal  London House. Such a lovely hotel with great staff. 

I highly recommend it . Great food, great spa, decor, ambiance and staff.",5,2022,01,02
111,Amazing hotel!!!,"I was planning a proposal whilst staying at this hotel and not only was it a special occasion, but without me even asking, they offered to decorate my room, complimentary Prosecco, upgraded my room and really accommodating.

The management was fantastic and the staff were lovely and very friendly.

Can’t express how much they made this special occasion even more special ! 

Very much recommended and will be staying here again in the near future.",5,2022,01,02
111,Excellent atmosphere/facilities and great service,"I had a wonderful stay for my birthday. My room was decorated in advanced and I was treated to a small chocolate gift and a card wishing me a happy birthday which was lovely. The spa and jacuzzi were wonderful, just a shame that due to covid restrictions you have to book a 30 min time slot. Nevertheless it was a great stay and I received excellent service from friendly staff. I will be going again. Thank you!",5,2022,01,01
111,"Lovely hotel but know what you've booked and be weary of the ""Club room"" package.","A night away during the xmas holidays - booked the night before, on hotels.com

Whilst booking the room, I called up the hotel to ask about the swimming (you need to book a slot) and the 'Club Room' rate.  The lady explained that for the extra cost, we get access to the Club Lounger and continental breakfast included.  Sounds like a deal,

Upon arrival at the reception, we were told that the Club Lounge is only in operation Thurs to Sun,  and we arrived on a Tuesday!   Nowhere on the website is this mentioned.

We also had to 'fight' with reception the next morning to get the breakfast that was included as part of our rate - as 2 members of staff told us that it wasn't included for us.  We got it in the end, but what a shame that the hotel had no idea what our booking contained.  Don't be fobbed off.

This small glitch didn't upset us too much from what was a lovely bedroom, with a fab view over the square.   extra towels and dressing gowns provided for us to use the small pool in the basement, which was hot and just perfect (remember to book your slot!)

We asked for foam pillows - what a mistake! - 2 lumps of foam in a pillowcase.  possibly the most uncomfortable synthetic pillows we've ever seen.

Continental breakfast was lovely - and the hotel staff friendly.

Nice break, but not sure we'd return.",4,2022,01,01
111,Me Simpson,"Great hotel Deepak and he’s staff couldn’t do enough to make your stay as pleasurable as possible . The room are spacious and well planned out.
This is a hotel that I would highly recommend for a great stay in London",5,2022,01,01
111,A totally satisfying stay,"Lovely welcome from Mary after a significant check-in queue for our four night stay.

6th floor room overlooking the square was quite spacious with an excellent bathroom and an extremely comfortable bed.

Requests to the front desk were taken care of quickly and all staff encountered were excellent.

Breakfast was good with reasonable selection and again, good service levels.

The Aviary bar is a cool space which we enjoyed on a few evenings.

Perfectly situated for Moorgate which will get you anywhere in London and an easy walk to the Barbican where we were seeing a concert.

At 45 and 59 we were amongst the older patrons .. a very young vibe.

Highly recommended and will definitely revisit.

4.5/5.0",4,2022,01,01
111,Perfect Birthday Stay,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. Our visit was made extra special by January and Mary who made sure there was some birthday treats in our room upon arrival. The room was well equipped with a hairdryer, slippers, bathroom products and a good selection of teas and coffees. The cleanliness was outstanding of both the room and the whole hotel, not a single spec of dirt to be found anywhere. One of my favourite parts of the room was the underfloor heating in the bathroom as well as the easy to use heating system for the room. The location of the hotel is out of the way of most things but our view out to the square in front of the hotel and the quality of the stay made up for that. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,12,31
111,My Pre Birthday Overnight Stay,"If there is one hotel I will happily return back to over and over again. It will certainly be The Montcalm Hotel at Royal London House. 

The hospitality was exceptional from the minute my sister and I walked in. Mary, Guest Executive, accommodated my request to make a fuss of me for my birthday.

And I can assure you in all the times I have stayed in hotels on my birthday. No other hotel has exceeded my expectations except The Montcalm Hotel - Royal London House.

My overnight stay at the hotel was an amazing stay made with such great gesture by upgrading my room for free. Surprised by such sweet balloons on the bed, and macaroons left on the table.

Mary and her staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay with my sister. Was one of exceptional memories. 

All that’s left to say I WILL be coming back.",5,2021,12,31
111,Great getaway ,"Great getaway, spa experience was fantastic die to the staff. All working hard and really care about making your experience great. Big shout out to Somona, Gabrielie and Marlena

Also a big thank you to the manager Iryauniese (think I've said that right) personally checked us in and took us to our room for a surprise to celebrate a special occasion. Hotel was immaculate, breakfast was good.. Although we went closer to 10 so things weren't as warm or as fresh, but staff did make fresh for us.

Thank you again will return for sure",5,2021,12,30
111,Great stay at the Montcalm,"Our stay at the Montcalm was great, the staff were lovely and helpful and they even decorated our room with birthday balloons for my birthday .
Great location and near everything we had planned to visit",5,2021,12,30
111,"Mixed feelings, Average..","I will start with the positive: it is a good value for money hotel, nice bathroom and Sky Tv, but I would not rate this as one of the top 25 hotels in London. Maybe we got unlucky with the room on the 1st floor (with no view) or the view into backyard and woken up by bin collectors at the silly hour in the morning on 27th Dec: they were fighting with the bins for 10 mins or so. We've missed our breakfast too. 
Do not disturb sign was on, but hotel staff was still knocking on the door 40 mins before checkout time. Mini bar was empty.",3,2021,12,29
111,"Conveniently located, nice swimming pool","Stayed for one night. Check-in took nearly 40 mins, there was a massive queue, though they didn’t appear to be short staffed.
It’s a nice hotel, right by all the bars and restaurants in Shoreditch. The staff were friendly but could do with more training; we found they struggled with answering basic queries.
The room was a good size, lovely bathroom and rainfall shower. We made use of the swimming pool too, which was refreshing. It’s a shame we could only book a 30 min slot, but I suppose we have to blame COVID for that. 
Breakfast was delicious, if a bit pricey.",4,2021,12,28
111,"Fantastic hotel and very helpful, friendly staff - Will be staying again!","The room was a good size, very seasonably priced and in a prime location; within a short walking distance to both Liverpool St and Moorgate station. 
Booked for a short stay in London for my partner's birthday and the staff were incredible. I had asked them at the time of the booking if they could make it special for her and they did not disappoint. They had sprinkled rose petals on the bed as well as birthday balloons, champagne and a personalised card wishing her a happy birthday. 
Great facilities too, including a spa and the Aviary restaurant located on the 9th floor.
Overall an excellent stay and would highly recommend.

- James",5,2021,12,28
111,Excellent Service,"Very good customer service by January, made a effort with communication and set up room as i wanted for my honeymoon! Clean rooms with free water! Mini fridge and large tv in the montcalm club rooms very good feature",5,2021,12,28
111,Lovely hotel in the City of London,"We stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House for a night in December and we had a lovely time.

The most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in! Room was nice - very modern, bathroom had underfloor heating and room was a good size. Staff were super friendly and efficient. Location and view are on point - I think you'd struggle to beat this view in London!

We would have preferred a bath to a shower but as the hotel is very modern, most rooms have showers. Rooftop restaurant is cool with incredible views and a varied menu.

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anybody looking for a luxury overnight stay in London. Easy to reach by train, tube, taxi or walking.",4,2021,12,28
111,"Mr n Mrs Ariton
Superb","Just came back home from spending the best time in The Montcalm Royal London House Hotel. Outstanding! Everything about this hotel is pure happiness. So lucky we selected this hotel. We will definitely come back and recommend to everyone. Staff were excellent from the minute we stepped through the door, all of them,  without exception. 
Camelia is a gem of amazing hospitality. 100 percent of professionalism! Excellent manageress.
Beautiful rooms, cosy rooftop, heated pods and  food was so delicious. We did not want to leave. 
By coming back home, we took with us such a great feeling that we been looked after, rested and very happy.",5,2021,12,27
111,Christmas stay,"Very nice hotel, with nice rooms, the staff especially was very helpful and welcoming. Definitely a place to stay when in London. Special thanks to Adriana in the reception for help with all transportation, and Hussam working at the aviary for very good service.",5,2021,12,26
111,The perfect base for a London City break.,We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a 50th birthday celebration. Check in was fast and efficient and upon entry into our room we were greeted with some lovely birthday  balloons. Very comfortable bed and large shower were ideal. Although a little bit away from the hustle and bustle of the West End this suited us as we would walk pretty much everywhere. 15 minutes to St Pauls and about the same to the Tower of London. We would certinly stay here again as nothing was too much for all of the staff members that we spoke to.,5,2021,12,26
111,Wonderful Christmas Getaway!,"My boyfriend and I visited a week before Christmas for my 18th birthday. The hotel was so beautiful and festive and the staff did everything to accommodate our needs, from booking a slot in the relaxing spa to decorating our bed with birthday balloons! Mary was especially kind and attentive, even making sure to wait for us to say goodbye and wish a merry Christmas. All in all it was a lovely stay and we’ll be visiting again next year.",5,2021,12,24
111,Ideal location for a weekend break,"I really do like the Montcalm chain - the Royal Hotel is the perfect venue for a weekend break with the girlfriend - The rooms are spacious, clean, modern & the bed is so comfortable - but the small thing matter - the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a dream!
We had a meal at the Aviary - the terraced bar/restaurant - the food was fantastic - I have been disappointed with a number of London restaurants recently - so this was a welcome change.- I will certainly return!
A special thank you to Mary at the the front desk - she made out stay most welcome",5,2021,12,24
111,Mr Bullen,"I stayed at the Montcalm hotel for a mini getaway for my girlfriends birthday.  
I have to say we had the most amazing experience, from the moment we entered the door to the moment we checked out.  The staff were very friendly, the interior and state of our room was spotless, the spa was relaxing and the food was also very nice.

Also, a special thank you to January Stevens for surprising us by upgrading our room free of charge as a special gesture for my girlfriend and for her customer service overall.",5,2021,12,23
111,Amazing solo birthday trip 10/10 experience,"Just come back from a solo birthday trip at this hotel and I had an amazing time. The staff could not do enough to take care of me. Special mention to Mary who went over and beyond to decorate my room with balloons and was there every step of the way to ensure I was having a good time. I have stayed at this hotel before and always keep coming back. Great rooms, good amenities, excellent location, overall highly recommended",5,2021,12,23
111,Personal touch to a welcome and stay,"Excellent Service. Camelia made sure requests were met and everything went like clockwork. She greeted us at the door and farewell at reception. She kept our luggage safe whilst we went out. Offered drinks whilst we waited. Gave advice and direct details to contact her. It didn't feel like staying at a hotel but a close family/friend. The hotel is impressive, especially when you look at it from outside (the whole building it's within). Thank you",5,2021,12,22
111,An amazing stay!,"My girlfriend and I decided to take a trip away to visit london staying at the Montcalm. We were greeted on arrival with great hospitality and friendly faces. After a quick and fairly easy check in, we headed to our room. The hotel had given us a complimentary upgrade due to our trip being an anniversary, which we much appreciated. 

Our room was stunning, especially the bathroom, with a petal made bed, along with a lovely greeting card and some little treats. Due to Covid, spa use was only available through booking, which was made very clear to us, and very quick and easy to do. We booked the spa on our walk up to the room. 

We used the pool twice during our stay along with the steam room. The pool is not huge but it has a nice feel about it with the Versace logo printed on the wall. We didn’t manage to go to the gym but we took a look and it looked fairly equipped. 

The roof top bar was amazing. Everything we imagined plus more. The views were stunning along with the chill Ibiza tunes. The only downside is that the drinks took ages to arrive, I don’t think this was the waitresses fault, but more the bartender. There was a solo bartender who I think was struggling to handle the capacity of orders. It’s a shame that the roof terrace closed at 10, because we were rather hoping to stay out a little longer, and they really weren’t happy with us still being outside even minutes after ten, despite the private bubbles still being served and with no curfew. 

We really enjoyed our stay and have already planned a trip back, thanks to Mary the manager at reception who helped to make our trip really feel unique and special.",5,2021,12,22
111,Lovely stay,"I was lucky enough to have customer experience exec Mary look after us for our stay, she went above and beyond to accommodate us, adding some extra touches to the room to make it even more special for our anniversary. Loved our stay and wish I'd gone to the spa - next time for sure!!",5,2021,12,22
111,Lovely stay made by Mary (concierge team),"I booked the hotel through booking.com for my girlfriends birthday. I spoke to Mary prior to staying the night at the hotel to organise a surprise. Everything was first class from the food, drink and experience she gave us. I will 100% be coming back to this hotel! 
Amazing night and day at the hotel.",5,2021,12,22
111,Amazing,"We had an amazing time here for my 21st birthday! The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and the staff members are fantastic! My compliments especially go to Kaloyan from the reception, he is a lovely man and he made our stay here extra special, thank you so much!! I will certainly be returning here and I cannot wait for my next visit.",5,2021,12,21
111,Room,"We booked a night in January 2021 but due to COVID it was cancelled we got a email saying we had a credit for the night, we came in December for a different reason and Kaloyan was very helpful he sorted us right out and upgraded us also, thank you very much Kaloyan",5,2021,12,21
111,Amazing!!,"We absolutely loved our stay at Montcalm Royal London House. We found our stay relaxing and luxurious. Hamid especially was absolutely brilliant, making us feel comfortable and being so helpful with our luggage and answering any questions we had.

111,Amazing Hotel with an amazing and outstanding manager called January,The hotel is amazing and the best thing about it all is the excellent customer services. The manager called January is an amazing person and knows her job. She is so professional and  is the best manager i have ever seen in any hotel we have been to in the world. We travel a lot and have been to many hotels but this lady is outstanding in her customer service skills. She is a good listener and very quick to resolve any issues you might be facing and also make her guest feel very welcomed. The hotel is close to the tube station and has a good facilities on site that you will not need to go out of the hotel if you want a good place to relax. The sky bar is amazing and a good place to spend a nice evening with good city views. The spa is very relaxing after a long day out. Thanks January for making our stay a memorable one and see you soon.,5,2021,12,20
111,What an amazing stay,"We stay at the Mont Calm as I was planning to propose to my girlfriend that weekend.

I asked for help upon arriving and they were amazing!

Mary and January were really attentive, they booked us for the restaurant, arranged our room, decorated everything with rose petals.. we even got a complimentary bottled of Prosecco and chocolates.

They made the whole experience smooth. We even got to have a chat with them before we left, they were so nice. 

The facilities itself were also very nice, the bed was comfy, the shower was nice, the spa, everything.",5,2021,12,20
111,Fantastic service,"Booked last minute from a change of plans and so pleased we did! The team were excellent and responded positively and efficiently to every request, even gifting us with a bottle of wine and chocolate truffles for my partner's birthday. The room was big and comfortable, all wonderful amenities and an excellent location. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2021,12,19
111,Exceptional Service,"Attended Montcalm royal London for 3 days to celebrate me and my girlfriend anniversary, the whole purpose of staying there was to propose, and oh my, did I choose the right hotel!! 

The staff specifically January and Mary went beyond any expectations, the pure friendliness and care they greeted me with was great. Both January and Mary made sure that my stay was comfortable and memorable for me and my girl. They upgraded and decorated my room to a beautiful standard and literally set the scene for a romantic proposal. Not only did they make it their mission to decorate but they continually checked that everything was ok for me and everything was taken care of free off charge. 

Long story short she said Yes, and I can’t thank January and Mary enough for making my stay and experience at Montcalm phenomenal. 

Additionally thank you to Daniel who was very welcoming and gave me great advice. 

Thank you both…. This hotel  truly felt like home for the few days and the staff all made the experience a lot better. 

Definitely recommend.",5,2021,12,19
111,Daniel Concierge,"Beautiful hotel, great location - just wanted to say a massive thank you to Daniel the Concierge, 4th time we've stayed and each time he goes above and beyond our expectations! Best Concierge in London, and such a lovely person. Kind Regards, C & I Gardner",5,2021,12,18

111,THE BEST HOTEL,"Honestly couldn’t fault this hotel at all, I took my boyfriend here for his birthday when I luckily came across this hotel on wowcher and I was impressed from the start. Absolutely beautiful hotel, couldn’t believe when the cab pulled up outside it that we weee staying here! The contact with the staff to arrange something extra special for my partner was just amazing, Mary is an absolute asset and greeted us on our arrival to take us to our upgraded room which was out of this world! We had a half hour slot in the jacuzzi and also enjoyed a drink in the rooftop bar Aviary, with the most incredible views, before heading to Covent Garden for dinner and then enjoyed a beautiful breakfast here the following morning. The staff at Montcalm are an absolute credit to the hotel and literally couldn’t do enough for us, from checking in to checking out, everything was amazing! We have already talked about coming back asap! Loved every single minute here. Thank you so much!",5,2021,12,15
111,Not a 5 star experience or feeling,"Visited with my girlfriend, and was looking forward to a romantic stay, at an exclusive 5 star hotel. We werent overwhelmed by any means, although our stay was alright. Nothing was really spectacular. The hotel felt more like a ""small"" boutique hotel. 

The room was quite big, and had the expected features. We werent happy with the condition of the room. Everything looked a bit old, paint was scraped off several places, cabinet doors didnt close properly, carpet had stains and so did the bathroom. Wouldnt say it wasnt clean, but not the nicest condition. 

The Spa was allright. The pool is NOT heated, but luckily the jacuzi was. The steam was was terrible, old and dirty, there was dirt on the floor even though we visited as the first persons in the morning. The spa generally also needed renovation, and sauna was out of order!

The lobby was a little hidden away. The employees were all OK, but no special feeling of being welcome.

Also, the FIRE ALAM went of at 2AM in the Morning!!! Was an error. Gave us the biggest shock of our lives, and we couldnt really sleep afterwards. Nothing was done about this next morning, an apology or a free coffee or something would have been in order! 

We wont come back, there are so many other luxorious hotels in this price range in London.",3,2021,12,15
111,First class service at an economy price!,"Following a recommendation from a friend I chose the Montcalm as a surprise for our anniversary.
The price seemed too cheap to be true and the pictures emphasised my doubts. 
From the moment we walked through the doors to the second we left, the service was exceptional.
Truly treated like the stars of the show and in such a beautiful setting within a more than ideal location. 
We will be staying again, without doubt this time! 
5 ⭐️",5,2021,12,13
111,Excellent,"Had the best weekend for my partners birthday. The hotel upgraded my room and left (happy birthday)balloons in there on arrival for no extra charge. The staff were all excellent, very helpful in every way possible. I want to say a special and massive Thankyou to Daniel Concierge for being a class act during our stay, he was a huge help and made it that extra special. Thankyou once again and I will be back 100% very soon.

111,Highly recommend - fantastic service and hotel,"We loved our stay at the Montcalm. From check in to check out the staff went above and beyond attending to our every need. They were FANTASTIC! The service really made it such a memorable stay. The room and hotel in itself was also wonderful, our room was very spacious and had a great view of Finsbury Square. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was an added bonus! We also really enjoyed the spa and pool facilities. Thank you.",5,2021,12,13
111,Fab stay at The Montcalm Hotel,"Fab stay at The Montcalm Royal London House
Mary and her team went out of their way to make our weekend stay amazing from check-in to check-out. Our view from the 7th floor over London was great , and the welcome package in the room a lovely treat.  The pool and spa was a great place to relax in. We had a drink at the bar, the staff were very friendly. 
Breakfast with a view in The Aviary on the 10th floor was superb.

The reception staff were polite, friendly, welcoming and they treated us like old special friends. The gave all the info needed for the visit and NOTHING was too much trouble. The concierge whipped our bags away, we didn’t have to worry about anything. The rooms were great - clean, well stocked and we wanted for nothing. The staff made sure all our needs were met. The service throughout the stay was perfect. The Hotel Manager ensures every guest has the most amazing experience.  Any wait to return.",5,2021,12,11
111,Birthday!,"I choose  this hotel for my partner's birthday and it was the best choice I did. The room was very clean, good location and the staff very helpful and friendly.

Our guest experience Mary, was so polite, warm and welcoming. She even advised us were to park which I thought was really kind. She also come to see us upon our exist. 

The spa was amazing and not too over crowded. 

The room was beautiful and the room service was amazing. Food was tasty and came really quickly. 

Overall my experience was amazing, the hospitality was amazing and will definitely be returning. 

Mr and Mrs Hoo x",5,2021,12,08
111,Perfect overnight stay!,"From the minute we walked into the hotel we were made to feel so welcome. When checking in we were greeted by the lovely January who knew it was my boyfriends birthday. She showed us to our room where she had set up balloons and a bottle of wine for us to celebrate. She gave us lots a recommendations and even helped us with directions without us having to ask! She really made our stay special and we can’t wait to visit again, thank you January x",5,2021,12,08
111,Great hotel and rooftop bar with friendly staff,"A friend and I stayed here to celebrate my birthday. Staff and facilities here all great and was made extra special by them brining complimentary wine and truffles to the room. The bars, particularly the rooftop bar was fun of an evening and we had lunch and drinks in the igloos the next day up there which was lovely. We just about managed to get a table at the rooftop bar without a reservation Friday night so would definitely recommend booking that and we also booked the igloo dome which was completely booked out on the day. We wanted to use the spa facilities as well and tried to book in advance of our visit however it was already fully booked. We went to their sister hotel at Marble Arch to use the spa there which was nice although I think this spa would have been better as it is newer and slightly bigger. All in all a really nice stay with friendly service and a smile which goes a long way in London. Thank you!!!",4,2021,12,08
111,Excellent stay,We had an excellent stay at the Montcalm. I was proposing to my partner on the trip and January and the experience team were a massive help in making the trip very special. Would recommend to anyone and we will be returning!,5,2021,12,08
111,Lovely stay,"We stayed on Sunday night for a quiet night away. Beautiful hotel and room with an amazing view of the city. We had lunch and cocktails in one of the igloos on the rooftop bar - cosy in December - followed by a visit to the spa. 

Good cooked breakfast in the morning in the Aviary restaurant on the 9th floor. Lovely coffee. 

January in guest services really made our stay special. It felt very personal and balloons and wine were gifted to our room as it was a special stay for my husband and I. 

The hotel is in a nice quiet spot and easy to get to from Euston. Close to a couple of tube options - Moorgate and Liverpool St.

Would recommend. Thank you!",5,2021,12,07
111,Theatre Weekend,"Another fantastic stay at the Montcalm - this time a personal visit rather than a business visit! We were in London for a theatre visit and opted to stay here again - as always excellent service, superb room and incredible view! This is always a brilliant place to stay when In London - so peaceful and relaxing! Extra thanks to the team who accommodated an early check in for us so we could drop our bags and quickly get ready for the theatre! Perfect - Thankyou! Cannot wait to come back again xx",5,2021,12,06
111,Wonderful hotel,"We really had a wonderful stay at this very modern, stylish hotel. Electronic controls in the room via a wall panel were superb with underfloor heating and night lighting.  The shower was amazing - rainwater style very large cubicle.   Sad that the minibar had to be removed due to Covid concerns.  
Room service meals reasonably priced but service charge at 12% seems very high. 
The rooftop bar is lovely, but sadly no meal slots were available and only 30mins in the spa was a bit disappointing.  However the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would consider another stay but will book well in advance next time.",4,2021,12,06
111,Absolutely brilliant overnight stay with a personal touch! I would 100% recommend,"My husband and I had such a brilliant overnight stay at the Montcalm Royal London Hotel! I have to give most of the credit for this to the amazing Mary on the Guest Experience team. As we were staying to celebrate my husbands birthday she helped us with logistics (as we had to get there earlier than planned), decorating the room with balloons and treats for my husband and seeing us out on the day we left. This personal touch made all the difference! 

Our stay itself was fantastic. The room was perfect, room service was exceptionally quick and breakfast (that we had in our room was very nice), I'd recommend the avocado!

We didn't manage to book a spa slot prior to our trip but when we went down to check it out the team were so over accommodating and found a slot so we were able to use the facilities before we left.

Overall our experience started well before we walked through the doors thanks to Mary, it was a super smooth check in and we'd like to say thank you to January for helping us up to our room. It all went a long way to making my husbands birthday a special occasion. 

I would 100% recommend to anyone considering staying at the Montcalm Royal London Hotel!

Thank you team!",5,2021,12,06
111,Amazing hotel great staff,Me and my girlfriend stayed here for the 2nd time this time for our anniversary I honestly couldn’t say more praise about the staff- January the guest experience manager could not have done any more us and when she found out it was our anniversary upgraded our room and was happy to help with anything we wanted to know or needed. We had dinner/drinks in the dining igloos and then sat and had drinks inside the aviary restaurant our server was i believe called sonum and we had top notch service from her too was a joy to speak too and when she found out it was our anniversary brang over happy anniversary with a candle. We will definitely be back for our anniversary next year and most likely before then as we loved it so much.,5,2021,12,06
111,The best in Ldn,"From as soon as I we stepped in, it was amazing the greeting was very welcoming. They helped a lot with the birthday request which made every moment special!Throughout the stay they always checked on you to make sure you felt like home. I will definitely be coming again. I really enjoyed the stay!
Thank you!!",5,2021,12,05
111,Our Engagement Stay,"We absolutely loved our stay this weekend at Montcalm Royal London house. It was a surprise for my girlfriend on our anniversary weekend on which I proposed. January the guest experience manager went above and beyond our expectation to provide us with the most welcoming stay we’ve ever had. Congratulations balloons, complimentary Prosecco, complimentary room upgrade as well as complimentary in-room breakfast were all provided for us as a gift from them to us. I honestly cannot recommend this hotel enough and we thank all of the staff there for making our weekend extra special.

We will definitely be back.",5,2021,12,05
111,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, & the rooftop bar made our trip!","Highly recommend. Beautifully kept hotel, beautiful decor, clean rooms, friendly reception staff, bar staff and housekeeping staff. Nothing too much trouble. Even managed to accommodate us on the rooftop bar when we hadn't booked. To top our stay off, the next day we had lunch booked in the domes on the rooftop which was amazing. The atmosphere, service  food and cocktails were all incredible. It was my friends birthday and the staff even arranged a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in the room. A lovely touch. Thank you for making our stay a special one. We will definitely be returning.",5,2021,12,05
111,Great stay,"Really enjoyed our stay - well looked after.

Thank you January for your help and getting us booked into the Avery, fantastic views, delicious food and some of the best service, it all help make our night a special treat.

Would definitely recommend and will be going back, next time will book the outdoor spheres",5,2021,12,05
111,Amazing,"A seriously luxurious and modern hotel. I want to pay a massive thank you to January - you made our stay incredible and went the extra mile to put a smile on my friends face for her birthday. I can’t thank you enough, what a LOVELY person. Balloons in the room with complimentary upgrade and macaroons, the restaurant at the top sung to her and brought her a complimentary dessert. I couldn’t have dreamt of more! The spa is amazing too!",5,2021,12,03
111,Birthday stay in London,"I would just like to say a huge thank you to the staff at the Montcalm. We were made to feel welcome and at home as soon as we stepped through the front door. 

I had mentioned that the stay was a birthday gift for my 40th and Mary the Guest Experience Executive arranged for a room upgrade and had the room decorated with balloons, card and macarons for our arrival. 

All the staff were equally as attentive. The hotel is beautiful and well appointed. The room itself had the most stunning views over London. 

The Aviary was a delight, super stylish and the perfect place to eat or just grab a drink as we did to watch the sunset over London. 

Wonderful hotel, but it is definitely the staff that really makes it. 

Would certainly stay again in the future.",5,2021,12,03
111,Perfect staycation break,I stayed at the Montcalm as a treat for my best friend before she gives birth. From the spa treatments to our stay at the hotel was perfect and the rest we really needed. We had a buffet breakfast as part of our wowcher deal which was a full English. My only negative is that it would’ve been nice to have Netflix on the tv or mirror cast with an iPhone,5,2021,12,02
111,Cannot fault in any way!,"Myself and my boyfriend visited a couple days ago and I really cannot fault either the hotel or the staff in any way whatsoever. The moment we arrived, a concierge helped us with our bags (we had a lot lol). I then went to check in and they had upgraded us to a suite (I’m assuming because they knew it was my boyfriends birthday) which I was over the moon about. We then had a staff member personally greet us and introduce herself and then escort us to our room which I thought was so lovely and made us feel very welcome and special. 
Anytime we needed any help we just called from our room and we had someone at our door within minutes. 
The room has sky TV, YouTube, heated bathroom flooring, neon lights, floor lights. It was honestly the most comfortable stay, one of the best we’ve been. 
We also visited the spa at the hotel and both had treatments which were amazing. The staff there were also so friendly and accommodating. 
When we checked out, we also had somebody personally come to say goodbye to us and check how our stay was - again such a lovely personal touch. 
My boyfriend and I were blown away by the customer service and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will definitely be back. 
Thank you to all at the Montcalm, we were so grateful!",5,2021,12,02
111,Did the job! Solid four star,"We stayed At the Montcalm last weekend. Right in the heart of Shoreditch it’s really close to cool bars and clubs. We didn’t have time to use the spa as we were just too busy! The hotel is good I wouldn’t say 5 star but a good central location to drop our bags and sleep. We were in London for the nightlife and theatre. Bed incredibly cosy and on the eighth floor it was very quiet, no street or traffic noise which contributed to a peaceful nights sleep. Good value for money but not an entirely luxury experience of a 5 star hotel.",4,2021,12,01
111,Great stay !,"Fab hotel ! Great location

We stopped her for one night ! Staff were friendly , bar was lovely , room was great however the situation of our room meant that we were right by the entire hotels fan system … this meant we had a disturbed sleep ! I’d stop again but I’d ask to be away from that , if they give you room 214 then ask for another on the other side !",4,2021,11,30
111,Anniversary Celebrations,"My Fiancé and I visited the Montcalm Royal House London for our Anniversary and were absolutely overwhelmed by the warm welcome we received. 
I had left a note on our reservation to state we were visiting to celebrate our anniversary and Mary Philippiah so kindly decorated our room in advance with rose petals which was such a kind and thoughtful idea.
The room was immaculate, the facilities were fantastic which included a well-equipped gym, pool, sauna and steam room. The Spa area was clean and staff were friendly. We both had massages during our stay with experienced therapists. 
Room service was enjoyable and quick. 
The hotel location was great, a few minutes’ walk to Moorgate station and surrounding bars and restaurants. 
During our stay all staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. 
Mary Philippiah was extremely attentive, welcoming and made our stay that extra bit special as we knew if there was something we needed, she would be able to assist.
We will most definitely be returning on future visits to London.",5,2021,11,30
111,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a great hotel staff were friendly and rooms were lovely. Very spacious beds are comfortable and you controlled your room from an iPad on the wall. The bathroom has a beautiful shower which was lovely and hot.  

The hotel is situated on a lovely square and the breakfast room is on the 10th floor with good views.",5,2021,11,28
111,THE MOST AMAZING STAY !,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm Royal London House, everything was perfect and the staff were so attentive.

They really do provide a 5* experience !

Our brilliant stay began with check in, as we provided our ID the friendly, lovely and helpful Mary noticed that it was my birthday the day before. Not only did she take note and wish me happy birthday she also kindly upgraded our room to the 8th floor with an amazing view. We were so grateful and did not expect this as we hadn’t mentioned my birthday in the initial booking.

We were asked if we had booked in for the spa by Mary and as we had not, she kindly arranged this for us.

Mary was so friendly and personable but the great encounter didn’t end there, Mary advised she would like to do something special for my birthday and then went on to sent the most delicious chocolate truffles and a selection of drinks to our room - we were taken aback by how thoughtful she was and by the amazing service provided at the Montcalm, with this having been our first stay.

The hotel in itself was stunning, every staff member we encountered was helpful and cheerful all adding to the delightful stay.

The Avairy is located on the top floor of the Montcalm hotel so we stopped by for drinks in the evening of our stay, we were accommodated with a table on a Saturday evening without a booking, once again helped by the fabulous staff !

I would have to say this was one of my best hotel stays.

Thank you so much to Mary for your kindness and hospitality, you truly enhanced our trip - we will definitely be staying again !",5,2021,11,28
111,Great experience,"I surprised my wife with a city break for our 5 wedding anniversary, staying at the Montcalm. As soon as we arrived and completed check in we were greeted by Mary from the Customer Experience Team who was polite and welcoming, asking questions about how she could make the stay better, our bags were collected and taken to our room and Mary informed us that we had been upgraded. The smile on my wife's face as she entered the room let me know I had done well. I ordered the a dozen roses be ready in the room which was done and the roses were perfect. 

The room was very large with heated floors in the bathroom, mood lighting, air conditioned (though because of how cold it was outside this was not used), the bed was humongous and very comfortable. The room also came with the standard tea and coffee set along with a Nespresso machine for those who like coffee a little stronger. When we unpacked we realised we had forgotten our toothpaste, with a call to front desk that was quickly sorted and withing a few minutes someone was at our door with toothpaste. All staff we interacted with were very polite and eager to help. Room service was straightforward, scan a QR code and order from the page paying immediately to avoid checkout charges. 

Some areas of feedback would be consider the use of space in such large rooms. The room is so large with much of the space unused. The room would score a 4/5 on cleanliness, there were some dusty surfaces and a sticky stain on the leather chair, the carpet needs a deep hoover as the fibres get on everything. The TV remote was missing (though we didn't really use the TV), the make-up mirror light in the bathroom was not working and finally the fact the front desk is unable to aid with room bookings is a frustration. 

We wanted to extend our stay by another night given how happy we were with everything but you are only able to do this online, front desk staff only help with check in. Sadly for us online there were no more rooms available.

Overall we had a pleasant stay and really do commend the friendliness of staff, especially Mary who upon check out came over to make sure we enjoyed our stay encouraging us to seek her out next time we stay so she could support us again.",5,2021,11,28
111,Amazing Hotel And Staff,"Thank you all for this amazing experience especially to Mary who assisted us very well and covered everything we asked and even more. Thank you Mary for the decorations on our special day, you made it an experience we will never forget. We will definitely visit again. Thanks to the entire team.",5,2021,11,27
111,Montcalm visit (26.11.21),"Had an amazing experience and stay at the hotel for a birthday. They decorated the room beautifully just from a request that I had put in, and the staff were really kind.
Personally met Mary Phillipa who made the visit that even better and was such a lovely person to talk too for that few minutes we checked out.

Would definitely come again, and will do so very soon!",5,2021,11,27
111,Theresa and Jade,I took my mum for a stay here and wow! The hotel and services are absolutely amazing! A special shout-out to Mary who assisted us and went above and beyond! She was a pleasure to meet and greeted us with a amazing smile we won't forget! We will definitely be back!,5,2021,11,27
111,Perfect treat,Lovely stay - January (Guest Experience Manager) really made us feel really welcome. Complimentary breakfast & the room was beautiful. Perfect combination of modern and traditional. We loved the touch turn on lights. We shall definitely return! Great location too. The perfect treat.,5,2021,11,27
111,Amazing Customer Service!,"Most incredible experience all thanks to the lovely Mary Philippiah. She went above and beyond to make my stay perfect. Would definitely come again! 

From the first phone call I had with her to meeting in person. She made the experience a perfect one.",5,2021,11,26
111,Lovely Stay at Montcalm RLH,"Visited the Montcalm last weekend, highly recommend the stay!

The hotel lobby/reception has a beautiful Christmas Tree giving the Christmas vibe! 
Our room was lovely, ceiling to floor windows which made our view at night amazing! 

Special thank you to the staff that made sure we had everything that we needed, Valentina at Reception, Alex the Hotel Manager that day, Daniel the Concierge & January the Guest Experience Manager.

Loved breakfast at the Aviary!! 
Will definitely be coming back to Montcalm RLH",5,2021,11,26
111,Beautiful hotel ,"Beautiful hotel, had a lovely room and amazing time here. Breakfast was awesome on the 10th floor with some lovely views. Only issue we had had was the touch screen in the room for lights, heating etc. It  was a bit non responsive but reception took note and will hopefully sort the problem for future use.",5,2021,11,26
111,Hard to fault,"My wife and I spent three nights in the Montcalm London House as a gift for her birthday. We had high hopes based on previous reviews and we weren’t disappointed. The room was perfect - finished to a very high standard (same as the bars and restaurant which are all beautiful), had everything we needed and plenty of space. We had the full English breakfast which was great and had breakfast in the room one morning which was very quick and not overly expensive. The pool and spa area is small but great to have it as an option in such a central location. Finally, the staff were amazing - friendly, helpful and very quick to respond to any requests. All in all amazing - thanks.",5,2021,11,26
111,Miss Brusatori,"My partner and I stayed here for our 2 year anniversary. It was amazing.

Firstly, the bed is ridiculously comfortable. The staff are incredibly nice and accommodating.

Upon arrival, we welcomed at the check in desk. They even upgraded our room as it was our anniversary.

January, the hotel manager, showed us to our room 310, where we spoke about going to watch The Lion King Theatre show. January had a lot of insight about our travels there and was very helpful with tips and advice about our night going to The Duck and Waffle. Over all, she is a lovely lady and I'm glad we got to engage with her.

Also, on top of upgrading our room, they decorated it beautifully with rose petals and balloons! 

We didn't get a chance to use the pool or the spa because we were just a bit too busy, but the options were there and seemed great.

I would highly recommend this hotel as a place to say when visiting London. It was beautiful and I'd definitely do it again.",5,2021,11,25
111,Amazing stay once again!,"We visited Montcalm several times and all I can say is every time it gets better. This time we went for my boyfriends birthday which they made extra special for us, the spa was excellent and everyone across the hotel offered us amazing service. 
Mary from the guest experience team was brilliant, we will continue coming back.",5,2021,11,25
111,Montcalm Royal London House,"I booked a surprise stay for my Mother's 60 birthday and my Godmother to stay at the Montcalm Royal London House and they absolutely loved it.

They said the hotel was plush and very clean.
Mum said the room was lovely and the staff were all so friendly and welcoming. 

Mum said they loved the spa and said their meal in the restaurant was the best dinner she has eaten at a restaurant for a very long time.

They both want to visit again so it must have been great. 

They way they both talked about their experience it's made me look into booking it for my Husband and myself. 

I want to say a special thank you to January the Guest experience Manager, for all her help with making sure all went to plan for my Mums birthday treat. 
January also added birthday amenities to my Mum's room and this was a very nice addition to everything. 

I appreciate your help January.",5,2021,11,25
111,Stunning Venue for a special occassion,My fiance and I visited the Montcalm hotel to celebrate our engagement. We were over the moon with the service and help we got from the experience director Mary who helped accommodate a perfect stay for us.,5,2021,11,25
111,A wonderful stay!,"3 night stay for a weekend break. Fab hotel, with really helpful staff. The roof top bar was a perfect spot to head to before an evening out. Location is great for a walk into shorditch with tube stop near by if heading further afield.  

Great service! We would absolutely stay again!",5,2021,11,24
111,Amazing customer service ,"We had a wonderful stay at The Montcalm Royal London House Hotel.

Big thankyou goes to January Stevens who went the extra mile to make our stay even more special for my daughter who is undergoing treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital.",5,2021,11,24
111,Above and beyond - Absolute amazing experience and pleasure,"I initially booked a trip at another hotel with my heavily pregnant Wife and myself for a stay away before parenthood, through no mistake of Montcalm Royal London House our other hotel had cancelled our booking late on a Sunday evening. 
Montcalm Royal London House offered us a room and given my wifes heavily pregnant status she was treated with the utmost care and greatest customer experience I had witnessed. The manager and staff at this hotel are a true credit to their company they went above and beyond and really left a lasting impression that will not be forgotten. 

Our trip very quickly went from complete nightmare to complete heaven thanks to the team at Montcalm Royal London House I cant thank you enough and especially Deepak.",5,2021,11,24
111,"Great staff, great stay!","A lovely anniversary weekend in London, made even better by the help of January and the fantastic Guest Services Team. The hotel is already great, but the team made sure it was extra special, with room treats and helping to secure last-minute seats at the rooftop bar on a Saturday night. Location close to lots of top bars and restaurants - an ideal place for a little bit of luxury in LDN.",5,2021,11,23
111,AMAZING!,"This hotel was so lovely! I booked a one night stay for my fiancés 30th birthday! The guest experience manager , January Stevens was so helpful and done her up most to make our stay perfect!

I couldn't recommend the hotel and the staff enough :)",5,2021,11,23
111,Exceptional Luxury Hotel with the most accommodating lovely staff especially January Stevens!!!,"From start to finish our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House exceeded all expectations and myself and my partner could not be more grateful for the service we received from January Stevens and her staff, she really always goes above and beyond for her guests and made sure our stay was nothing short of outstanding! We were surprised so much during our visit with the room set up with such a romantic setting for our special occasion complete with a bottle of wine, petals, macaroons and a hand written card from January herself as well as the amazing room itself which was so big!!! Having stayed at a lot of London hotels previously I can honestly say please try the Montcalm royal London house as once you stay there once you realise no other hotels can match the experience at this hotel and like myself I can ensure you will become a regular and look forward to booking your next stay! I would like to say a massive thank you to January again for always making our stay so great and always being on hand for anything we may need during our stay! This hotel really does have it all including amazing restaurant/bars at the hotel and also an unbelievable spa! The hotel is also very central as we had a lovely time walking to all areas of London and taking in the views along the way.",5,2021,11,22
111,Overnight Stay,"Having been gifted a spa treatment here, we decided to book overnight accommodation for the same day. We opted for the Executive room, as this included evening drinks/snacks and a continental breakfast. The hotel is beautiful, with a luxury feel. The room was very well appointed and spacious, with the option ahead of arrival to choose what type of pillows we wanted on the bed. The only reason we haven't given 5 stars for this stay was the bed and pillows were too soft for our liking, resulting in a poor nights sleep. I'm sure the bed would suit other guests though.
The spa was clean, with welcoming staff. The beds around the pool area were wooden with a very thin cushion which were uncomfortable after a while. I would recommend wearing your own flip flops down to the spa as the slippers provided in the room soaked up the water rather quickly. ",4,2021,11,22
111,Birthday treat,We stayed at the hotel for 1 night for my birthday. The hotel was lovely and the staff were very attentive. Great views especially on the rooftop restaurant. Good location and value for money. We will definitely return 😊,5,2021,11,22
111,Excellent Location,"Our favourite location in London, we are new to this hotel as we stay at Montcalm East a lot but after our weekend, the staff were amazing and could not do enough to make a great stay.  Special thanks to Camelia Rujan Duty Manager.  We will stay again on our next London trip.",5,2021,11,22
111,Beautiful Hotel made all the better by the staff,"Around 16 of us stayed here in individual rooms for 2 nights as a work social event. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms very comfortable with many modern touches (the mood lighting, underfloor heating and touchscreen panel especially!) Breakfast was lovely and very tasty. The hotel bars are also beautiful and location is fab.

But the real highlight for us was the staff. We came to them on Saturday afternoon wanting to arrange some flowers and champagne very last minute for a colleague who has organised the event. We asked the staff if they could do this for us expecting it to be too late notice to get any flowers etc. But manager January was wonderful and said to give her a few minutes to see what she could do, she came back less than 5 mins later and had found a florist that could get us a bouquet within 45 minutes! They also arranged some champagne which they put in a gift box and put in some hotel chocolates as well. Then the lovely Mary kept them at reception for us until we were ready to present them. They were extremely accommodating and professional and worked their magic for us! Thank you January and Mary and the Montcalm team, we’ll be back!",5,2021,11,21
111,Best experience in London,It’s honestly one of my best experiences staying in a hotel! The staff are really accommodating and really lovely and helpful! They really make my birthday weekend special! Absolutely love it and would definitely go back again!,5,2021,11,21
111,Surprise Engagement Proposal and Birthday Weekend,"I would like to say a huge thank you to both, January and Mary for making our surprise engagement proposal and birthday weekend so amazing. Between the two of them they were able to make the room look beautiful prior to our arrival. All staff continuously asked us if we were okay and if we were enjoying our stay. But were also willing to go further and beyond to make our stay more memorable. They made the whole experience run smoothly without any issues. This is our second stay at the Montcalm Royal London House and we look forward to our next stay here. 

Thank you

111,Faultless,"Wonderful staff who have been so friendly, super helpful and offer excellent customer service. The hotel itself is really lovely and has everything you need to have an enjoyable stay. Our room is really comfortable- particularly love the heated flooring in the bathroom and the mood lighting. We stayed in a club room which offered complimentary drinks and nibbles in the club lounge which had a lovely ambiance. Would thoroughly recommend. Hi",5,2021,11,21

111,Lovely hotel and made even better by manager January!,"I visited with my partner last night for our anniversary. After popping a note to say the occasion, January the experience manager, was so lovely and upgraded our room. She was so accommodating and friendly and she really made our stay special. She even put a note on the system to make sure she could see how our stay went and say goodbye when we checked out. We also booked a couples deep tissue massage in the spa and it was incredible! Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,11,20
111,Nice roof top terrace,"Nice hotel, great service. Roof top terrace has heated pods, which are very cosh. Rooms are spacious and clean. The only thing that lets it down is the check-in process, takes too long.   I would stay here again. Moorgate rude station is 5mins walk. ",4,2021,11,19
111,Our new favourite hotel 😍,"Enjoying staying here, the staff are amazing, very clean modern hotel. We checked in for a 2 night stay and Pamela and Mary on reception went out of their way to welcome us. They noticed it was my birthday a couple of days ago and upgraded us to a beautiful room.

111,Excellent weekend city stay,"I would definitely recommend this hotel for a city weekend stay. Fab location near transport links and also walking distance to loads of pubs, bars and restaurants. Aviary on the rooftop is great if you don’t fancy leaving the hotel too. Really good quality food in a buzzy exciting atmosphere with amazing views of London from the terrace.

The hotel staff were all friendly and the rooms are great. Comfortable beds, excellent bathrooms and fluffy towels. Will definitely be booking again for my next London weekend stay. Loved it!",5,2021,11,17

However it was the staff that really made this special, they were all very welcoming, friendly and professional going out of their way to make sure this was a memorable experience (a very special thank you to Mary).

A SPECIAL shout out to Mary and January who were a big part of my surprise day for my partner. They helped me from when i spoke on the phone up till when we met. It was a perfect day largely through their help.  They are a credit to the hotel. GIVE THEM A RAISE!!!!! I would give 10 stars if i could.",5,2021,11,15

111,Not good,"We stayed here for a weekend upon arrival we were given a dirty room which smelt of urine and sweat and had urine stains in the bathroom. We were moved rooms by the hotel to a ""upgraded"" this was bigger but not very well cleaned but did not smell of urine. The service was mediocre and slow. Hotel is very worn cracked marble and tiles etc. ",1,2021,11,14

111,Great stay in a top class hotel,"The Montcalm is a very stylish hotel with well soundproofed rooms and provides an excellent breakfast.
The outstanding thing about the hotel is the professionalism of the staff, for whom nothing is too much trouble. The young man on reception even walked to the main road to flag me down a taxi in rush hour.
I would certainly stay here again.",5,2021,11,14

111,Experience of my stay,I had the worse experience in relation to any 4 and 5 star hotel so far. Staring from the check in till the check out. 18 hours of nightmering experience. Visited  the bar with the family. Had a query about the closing time discrepancies between the roof top service and the in house service. Manager Larissa did not even want to see us and had en excuse of being busy. The staff were rude and no customer service except two staff Alex and Sophia who went extra miles and did not follow the trend of rudeness of the hotel. We ended up being unattended and unsatisfied. Never again,1,2021,11,10
111,Perfect and very romantic!,"Booked a weekend away recently with my boyfriend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. The staff were absolutely excellent, the quality and cleanliness of the hotel amazing, the room beautiful, and the breakfast lovely.

Having noticed it was my birthday in a few days she upgraded our room and we were gifted with a bottle which was so lovely. The room was beautiful with so many modern features and so clean and comfortable. The spa area was perfect and relaxing and the whole experience was honestly so perfect 🥰. The hotel in itself is amazing and we can’t fault it at all however what made our stay so special and a place we would consider returning to was how good Mary took care of us. She made our stay the best it could possibly be and she made us feel so good and so happy 💓,5,2021,11,08

111,Amazing staff! Great facilities! Beautiful spacious room!,"I had an amazing experience at Montcalm RLH, from entering, checking in, spa facilities, room facilities, comfort and sleep quality. At check in, I requested to upgrade my room to a junior suite (of course I was willing to pay the difference), the staff were accomodating and happy to help and offered the upgrade FREE OF CHARGE! I rrqua cake to celebrate a birthday and the cake was delicious and exceeded the standard I expected. Thank you so much Mary for your hospitality, help and for being so welcoming. Would definitely return. ",5,2021,11,07
111,First time back since pandemic and happy to say they are still great!,"I love this hotel and especially admire the professionalism and commitment of the staff.
I came for a full week this time around, combining business with an extended weekend. Had my concerns around the new norm (this was my first flight since), but I was happy to quickly discover that all was as usuall at the Royal House.
Had a minor issue that was quickly resoled by the hotel manager to my satisfaction. Throughout my stay I had a few technicalities that required attention, and as always, the staff were amazingly responsive and courteous. Worth a mention is Daniel, who stands out as a true professional in his field, making you always feel as if you were the sole guest of the hotel. Thank you, Daniel and team, and see you again soon!",5,2021,11,07
111,An amazing 'Guest experience' stay for my birthday,"I will not forget my amazing experience at Montcalm Royal London house for a very long time. I got to experience the 'Guest Experience' when I got a surprise on the morning of my birthday, a beautiful large bouquet of red roses, champagne and a very tasty birthday cake. All thanks to the guest experience manager, Mary, who made sure that I was happy throughout my stay. My husband and I even got a room upgrade.  A beautiful luxury hotel that makes you feel so special as though you are the only guest they have. I will definitely visit again very soon. Top marks for everything.",5,2021,11,06

111,Girls Trip ,"I got a wowcher deal that included 1 night stay, breakfast, spa and late checkout and it was soo worth it! Definitely 5 star service and quality from check in to the rooms. Mary helped us at check in and set the tone for the great stay. Breakfast buffet is small and spa time is only 30mins only slight negative. Definitely worth the visit!! ",5,2021,11,03
111,Everything was brilliant ,"From check in to check out, everything was amazing. 
This is the 2nd time we've stayed at this hotel, and prior to booking, I wrote to them as it was my wife who booked the 1st time, and I wanted it to be a surprise, but also to make sure we were in the same room type (Club room, but I couldn't remember the name!!)
January Stevens was the last who was handling our booking and all I can say is that the level of service we received was exceptional. 

We were so very well looked after for the duration of our stay, we actually felt guilty leaving the room to do 'touristy stuff'

Check-in was easy and seamless. The room was amazing, breakfast was first class and checkout was just as easy. 

I would absolutely book to stay here again and would again give a shout out to January as she is an asset to that hotel!!",5,2021,11,03
111,Consistent excellence,"I have now stayed at this excellent hotel 4 times and will continue to book monthly. The Manager Deepak is amazing and nothing is a problem. The reception staff are starting to remember me and it feels like a home from home. Tried the pool area for the first time, very relaxing indeed. Great all round…first class service!",5,2021,11,02
111,Superb place to stay,"We have just returned from a one night stay at this hotel. It was my 40th birthday, so we booked a suite. The hotel is beautiful from both the outside and the inside and the room was extremely spacious compared to other suites we have had in other top hotels. The hotel was clean and well appointed on every level and the service was exceptional, in fact the staff go out of their way to be polite and courteous! The breakfast was plentiful and fresh with a quality ambience in the dining areas and the hotel itself is well located with Liverpool Station a nice stroll away. A special thank you to Mary on the front desk, she was exceptional in every way. Could not fault the hotel which was incredibly priced for the level of service and quality of stay.......",5,2021,11,02
111,Very pleasant stay,"The hotel is a very busy one and despite that the staff is amazing, always there to help and never frustrated or busy despite the high traffic. Farhana, amongst others was extremely welcoming and always giving guest a warm greeting. The location and the hotel bar and coffee shop made the stay very pleasant",5,2021,11,01
111,Proposal,"Amazing hotel A* Service. I have booked a room to propose to my girlfriend, fantastic service from the guest experience team manager Natasha, she had kindly assisted me in getting her team ready to decorate the room whilst we were out for dinner. Natasha put me at ease by making sure it will all work out perfectly as I was really nervous. We checked in at 3pm, we got ready and went out for dinner at 8pm. The room was ready when we got back at midnight a complimentary bottle of Prosecco had been provided and the decoration for the room was out of this world. Now the amazing hotel staff member January had decorated the room so beautifully as we walked in, the rose petals with a heart shape, marry me led lights and many more. January had made it perfect  the Vision i had for the proposal definitely come to reality. My fiancé was overwhelmed with so much emotion, excitement and tears. She said Yes :) Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making this night so special. Thank you Natasha for making it all happen and providing us with a room with a beautiful view of the city. Thank you January for the amazing room decoration.",5,2021,11,01
111,Service is so poor,"This is a really lovely hotel, nice rooms, clean and comfy. However the service in the hotel was so bad. A manager in the  bar gave out to us and was extremely rude for sitting in seats that she had reserved but there was no reserved sign on the table. When they cleaned the room the took the towels and we were left with just a hand towel the next day. 
Its a nice hotel and the location is good but I would not recommend based on the service.",2,2021,11,01
111,Amazing weekend away,Just come back from a lovely stay at this hotel. Went away for a surprise for my fiance and Valentina at reception was amazing. She organised sweet treats for our upgraded room. Thank you so much for all your help. Will definitely be going back again,5,2021,10,31
111,"Superb hotel with amazing service, truly oustanding and would 100% come back to stay here again! 5 Star!","My visit to this hotel was special, it was one day that would be remembered forever. This was the day I had planned to propose to my girlfriend and had been looking for somehwere special to be able to do this. I had emailed the hotel and January who is the Guest Experience Manager had replied back with some information. From the moment I had spoken with her she went above and beyond. To assist me and help with my planning. The stay was truly beyond amazing, the room was excellent and I couldn’t have been happier with the cleanliness, the size and view! This was only the tip of the iceberg as I had really wanted something special so an amazing romantic set was provided in the room as well as amenities. The hotel also has the amazing rooftop restaurant which was The Aviary and I had a reservation there which also made the whole experience amazing, this is where the proposal was done within the Igloo. The hotel staff we super helpful, so polite and not once did I feel uncomfortable to ask for anything. The breakfast which was a continental breakfast had great variety and was really delicious. I would honestly recommend The Montcalm Royal London City Hotel in Finsbury Square to everyone as the hotel is really up to standard with modern requirements and I persoabkh was extremely happy with my stay shut my partner who is now my Fiancée thanks to the help from the hotel staff and especially January. Definitely a 5 star if not more in my opinion.",5,2021,10,30
111,"Exceptional service both from the team, the room and experience","From organising a special request with balloons and bookings, there was exceptional responses from January and the team. Every service was met and the room was fantastic. 5/5 experience regardless of spa. Clear room set up on website and complimentary services were beyond expectation",5,2021,10,30
111,Great location awful cleanliness,"Really great location, everything is within walking distance.  Room size is very decent. Roof top restaurant has very nice view. Cleanliness is appalling, pair of sock in the corner of the room right underneath the curtain.  Bathroom was so dusty.  Bedsheet has yellow stain.  Bath robe has make up stain on the collar.  Steam room out of order.     It fell very short of 5 star quality.",2,2021,10,29
111,Exceptional service every single time,"Montcalm has become our second home. What keeps me going back is the warmth, professionalism, attention to detail and the constant care during our stay. Thank you to the Front House Manager Alex Storie for always welcoming us to the hotel. My children would never  let me venture off elsewhere to book another hotel because your staff members are so caring and the staff remember us each time we visit. Keep up the great job Alex. Also, our stay will never be the same without Daniel (concierge). He so dedicated to his job and always go out his way so that our trip is well spent. He has assisted us with the best restaurants and events booking. I’ve also observed how caring he is in training the new/younger concierge. My eldest son suffers from anxiety and each time we visit the hotel, he looks forward to greeting  Daniel. Thank you for the encouraging conversations you’ve had with him on our visits. I have learn so much about customer service by just staying at your hotel. Thank you for always bringing extra pillows and water each time we ask without any hesitation. I appreciate this team so much. You guys are certainly exceptional and I don’t think I’ll ever book elsewhere. See you soon.",5,2021,10,29
111,Great hotel,"Spent one night at the hotel as a birthday celebration. We were looked after by Valentina who not only upgraded our room but also arranged for a bottle of wine and nibbles to help us celebrate. The room was on the 7th floor and overlooked the Square and the City skyline. It had all the facilities you would expect and was a more generous size that most London hotels. Tea and coffee making facilities a very large LCD TV, large shower and a very comfortable bed.Thank you Montcalm and Valentina we hope to visit again in the near future. A great improvement on a lot of so called 4-5 star London hotels!",5,2021,10,28
111,Absolutely lovely,"This is the first time staying in this particular Montcalm, myself and my husband went for our anniversary. During check in I casually mentioned it was our anniversary and to my surprise a few minutes later a bottle of Prosecco and macaaroons were sent to our room. It was such a lovely gesture and very thoughtful and very much appreciated. From the moment you join the que to check in you will notice that every single member of staff are amazing, nothing is too much trouble and everyone is positive polite and friendly.  The only criticism is that I booked this hotels as it had a spa and I was informed that guests only get 30 minutes access and the only available slot was at 8am which was disappointing. Breakfast at the Avery was gorgeous, again beautiful surroundings and great staff yet again. Thank you to all the staff at Montcalm royal london for an amazing stay we will be back!",5,2021,10,28
111,5 star? Hmm,"Just returned from a stay at the hotel. Got a really good deal so for the money it was adequate, however it fell short of 5 star quality on several counts. The overall feel of the hotel is ok, but just doesn't feel ""premium"" I have stayed in 3/4 star hotels that feel equally special. Hotel photos show a doorman for example. We didn't see one in the 3 days we were at the hotel however.

The spa/pool area is tiny, crowded and a bit chaotic. The pool is really small and is only suitable for cooling off and not exercising and this is exacerbated by people lying on loungers right next to the pool (as the pool area is so small) so you can't even try to swim for fear of splashing them.
I was told by the spa reception that you needed bath robes to use the pool. Duly went up to reception to ask for bath robes and was told they would be sent up to the room. 5 minutes later, bath towels arrived but no robes. Call to reception revealed that they didn't have bath robes due to a ""delivery problem"" The telephone was also playing up as it only worked on speaker phone and not via the handset. We again contacted reception who sent out someone who showed us how the speaker phone works, but couldn't solve the handset problem.
The room was fine, a decent size, huge TV with Sky, a digital panel to control under floor heating, a Nespresso machine, Elemis toiletries etc The desk chair however was wobbly and needed fixing.
My teenage son doesn't drink tea or coffee, so I asked for instant  hot chocolate. Maybe a bit unusual, but certainly not extravagant and certainly not out of the ordinary for a 5 star hotel I would have thought, but was told they did not have any and couldn't assist me.
l would have raised these issues at checkout rather than resorting to social media, but upon checkout I was just asked if I was checking out and my room card was taken, without actually asking me if everything was ok with my stay.

All in all, a good solid hotel, just not 5 star in my opinion.",3,2021,10,27
111,Very pleasant stay and excellent service,"The room was clean and spacious and  the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  They were very responsive to our needs and very professional.
The breakfast was also delicious. Would definitely return",5,2021,10,26

111,Miss Taseva,"Our stay was wonderful and mostly thanks to the concierge Daniel, a wonderful person, always responds when we need it!Great place and very nice staff!The view of the roof was amazing!  And everything was a few minutes from the hotel!",5,2021,10,25
111,A nice night away from home,"I had a fantastic visit with my husband , the room was spacious , very clean,  comfortable and modern. Everything about the stay felt 5 stars . The concierge was fantastic . I called down late evening for some ice and a while bucket came to me lol was More than enough for the whole night and then some . Might seem like just a little request but all the staff go above and beyond . The Continental breakfast was also good.  Natasha and Mary were lovely, welcoming and great . 

We will definitely be booking another stay and this time experience the spas and well-being centre + rooftops restaurant. 

Kind regards 
Mrs Mohamed",5,2021,10,25

111,Beautiful British hotel,"We stayed for our anniversary, in a standard room , we were pleasantly surprised by the features in the room , we were out most of the time so for us it was a vase to change , but we enjoyed the use of the spa facilities , the rain shower in the room was great , hot and heated flooring , the comfort of the room is all on a very easy to use control panel , reception/ concierge were fantastic, and couldn’t do enough, friendly , approachable and officiant. The location is perfect for Shoreditch and the markets , Liverpool Street station , and trendy bars and restaurants all very close . With the station so close by it’s very east to access all of London so all in all a great base , every thing you need is in the room , nice tea selection and nespresso coffee machine we had a wonderful stay and would stay again when visiting London , thank you to all the staff",5,2021,10,22

111,Lovely city Hotel,"The hotel it’s self is lovely but the staff and The Aviary really make this hotel - The reception staff we’re welcoming and couldn’t have done anymore 
A lovely lady managed to get us one of the igloos on the 10th floor last minute for drinks and the view up there is gorgeous - beautiful place to sit for drinks 

They set up balloons in our room as we stayed for a birthday celebration 

Great location - Would definitely stay again",5,2021,10,21
111,Exceptional and incredible stay at Montcalm,"We were blown away by the exceptional experience at the hotel. We stayed as a celebration of my 50th birthday and we were treated to an incredible room on the 8th floor with amazing views of the city, as well as a room decorated with balloons, a complimentary bottle of wine and some macaroons. All the staff were incredible, from the reception team to the spa staff, as well as the team at the Aviary rooftop restaurant and bar. The food at the Aviary restaurant was first class, every dish on every course was perfect and it probably was the best dining out experience which we’ve ever received. We then went to the Aviary roof top bar and the staff treated us to staying in one of there beautiful terrace ‘pods’ where we could sit on the terrace enclosed in a glass bubble which was stylishly furnished and also captured the beautiful view of the city skyline. This was such a wonderful surprise and an outstanding experience and it crowned what can only be described as the best luxury hotel stay that we have ever had. Really big thank you to the hotel team you made my 50th birthday such an amazing and memorable day.",5,2021,10,20

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the service provided was a true 5 star experience. I have to really thank Ms. January Stevens for going out of her way to make my stay as amazing as it was, she was so lovely. 

l definitely recommend staying here when coming to London, great spot!",5,2021,10,19
111,What A Stay!,"Wow, what a stay.  Me and my wife stayed here for our wedding anniversary.  It was a surprise for my wife, and I contacted the Hotel Guest Experience Team in advance to talk through a few details to make it special for my wife.  If you call the Hotel Reception number they gladly put your through to a real person, not an automated system!  They were amazing and after talking through what I would like, oh wow did they deliver!  The room was dressed with ballons, banners, bubbly, flowers, chocs!  My wife felt like a Celeb for sure.  For me, what made it special was to see the GM, Deepak, and his Team giving the personal touch to all the Guests during check in.  Bubbly on arrival, a lovely lounge to sit and relax whilst checking in, members of the Team to help with bags to the room (please be polite, a little £5 tip is nice but not expected)..The rooms are as expected with a 5star London Hotel, but what makes this Hotel great is the amazng customer service and attention to detail.  We will definitely stay again without a doubt, and as far as value for money goes, what a plus!",5,2021,10,19
111,Amazing hotel THANK YOU,"Stayed here for one night on two day stay in London and this hotel was PERFECT.  Great location, the room was huge and the bed was SO comfortable. The huge TV with sky, the bathroom was modern and felt brand new, the breakfast was delicious but what made it for me was the staff. Every single member of staff we met couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. We didn't even get to the spar as we didn't have time but I wish we could have stayed another night to try it out.  Will definitely be back :)",5,2021,10,19
111,Overall this weekend was such a special weekend and I can not praise this hotel and staff enough!,"What a fantastic weekend staying here AGAIN for my partners 25th Birthday!

On arrival the hotel was so beautiful and the staff was super friendly and really go above and beyond to make your stay special from the start.

Once we checked in we went to go to our room and when we walked in straight away we had the pleasure of seeing our room decorated with balloons , greeting card for my partner and complimentary of red wine what was fantastic, the rooms have a really modern decor and really special feeling to them.

On check out the staff once again was super helpful, friendly and polite and make you feel so special. One thing what was fantastic was we could leave our suitcases with the hotel while we went shopping and after we come back for them they was again really friendly and do make you feel really welcome.

Overall this weekend was such a special weekend and I can not praise this hotel and staff enough! Definitely one of if not  the best hotel I have stayed with again and will be booked again in the near future for our THIRD VISIT!

Thank you,
Kind regards

111,Good stay,"Staff was very friendly especially a lady called January made our lives really easy and helped out so much. Bed was very soft and had no trouble sleeping like how I do in other places. 
Thinking of an excuse to come and stay again!",5,2021,10,18
111,A lovely experience and great hotel to stay in if you want to get away for a night.,"Staying here was a great experience and the guest manager (January) made it a memorable night! As requesting for a bath in the room, she upgraded my room to a junior suite & gave us access to most of the facilities such as the lounge and the avery for breakfast. I had no problems at all with the room, room service, Spa facilities. I was able to check in early due to her being so helpful and she would always check if everything was ok! Overall the experience was amazing and i would come back here again, sooner than before.",5,2021,10,18
111,Miss,"Our overall experience was excellent at this hotel! 
We stayed in the Montcalm Club Suite which provided everything required for a 5 star experience. The service was impeccable and the shower, toiletries, bed and lighting of the room, coupled with the top class standard of cleaning made us feel comfortable here. 
Furthermore, the breakfast is way too good to miss out on and the free 30mins in the spa is pure luxury. 
There were some issues with the technology including tv, lighting and heating but even with these minor issues, we would still happily rank this hotel as 5*
Strongly recommend!
Praise to Michelle and Mary who checked us in and out and provided excellent service!",5,2021,10,17
111,Beautiful hotel,"Me and a friend visited this hotel in October and was absolutely blown away with everything about the hotel. The minute we walked in we were greeted with smiles from all of the staff who were exceptional throughout our stay. The room was spotless and stunning, with loads of gadgets all over the room. We both would highly recommend this venue to anywone who is considering staying in London",5,2021,10,17
111,Weekend away that surpassed all expectations,"Bear with this one, my reviews are normal short but this deserves a little extra attention.

We arrived on a Friday afternoon for a weekend break.  There was a bit of a queue due to a coach party arriving but the concierge offered us refreshments whilst queuing.

Checkin was smooth and we were checked in by the reception manager (Camelia).  Without any prompting from us, we were upgraded to a junior suite (See notes on choosing a room) and absolutely nothing was too much trouble.  Got to the room and we only had limited towels but a quick call down to Camelia and this was rectified in minutes.

By London standards the room was huge!  It was clean, ultra comfortable bed (you can even select what type of pillows you want), Sofa bed, Working Iron and hair drier.  The rainfall shower was something else, no water restrictors here.   Also there was a proper bath.

We made use of the members club (just register) complimentary nibbles and wine.  Nice and chilled which set us up for the evening.

Another mention of specific staff for Hamide (hopefully I spelt his name correctly) from the concierge team.  We needed a table at the Aviary restaurant which is always full (you can prebook on the website).  He sorted everything, we didn't need to lift a finger.

Aviary restaurant is on the 10th floor with views towards the Thames.  Really popular with locals and residents alike.  It isn't the cheapest but the food is amazing and if you like a cocktail any more than a couple and you will be squiffy.

In summary, not the cheapest but you get what you pay for.  The staff are all very genuine and eager to help you.  The staff try to anticipate your wants and needs.  This is a five star on the up and I really cannot speak highly enough.

I have stayed in Montcalm hotels before and their sister brand, Shaftsbury premier for work but this is by far the best!

We will be back!",5,2021,10,17
111,Outstanding experience,"The hotel exceeded our expectations upon arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff and booked in very quickly , we are also upgraded which was a very nice surprise

The  room was beautiful , incredibly clean and spacious the rose petals on the bed made the whole experience very romantic , which is exactly what we are looking for ! we weren’t expecting access to the club sweet where we receive free drinks and canapés- fantastic ! 

The highlight for us was going on the rooftop bar drinking excellent cocktails whilst looking over the amazing views of London it was quite an experience we really enjoyed it

In the morning we enjoyed a nice Jacuzzi as we had free access to the spa with our club sweet booking we then enjoyed a really nice continental breakfast with a great selection of foods , the staff are friendly and very professional

We are actually really excited to return to the hotel and As soon as we got home we started looking at dates to book for our anniversary as we’d love to come back and have the experience again

Thank you to all the staff who helped us enjoy your stay

111,amazing!,"Made a booking for my partner's birthday and would like to start with a big thank you to Mary and Natasha at the reception who made the check-in process smooth and friendly. I would also like to thank Mary who upgraded the room a splendid room for the occasion and Natasha and her team who decorated the room as I was in a rush and honestly they couldn't have done a better job. after where the room wasn't registering the key card at times and the room light was a bit frustrating to navigate, I would definitely stay here again due to the faultless service received. ",5,2021,10,15
111,Front office staff,"Alex Storie and his team at reception could not have been more helpful to us when our 61st wedding aniversery plans went a bit wrong they did all they could to help us have a really good time.
Many many thanks to all at Montcalm Royal London House.",5,2021,10,14
111,Incredible.,"What can I say. A huge thank you to Camelia and Natasha for their time, effort and energy for making my stay as easy as possible. 

They were helpful through the whole process of our stay and the build up to it. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff are very friendly. The spa is amazing and the gym was very clean. 

The concierge Daniel was one of the best workers I’ve ever seen work. Someone who strives to help people and always has a smile on his face. 

I would highly recommend staying at this hotel, the breakfast is incredible and so is the rooftop view with the pods. 

10/10

111,Weekend Break,"The hotel is beautiful; the welcome, the spacious rooms and clean environment. Not to forget the excellent terrace where you can have drinks and breakfast! The lovely staff made the visit; Peter at check-in and Mary & Daniel always ready to help on the 9th floor. 

Cons: small bathroom with no bath. Also, could have done with a later breakfast time for the weekend.",4,2021,10,13
111,Outstanding Hotel,"We had the most wonderful trip here. Outstanding staff and the hotel is just beautiful! Very modern and has lovely social spaces to relax in. We loved every minute despite being slightly disappointed on arrival to hear  that the rooftop terrace and steam room was closed for works at the time of our stay. I highly reccomend staying here for location aswell as the attentive and wonderful staff. Couldn’t fault it! Will definetly be back, thank you mont calm!",5,2021,10,12
111,Just W.O.W.,"Beautiful hotel with beautiful service. I have really enjoyed every bit of the stay. With Mary in the concierge, Pamela and Valentina helping in checking in and out. And Peter from the service all been really helpful and attentive. They made our stay more enjoyable.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have best of both, to be in central London everything close to you and enjoy a luxury hotel. 
The bar downstairs is busy and lively, the aviary upstairs has definitely been a different experience for our family. Alex was who made it even nicer, with her energy and friendliness she was unbelievably nice.",5,2021,10,12
111,Amazing stay!,I am never disappointed in the Montcalm Royal London House! I have stayed multiple times and have always had a wonderful visit. This time January made our visit exceptionally amazing! She went out of her way to help make sure we had everything we needed. She even sent a bottle of prosseco for our friends birthday. I will never stay any where else in London.,5,2021,10,11
111,Great service,"One of the best experiences in a london hotel! January was the best customer relations manager who upgrade us and added free breakfast as it was my birthday! Even sent a bottle of wine to my room to celebrate my birthday! 

I will be coming back again!",5,2021,10,10
111,Fab central hotel with a rooftop bar,"We stayed at the Montcalm for a couple of nights for our wedding anniversary in July and we had a great trip. The hotel kindly left a bottle of fizz in our room as it was our anniversary which was a very sweet touch. The hotel is in a top location, central to tubes, main stations, restaurants and bars.  This hotel has a rooftop bar called the Aviary which has great views. Sadly the Aviary doesn’t reserve any walk in tables for hotel guests so if you want to use this bar, make sure you book in advance, it’s well worth it!",5,2021,10,08
111,Not as good as it thinks ,"This hotel looks nice but it's not as good as it thinks it is. It is comfortable and well located near Moorgate tube but many of the staff are surly, the breakfast is bang average and the room cleanliness lacked care and attention. The walls are very thin so you can hear the street and the next room. 
The pool is TINY, and the gym is adequate.

Everything is very expensive, food drink, etc...

It looks stunning on the website but the reality is slightly less I'm afraid. ",3,2021,10,08
111,High Standards all round.,"Lovely staff who went out of their way to help.. giving directions, always cheerful and helpful. Our room was big for London and the requested view was given.  Toiletries were of a high standard and there was plenty of storage. Plenty of tea and coffee but no biscuits!  Everything was spotless and the bed was really comfortable. The shower was fantastic.  Our breakfast was great. All the food was good quality and service was efficient and friendly. An omelette station would have been good. Lovely fresh fruit though. The aviary was amazing...lovely pods with food at reasonable prices. Definitely recommend. Thank you to all staff

 
 ",5,2021,10,07
111,Night away,I've previously visited the spa at the Montcalm Royal London House so I was super excited to stay in the rooms. I stayed in a double deluxe room- I was there for business and for one night but I was made to feel welcome upon arrival. The room was spacious and clean. I particularly loved the bathroom. One thing I was a little upset that I didn't have the opportunity to use the spa. I was booked in for a slot but I sadly got into London later than expected and was unable to be fitted in. I would say maybe the guests staying at the hotel should have priority but I understand they need outside guests too. My breakfast was not included - I ate in the aivary restaurant which is so beautiful. I would have liked more selection on the fruit but that's just my preference. Overall a great stay and January was absolutely delightful! (The Manager),5,2021,10,04
111,"Could hear next-door as clear as day, massively disappointed","There was a strange partition door inbetween my room and someone else’s, it sounded like they were almost in the room with me, even when they were talking at normal volume. For a room advertised as “sound proofed” I was really disappointed, I brought it up with the staff and they said that they couldn’t move us as every other room was booked, make sure you aren’t in one of these rooms, it ruined my experience.",2,2021,10,02
111,Amazing stay,"Lovely staff, amazing hotel. We also ate breakfast at Burdock downstairs which was very nice (amazing coffee). 

My girlfriend and I came to London for her work and pretty much everything was spot on. Can’t ask for much more.",5,2021,10,02
111,Birthday,"We stayed at the hotel at end of Sept to celebrate my birthday.  What a lovely surprise in our room - balloons, wine and macarons.

We had a fantastic time, lots of rest time, super comfortable beds, great spa covid safe as you booked in advance. Thank you to Mary and all the Montcalm staff for making this such an enjoyable experience. Everything has been smooth and wonderful, nothing was too much trouble.

We would definitely stay here again as a result of the warm hospitality and the hotel atmosphere.
 ",5,2021,10,01
111,Brilliant staff.,"Had a brilliant stay with my sister last weekend.   It was my second stay at the hotel and I have to say that it was as good as the first, especially considering a lot of the frills had to be take. Away due to Covid.   The staff were, without exception, the high point of out stay with particular mention going to the superb waitress in the Aviary restaurant who managed to make every customer feel special.   Well done and thanks.",5,2021,10,01
111,AMAZING FROM START TO FINISH!,"My two daughters and I had the privilege of staying at the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel last weekend.  I cannot praise the team highly enough for their service.  From the moment we arrived, which was way too early for check-in, the Reception team and Concierge were amazing!  We were able to leave our luggage so that we didn't have to carry it around all day and were told it would be in our rooms when we returned.  It was great to be introduced to the Manager, Deepak and welcomed personally by him.  When I requested a taxi, this was arranged immediately and arrived within 1 minute.
We thoroughly enjoyed spending time in our well-appointed family suite with its two bathrooms and tray of goodies!!
We had booked a table in the rooftop restaurant The Aviary and I am so glad that we did.  The view was amazing - as were the cocktails that we sipped as we took it all in.
The staff here too were so attentive and friendly yet always professional - and the meal, delicious.
On our departure we had the pleasure of meeting January, the Guest Experience Manager, who checked if everything had been satisfactory and even walked us out to our taxi.
We were made to feel very special and we felt we had been totally spoilt during our stay - my only regret ..... it was only for 1 night.  Until next time - thank you all.",5,2021,09,29
111,Perfect stay.,"Thank you so much! The staff are so attentive, will get you anything you need - I can't emphasise enough how every member of staff was so welcoming and nice. Food was amazing, drinks amazing, the avairy bar is just a beautiful skyline of London. The room was top spec, so comfy and the double shower was like having a massage. The spa was so nice, I will remember to book a treatment in advance next time as its so popular! Can't wait to book again!",5,2021,09,28
111,Outstanding staff,"This is a lovely hotel, the room was lovely, really spacious and very clean and modern. The breakfast was great and the location excellent. But it is the staff who steal the show, I turned up to the hotel with one shoe on having broke my toe a few hours before, I expected lots of weird looks but instead was looked after so well. Everyone was so considerate and they genuinely wanted to make our stay as pleasant as possible. If you are considering this hotel, stop and just book it, you won’t be disappointed. Special thanks to Mary on reception who took wonderful care of us. I will definitely be back.",5,2021,09,27
111,Amazing hotel in London City Center,"Everything about this hotel is great starting from the location, hospitality, amenities in the rooms and hotel. I have already stayed in this hotel twice. Rooms are super comfy, bathrooms are clean and have heated flooring which was a plus. Different mood lights also available in the room. Rooftop has a restaurant and a good view to offer. I would recommend this place to all who like to stay in a fancy high-end hotel and would love to stay here again. I loved every bit of my stay here.",5,2021,09,27
111,Compensation of a disadvantage triumphed,"Although we had been transferred from a far more familiar and convenient hotel by the same company, our arrival at Royal London House could not have been more welcoming. We are both in our eighties and I am partially disabled. As our taxi drew up, there was an arm offered me to help dismount and we were ushered straight to check in, sat in easy chairs with a pot of tea as our check in was effected. 
Daniel, the concierge treated us like senior members of his family, and the original inconvenience was hugely compensated by the warm and safe welcome as we had left shielding for the very first time. 
Our breakfast in the spectacular floor 10 Aviary Room was an unexpected highlight of our first out of home post pandemic adventure.",5,2021,09,26
111,Personal touch,"Me and my husband don't get away often as a couple because family unfortunately do not live close enough to look after our 2 children. But when the chance arrived we chose to stay at the The Montcalm Royal London House and we have just returned from our second stay. 

The first time round we had a lovely experience. I love the little touches this hotel does, the mood lights, the scents on the pillow, are just all added lovely extras that for us just make it a little more luxury. The first stay we had here was in  August 2019 and despite enjoying our stay we did have a problem at the Aviary restaurant that we reported to January (the manager). 
We never expected anything when we reported a problem, but we always like to report problems to bring things to the attention so things management can help prevent anything like this occurring for future guests. 
January was extremely understanding about our issue and offered to oversee our stay if we ever returned. 
We decided to take January up on this offer in April 2020 after previously being in Hospital and sadly  nearly losing my life. So understandably we desperately need a stress relief weekend to ourselves. Unfortunately due to covid and Lockdown restrictions the stay didn't go ahead in April 2020. It was postponed several times and finally went ahead in September 2021. January was so lovely and even though it was a stressful time for all of us and businesses were struggling, she still kept to her word about overseeing our stay and that she did. We had a lovely room, the bed is very comfortable and big, everything is so sparkly clean! I love the heated floor tiles in the bathroom, you really notice it!! 

If you like a pre drink before going out to of an evening, the hotel do a club lounge, that you can upgrade to. Personally worth the money, opens at 5:30pm - 8:30pm selection of spirits, soft drinks, wine and prosseco with Crisps and nuts in a lovely relaxing atmosphere and a lovely gentleman that remembers your drinks order from the previous day. Me and my husband would sit in for an hour playing cards before heading out. 

Overall, although this is a central London Hotel, so you need to expect to spend money for certain extras, I feel so welcomed here, I feel like my say has a personal vibe where being compared to other big central London hotels where it feels like profits is the main priority guest 2nd, here I feel like guest experiences are first priority. If you have a problem, they want to resolve it straight away. 
It is this personal touch that is the main reason for me to return in the future and this reason where I will be recommending all my friends and family this hotel. 

January, Thank you again for such a lovely stay, you are so lovely and definitely one of the many reasons as to why we would return, your hospitality and caring nature is a breath of fresh air!",5,2021,09,26
111,Beautiful hotel,Took my missus here for a birthday get away and she loved every minute of it... hotel suite we had was amazing .... hotel staff was very inviting and welcoming when we booked in....can't think of anything that they need to improve on...,5,2021,09,26

111,Best weekend,"We have booked for a night to celebrate my husband getting a new job and they delivered. We had a bottle of wine in our room and celebratory balloons . The room was superb and we had some of the best sleep we’ve had in ages. Special thanks, to Natasha for arranging everything and helping us with the room and to Daniel for being so helpful and looking after our luggage and getting us a table at the rooftop bar, we will definitely be back I highly recommend this hotel. 10/10 

Thanks Montcalm and especially Natasha and Daniel ❤️",5,2021,09,26
111,Comfortable and excellent service,Fantastic room and service. Mary at reception and the whole team were very efficient. We had a family room with a sofa bed but they gave us two connected rooms with two big beds which was fantastic. They also gave us continental breakfast which wasn’t included in the price originally. Thank you!,5,2021,09,26
111,Excellent,"Stayed here for two nights. Lovely room, clean and comfortable. Had a swim and jacuzzi, bit small but pleasant. Staff in the hotel polite and bent over backwards to help. Daniel one of the concierges was so helpful and could always find time to chat.
Breakfast was excellent in pleasant surroundings with a birds eye view over the city.
Reasonable price for central London. Better to book through their own website as it did work out cheaper. Will definitely stay again.",5,2021,09,22
111,2nd time at this hotel. We will be back!,"Amazing hotel & we will be back! Have stayed here before and treated my partner to a couple of nights & she also really enjoyed it. Staff are excellent, rooms are great, the rooftop bar is amazing and there is  lots to do around the local area. It’s also Short tube to Oxford street shopping as well. On grumble is that 2 pints of larger was £15. Slightly expensive, but worth paying to stay in the hotel. See you again soon!",5,2021,09,21
111,Hotel awful.  Staff did their best.,"Booked a junior suite for 2 nights for
anniversary celebration.  Have stayed in Montcalm standard rooms before in Marble Arch and far superior to this ‘junior suite’.  I had asked for an upgrade - happy to pay before we arrived but was told the room was one of the best??? Room 423.  Early check in requested -and agreed on booking -was a non- starter with me having to unpack a case and change in the toilet in reception.   Room was dirty with a bunch of mouldy grapes under the desk which we reported the following day to reception when we asked for the room to be serviced.  Not acceptable at anytime.  My husband had booked the spa snd was seriously underwhelmed and told 4 times he only had a 30 minute slot.

Continental breakfast was good and staff pleasant but obviously not enough of them!

Anniversary not acknowledged!  Don’t ask if it’s a special occasion if you have no intention of acknowledging!

Definitely not even a 3 star hotel I have stayed in better Travel Lodges in London on business at a quarter of the price.",2,2021,09,19
111,Friends birthday stay,"This was my first stay at the Montcalm Royal London House and I will be back! Booked one night for my friends birthday, which I mentioned to the hotel upon booking. When we arrived the staff had placed birthday balloons, macaroons and a card in the room which made the stay so special. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The continental breakfast was delicious with a lovely selection and freshly made coffee at request. We managed to go to the rooftop for dinner which had a beautiful view - a must if you ever visit! We didn't manage to visit the on site spa as we had quite an action packed couple of days, however I will have to return to make use of this. Thank you to the wonderful team at the Montcalm.",5,2021,09,18
111,WOW Mary was amazing!,"What can we say except wow! From the second we arrived, we were treated with 5* attention.
The receptionist Mary was absolutely lovely. She is a real credit and fantastic ambassador for the company.
We mentioned that the stay was for our 25th wedding anniversary. To which she commented that she would make our stay ‘special’ and boy did she!!!
We had a bottle of wine waiting in our beautiful room for us.  The room was out of this world and the breakfast was second to non.  Will always be staying at the Montcalm in future and recommending it to all our friends and family.",5,2021,09,16
111,Lovely,"Went for an anniversary with my boyfriend. Used justpark app for Barbican car park which was a 10 minute walk. Fabulous location and very central, we were able to check in early to drop our bags off, staff were lovely and friendly. Breakfast was absolutely delicious. Well worth the money and definitely want to return!",5,2021,09,15
111,Anniversary visit to London,"We were moved by Montcalm reservations from the Montcalm Brewery where we have stayed several times. On arriving at the Royal London House we were greeted very warmly by Mary at reception who looked after us during our two-night stay and made sure we had everything we needed. The Hotel was up to the usual Montcalm standard, a beautiful room with a large comfortable bed, choice of pillows, kettle and large bathroom.  To make the Hotel Covid safe we had to phone down for extra pillows, bathrobe and towels and they arrived very quickly. Highly recommend, especially if you arrive at Liverpool station. Very close to Shoreditch too.",4,2021,09,15
111,Beautiful room,Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the Junior suite. Definitely worth paying the extra for the added luxury. The staff who I dealt with were very friendly (Eylor and Mary) and I will definitely be coming back next time I’m in London. 10/10,5,2021,09,15
111,Hospitality A+,Stayed for 2 nights with family. All staff were very nice and helpful. Spacious room with very comfortable bed and some welcome drinks.

111,A lovely stay,Me and my hubby stayed on 15th August.  I was not aware you had to book spa as I knew everything had opened up.  Mary valentina was excellent she sorted out a session for us and was really professional.  She is a credit to the hotel.  We had a lovely stay and breakfast was really nice.  We will return thank you.,5,2021,09,13
111,Birthday celebration,"The staff was welcoming, helpful and friendly especially Daniel. They managed to book us all on the same floor. The dining on the rooftop is amazing with spectacular views. The jacuzzi was like a cherry 🍒 on the top",5,2021,09,11
111,Great Hotel stay,"Stayed only the night but we had excellent service from the time we got in to the time we left. And loved the rain shower in our room, very needed after a hard day photographing and relaxing too. Will definitely like to have another time at this hotel",5,2021,09,10

111,5 Star Every time,"Every time we stay, we still feel amazed by the facilities and how attentive the team are at the Montcalm. The room was amazing and the beds are that comfortable we almost missed breakfast.

Would come back and will come back.",5,2021,09,09

Great service, great hotel and the restaurant and terrace were excellent , we were looked after by a young guy from Italy who was attentive and  friendly yet professional . Late summer cooler weather and we were given a blanket to make sure we weren’t cold .

EVERYONE without question was EXCEPTIONAL.",5,2021,09,09
111,"Amazing hotel, faultless.","From arrival right through until departure, the staff couldn’t have been anymore welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
Perfect location being only a short 5-7 min walk from the tube station and within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants etc.
The hotel interior is beautiful, and the rooms are spacious and well equipped, also very clean throughout. 
The bed was so comfortable and I had the best nights sleep.
The added bonus of this hotel is the gorgeous roof top bar with some amazing views across the city, especially at night.
100% recommend to anyone wanting to opt for a more luxurious hotel and I would definitely stay again, it was worth paying more to experience this 5 star.",5,2021,09,08
111,Incredibly helpful staff,"We had a great time staying at the Montcalm. We had a problem with our booking through a booking agent but they managed to sort everything out for us and nothing was a problem.
The spa is small but worth checking out and the roof terrace is beautiful for breakfast. We really liked the different bars within the hotel.
We would especailly like to thank Mary from reception for all her help.",5,2021,09,08
111,Hen night stay,"As a returning customer, I was yet again impressed by the impeccable service that I got. From the I was warmly greeted and welcomed,  to my express check-in by January (the manager). I really appreciated the lovely welcome notes and treats waiting for me in my room. The hen night was Success as we had all our needs met to by the lovely staff. The spa was relaxing and intimate for just us ladies. The food was just amazing with a nice variation. I honestly wish I could stay another night at that moment. But I would definitely be returning with my husband for his birthday getaway treat. I would definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt if you want an unblemished standard of customer service. 👌",5,2021,09,08
111,Fabulous!!!!!,"January and her amazing team
Could not cater to our needs anymore !! This is what you call excellent customer service !! January went over and beyond to make sure she met and exceeded our expectations. Not to forget to mention that all of her service was served with a beautiful smile and welcoming aura . 

The spa and restaurant facilities added that extra glamour to the stay !

I definitely will visit again ! I would like to Thank you for making my stay special and very enjoyable!!",5,2021,09,06
111,Highly recommend,"My friend had booked this hotel for me for my birthday and I’m honestly lost for words! 

We arrived really early and our room wasn’t available but the staff made us feel so welcome. The reception staff took our bags, charged my friends phone and offered a cup of tea. 

When we did get checked in, we received an upgrade to a beautiful room with literally the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Our bags were brought to our room by the concierge (I wish I remembered his name - he was lovely!) The room was clean, modern and literally had everything you could possibly need. 

We had drinks on the rooftop bar a few times during our stay; drinks are a little pricey but they match the exceptional service and the beautiful view.",5,2021,09,06
111,"Great hotel, super welcoming & helpful staff!","I would like to personally thank January and Tala for making my partner's birthday celebration amazing! From my first email to January, she was a great help with organising our stay. She dealt with a room change and gave us a top floor room with amazing views! I planned to set up some rose petals and both Tala and January went out of their way to help me create a beautiful romantic set-up for my partner. They provided us with a complimentary bottle of wine, little treats and late check-out the morning after!
The hotel itself is within 10 minutes from Liverpool St Station and has a nice atmosphere to it. The room had a great control panel for lighting, heating/air-con and to contact the concierge team. We will definitely be returning in the future and wish to try out the spa service. Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2021,09,06
111,Great hotel with great staff,"I couldn’t fault our stay at all. We were given a bottle of water whilst waiting to check in and our bags were taken to our room by concierge. 

I had previously spoken to Natasha on reception about decorating the room which she kindly organised for me exactly as we had discussed on the phone. 

All staff were very attentive and professional and we will definitely return again in the future.",5,2021,09,05
111,Definitely worth a visit,"A stop over whilst visiting London for the weekend.  

Staff are polite, kind and efficient.
Hotel is clean, has nice facilities, spa and pool available to guests, for a small cost.

Rooms spacious, clean, towels and complementary soap, shampoo and lotions available.  Tea and coffee making facilities and room service available.

Rooftop restaurant and bar, excellent service here.  There is a bar & restaurant downstairs also.  Breakfast is overpriced but food nice.

Nice hotel and would recommend a visit",5,2021,09,05
111,A really welcoming and relaxing stay.,"We came and stayed for one night whilst we were visiting some other attractions in the area. We don’t usually come to the east of London but we will definitely be returning and this is the only choice of hotel for us. All of the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and they really cannot do enough to help you. Daniel, in particular,  was an extremely helpful member of staff and his knowledge of the area is amazing. We enjoyed using the sauna, jacuzzi and pool although a bit on the small side was a refreshing start to the day. We will 100% be coming to stay again in the near future.",5,2021,09,05
111,"Amazing hotel, highly recommend","We had an amazing time at this hotel.  It’s beautifully decorated and cared for, the bars are lovely and the staff are incredibly helpful.  Everything was high quality and the service was superb.  Valentina and Mary at reception were so helpful and welcoming.  The room had everything we needed and more with fun lighting, underfloor heating in the bathroom and a great control panel for everything.  The Aviary bar is lovely and we even had time for a few rounds of shuffleboard at the Burdock bar.  We will definitely be back!",5,2021,09,04
111,Amazing Hotel!,"We had an AMAZING time at the Montcalm Royal London! We were greeted by friendly professional staff, who were warm and approachable throughout our stay! 

Prior to staying at the hotel, I corresponded with the experience manager (January Stevens)! I knew from speaking with her I was going to meet like minded colleagues! January provided an outstanding service from start to finish and although I contacted her several times to confirm plans - she always made me feel welcome! I never once felt like I was bothering her! Then to finally meet her during my stay was incredible, it was like meeting a celebrity!

We had complimentary wine and treats in our room with birthday balloons! 

I’m sure you will enjoy your stay at the hotel, well, I hope you do, as we did! 

Nicola",5,2021,09,04
111,In London on business,"I have stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House (City of London) Hotel before and decided to stay here again, as it was near where I needed to be. It was my first time back in London for 18 x months. I booked for myself and two colleagues.
As usual all of the staff were warm and welcoming, very attentive and kind. I felt safe in the entrance area and in the reception area too. My bedroom was beautiful and I loved the bathroom. Breakfast was delicious. I enjoyed my two night's stay here very much, as did my colleagues who were very impressed with the hotel and the team. I was particularly impressed with Fenna and Mary on reception - very professional and caring.",5,2021,09,03
111,Great overnight stay,"We booked this hotel to celebrate our anniversary. On arrival we were greeted warmly at reception, with our bags being moved for us. Mary checked us in and was very informative about our stay. She was efficient and friendly when communicating with us.
Our hotel room was large and generally clean. A lovely card and bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room. Breakfast was a buffet service but we were able to order additional towels from the kitchen, which they were more than happy to prepare.
Our interaction with all staff throughout our stay was great as they were courteous and helpful. We accessed the club lounge as part of our room and it was a pleasant environment but a bit cold. Wine, spirits and a small snack selection was available. When checking out it was great to see Mary again who was just as polite and friendly when we were leaving.",5,2021,09,02
111,The staff are the best part of this hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay but the staff at the hotel really did make it feel like a 5* stay. Mary at reception was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make it possible for us to check in earlier than the 2pm check in time. We also found two of the concierge men (didn’t manage to catch their names) extremely polite and helpful. The hotel room was clean and the bed was the comfiest bed that I’ve stayed in at a hotel. 

As we were only there for one night we didn’t have the chance to try the spa facilities. We will definitely be staying again next time we come to London",5,2021,08,31
111,Lovely stay,"We stayed for one night, the staff very welcoming, Mary in particular. Room was a good size and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The TV had good channels as well, we would definitely recommend.     .",5,2021,08,30
111,Birthday visit with family and friends,"An amazing stay at the Montcalm in London. The staff were brilliant and could not help you enough. We had an upgrade to include breakfast and drinks in the club lounge ,which was an unexpected treat. It was busy because of Bank Holiday so the service in the club lounge was slow but I guess that’s normal for Bank Holiday. We booked into the pool with our children who want to go back and stay there again as soon as possible! They mentioned it as one of the best things about London! Lovely lighting features in the room and super comfortable beds.Bottle of fizz in our room because it was my birthday and brilliant location for getting around. The rooftop restaurant was absolutely stunning , we have travelled a lot but never seen views like that. Staff were lovely and great food and cocktails . We will be back !",5,2021,08,30
111,I’ll be back!,"Stayed here for just one night with a friend whilst visiting London. What a refreshing hotel, it’s in a great location, they have very friendly staff (especially Mary!), it’s extremely clean, modern, one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on, amazing value, couldn’t be happier!",5,2021,08,29
111,Two star experience for cost of four stars,"Overall the experience was really disappointing.

Check in took 45 minutes, and while covid is making some things slower the length of time it took to check in wasn’t purely covid related.  Staff apologies at delay were lip service and only two of the three check in desks were in use which was surprising given the check in line (again not covid related as the two open ones were right next to each other and staff were in abundance but no one seemed able or willing to to fill the extra check in desk. )

Hotel food at breakfast was of disappointing quality. I’d expect more for the 22 pound per head cost.  

Rooms were ok but amenities were non existent and sound proofing between rooms meant little sleep. When I spoke to reception they quoted covid as the reason. I think this is an easy cop out as many other establishments we have stayed at recently have been able to provide amenities even if in a different way.

All in all it was a two star experience for a four star price. I’d not recommend or stay at one of their properties again.",2,2021,08,28
111,Amazing Hen do weekend stay!!!  Highly recommend. The hotel is beautiful. The stay was sooo comfortable.,We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London house this weekend. From the moment we stepped in we were treated soooooo well. We went stayed as part of my friends hen do. We ended up with all of us on the same floor which was arranged at check in. Thank you,5,2021,08,28
111,Fenna and team! Great getaway! ,"My first ""holiday"" away from home in a year and it did not disappoint at all. 

Absolutely amazing hotel and staff who made this an absolutely wonderful experience. Kindness goes a long way and Fenna at reception set the perfect scene from check in with brilliant service and hospitality, what was lovely about this is that it was the attitude of all the employees here, the standard is incredibly high suited to all types of guests.

The rooms were comfy but if want a treatment book way on advance, it is worth it.

Thank you so much ",5,2021,08,28
111,Wonderful hotel,"The first thing that struck me about this hotel was the incredibly warm welcome by the staff. They were so helpful and friendly. I would particularly like to mention Mary, Hamid and Daniel who were absolutely brilliant and a real credit to the hotel. The hotel itself is really lovely and we really enjoyed the continental breakfast and using the pool. We would love to return next time we are in London- the children were keen for me to extend our stay!",5,2021,08,27
111,Staff Is So Warming,Our Experience Here Was Phenomenal.. The Staff Were All Welcoming & The Best Hospitality Experience In London For A Long Time.. Thank You For Your Help Hamid.. You Were Awesome xx We Would Definately Recommend This Hotel ..,5,2021,08,26
111,Birthday stay,"This was our second time staying at the Montcalm and it didn’t disappoint. Ahead of our stay I emailed guest experience at the hotel and asked if there were any special birthday touches which could be arranged for my boyfriends birthday which January arranged for us with complimentary balloons, a card and a bottle of Merlot.  January was so helpful and personally greeted us at check in and saw us to our room. A trip to their rooftop bar the Aviary is a must also but you’ll have to book in advance. The service I received both times stay at the Montcalm was outstanding and I recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the hub of London. We will be returning soon. Special thank you to January again! :)",5,2021,08,23
111,Lovely stay,"I planned our stay here alongside my planned proposal to my girlfriend of 5 years. I contacted the hotel in advance and they offered some things to make our weekend even more special. This included a decorated room and a complimentary bottle of Prosecco! Natasha on reception was very helpful in organizing this for us! 

We had a fantastic weekend and all went to plan. The only couple of things I would criticise is the fact that the fridge in the room was simply not cold enough. And for the spa/pool, you have to arrive in dressing gown and slippers which some people might not like. I assume there are no lockers or changing rooms.

But all in all, we had an excellent stay, and I can't thank the brilliant staff enough.",5,2021,08,23
111,"Great location, good value but don’t expect 5*","First impressions of the Montcalm were good. As there was a queue to check in, a member of staff was providing bottles of water to guests, a nice touch. Check in prompt and smooth. Room was quite nice and very clean, however we were provided twin beds with separate duvets for a couple. Not ideal but I didn’t feel the need to be moved rooms. Some really good ideas,  I liked the lighting options in the room but the electronic touch screen to control air con and lighting was slow and unresponsive. 

The spa experience was not great, you are allowed half an hour a slot and it seemed to be a bit crowded. Also I personally felt a little bit uncomfortable as other guests were filming in the pool. Not very relaxing. My robe that was provided had a couple of holes in it, again a minor issue but for a 5 star hotel you expect this attention to detail. 

The burdock bar downstairs was welcoming and had a nice atmosphere and drink selection. Unfortunately we could not go to the Aviary rooftop bar as it was a Saturday and was full, which was a shame but I should of booked ahead.

My major disappointment was breakfast. We were not informed of breakfast times and where this is served when checking in, therefore on the way out to dinner the night before we enquired at reception. We were told breakfast is 6.30-11.00 served in the Aviary. So in the morning we go for breakfast at 10.00 only to be told breakfast is finished. Reception had told us the wrong times. We were not offered if we wanted breakfast in the room by the Aviary staff but my partner saw the sign so called to order when back in our room. Room service breakfast was fine but I was unhappy as I wanted to eat in the restaurant, then had to pay a service charge for the privilege! This was mentioned upon checking out and we were given a genuine apology by reception but no refund of the service charge.

All in all the Montcalm offers good value if you book on a deal, sadly I would not recommend to others based on this experience which is a shame as I feel with a little bit of improvement this could be a great place to stay. I would say this is more of a 3* hotel from my experience, just don’t expect luxury.",3,2021,08,23
111,Incredible stay!,"The staff were the most attentive of any hotel I’ve been to. They went above and beyond to make it such a wonderful stay. 
The room was spotless, a great size with a smart TVs and a very comfortable bed. 
We stayed for 3 nights and it’s got the be the best hotel I’ve stayed in, in London! 
I’m very excited to come again!",5,2021,08,22
111,Amazing stay!,"Booked the hotel, because of the spa facilities. From the start at the reception, the staff were very nice and very attentive to our needs. When I called the reception for robes to be brought to the room, it didn't even take 2 minutes before someone was knocking at my hotel door with the robes. You have to book the spa facilities in advance which I didn't mind, considering how we live now due to Covid, it restricts the number of people using the facilities at any given time which is great. My wife and I enjoyed our stay and will definitely be coming back.",5,2021,08,21
111,A relaxing stay,Our recent visit to this hotel was exceptional! The hotel is in a great location and we enjoyed the Aviary rooftop bar at the hotel (we booked this prior to arriving). The staff were very friendly and accommodating (particularly Daniel). We had to book the spa access prior to our visit but we didn’t feel rushed when we were there. A very relaxing stay overall.,5,2021,08,21
111,Birthday Surprise,"We checked into your hotel on the 10/8/21  as a getaway for my husband’s birthday
On arrival reception was lovely, professional and courteous 
There was confusion regarding the spa - although it was included in our booking 
we went down to book the day before but when we went down the following morning - was told the booking was for a spa and not a massage which wasn’t what i requested for so we left

My husband was very upset as it was supposed to be a birthday treat
In desperation I went to the reception desk to ask if there was any where around that we could go for a manicure and pedicure 
I was directed to Daniel - the concierge 
He was amazing!!!!
Not only did he reassure me he will find us somewhere 
He was on the phone immediately 
Found us somewhere, booked a cab to take us
He went outside with us make sure we were in the cab
He did all this with such eagerness, effortlessly and joyfully
It was such an amazing encounter with Daniel , his efforts made the bad experience     with the spa to quickly disappear and the place he found us was amazing 
We just want to mention that Daniel is such a valuable asset to the hotel 
We also noticed later his courteousness extends to all who come to the hotel
Please extend our huge gratitude to him 
He made a massive impression which will
never be forgotten !!!!
He is truly an amazing asset to your hotel",5,2021,08,21
111,Faultless experience,"An amazing time was had at the Montcalm as part of my boyfriends birthday celebrations! From start to finish January and the team helped me make the occasion as special and stress-free as possible, with countless personal complimentary touches and upgrades to a personal greet on departure, we truly felt very well looked after and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms, services and amenities all live up to its 5* standard. January truly went above and beyond to accommodate us and the rest of the staff at the hotel made the occasion that bit more special. We are looking forward to our next stay whenever that may be!",5,2021,08,20
111,Def not 5 star,"Disappointing stay was more like a 3 star. Room was small, no nice touches, no robes as advertised, coffee machine but sugar/coffee etc wasn’t replaced so could only use it one morning despite our room being cleaned, although cleaning was poor. 

Impossible to contact reception or room service to rectify problems no one answers the phone. 

Air con didn’t work well so slept poorly. Breakfast is a buffet similar to what you’d get in a premier inn with poor service. 

Don’t normally write reviews but wouldn’t want anyone else being disappointed expecting a 5 star hotel and getting this.",3,2021,08,19
111,Simply Amazing!,"Such a warm welcome and received a welcome card from Manager Mr. Deepak's card was both surprising and amazing. Staff at front desk were genuinely attentive and caring. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The bed was luxuriously comfortable, Location of Hotel is at the heart of London. The hotel itself is beautiful and comfortable with staff who took a genuine interest in making our family stay special. Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone shopping or visiting London.",5,2021,08,18
111,Fantastic from beginning to end...,"From the minute we walked through the door to the morning we checked out, the service was faultless. Friendly and knowledgable staff, sizeable rooms (very comfortable bed) and a fantastic rooftop bar called the Aviary, where breakfast is also served. This is a must to visit of an afternoon/evening as well...we got particularly lucky with great weather!
Thank you to Valentina and everyone at the Montcalm for a wonderful weekend, we would definitely stay again and highly recommend!",5,2021,08,18
111,Highly recommended,Extremely happy with the service as all staff made my partner and I feel welcome. Would definitely go Back again. Pool and hot tub were very nice. Breakfast buffet was also tasty. Quick service from staff consistently which was great,5,2021,08,17
111,"Absolutely fine, but nothing special.","On arrival at Montcalm it was not clear where to book in. The reception is not at the entrance and only by wandering down the corridor could we see reception.  Having left our luggage as we were early we headed to the Burdock for a coffee and waited at the sign asking us to ""wait here to be seated"". As it was lunchtime this took 5 mins, but as there were only 3 customers already seated I don't know how it took 5 mins for a surly woman to point us to a table and ask what we wanted before we'd sat or seen the menu. This cafe may be aiming for shabby chic but it only manages shabby; stained cushions, scuffed mismatched furniture and parquet flooring which needs sanding and polishing. But the coffee was v nice.

After our show our bags had been taken to our room. I can't complain about the view as it's London City so never going to be picturesque. However i can complain about thin holey towels, stained grouting and shower surround, and dusty surfaces.  I think the curtain on one window was stuck, but at least it was closed. I have to say the bed was very comfortable though.

We also ate at the Aviary as there are limited options in the city on Sunday night, inflated London prices for a nice meal, nothing spectacular, service rather hit and miss. Apparently there is a dress code but evidently not one which is followed by staff or customers.

The lighting in the corridors makes the whole hotel interior dark and dingy, and I will not be looking at a return trip to any Montcalm hotel based on this experience.",3,2021,08,17
111,Fantastic Weekend Stay,"Just back from a 3 night stay in a Club Double and couldn’t recommend this place enough.

The staff are a credit to the hotel, always friendly and on hand if you need anything.

The room and bathroom were of a good size, and the bed one of the comfiest I’ve ever slept in. It was explained to us on check in that due to COVID the rooms were not serviced unless requested, however on returning to the room on Sunday we found that it had indeed been serviced. Staying in a ‘club’ room includes a continental breakfast-we didn’t expect much but were pleasantly surprised at what was available. It also gave access to the lounge for drinks and snacks on an evening which was great for a quick beer before heading out for dinner.

We used the Spa during our stay. I’d emailed ahead prior to our stay to book this, and on arrival to the spa there was a bit of confusion but this was easily rectified.  We didn’t use the roof top bar during our stay but heard good things from speaking to people in the lifts.

We will definitely look to use the Montcalm chain again when in London.",5,2021,08,17
111,Perfect stay!,"Our stay at The Montcalm was amazing!! All the staff,  especially Andreea, were incredible - so attentive and made our time perfect - everything we asked for was sorted without a problem! The room was beautiful, and the rooftop bar was incredible - the staff were amazing and made our trip amazing! Thank you Montcalm!!",5,2021,08,17
111,Beautiful hotel with great service,"Stayed here at the weekend with my husband for a night away on our own without the children, relaxation and shopping.
We stayed in a Montcalm Club double room with a lovely view looking over Finsbury Square. The room was beautiful, exceptionally clean, lovely big bathroom, very comfortable bed and it was very quiet. 
We had wine and macarons left in the room for us and our bag was brought up to the room after we checked in. 
We had a problem with the air con in the room that wasnt able to be fixed but we were offered to either change the room or have a fan brought in.
We used the spa we had previously booked and robes and towels were also delivered to our room.
The complimentary drinks and snacks before we went out for dinner was a lovely touch as well.
Breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice, tea, coffee and juice.
All of the staff were friendly, attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. Special mention to Mary who checked us in and out and Daniel who was one of the friendliest people we have ever met and treated us like royalty. We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone and look forward to our future stays.",5,2021,08,16
111,"Nice room, lovely bar, great location, but just falls short on some of the smaller details.","We couldn’t fault much at the Montcalm but there were a few small niggles that you don’t expect from a 5 star hotel.

On arrival, we had a friendly welcome and were advised that there were no robes or coffee machine in our room and they were available on request. We asked if we could have both and the robes turned up 20 minutes later but the coffee machine never arrived. Not a big deal and we didn’t chase it up but it was a little frustrating when I remembered on Saturday morning and really wanted a coffee!

When we booked we were asked how we wanted our room to smell with a range of fragrances available so we chose orange blossom! We also had a choice 4 or 5 different pillows both of which we thought were nice touches…or at least they would have been if we’d actually had them but there was no fragrance to the room and we had standard pillows. However, the bed was really comfortable and probably one of the best we’ve ever stayed in so it wasn’t much of a problem. I don’t think we missed the smell of oranges either but if you’re going to advertise these extras you should probably actually deliver them.

We stayed for 2 nights and after the first night we thought maybe the room might have been cleaned or at least the bottle of water in our room replaced but it was left untouched. Again, not a big deal but frustrating when you get back after a day out when other 5 star hotels we’ve stayed in would have refreshed the water and made the bed. We later found out that there was a button on the touchscreen display to request your room to be cleaned but this wasn’t very clear and it wasn’t really necessary to have it cleaned, just a made bed and a fresh bottle of water would have been nice.

When visiting the pool we went down in our robes and signed in. We weren’t given towels but assumed maybe they were by the pool area. However, they weren’t which meant we had to return to our rooms wet in our robes. As with the other grumbles, not a big deal at all but just small annoyances that you don’t expect from a 5 star hotel.

We tried booking in to the rooftop Aviary bar several days before we arrived but it was fully booked online so we sent an email to see if we might be able to get in if there were any cancellations. We were told there was some availability for drinks but it would be subject to a £100 minimum spend. Now we both like a drink or two but I’m not sure the two of us could have drank that much! We tried our luck on Saturday night anyway and managed to get in quite easily and were lucky enough to actually get a “VIP” sofa. We had a cracking view and it’s a lovely bar but we were glad we hadn’t agreed to the pre-booked minimum spend. We would have also been very disappointed if we’d paid the £500 deposit required to secure the sofa when booking online. Don’t get me wrong,  the view is great but I don’t feel it justifies forcing a minimum spend or taking a £500 deposit for just 2 people as it really didn’t feel that VIP.

Our breakfast was in the same bar on Sunday morning and unsurprisingly many people did the same as us and had a lie in and arrived just before the 10 o’clock cut off. Whilst I appreciate this is probably quite annoying for the staff it’s not really surprising on a Sunday but they didn’t seem prepared for it and it was quite chaotic with no plates and no coffee. They were replaced after a small wait and the food itself was ok but I would have expected more at over £20 a head.

I should say though that despite a few grumbles this is a nice hotel. Our room was spacious and well appointed with a huge TV that had Sky TV (complete with Sky Sports) which I’m not sure I’ve ever had in a hotel room. This was a nice surprise as it allowed me to watch the cricket whilst my wife was getting ready! The pool and jacuzzi are good, if a little small. The location is great with Moorgate tube station only a short walk away and Shoreditch and other Central City areas not far away either. The staff were all helpful and polite and none of the problems mentioned above took away from our stay too much. However, I feel that when you decide to treat yourself to staying in a 5 star hotel you do so in expectation that those little details are taken care of. 

Overall we had a fab anniversary weekend and by booking direct with the hotel we got a pretty good deal. I would still recommend the Montcalm as a good place to stay but I’m just not sure we really got the full 5 star experience and our own 4 star review reflects that.",4,2021,08,15
111,A wonderful stay!,"My daughter and I spent a wonderful night at the hotel and amazing cocktails with friends in the rooftop Aviary bar.
The staff were friendly and attentive and the bedroom perfect.
Can’t wait to stay again!",5,2021,08,15
111,Fantastic hotel with exceptional service,"Booked a quadruple room through booking.com.  Room was 2 adjoining doubles - initially the inter-connecting door was locked and rooms set up as 2 x doubles but this was soon corrected.  Rate included use of the swimming pool and jacuzzi downstairs - note this needs Pre booking and children only allowed 9am-midday.  Our rate included access to the Club Room - open 5.30-8.30pm Friday and Saturday - free drinks, nibbles, fierce aircon and great people watching of people stumbling out from the Roof Terrace bar.  TV in room had all sky channels. Minibar was empty so could be used for bottled water - freely supplied by hotel.  Aircon, lights, cleaning all controlled from the panel by the bathroom.  Bonus was we thought the rate included continental breakfast in the Club Room but Roof Terrace breakfast was also included.  Also staff on roof terrace booked us a last minute table for Pre dinner drinks on 2 nights (children only allowed before 6pm). 
Only problems were a very rude Bar Manage in the downstairs lobby bar and the pool booking for children rules and the fact that the rules are not communicated in advance or consistently applied to all guests.",5,2021,08,15
111,Amazing experience,I stayed here yesterday and the staff was fantastic.

111,One of our most Amazing memories thanks to Mary & Daniel,"Wow oh Wow !! Apologies I’m as working class as they come & I wanted to treat my Wife to celebrate our first wedding anniversary & I’m so glad I chose the Montcalm Royal London to celebrate. I had previously stayed at the Montcalm Marble Arch as a treat to my Wife for our Engagement & also had an amazing time. But our stay at Montcalm Royal London just honestly blew every hotel we’ve ever stayed at away !! I phoned the hotel the day before our stay, which is hard for me because I just don’t like asking for anything & don’t like being a nuisance & also appreciate that a top London Hotel would probably be really busy. As soon as I called I spoke to Mary who was just so caring & listened & just honestly cared which was just so so lovely. I told Mary that I was treating my Wife to our upcoming stay which was a total surprise to my Wife & just asked if it was ok to send to the hotel a couple of gifts from M&S & if they could be put in our room on our actual wedding anniversary just to make another surprise for my Wife as we had had a lockdown wedding when it was first allowed again after the total lockdown & just to feel normal again. Mary very kindly said it was no problem at all & was just so so lovely & helpful. I work for the service industry & always give my very best & will do everything for anyone but find it hard asking for things for myself & it was just so lovely speaking to Mary who just so understood & really wanted us to have a wonderful stay right from the start. I also wondered if Mary could kindly help with recommending any restaurants or if we could book anything as the hotels Aviary restaurant was fully booked because of Covid restrictions but it was lovely to know that breakfast was actually served each morning in the Aviary which was lovely to know as I had seen the pictures on the hotels website & the view looked fabulous. Mary very kindly took my number & said she would kindly get the concierge to give me a call who would be able to help me, Wow that’s what I call service & Mary hoped to meet us the next day. Shortly after I received a call from Daniel the concierge from the Montcalm Royal London who was just so so lovely !! Mary had kindly briefed him that I was just trying to add a few finishing touches to my Wife’s first wedding anniversary weekend stay. I asked Daniel if he could kindly recommend anything for our first evening upon arrival to get something to eat & he very kindly checked if we had any dietary requirements & if we had any preferences & as we don’t it was just lovely to be under the careful hands of Daniel to    recommend & help. I also asked Daniel to help with our actual Wedding Anniversary evening meal & Daniel was only more than happy to help, I’d asked for anything around 7pm but we would be flexible & just more than happy for anything especially as it was a weekend & I had basically left it to the day before we arrived. Just speaking to Daniel was so lovely & I honestly felt like royalty with Mary & Daniels help. Daniel kindly asked if it was ok to call me back once he had made our bookings which was just so so lovely. True to Daniel’s word shortly after he kindly called back & explained he had booked us into Sagardi  London for our first evening meal & Piazza Italian for our Wedding Anniversary & had very kindly advised the restaurants of our occasion. Daniel would be looking forward to our arrival bless him. Omg !! We hadn’t even arrived yet & I was just blown away by the level of service. This was seriously going to be so special for my Wife & a well earned break for me, even I was excited & my Wife’s case was all packed ready for the surprise the following day Friday that we were going away for the Weekend & retuning on Monday. The Big Day !! We arrived at the Montcalm Royal London & were kindly shown to the reception for checking in & as soon as I mentioned our name Mary was there & just said it was just so lovely speaking to me & gave us such a lovely welcome & to my Wife & just made us feel so so special it really was just so lovely. Reception kindly helped us booking in for breakfast for our stay explained the hotel & advised us the spa was open!! Yeeeey as sadly due to Covid the one at Marble Arch was understandable closed for safety, I’d looked at the pictures on the Royal London & it was just amazing & we couldn’t wait to use it during our stay. Mary very kindly introduced us to Daniel the Concierge & it was just so so lovely to meet him. He was as excited as we were that he had arranged our evening restaurant bookings. We were helped up to our room & Wow oh Wow it was absolutely Amazing the Queen Bed the space the Amazing bathroom Shower the massive television everything my Wife was in tears of gratitude. Knock Knock omg!! a beautiful surprise from the hotel Mary kindly arranged for a bottle of wine to be sent up to our room complimentary of the hotel for our Wedding Anniversary. Wow oh Wow !! We got changed & went down to reception just to say thank you for our lovely surprise & just to thank them for the room it was just so so lovely. The concierge very kindly helped get us a taxi to Sagardi & even kindly lent us a couple of umbrellas as it was pouring down lol usually does on my days off. We arrived at Sagardi & Wow !! Daniel really had tipped them off we were welcomed by we so hope you have a lovely Wedding Anniversary & we’re just so well looked after, Wow what a evening. We returned to our hotel & finished the evening at the hotel with a few cocktails & played Shuffleboard oh it was absolutely brilliant all the hotel staff were truly amazing. We returned to our room & I honestly think I had one of the best nights sleep ever as the bed was amazing. We awoke & it was lovely to wake my Wife up to the Nespresso posh coffee pods & biscuits we were just so rested. I gave my lovely Wife her few presents I had secretly packed & she was just so happy. We got ready & went up to the Aviary for breakfast as it was now our Anniversary & we’re just blown away with the view & kindly asked if we would like any beverages tea, coffee & explained the self service breakfast. After a lovely cappuccino we went up to where breakfast was all laid out & were absolutely blown away at the choice & how it was all beautifully laid out. Well we so enjoyed breakfast & departed to the room we opened the door & their were our M&S flowers & Champagne & Chocolates my Wife was so so happy. I called the concierge & they very kindly brought up a vase & ice bucket & champagne flutes it was so so lovely. We left for a walk & just had to pop down & thank Daniel for recommending Sagardi & to let him know that we had just had the best ever time. They kindly recommend we pop down to the spa to book our spot which we did & they were so helpful. We ventured out & I took my Wife to Jack the Ripper Museum lol really interesting & set out so well. I was honestly so blown away with our hotel I wanted to surprise them & ordered 24 Krispy Kreme donuts for the reception & concierge team hoping they would get a break & a donut whilst we were out & just to say thank you for everything. We had a lovely day out & returned to the hotel to get changed & grab a couple of amazing cocktails before we went for our next adventure that Daniel had kindly arranged at Piazza Italiana. On arrival at our room was a beautiful note & a bottle of champagne from the hotel manager thanking us for the lovely surprise & to say the team absolutely loved our treat the donuts we were blown away, I went down to say thank you & complain because I had only done it as a small treat & just say thank you for everything the manager came out & said thank you it really lifted the whole team, Awww it was so so lovely. We visited the Spa & it was absolutely fabulous & then went to get changed & ready for our evening meal. The concierge kindly helped us with a taxi again to Piazza Italiana  wow oh Wow!! On arrival it was beautiful & Daniel had certainly told them it was our Anniversary we were so so looked after it was truly one of the best evenings we’ve ever had. The restaurant even gave us a beautiful surprise box with little bottles of limoncello with our names on we were blown away. We returned to our hotel & had a couple of cocktails before retiring to our room. Another Fabulous sleep breakfast & trip to spa it was relaxing day till another surprise for my Wife to see Six at the theatre. We saw Daniel & just couldn’t thank him enough for such an amazing evening we had had under his recommendation & booking. We had asked for a top up of coffee pods & water & nothing was to much trouble we truly were having the time of our lives. After a restful day we visited the Aviary as it wasn’t raining & they very kindly let us go outside for cocktails as you do normally have to book in advance. It was beautiful sitting outside before we headed off to the theatre, I’d definitely recommend Six it was amazing & we visited Chinatown & The Golden Dragon Restaurant China Town oh Wow amazing. We returned to our hotel for nightcaps a fabulous sleep Amazing breakfast again trip to spa & then sadly pack our bags. We went down to reception we both could nearly cry because we were greeted by Mary & Daniel we thanked them so so much for truly making memories we will never forget. Daniel even kindly arranged for a coffee whilst I settled up. The manager even came out to thank us for being such lovely guests we truly were just so so spoilt. It was so funny people watching whilst we were drinking our coffee & watching the normal members of public booking in, in such a rush & sometimes rude why I’ll never know!! Maybe we had just been such a change for the hotel but it’s just how I am & we were just so thankful. One last teary eyed goodbye & promise to return we just honestly cannot recommend the Montcalm Royal London Hotel Enough & would just say be nice & thankful & who knows you may get a magical stay like we did. Thank You Montcalm Wayne & Michelle Thurston",5,2021,08,14
111,End of Week Stay - wowcher purchase,"We had a lovely stay at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel. We purchased a wowcher deal for an end of week stay which included breakfast, spa access, local map and late check out. The hotel is beautiful and the hotel staff are extremely helpful. I would say that it is very difficult to get through to the hotel prior to your stay if you have any queries. I resulted in emailing/calling head office, so keep this in mind.

We wanted to book spa treatments which we understood were not included in our package. I called the spa 2 weeks prior to our stay to sadly be informed that they were fully booked. I was notified that the spa is actually not part of the hotel, despite being in the building. Therefore they accept clients not staying, which was a bit disappointing. We were able to use the spa facilities which we had to book a time slot for. The pool and jacuzzi is great and not too busy! We were provided with robes in our room to go down in. 

We didn't choose to have dinner at the Aviary but we did book to have drinks. We called to say we were running late and spoke to a lovely man Mohammedul who said this would be ok. Just note, the Aviary is separate from the hotel as well therefore any booking concerns/enquiries need to go direct to them and not through the hotel. 

Our breakfast in the morning was great with a variety of full english and continental foods. Staff were helpful and friendly.",4,2021,08,13
111,Lovely hotel amazing staff,The hotel was very clean and tidy. The staff could not of been any friendlier or helpful. We had our room upgraded and had a lovely view over the park. Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of items and great coffee. A big thanks to all the reception staff. The staff member (sorry forgot his name)that booked us in on the afternoon of the 11th august was a star as was our checkout staff member Fenna Valentina. Nothing was too much effort.,5,2021,08,12
111,A Relaxing Sunday evening,"This was our second one night London break at this hotel and it will not be the last. The hotel is in a great position with the City and the Thames within walking distance and the excellent Spitalfields market close by as well as being very near a number of tube stations. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the swimming pool was an added bonus and the room extremely quiet and comfortable as well as being very spacious for a hotel in this location.",5,2021,08,10
111,Wonderful stay,"Me and my boyfriend had the most amazing stay here, it was our anniversary and Daniel the concierge went above and beyond to ensure it was perfect for us so thank you kindly for your hospitality . The spa was great and my massage treatment was even better. Will definitely  return.",5,2021,08,09
111,"I would like to say if you are thinking of booking a stay at the Montcalm Royal London house, DO IT!!","I have never experienced a hotel which puts so much effort into ensuring each guests stay is exceptional. We usually stay at Montcalm Royal London house and never once has a stay disappointed in any way and the staff will always go above and beyond. A massive thank you to January Stevens who organised for our birthday stay to be made extra special with balloons , truffles and even a complimentary upgrade which was the most lovely surprise! There is a luggage store so you never have to worry about your bags whilst exploring the city and having the Aviary restaurant in the building is so convenient as the food is amazing and you can enjoy your meal whilst taking in the most breath-taking views of London. We really cannot thank the team at Montcalm and January enough for really making our weekend so special and we are already excited to book our next stay!",5,2021,08,09
111,"Great hotel, nice location,","It has great facilities and looks really nice inside. We drunk the rooftop bar which has great views, the rooms are nice. At check in both Mary and Valentina were a huge help and made us feel welcome. The breakfast was decent. I didn’t give the hotel full marks because I feel as though it is slightly overpriced but not frantically so and we didn’t make use of all facilities so it could be slightly unfair",4,2021,08,09
111,Just Perfect !!!!,"We booked a one night stay for 4 Ladies to celebrate a birthday, We fancied a night away now things are returning to normal.
On arrival the staff we friendly and helpful, kindly arranging two rooms together, the rooms were totally amazing, classy and importantly very clean, all the little extras (water, toiletries, slippers) were a lovely touch.
We ate dinner in The Aviary Restaurant, both the food and the cocktails were first class.
We really can’t recommend the Hotel highly enough and will most definitely be returning.
A big shout out to Pamela on reception who was simply lovely ( as were all the staff).
We all look forward to seeing you again.

A little tip, make sure you book for The Spa as soon as you arrive as the popular times get booked up very quickly.",5,2021,08,09
111,Lovely stay,"I had the most lovely stay at the Montcalm royal with my boyfriend for our two year anniversary.

Firstly Elyor kindly upgraded us to a suite which was decked out with rose petals, balloons, chocolate and wine. After checking in we progressed to the Aviary roof terrace where we had a delicious meal whilst looking out over the beautiful London Skyscape. Service was absolutely fantastic and the food was even better.

We made it back to our room in time to watch love island from the comfort of our huge bed. 

Thank you so much to Mary and Elyor for looking after us so well.",5,2021,08,09
111,WONDERFUL PEOPLE - WONDERFUL HOTEL,"Never in all of my time of staying at hotels for Business or Pleasure have i been treated as well as i have in this Hotel.

Even down to the little things of it raining outside and reception kindly offering umbrellas 

If you are looking for amazing service a well run hotel and beautiful rooms then I can't recommend any more",5,2021,08,08
111,Lovely hotel,Our stay was very good. The staff were helpful. Our room was beautiful and we enjoyed the different facilities we had. We enjoyed the mood lighting and the toiletries as well as the bathroom. Little things like the personalised card was thoughtful. The only downside would be the room service charge was quite expensive. Having a late check out was nice.,5,2021,08,08
111,Amazing,From the start we had an amazing lovely welcome from mary who informed us about everything that the hotel has to offer. That evening we had an amazing time on the top floor bar with stephan making amazing drinks. One of the security guards were also really really helpful with making sure we were safe but i didn't grab his name (just knew he was from romania but lived in italy for a long time. The room was superb so so so comfortable and at check out it was very friendly where pamela made sure we had an excellent time :) cannot reccomend it enough. Thank you for making out one night holiday so special. ,5,2021,08,08
111,One of the best hotels I’ve been to!,"Definitely will be returning, staff are all very welcoming and polite. Rooms are very modern and spacious, coming with many facilities, catering Dow
all. Food was divine and quick to be served, great atmosphere. The views from the aviary was amazing also!",5,2021,08,07
111,Excellent 5* Stay great service!,"Stayed for a Birthday (May 2021) and again for an anniversary and a wedding. (July/aug 2021) . We stayed in room 702/703. LOVE this room as its spacious, extremly clean and had everything we needed. Room had everything we needed, bathrobe, slippers, elemis toiletries etc. Cleaners were great, when your ready to get your room cleaned you just call reception and let them know, so no one disturbing you at random times.
Both stays on different occasions was perfect staff are so helpful and nothing is at all any trouble. From checking in leaving my bags and asking to use an umbrella to the catering at breakfast for dietary requirments everyone was so helpful. Deepak hotel manager was once again superb to make our stay perfect everytime. Restrictions has been lifted, the breakfast is on the top floor and is a buffet. We didnt use the club lounge but had this included. The spa area you have to book a 30min slot, we also booked a treatment. This was ok, on our recent visit the sauna and jaquzzi was out of use (broken) which was a shame so we ended up only having our treatment even though we paid for a 2hour use of the spa. Hotel is located close to liverpool st station and moorgate station. We actually drove and right opposite the hotel you have a NCP car park. 

Overall perfect stay and we will be using Montcalm hotels more often. ",5,2021,08,06
111,Fabulous stay which we loved and we will be booking again,Fantastic stay with our 3 teenagers. The hotel is wonderful but the one thing that stands out is the attentive and professional staff who are not over formal and made you feel relaxed and looked after. In particular the bar manager and the 2 bar attendants on the ground floor. Also the manager at breakfast and Bruno our waiter in the Avairy where we enjoy an amazing dinner. We will be booking again. The hotel is located in a great spot with stunning views.,5,2021,08,06

111,"Good Hotel, Great Staff","Me and my wife stopped at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel for 3 nights, first impressions were great, staff really helpful, great location not far from the underground which was fantastic, the only issue was it was a bit on the expensive side, the room was a bit small , needed a few more touches to meet the 5 star rating but the bed was so comfy and the rooms were also very quiet so all in all a great stay.",4,2021,08,06

111,Wonderful stay,"Myself and my Husband booked to stay for the weekend for our Wedding Anniversary.
It couldn’t have been more perfect, with the added surprise of our room being decorated with petals, balloons, wine and chocolates.
The room was spotless, and I’m quite picky!
The staff throughout the hotel, from the bars, restaurant, reception & concierge are all impeccable, nothing was too much trouble and their attentiveness is amazing. 
The food in The Aviary is wonderful, as are the cocktails.
The surrounding area has a lot of development going on, so I hope it will become an area to appeal.
I’d highly recommend staying here, I’d happily return.",5,2021,08,02
111,Birthday get away!,"Me and my partner came away for a night for a birthday treat! And the initial welcome was great and was greeted with a warm welcome  at the check in desk from Valentina and Mary, who were so helpful and friendly.
Once we headed up to our room, we soon realised that our room was upgraded for the special occasion due to free availability courtesy of the hotel! 
Also I had a beautiful bouquet of roses awaiting our room and a selection of macaroons! 
It was a beautiful stay and we will be returning in the near future! 

Thank you to all the staff",5,2021,08,02
111,Lovely hotel with friendly staff,We had originally booked at a hotel up the road but was moved due to the hotel quarantining - The staff at the Montcalm were lovely and helpful and the check in process was quick and smooth - It was my birthday and the staff organised for me to have a free breakfast which was lovely - would definitely stay again !,5,2021,08,02

111,"Excellent, Recommended","Checked in late but the process is pretty smooth and very friendly / customer focused.  The standard of the rooms are modern and maintained to excellent standards/cleanliness.

Pleasantly surprised with the upgrade …Fantastic room…especially after a long drive and busy day with a late check in.

Thanks to Xavier and Mustafa for the quick  check in process and excellent customer service.  Highly recommended",5,2021,08,02
111,"Amazing, amazing amazing!!","We visited from the 16th-19th July for mine and my girlfriends birthday weekend, we couldn't have asked for a better hotel! We've always wanted to visit London to see the attractions but have been apprehensive on where to stay, however the Montcalm was perfect! Fantastic location which has beautiful restaurants within walking distance, also a short walk from the tube station to get where you need too. Amazing breakfast, beautiful room with excellent facilities which included sky TV, touch screen pad for room service, air conditioning and the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in! The staff were very welcoming and helpful whenever we required assistance. (Special mention to Andreea Mary!) The only thing we didn't get to try was the spa and pool which we were gutted about. Highly recommend this place and we can't wait to visit again!",5,2021,08,01
111,Amazing!!!!,"I booked this hotel through wowcher , and was very apprehensive about getting bad service due to us paying a discounted price ....How wrong could I have been! 
We went for my fiancees birthday, we arrived at 11 am the room was not ready as to be expected so we dropped our case and that was smooth and seamless. 

When we came back from shopping at selfridges we were greeted by a lovely lady on reception. I can’t recall her name but she was from Spain she was so so helpful and friendly. She upgraded our room and sent up a bottle of Prosecco and macaroons for his birthday!! That was such a lovely touch. 

Room was clean , modern and had everything we needed. Bed was so comfy. 

Hotel was stunning! 

We went to the spa...shame only half an hour a time is allowed! An hour at least would of been nice. 

Now for me the best part of the stay was the breakfast!! Wow wow wow
It was the best hotel breakfast I’ve ever had, so much choice , so fresh the setting was stunning! We got there at 7:20 so was all just brought out. I advise this. 

Gutted to come home to be honest! 

I tried to book for next month for my daughters birthday on wowcher but fully booked!! 

Thank you so much Montcalm royal London I will be back.",5,2021,07,31

111,it was ok,I have stayed in this hotel last week. I used the pool at the first day during my stay and found so much hair in the pool. I was hoping that will be cleaned next day. Next day when I went to pool again there was more hair and it seemed like they don't clean the pool daily. My room was not cleaned properly too. Foh team was very helpful they sent cleaners after my complain and they cleaned.,3,2021,07,29
111,First Class Service,"First time at this Montcalm, by far my favourite of the group. From check in to departure I was looked after. Big thanks to Andrei the head concierge...fantastic help. 

Nothing is a problem and Deepak, the manager, is such a lovely person. This is now my hotel of choice in London.",5,2021,07,29
111,Family staycation,"5 stars and above! We loved our stay at the Montcalm Royal London. Camelia and her team could not do enough for us. Our rooms were Superb and the attention to detail in the family rooms was excellent. We travelled as a family and the experience was not stressful at all. Our rooms was ready on time and we had a lovely welcome card from guest experience team on arrival. Special thanks to Camelia. She is so good at her job and looked after us from start to finish. I am looking forward to our next stay which we are already planning. The hotel was very Covid safe too. I would recommend this hotel as a fabulous 5 star, family friendly and also trendy place to stay in London. Can’t wait to return. The restaurant on the top floor is great with a fabulous rooftop bar and dinning.",5,2021,07,28
111,One night stay couple,I had a one night stay at the Montcalm with my partner and the experience was all round lovely. January the guest experience manager was extremely accommodating to our requests and had a great team who catered to our needs. I would 100% recommend this hotel.,5,2021,07,27
111,Highly recommend,"This hotel really goes above and beyond when it comes to accommodating their customers as well as being a really homely, luxury environment. From the moment we walked in the staff were so helpful, polite and attentive. I couldn’t recommend this place more! The staff members Joshua and Xavier went the extra mile in helping us and making us feel comfortable in our stay. I really haven’t come across better staff! The rooms were clean and environment was pleasing.",5,2021,07,27
111,Great value given the quality. Had overlooked before due to online branding but would definitely stay again now!,"My girlfriend and I regularly stay in hotels with our jobs as well as holidaying (until Covid) and so have had the fortune to stay at some luxury hotels around the world as well as in London. This was right up there!
I noted on the booking that it was my girlfriend's birthday and on arrival there was a handwritten card, birthday balloons and rose petals all over the bed. A lovely touch
Montcalm Club room was luxurious and spacious with a huge tv with apps like iplayer, all4 as well as sky and the touch screen for controlling lights, air con and underfloor heating worked (not always the case in other hotels!) Floor to ceiling windows gave a great view and extra lux feel too.
The bed was comfortable and although cleaning and room service were limited due to Covid, we did get the room serviced once on request as well as getting water replenished.
We didnt have breakfast included but decided to pay for it as we went. It wasn't cheap but location in the rooftop restaurant meant we had spectacular views and the food was good quality. The buffet is actually better than the a la carte and slightly cheaper..
We used the pool area and spa and whilst the steam room and sauna werent available due to Covid, the pool and jacuzzi were and felt clean and luxurious. The massage we had at the spa was also excellent with a very knowledgeable masseur.
Overall, all staff were attentive and friendly without being over so.
Its a well located hotel - 5min walk from Moorgate / Old Street tube too.",5,2021,07,27

111,Perfect for a Staycation,We had a lovely stay and it was perfect for our 2 night London Staycation. January Stevens was excellent and went above and beyond meeting our expectations. I asked to move to a room with a nicer view and she was extremely helpful (even walking me to the new room to check it was okay). Also left us a bottle of bubbly to celebrate one of our birthdays in the room.,5,2021,07,26
111,Our anniversary stay,"We were placed in this hotel as a result of our original hotel being closed . We couldn’t have been happier . 
You are a short walk from Liverpool Street station so if like us we were carrying an overnight bag then there is no need for a taxi . 
The staff were so friendly and attentive . Mary front of desk was lovely but so were all the staff . Rooms are clean , beds and pillows were so comfortable . 
Roof top bars  , The aviary is run by a separate company and we hadn’t booked   They were fully booked but allowed us Standing room . Drinks are a little pricey but we are in London and the view is spectacular . 
We will be back again and you won’t get a better hotel 
for the price in London . Truly 5stars from us

111,A superb anniversary stay at this wonderful luxury London Hotel………….made to feel special,"Where do I start? Well firstly with a BIG THANK YOU to January Stevens and all the staff at Montcalm Royal London House who could not have done more to make our wedding anniversary stay at this hotel so memorable. I have been fortunate to stay in many Central London Hotels over the years and can honestly say that January and her Guest Experience Team epitomise what a front of house team should be like at a top hotel - genuinely committed to making guests feel truly special throughout their stay. I spoke with January ahead of our arrival and my wife and I were welcomed with bubbly on ice and a hand-written anniversary card, in our splendid Club Double room on 7th Floor overlooking Finsbury Square. We were a bit of a last minute booking but they managed to reserve us  two seats at the roof top bar where we were superbly looked after by Justine and her team notwithstanding it being understandably an extremely busy first weekend post lockdown on a beautiful summer evening. We were also reserved time in the spa and pool and they managed to sort breakfast too (which we had failed to book). Whilst the hotel is, of course, everything you’d expect from a Luxury 5-Star Hotel, at this Montcalm, it is the people and their commitment to the absolute Customer Experience which makes the real difference. Thanks again and we cannot wait to come back soon. Jeff & Julie-Ann #MontcalmMoments #JanuaryStevens #MontcalmMagicMoments",5,2021,07,24
111,Last Minute Change of Hotel,"Initially disappointed that our Hotel was changed from a sister hotel due to low occupancy 2-days before our visit.  However, very impressed when we arrived at 10:30 in the morning and were able to check in.  Room was large and spacious and my son particularly liked the digital light/air con management system

Great toiletries, powerful shower.  Nice roof-top bar.  Friendly bar downstairs too. Excellent checkout, nothing too much trouble. All in all a good place to base yourself for business or pleasure",5,2021,07,23
111,"Excellent location, excellent staff","Great two night stay - slight issue with first room - instantly rectified with a  room change. Staff were courteous, polite and professional. Special mention for Mary and Karolina, who really seemed to care about their guests.",5,2021,07,20
111,One of the best hotels in London. Amazing staff and a beautiful hotel.,"A beautiful hotel with amazing staff.

The hotel has it all. Polite happy staff, good gym and pool, two amazing bars.",5,2021,07,19
111,Truly a 5 Star Experience,"We’ve just got home after staying here for one night as part of my partner’s 30th celebrations. The hotel went above and beyond from the very start. They added a couple of surprise touches to our room before we got there and the service, food and couples massage the next day just made this stay fantastic. Very nice decor in the lobby and rooms. Media is fantastic with 55” TV’s with Sky etc, air con was a dream as it was 30 degrees in London during our stay! Shout out to Ken and Mary for helping making our stay amazing.

We will be back.",5,2021,07,19

111,The best hotel I have ever been tooo,"When I first entered the hotel I was greeted by a man (didn’t get his name) he carried my luggage to the front desk, where Mary checked me in me she was lovely and welcoming. Valentina checked me out and she was also lovely",5,2021,07,17
111,Great experience!,"We went for a girls stay and had a lovely time  here! The staff were so polite and helpful, the rooms were clean and we both had a comfortable nights sleep. We enjoyed the swimming pool, jacuzzi also the breakfast that came with the deal. The staff were warm and welcoming and we will be booking another stay with some more friends. We would definatley recommend  this hotel. Thank you Montcalm for such a pleasurable stay!",5,2021,07,16

111,Weekend stay,"Our stay  at the Montcalm was perfect, Daniel the concierge and Mary at the front desk went above and beyond to accommodate our needs, from restaurant reservation to getting us a table at a fully booked roof top bar, you guys made our stay memorable, we will most definitely come back, ask for Daniel or Mary, I call them miracle workers.",5,2021,07,16

111,Amazing!,"The hotel is everything you would want and more whilst staying away. All the staff I spoke to were very friendly. 

The bed was unbelievably comfortable, made it difficult to get up and ready. I was impressed by the amount of space you get in the hotel rooms. With probably one of the widest smart tvs I've seen at a hotel I've stayed at before. 

Set in a great location for travelling, didnt have to walk for that long from the train station. 

The bathroom was quite nice too. The marble flooring gave it that extra touch of luxury. 

The hallway leading towards the hotel rooms were dark, with a night light across the rooms. Which in my opinion really sets a comfortable feeling walking towards your hotel room at night not to be blinded by bright lights. 

The room had mood lights too.  Even a fancy touch pannel where you could put a "" don't disturb sign on ( one of the few options) "" which seprates it from most hotels as it gives it a modern feeling rather than a simple paper cut out which you would hang on your door. 

I'd had liked to extend my stay but due to work arrangements this couldn't get done. Unfortunately I didn't get to use the rooftop bar as I didn't get to book it and didn't decide until the last minute which is usually something i tend to do quite often. But overall stunning hotel worth the money for sure!",5,2021,07,14
111,Fantastic staff,"What a wonderful hotel with incredibly welcoming staff especially Mary at reception. Thank you for taking care of us. 
Excellent food, great location, lovely  spa- exactly what we needed! Plus Elemis products in the room!",5,2021,07,12
111,Best friend's Hen Do,"Am absolutely amazing stay for my best friends hen do this weekend! The little touches were so great appreciated and the service was impeccable! The food, rooms and staff were all amazing and it was so clean and well looked after. We also visited the rooftop which had amazing views and the experience was brilliant!

Thank you so much for an amazing stay, the bride had a wonderful time and we cannot wait to visit again soon!",5,2021,07,11
111,Great stay,"We stay at the Montcalm city house for one night on my partner birthday. Our stay was really nice, staff was really helpful and Andreea from the reception managed to make nice arrangements to make our stay even more special :) we enjoyed the pool and breakfast in the morning was nice as well. Overall a very good stay",5,2021,07,11
111,This hotel was a great stay,"Booked at the sister property, Montcalm at the Brewery to turn up and find that they had no record of our reservation and that they were closed and being used as a COVID quarantine hotel.

After much stress and panic, the hopeless hotel manager then advised our reservation had been moved to this hotel and what a welcome surprise this was.

Having made the journey and explained our dilemma, we were offered complimentary breakfast and a nicer room.

Room was large with all the modern amenities. Only downside was that we were right next to the restaurant in room 904 and could hear some slight noise at night.

Our room wasn’t serviced when we arrived back late on the Saturday but after a quick call down to reception, additional towels etc were brought to our room

I was more impressed that this comment was passed onto the morning team and the manageress came out to make sure we were all okay on check out

Customer service, second to none",5,2021,07,11
111,5 stars all round!,"Wow what can I say everything about it was 5stars. Mary in reception, January the manager at reception, the bar staff in the evening and morning, and the room! We had a wonderful time and will definitely be back again! Thanks you so much for having us.",5,2021,07,10
111,Birthday upgrade!,"Me, my partner and little girl had an amazing night stay here!! As soon as we got there and mentioned it was my birthday we got a lovely upgrade from Mary who looked after us throughout our stay! She upgraded our room, gave us access to the lounge for complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening and complimentary breakfast! 
Our room was amazing, so clean and super comfy!! We ordered room service which was delicious and called Mary for an extra bottle of water in which 2 arrived in a flash. 

Excellent stay all round! And would love to stay here again, thank you Mary!",5,2021,07,10
111,Best service possible,"We were looked after by Andrea at front desk, she was absolutely wonderful.
After giving my ID she realised it was my birthday and immediately upgraded our room. 

Highly recommend to stay at this Hotel for any occasion with or without people.",5,2021,07,08
111,What a great hotel! ,"My friend and I were so impressed with the level of care and attention to detail at your hotel.

Somehow your staff managed to make us feel special and personally welcome despite it being a big and busy hotel.

I would highly recommend the hotel and hope to come and visit again soon.

",5,2021,07,08
111,Wedding Stay,"Myself, my new husband and our families stayed here over the weekend of our wedding.  The staff couldnt have been more helpful, they made the weekend extra special for us all.  I cant rate the this hotel highly enough. We will definitely be coming back to stay. 
We ate at the Aviary on the Friday evening and the food was amazing and the service was excellent.",5,2021,07,06
111,Lovely Stay,"Really lovely hotel, the staff were great and very helpful.  The only slight hiccup was with the beds but it was sorted by the lovely duty manger. The rooftop bar & restaurant was lovely. Will definitely visit again.",5,2021,07,06
111,"Visited for my boyfriends 20th birthday, delightful overall experience at the Montcalm Royal London Hotel!","Lovely hotel, amazing staff; especially Andreea who assisted us throughout our stay. Very close to Liverpool station and a nice experience for my boyfriends birthday! 

Would defo come back, and hopefully use the pool and spa facilities. Thank you.",5,2021,07,05
111,My Favourite Hotel,"I have been able to work during lockdown so used hotels instead of having to travel home quite as often. The Royal London has been the best hotel to stay in. The staff are so friendly and do their upmost to make your stay enjoyable. Nothing is touch trouble. From checking in with Fenna and getting an upgrade to a room with a bathtub. The restaurant staff and doorman are just all so pleasant and friendly. You are made to feel like a VIP and it really cheers you up after a long working day. The rooms are so spacious. The rooftop restaurant and bar spectacular! The entrance hall coffee bar serves great food too. Room service breakfasts are very good. There is so much more about this hotel I have yet to discover,spa and pool being one. Very close to Moorgate Station too.
What're can I say.",5,2021,07,04
111,Worst hotel I have ever stayed in,"We tried all week to get through to the hotel to pay for our spa treatments. Never got through so our treatments got cancelled. 
Arrive at the hotel on time and we have to to wait 30 mins for our room.
We then get to the spa and our spa booking has been cancelled. We chose this hotel for the spa as our friend's birthday. 
Breakfast the following morning we had to wait an hour and a half for breakfast... An hour for a cup of tea.. All the staff are so rude... They literally ignore you or answer very rudely. 
Service throughout the hotel is terrible. 
Very overpriced. 
I highly recommend you not to stay at this hotel.",1,2021,07,04
111,Fantastic stay,"We visited the The Montcalm Royal London House to celebrate my husbands 50th Birthday. I had pre-booked spa access with couples massage and dinner at Aviary rooftop restaurant. Pre booking, I contacted the spa to book massage however they were fully booked and I asked if they could let me know if something becomes available. Luckily, they called a day before our arrival and offered us couples massage which I booked.  The staff at the SPA were very friendly and extremely  professional. We really enjoyed our massage by the two woman who saw us (1.00 PM on 27 June) and who really helped release our muscle aches and pains. Following the massage we had access to the pool and other spa facilities for an hour which we really enjoyed. 

Prior to checking in, I called the hotel and asked if we could check in earlier than 2.00 PM as our massage time was at 1. We were told to call in the morning and find out. However we turned up at the hotel at 10 AM, expecting to leave our luggage in the reception while we went out for breakfast. I was served by Mary, who had excellent customer service skills and made our day! Not only did she upgrade us to a suite after I told her that we were celebrating my husbands 50th Birthday, but she let us check in at 10:00 AM!! Something we have never experienced before! She also made sure that we felt really valued as customers - there were balloons with ""happy birthday"" writing in our room,  vine and a welcome card. The room was very very decent size with a modern, clean bathroom with a big shower which I loved.  There is also a makeup mirror in the bathroom which was very helpful. We had a very comfortable stay and a good sleep at night thanks to the very comfortable bed. 

We had a lovely time at the rooftop restaurant, Aviary. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to assist. I had booked dinner inside the restaurant and the rest of the evening for outside drinks on the rooftop. However, due to the heavy rain, we could no longer go out and you can only stay in the restaurant for a limited time , however after our meal, the staff moved us to the other side of the restaurant where we could sit comfortably all evening, enjoy the view wile remining dry. 

We were served breakfast in the same restaurant the next day and we were once again met with very friendly, professional staff that went out of their way to satisfy.   

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London or just for a SPA weekend away.",5,2021,07,02
111,Lovely hotel & facilities,"We had a lovely one night stay at this hotel! Perfect for if you want to explore the city and within walking distance to tube stations, the gherkin and other iconic sites! The beds were amazing, they felt like a giant cloud, I wish I could have taken it home! The staff were so helpful and friendly especially Mary who was very welcoming! The only disappointment was that we did not have a nespresso machine which I thought would have come with the room & we were unable to use the spa and pool facilities as they had no time slots available for the duration of our stay!",4,2021,07,01
111,Fantastic hotel,"Loved our stay here. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Anything we asked for they provided ( extra blankets, robe etc) i brought my daughter here for her 15th birthday and they left balloons and card for her. She absolutely loved it. The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. The pool and restaurant needs booking in advance, we was unable to get a table at the rooftop restaurant. Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2021,06,30
111,Birthday celebration,"The whole experience was incredible and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating! All the facilities provided were kept clean and were enjoyable. Highly recommended staying here, I will definitely be back!",5,2021,06,29
111,Sunday night stay for one night,"Check in was a bit chaotic and some guests just interrupt when you are at the desk with the receptionist. Water is provided free in Mountcalm branded bottles in the check in area. Staff are friendly and efficient. We had room 805 which had a nice view and it was a really good size. The room temperature and lights are controlled by a panel just outside the bathroom. The lighting is excellent and the air con is super quiet. Elemis products supplied. Due to Covid you do need to request anything for you room that you expect or is in your package. Beds are really comfortable. The only slight negative was you could hear the music from the bar and restaurant above from 11am to 11pm. We couldn’t hear any other noise from outside. 
We had dinner and drinks in the Aviary and the food and service was excellent. ",5,2021,06,29
111,Great service,We stayed the night for my birthday and the staff went out their way to make it special. There were birthday balloons on the bed and a card from the hotel. The spa was lovely and warm too! Thank you Valentina for being so attentive and making it extra special.,5,2021,06,28
111,Birthday trip,"We only stayed for 1 night but we will definitely be back. The room was very nice. Huge comfy bed we both slept very very well. Bathroom was very modern with an incredible shower.

The Aviary rooftop bar was great. Really nice chilled vibe on a beautiful summers evening.  Breakfast was nice too",5,2021,06,26
111,Car window smashed in hotel recommended car park don’t not park there!! Shocking customer services,"We checked into this hotel to be greeted with a 30 min check in que, the room was clean and nice. Breakfast was shocking! Honestly couldn’t even eat it, looked like it had been sat drying out the tomatoes and toast burnt and the hash room was actually leaking grease my partner asked for fried eggs and no tomato, he got tomato and poached eggs. We parked our car in the recommended NCP car park across the street, a secure locked car park. We returned to our car to have been broken into with a smashed window. I reported this to reception to no help what so ever other than that’s not our car park so nothing we can do, even though this is the hotel’s recommendation on their website. Was just Told to contact autoglass and phone the police, no help or assistance what so ever, shockingly bad customer services we have paid to stay in this hotel for a weekend treat away so to have some care and assistance into a situation like this would of been really helpful especially now I have to pay hundreds of pounds do have my window repaired! 
We can’t even go up to the roof top bar because it’s fully booked all weekend! Nice room but shocking service and customer care.",1,2021,06,26
111,The perfect morning,"A friend and I came for a spa morning. Had a massage, glass of bubbly and a couple of hours in the spa. Wonderfully relaxing time, faultless service and one of the best massages I have ever had, a full body deep tissue massage by Siobhan. Would highly recommend and cannot wait to come back.",5,2021,06,24
111,Exceptional treatment,"This really is a beautiful hotel. The bed is one of most comfortable I have had the pleasure of laying on. The bathroom is really clean and the overall decor makes you want to lay in without ever leaving 😊. I truly recommend it. And the breakfast - I had the full English breakfast and let me tell you, the scramble eggs tasted like fluffy delight. The hotel staff were amazing , especially the beautiful Andrea who attended to us. I will be visiting again.",5,2021,06,24
111,Amazing stay,"All i have to say is good stuff, from check in to check out the hospitality was great. staff were very welcoming, room was decorated very nicely and the views around are amazing, highly recommend this hotel",5,2021,06,24
111,Fantastic stay,"I have booked a room in this hotel for a quick getaway from my home with intention to relax before my exams. The whole experience was great and tick all the boxes. 
Upon arrival i was met by Andreea at reception. She was very friendly and professional, explained about all the facilities, timings, etc. in a detailed manner. Check in procedure was quick and smooth. 
I loved futuristic design on the corridors. I have not seen anything like this in other hotels. 
The room i was given was great size, everything looked like brand new. Beautifully designed and high-tech equipped. Bed was huge and very comfortable. Have not had such a good sleep in years. 
I want to thank staff for a personal touch (hand written note and amenities) which made experience even better.
I have ordered breakfast to be delivered to my room which came exactly at the time requested. And I must admit it was the best English breakfast i have ever had. 
Finally, during check out I was met by Mary who was very warm and professional, she made sure I am leaving hotel happy and had a enjoyable stay.
Thank you, and will see you again soon!!!",5,2021,06,22
111,Very welcoming staff at check-in,"My husband and I stayed 1 night for our 21st wedding anniversary. Mary on reception was extremely helpful and she kindly upgraded us to the junior suite.
The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was huge and I loved the shower but the room in general was basic and a little dated. 
We used the spa facilities. The steam room and sauna are currently closed but the pool was nice and the massage was very good.
We ate dinner in the Aviary restaurant, the service was excellent and the food was delicious.
So, overall we had a very nice stay.",4,2021,06,21
111,Hotel stay,"Had a lovely stay in the hotel it’s self, Valentino and Mary  was so lovely she helped me a lot and was so patient !! She had a welcoming personality and I would go there again, 

Only problem I had was with the spa downstairs!!!! 

They put my treatment on hold without my consent and had to wait 2 more hours until I could get a slot, but the man who did my massage was great!",3,2021,06,21
111,Lovely staff made up for loss of extras,"We’d booked Montcalm Club rooms specifically for the Club Lounge. Unfortunately the club lounge is apparently not open on Sunday’s but this was not clear when we booked. Mary, who booked us in more than made up for this with a room upgrade and some nice extras (Thai you!). Our room on the sixth floor was superb. It was big, spotlessly clean and we had the comfiest bed. 

Sadly we didn’t get into the spa because it was fully booked. But in fairness I was far too causal about booking it. If you’re keen for the spa I suspect you need to be straight onto the booking. Breakfast in The Aviary was really nice quality. And finally checking out was good with Daniel kindly calling us a cab to save us from a stroll across the square to flag one down in the wet (thank you!).

I’ve stayed at the Montcalm in Marble Arch, which was also nice, possibly a better location. However, we wanted to stay at RLH for the rooftop restaurant, and on the whole I’d say we’d visit the RLH again.",4,2021,06,21
111,Amazing Hotel!,"This hotel was amazing and me and my boyfriend throughally enjoyed our stay here! We arrived on Saturday 19th for my boyfriend's birthday. We had booked a Junior Suite but was given a family suite which was bigger and had two rooms! The check in was easy and quick, we were seen straight away. Our room was amazing and had a lovely view of the square below. When we arrived, there was water in the room and a lovely birthday message and chocolates for my boyfriend. The bed was so comfortable and we had an amazing sleep! There wasn't any mini bar which was a bit disappointing as we do like to have a night cap but we managed. We didn't experience the club lounge as we had lots of things booked and we were a little late to get up in the morning to enjoy breakfast. We did however order some room service in the morning which was a full English breakfast which was great and very tasty. The staff were very attentive and made our stay memorable. The concierge were lovely and helped as best they could. Mary at checkout was lovely and helped with putting our bags in storage to look after for the day as we were going to the Aviary Rooftop and didn't want to carry our bags with us. All in all we will definitely be back again! Next time we will try out the spa and the club room. Many thanks for a wonderful and pleasant stay!",5,2021,06,21
111,Lovely hotel but wouldn’t return.,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Montcalm for 1 night after I booked it as a surprise for his birthday the hotel was lovely, modern and the beds were comfy. Check in was fine we were greeted in the reception and everyone welcomed us and were happy to help. we had dinner reservations at 7:30 in the aviary and got ready early to go for a drink before going up to have dinner as the hotel had a few bars to drink at. We checked the aviary bar who advised no the bar area is fully booked all night and said they could sit us outside (it was raining outside and all the furniture was covered up) we only wanted one drink so agreed to try outside but the lady sat us down on two wooden stalls that were wet and walked off….even though it was raining there were other people sat outside but funnily enough they had comfy blue bar stalls with back support, yet we were given small wooden ones. SO we decided to try somewhere downstairs because it was windy and raining. We tried the burdock but they stayed there was a private party and we couldn’t come into the area, we tried the seating area opposite the reception to be told we would need to pay £30 per person to sit in there and at this time it was 7pm so we were 100% not spending £60 for the two of us to sit somewhere for 20 minutes. After being denied a drink EVERYWHERE in the hotel we went back to our room and had to sit there for 20 minutes till we could go upstairs for our food. We were taken to a table but then 10 minutes later we were asked to move because we were sat in an area that needed to be prepared for a party of 12, the bar staff agreed to give us our first round of drinks on the house for the inconvenience which was lovely. Due to the the weather over the past week I booked the terrace prior to coming to the hotel and with it raining I decided to check the website to see what happens with the booking of it rains, couldn’t find anything and due to the fact we were told the bar area was fully booked all night and nowhere downstairs would let us in, my only option was to cancel the booking and be charged. Fast forward to eating our desserts and the waitress comes over and gives us the bill and tells us that we need to leave the table for 9pm because they need the table for a party of 12, it was literally 8:50, just had the desserts delivered to the table and I had to pay in between eating which my partner was not happy with at all so we told the waitress that we need to be seated somewhere at the bar due to the inconvenience of being rushed off the table whilst we were still eating…they managed to get a table for us near the bar where we spent the rest of the night till close. For the fact that this place is a 5* hotel I feel like some of the staff (especially the aviary) need to treat their guests/customers with more respect, it was visibly obvious that because myself and my partner were in our 20’s we were tested differently to people a lot older then us which is not right at all, we spent quite a lot of money in the aviary yet we were still treated differently to the other guests in their 30s,40s,50s and we also met another couple the same age as us who said they were treated the same.

I wont return back to this hotel to be looked down on as if I am young, immature and can’t afford anything there, other then all of this as stated above the hotel was nice and modern.",3,2021,06,21
111,Excellent stay,"All round lovely stay - room was clean and had everything we needed. Particularly liked the bathroom. Mary was very helpful on the front desk, as was the concierge- not sure if his name though. Everyone was very welcoming and check in/out was quick despite clearly a busy weekend with the football on.",5,2021,06,20
111,The friendliest hotel,"We really loved our stay at this hotel and one thing that really stood out was the attentive and super friendly service. The team that checked us in were so lovely (sorry don’t remember the names) and Mary who checked us out was amazing too. 

It was nice to get an unprompted room upgrade and we really like the ground floor bar. 

Looking forward to our return visit soon. Thanks for taking such good care of us.",5,2021,06,20
111,"Great hotel, fantastic location","The hotel is in a great part of London and located in a nice quiet location. The staff were really friendly in arrival and gave us a free upgrade.

The room was huge! Really nice comfy bed, bathroom was nice with heated floor and plenty of hanging space in the wardrobes.

Would recommend an we will be coming back.",5,2021,06,19
111,Amazing Visit,"We stayed at the hotel for one night and would definitely recommend! We had a Montcalm Club Double Room and we couldn’t fault the service at all, Mary checked us in and out and she was absolutely brilliant, made us feel right at home and very welcome. The club lounge also had very good service and was a nice extra. The bathroom was great and the room in general was exactly what we wanted - we couldn’t fault it all. We went to the Aviary on the top floor for dinner and it was one of the best meals we’ve ever had. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a nice trip away in London.",5,2021,06,19
111,The best stay I’ve had.,"Had an a amazing stay at the Montcalm, great staff and welcomed us as soon as we arrived. Accommodated for everything we needed and asked for, great people who work there and very well organised. Great facilities in the room and the pool / spa use also. Get this place booked people!",5,2021,06,19
111,Great hotel and good service,Mary at Royal London House was very helpful on arrival. A great hotel in a good location. Ideal for business and also highly accessible to other parts of the city. The bed could have been a little firmer but would stay again and highly recommend this hotel.,5,2021,06,19
111,Amazing anniversary stay!,I stayed here for my anniversary and had the best stay. I’ve never been here before but will definitely come back. Check in was done by Mary and she really looked after us and even a bottle of wine was left in our room. We even managed to book for the pool which was great. Will definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2021,06,19
111,Service was outstanding,"Our quiet room on the 6th floor, although compact was comfortable, with a huge bed, beautiful quality linen and a bathroom with high end fixtures and fittings. We visited London in the rain and the hotel offered umbrellas for us all. The staff on reception, including Mary, housekeeping and serving breakfast were polite, friendly and very efficient. They clearly knew how to deal with the customers. There was a young man in reception, not behind the desk but generally running around sorting out luggage/umbrellas and helpfully answering any questions we had. He was superb and just the right sort of character to be in that role.",5,2021,06,16
111,My Anniversary,"We stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House on the 12th June 2021 to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were checked in by Mary who was brilliant! We were given robes, bought to our room for the spa, and to our delight we were given a bottle of red wine to make our anniversary more special. 
We booked for drinks at the Aviary and wow! We were incredibly impressed with the roof top and the astonishing views of the city.",5,2021,06,15
111,Beautiful and welcoming hotel,"We had the most incredible time. It was our wedding night and they kindly upgraded us to a suite and left petals, champagne and a very sweet and personal card. The hotel and rooms were beautifully designed and the view from our room over Finsbury square lovely. The bed was one of the comfiest I’ve slept in and the rain shower was divine. The level of service was great as nothing was too much trouble . When staying in London we will definitely book there again.  It was such good value for money. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay.",5,2021,06,14
111,Would recommend,"It was just the two of us and we had a double room on the 8th floor  with a lovely modern ensuite and a very comfortable bed with decent pillows and touch screen air conditioning which was very welcome!.  Well furnished and up to date and large flat screen TV with tea/coffee making facilities, safe, small fridge.  The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and had everything sorted as regards Covid-19 regulations and restrictions.   There is Spa facilities which you have to book (Covid reasons) which we didn't actually use so can't comment on that but I wanted a manicure and pedicure and Daniel in Conscierge arranged an appointment at a local nail salon and organised a taxi for me.  He was so helpful and always on hand to answer any questions or help with anything.    We had supper in The Avairy Restaurant on the roof which was really enjoyable and the food was delicious and sat out watching the sunset lighting up the buildings all around.   Breakfast was very good in the Burdock Bar for a lighter breakfast although you could have full english etc etc in The Avairy.  Good location for us attending Event at the Honourable Artillery Company and about a 15 minute walk from lovely Spitalfields market and shopping area.   We happily recommend this hotel.",5,2021,06,14
111,Birthday Treat,"I booked the Montcalm Royal London House as a birthday surprise for my best friend and we had such a lovely time. The service we received was great, nothing we asked for was too much trouble. Room service for dinner and breakfast was excellent. The room itself was beautiful, incredibly clean, and the bed was really comfortable. We stayed on a HOT day, and the air con was a life saver.

Special thanks to Ken at the front desk for giving us that sweet upgrade and for arranging a birthday treat in the room for us. I think we will have to make it an annual trip as it was so special.

ONLY non-positive is the swimming pool/hot tub area. And only because in terms of covid measures, it felt like it was overbooked for such a small area, and felt like there were too many people booked in at the same time. But it was still very enjoyable as part of the stay.",5,2021,06,14
111,Awesome place great transport links,"This is our go to hotel for London everytime we come. It's close to Euston with great tube links nearby. The hotel has an amazing rooftop bar and the staff are super helpful. It's just great value and I cannot recommend it enough!

You can't get straight onto the tube or catch a bus and be at London bridge or covent garden within no time.",5,2021,06,14
111,"Great place, fantastic helpful staff.","The place is grand. And everyone is very helpful and kind. It could do with a slightly better upkeep, some places look quite worn and tired. But it's very confidante and friendly. 
However the place is very busy with people choosing for the aviary bar /restaurant and that is when the covid rules seem to relax somewhat.",4,2021,06,13
111,"Great hotel, lovely and clean","Stayed here on a Saturday night, was clean, lively, staff were all so polite and will be visiting again. Special thanks to Mary on the front desk who was so helpful throughout. The pool could do with an update but was still nice enough for a morning dip.",4,2021,06,13
111,Disappointed,"When first arrived we were given room 816, when we opened the door a stench of drains hit us. They changed our room straight away.
Our first night we ate dinner in burdock, the chicken was so fatty and grisly that you couldn’t eat it. Our second night after being out all day we ordered room service. A chicken burger which was pink and bloody one end and a pizza that hadn’t seen an oven for more than five minutes. Inedible.
The breakfast on the last morning we were looking forward to having on the rooftop to find out breakfast finished at 10am, although at check in we were told 11am. 
So we came back to our room to complain and was told it’s okay you can have room service, not quite the same but ok. 
When breakfast arrived it was stone cold and had to be sent back. We were sent a replacement which was warm but not hot! So we ate it quickly and checked out!",4,2021,06,13
111,Simply perfect,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night and it was nothing short of perfect! The staff were more than accommodating and everyone was happy to help. Ken checked us in and Mary checked us out. Both members of staff were very friendly and made the process easy.

The room was spotless and it had a little touchpad on the wall for lights, air con, underfloor heating etc which was very easy to use. You can link your phone to the tv for Netflix and other apps. Breakfast on the rooftop bar was delicious and the serve was great. 

The location of the hotel is ideal, 5 minute walk from Moorgate or Old Street tube stations.

We will definitely be back again at this hotel!",5,2021,06,12
111,"Spacious rooms, great location but customer service not 5 star.","Great location near Moorgate station with M&S food hall and Tesco nearby plus loads of restaurants. Family suite was spacious with two rooms interconnected. Hotel is clean and spa was nice although swimming pool is very small. 

Continental Breakfast was good. It’s a shame that the Aviary restaurant/ rooftop bar is run by a separate company and not the hotel. You can’t stay at the rooftop bar after 5:30 with kids.",4,2021,06,11
111,Great stay!,The hotel is in an ideal location. We were able to walk to Gaucho's for dinner and then to Shoreditch for drinks later in the evening. Not to mention the jacuzzi and pool which had staggered timings (due to Covid restrictions) allowing us more space to enjoy it.,4,2021,06,11
111,An amazing experience,"We arrived at the hotel and was looked after by Andrea, she was lovely and always made sure everything was perfect! What an amazing person she is.   Everything was perfect. Very fancy hotel! 
Had an amazing birthday",5,2021,06,11
111,"Absolutely perfect stay, amazing hotel","My time at the Montcalm RLH was absolutely amazing. From the moment I checked in Fenna welcomed me so warmly and it was one of the best check in experiences I’ve ever had, she is a credit to the hotel. The room was beautiful and my special request was met. Breakfast on the top floor was amazing, made better by Joanna who was the most lovely hostess, putting a smile on my face both mornings I was here. Again, checkout with both Fenna and Andreea was a great experience, they were so chatty and friendly and they truly made my stay at the hotel. Thank you both so much! The Burdock bar staff were also so warm and welcoming. I’ve been to 5* hotels before, but this was truly a 5* experience and I cannot wait for the opportunity to return to the hotel if I return to London. 10/10, thank you guys for making this trip so amazing!!!",5,2021,06,10
111,Best Customer Service,"I can’t recommend this place enough, every member of staff we encountered was friendly, helpful and couldn’t do enough. I was so impressed by the hotel, bar, reception, room... it was fantastic. Weather was gorgeous so we sat outside for our drinks, I would come back here each and everytime",5,2021,06,09
111,Fantastic stay,"Just returned from a one night stay. This is an amazing hotel and cannot wait to return the room was spotless we stayed in room 104 which had a lovely  view of the square it’s a five minute walk from Liverpool Street station where you can jump a tube to anywhere you wish in London

We had cocktails in the downstairs bar served by two fantastic bartenders sorry didn’t catch your names.  The security team were very friendly and very helpful keeping an eye on everything making sure that we are all stayed safe

We ate in the Avairy which is a rooftop bar the food was delicious￼.  I have read a few reviews where people have complained that they didn’t get in well common sense should tell you you need to book everything at the moment and this is what we did  prior to our stay we booked our spa times and we booked our rooftop bar seats everything went very smoothly￼

Check out was very smooth as was checking out we were able to store our bags before checking out so we could enjoy another day in London the concierge team were excellent special mention to Mary￼ On reception and the wonderful concierge young man who name slips me I do apologise it was a very hot day and he helped us with our bags and offered us water for our journey￼",5,2021,06,09
111,Fantastic Girls Weekend,"Absolutely wonderful hotel with fantastic customer service and possibly the comfiest beds I have ever slept in! I recently visited with my friend to celebrate my birthday and just as an excuse for a night away in London. The staff were so attentive and welcoming, they even delivered a birthday card and a plate of macaroons to our room! The Aviary restaurant is gorgeous for Breakfast and also for evening drinks. The treatments in the spa were fantastic. One of the best hotels I have stayed with in London, will definitely be returning.",5,2021,06,09
111,Great service!,"Took my friend here for a birthday celebration and the team and Montcalm were so lovely and helpful, especially Andrea- thank you so much for a perfect stay! The room was very clean and facilities were great.",5,2021,06,09
111,Birthday visit,"Just had two lovely nights at this hotel to celebrate my daughter's 25th ( had been coming down to London for the theatre but tickets postponed) - travelling at this time is unusual and the rooms don't look quite the same with all the little extras taken away  - and the Club room booked didn't have a 'club'  so no free drinks or canapés and the rooms are not automatically being serviced - however the welcome was lovely, we were upgraded without asking and we had a bottle of prosecco in the room ( I had told them it was my daughters 25th) - We also got a complimentary continental breakfast which was lovely and another surprise! 
Our upgraded room was spacious and had good facilities ( microwave, sink, fridge , sofa ) and it was clean ( except for the sausage rolls left in the fridge!) - sadly it didn't have a view and had a very small window but we quickly got used to that. Aircon, rain shower , lighting system all worked very well. 
We ate in The Aviary ( sep review) and used the spa - both booked weeks in advance .
The hotel is beautifully situated for Liverpool Street Station and overlooks a park so quiet.
All the staff we encounter were very pleasant and extremely helpful - the service we received was very good.
Thank you all for making what could have been a disappointing few days a special few days. We really appreciated it.",5,2021,06,08
111,Great service from Concierge,"We had wonderful service from Daniel the Concierge at this hotel, he went above and beyond to help and improve our experience. We were slightly disappointed with our room at arrival and Daniel made is very easy to switch rooms to something more suited. He also helped book a slot at the spa for us and send robes and slippers to the room. He really did improve our experience of the hotel and made us feel special, thank you Daniel. 
Beautiful hotel and beautiful rooftop bar/restaurant!",4,2021,06,07
111,Amazing!,"A really big thank you to Deepak and his team,

We had a really great experience staying here last week. Our room was fantastic, had really nice views overlooking London. The room was spotless.
The service was amazing, there was a personalised note left for us, welcoming us back.
The facilities were so well organised.

We stayed in another 5 star hotel this week and couldn't help compare how much more organised the Montcalm was due to covid
We would definitely recommend it and will definitely be back!",5,2021,06,07
111,"A wonderful stay - Daniel, you absolute beauty","A delightful stay. Lovely gym and spa. Reception is a dream especially Mr Daniel. 
The rooftop bar is lovely too. Book in advance. 
The hallways look like you’ve entered a spaceship. 
Thermostat regulation is lovely in the rooms too.",4,2021,06,07
111,"Amazing hotel!! Fantastic staff, absolutely stunning!","Fantastic,  glamorous 5* Hotel in the city center.  Very welcoming staff, friendly and helpful. We had an amazing time. Very large rooms, slik and elegant, moder large bathroom. Massive beds. Beautiful SPA.  Breakfast on 10th floor was just lush. Staff make sure we were look after and we had everything we needed . We are very please definitely will come back. We'll recommended.",5,2021,06,06
111,Dare walk weekend,"A very impressive building in Finsbury Square.  Great location for exploring Spitifields  and Shoreditch. 
The hotel is spacious, modern and very clean.
Our room was very comfortable and clean. 
The reception staff Mary, Valentina and Daniel were the best reception staff we have ever encountered in a hotel. 
Our evening in the rooftop igloo was a wonderful experience. Alex our waiter gave us exceptional service. 
We will come again",5,2021,06,06
111,Best weekend ever!,"My boyfriend took me for 2 nights to this hotel over the weekend. The second we arrived the customer service was amazing and the staff were lovely. Daniel at the concierge went out of his way all weekend to ensure we had everything we wanted. The staff accommodated to all of our needs, when we arrived we had real rose petals on the bed with birthday balloons and Prosecco with chocolates. The room was spacious and clean, with amazing facilities the whole stay. We loved the spa and the club lounge, I am so sad to be leaving! I can’t wait to come back to this amazing hotel. Thank you Montcalm Royal London House for making our stay so magical ❤️",5,2021,06,06
111,Family time,"We stayed here for 4 nights at the end on May/early June. Overall the hotel is good, The breakfast we were offered inclusive of the room rate was continental so cereals ,yoghurt, toast etc but we could also have a full English for £7.50 per person if we wished, which we did and was perfectly acceptable . We had two rooms which were interconnecting as we had our two boys with us aged 11 and 13 . Both rooms clean and presentable with nice touches and a good size for a London hotel.
The staff are all nice and will do anything they can to help with any concerns you have. 
The swimming pool is decent but you have to book in advance so get that sorted as soon as you can so you don't feel let down . The gym is ok and there is plenty of equipment to have a workout while away if you are inventive . The aircon does not work in the gym and has a fault sign on the controller stating ""filters need cleaning"" . I was soaking by the time id finished as it was very hot as the gym is right next to the pool area which is as humid as the Amazon !  
Now let's talk about the Aviary restaurant /Roof top bar . Basically this is nothing to do with the Hotel and neither is the spa/pool/gym , they are separate entities . So if you ask about them at reception they cannot advise or arrange anything for you , you have to deal with them directly yourself. So you try and book some time in the Aviary directly and you are told that it is fully booked and don't even bother trying to say that you are staying in the hotel hoping that surely you will have some favour because it wont . 
In the 4 days I was there the entrance to the hotel was like an episode of Love Island with plastic looking 20/30 somethings having their photos  taken while looking up to the sky striking a pose for their Instagram, as long as the person taking the picture can manage to direct the camera at them without taking a selfie. I had the misfortune of having to take the lift with a few of these cabbages, the lift has mirrored walls so you can only imagine what that was like as they were taking a selfie of themselves taking selfies whilst eagerly posting them on Instagram stating that they were finally at the Aviary that they booked when they were probably 17 years old to guarantee a few likes. 
So if you book this hotel because you want to go in the Aviary it would be best to book the Aviary first then book the hotel around that particular 2 hour slot of selfie, orange skinned, TOWIE wannabe coolness than end up crying into your Insta feed. 
So to finish, I would say the hotel is great and I would stay again, Location wise is good for the East End and all that has to offer . Moorgate and Liverpool Station within 10 mins march away so all directions accounted for on the Underground. Nice staff, clean rooms and decent bars downstairs away from the selfie paparazzi !",4,2021,06,03
111,Brilliant,We really loved our stay. The staff were really accommodating and we would definitely return. The view from the rooftop is great and the spa is also excellent. The room was big and the bed was really comfy,5,2021,06,03
111,Montcalm Royal London House,"This place was very luxurious, stylish and looked wonderful to stay in, the room was great and everything else too. Staff were all amazing, welcoming and lovely people in assisting us with whatever we needed and definitely will be back again! 

Definitely a 5/5 rated hotel!",5,2021,06,03
111,Outstanding customer service,"Customer service is everything to me personally  when it come to hotel stay and we were warmly welcomed by Fenna who was very attentive,polite, kind, and informative. Fenna’s welcome started our trip on a good note. 

The hotel is COVID secured, they have signs up regarding the guidelines, they took our temperature upon arrival. They had sanitizers stations and clear gloves available which was great for me! The staff were wearing masks also.

I am OCD and was concerned about hotel stay during the pandemic but the room was really clean and tidy which gave me a peace of mind. The bathroom was stylish and bright.

The only pit was the road work noise in the morning.

The Vegetarian breakfast was wonderful and my friend also enjoyed her full English. 

The spa was calming and stylish. 

Overall I would recommend and I look forward to staying with them again.",5,2021,06,03
111,Mont(calm-ish),"Purpose: A room for the night.

Experience: The hotel was in a great location - just a five minute walk from Liverpool Street Station. The room did not disappoint - we chose to stay in the Deluxe Double Room. Having to wait 40 minutes to check-in wasn’t ideal. The reason for booking a room in London was so that we didn’t have to rush around getting ready before our night out. Wasn’t quite the start we were hoping for.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful. It was clear to see that these guys were under huge pressure though.

Final Thoughts: Could have very easily been a 5* review. Would definitely stay again.",4,2021,06,01
111,5 star defo not!!!!!,"Stayed here for 3 nights Friday - Monday 31st May and it was awful, covid secure it is not and everyone not wearing face masks while walking around the hotel and the room 414 was the noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in zircon noise all weekend and an excuse that it would not be cleaned because of covid, was originally booked win the Brewery and told last minute we had to stay here, an utterly disappointing experience and we will not stay here again, Premier Inn are better value!!!!!",1,2021,06,01
111,Staff go the extra mile,"The room was lovely and comfortable. We arrived on the first bank holiday out of lockdown which meant that the hotel was extremely busy. We felt staff handled the situation very well and were accommodating to customers needs. Mary in particular at check in was polite and helpful, apologising for the delay. 

We booked the hotel for our 1 year anniversary and had mentioned this prior to arrival. The staff had left us a lovely hand written card alongside a bottle of Prosecco on ice in the room for when we arrived back from an explore of the area. We both felt this was a lovely touch and just shows how the staff here go the extra mile.",4,2021,05,31
111,Fantastic Hotel stay,"stayed here for 1 night we were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival by a lovely lady called Mary she was very helpful and a credit to the hotel.
the room was absolutely amazing it had everything we could want and more x",5,2021,05,30
111,Ok but not worth the cost,"First room was small and dusty with a view of a alleyway with a phone that wouldn’t stop ringing, stains on the floor! Not worth the 420 spent for 2 nights however once they moved us (which they was very happy to do) the room had a lovely view a lot bigger and cleaner. Couldn’t fault the service! Roof top bar was two expensive minimum spend 200 for the two of us that just wanted one or two cocktails. Spa not open and hard to book but may have been down to Covid.",4,2021,05,30
111,Disappointed,"Had read some really good reviews of this hotel and stayed of personal recommendation so my expectations were high. So I was sad to be disappointed with some elements of the service received. Arrived Sunday checked in at 2 after coffees in the ground floor bar area. After walking along dimly lit corridors hotel room was lovely but as we had booked a club room expected a little more space, particularly in the bathroom which I thought was quite badly designed. The room was clean and welcoming. And due to Covid closing the club lounge (a fact we weren't told till we arrived) a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates were waiting (nice touch) . We booked into the roof top bar for drinks in the evening after dinner at The Alchemist locally. Must say the bar, choice of drinks and service there were excellent. Enjoyed several cocktails recommended by the staff. However Monday morning breakfast served in the closed club lounge. Which is not ideal for breakfast or the high number of people squeezed in was poor. We arrived just after 10am and couldn't be found on the guest list despite Club privileges including breakfast. It was busy but had a couple of tables free which were very small, given there were 3 of us. It took an hour to get our breakfast and even the drinks took an hour and were served in paper cups. Felt like we had popped to Costa.  Full English was standard at best, bacon was dry and rubbery, poached eggs overcooked, sausage ok, mushrooms quite greasy. Toast slightly burnt. Very disappointing. I think given the 5 star status of the hotel it sadly needs some improvement. Maybe we caught it on a bad day....who knows, but we won't be back ☹️",3,2021,05,25
111,the level of service,"I arrived in London during the lock-down and started in the quarantine in the hotel. the level of service even during the pandemic was brilliant and the reception was so much friendly. Especially Mary was so helpful in explaining the rules of the self-quarantine. I was so happy to stay with such high standard hotel. the location also is prime and it so close to the shopping center.  Such a unforgettable stay for 18 days. Thanks a lot to Mary,  Fenna, Duliam and Mihai .",5,2021,05,25
111,Not great,"Booked a ‘ Montcalm club double ‘ as we like to use hotels with a club lounge.disdaining to find club lounge us actually the breakfast room ! Nothing like a club lounge that other hotels operate !! 
The room wax the best double they could offer without going up to a suite. It was tired, on the verge of being scruffy !!god knows what they did to the bed ! I could have done better !  Couldn’t get in to the roof top bar ( the Aviary) as you have to book and it was fully booked with non residents .all 3 days we were there. There is no lounge to relax and the reception area is a joke ! Expect to queue at weekends !  Shouldn’t be 5 star. I wouldn’t stay at Montcalm again",2,2021,05,23
111,Great Experience,"Stayed one night in a double room and the facilities were comfortable and luxurious. The rain shower was incredible and spacious, the bed was massive and incredibly comfortable, and the changing “mood lighting” was a fun touch! Great place for a relaxing and comfortable stay. The location is also very convenient - walking distance to Old Street station and plenty of fun bars and restaurants.",5,2021,05,23
111,Great service and amazing price,"Spent the weekend in the hotel and had an amazing stay, the room was super clean, great views from the 7th floor and amazing price. Reception was very quick and the service was outstanding.  Breakfast in bed and spa what else do you need?",5,2021,05,11
111,Work visit,"I stayed here having been moved from my normal residence at the Montcalm in Marble Arch.

111,Great stay at Montcalm,"We stayed here for 1 night for my wife's birthday. Mary at the checkout desk was incredibly helpful. We also received an unexpected upgrade, which was great. The room was immaculate and it was an extremely restful night. 
We also used the spa. Although under current COVID conditions we didn't stay long. It was still nice enough to get us relaxed.
Overall a great stay . Thank you to Montcalm for making it so pleasant.",5,2020,12,20

111,Amazing service & great rooms,"I have stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House twice now and each time have been happier and happier with each stay. The service is exceptional and I feel like a valued visitor each time. Any time I have a question or request in regards to my stay I was answered promptly and with great customer service. The rooms themselves are large and spotless with all the amenities you could need. Beds are large and comfy, and I honestly had an incredible sleep each time. Room service was prompt and friendly and the full English breakfast was delicious. I am already planning my next stay and would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2020,11,25
111,Hipster hotel with great service,"When we arrived our room wasn't ready, but the last on the desk, Fenna, was so lovely she let us leave our bags in a room and go down for our massages. I asked if we could have a room on a higher floor as it was a special occasion, my boyfriends birthday, and we were moved to a beautiful room on the top floor. The massages we're good although the pool is quite small. Possibly, because of the 10pm curfew when we stayed, there were lots of young people hanging around the lobby. In the early hours a man knocked on our door looking for a party! Very close to restaurants and bars and nice clean room.",4,2020,11,23
111,Another Fantastic Stay - Wonderful & Relaxing,"Have to thank all the staff at The Montcalm for another fantastic stay there. Despite being in the middle of lockdown - I had to stay there for work - and nearly all the facilities having to be shut the staff did everything within their power to make the stay as perfect as possible. They were all super polite, no request was too much and they went out of their way to make us feel relaxed.

Thanks again and will definitely be recommending The Montcalm to everyone",5,2020,11,20
111,Great job done,Just wanted to say a big thank you to the staff and team for making my stay special. They were great with accomodating all my requests as they were particular. And really pulled off all the stops; to top what I wanted.  Thank you to Mary as she really did help and took on board everything i said on the day of my arrival. This was a very special occasion and this really did have the effect I was looking for; and has definitely created a memorable moment for us.,5,2020,11,13
111,The perfect stay for couples!,"We stayed in the Montcalm hotel back in August and was greeted by Alex the manager on duty with a huge smile who made us feel special and comfortable given/ to the current Covid situation.
We felt safe for the whole stay, they had covered all the hygiene/Covid procedures.
We stayed on the ninth floor with its own terrace and glass igloo!!
It was beautiful, the room, the views, the skyline!!
We are extremely grateful for the whole experience that Alex, Vito and the team gave us.
It will be a getaway and celebration that we'll never forget thanks to the Montcalm!
Once again thank you for making a magical memory for us.",5,2020,11,07
111,Great hotel!!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for my birthday and I would strongly recommend this hotel to others. The rooms are stunning. Due to the current pandemic, the spa and other facilities were closed. However given that the room was so nice, was still a good stay. I especially liked the bed, extremely comfortable. The staff were also very helpful. Andreea and Mary were the staff members that dealt with us and they were very nice.",5,2020,11,06
111,Birthday trip,"Very good service & hotel, all the staff were very nice with a great view from the room. Breakfast was really good. 
Stand out staff were andreea who checked us in and Mary who checked us out. 
Definitely coming back",5,2020,11,06
111,This is not a 5* hotel! :S,"I booked a Club Room while I was in London on business - I must say, I am appalled by the lack of ""high standards"" Montcalm perceive to be exceptable by calling themselves a 5* hotel. 

One morning, I was sitting in the lobby drinking my coffee and I noticed one of the characters from Tom and Jerry. You must be thinking: Tom. No! I saw Jerry. This was unpleasant as a mouse is the last thing you will expect to see in a ""well-established hotel"".

Moreover, I did not have the cleanest room as I noticed the bedsheets and carpet were stained. 

Overall, I did not enjoy the whole ""5* Luxury Montcalm Experience"", and I will not be recommending it to my associates.",2,2020,11,05
111,Not as good as reviews suggested,"I stayed with my partner for 2 nights over the Halloween weekend. We booked this hotel for the excellent reviews and for the pool and spa facility.
Unfortunately things didn't get off to the best starts, the check in was very busy and consequently we felt very rushed on our feet to get in and give our details while simultaneously being told the basics of the hotel, all with the resultant feeling that we should move on asap. 
On arrival at the room it was very hot with the AC set to 24 degrees. 
The room itself was a bit below average size, but nicely decorated with a modern feel, large samsung tv, large comfy bed and had some nice lighting features. 
There was a wardobe to hang clothes, but no drawers, hence we somewhat ended up living out of our cases for the 2 nights. 
The room had a touch screen panel to operate the AC, the bathroom heated floor (which is a nice touch), and weirdly the bathroom light which just proved to be awkward when going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. We found that the screen was also very slow to respond, taking away from the luxury feel of the hotel. 
On arrival we were informed that our room didn't yet have a coffee machine or bathrobes. When asked if we would like these delivered to our room we agreed that we would.
However the coffee machine arrived without any bathrobes and coated in a thick layer of dust. As an ex cleaner myself at Hilton hotels during my student years, the layer of dust truly did surprise me.
Alas, further bad impressions included the room view looking out onto an old dismantled HVAC unit of some kind, and parts of the room not feeling like it had been properly cleaned. Out of the 2 bins in the room, none of them had bin liners and there were no sanitary disposal bags much to the dismay of my partner. The toilet had white residue all around on the floor, which looked like dirty water left from the cleaners toilet brush and water that had dripped from the lid when it was last cleaned.
In terms of covid, there were reasonable measures in place, such as a one way system to use the lifts (which wasn't explained very well during our rushed check in), but it did mean limited use of the pool. The sauna and steam room were closed for obvious reasons, and you had to book a 30 min slot to use the pool and jacuzzi. However it seems you'd be lucky to get a slot as we checked in at 2:30pm and immediately tried to book a slot during our stay. There was only an 8:30 am slot available 2 days ahead. 
We also noticed that when in the pool, there is no clock anywhere in the room to tell you how long you've been there.
Whilst the bed itself was big and comfy, I found on both mornings I was woken by a loud thudding noise from somewhere in the hotel which also caused a rattle in our room.
Aside from this, staff were friendly when we entered and left, and on checkout we were asked if we had any feedback to help the hotel improve their service. I did not give any at the time as we had to catch a train, but it is nice to know that the hotel actively seek feedback.
Overall it was a pleasant stay and the location was excellent, but it failed to meet the 5 star luxury that was advertised and that we had anticipated.",3,2020,11,03
111,Miss,"Loved our stay, the room was amazing with brilliant facilities such as a huge smart TV, great quality tea and coffee, powerful hairdryer etc. The bed was excellent quality, comfortable and slept like babies. The whole place was spotless and the staff really went above and beyond for our anniversary, would recommend 100x over",5,2020,11,01
111,Tim Webbe,"Incredible stay, amazing value with complimentary drinks and breakfast included with the room. George the breakfast manager couldn’t have been more helpful and kind - made our stay. Will absolutely book again.",5,2020,11,01
111,Excellent service,"Was originally booked into their hotel around the corner and got re-booked to this hotel so arrived feeling a tad miffed. However, the service was absolutely outstanding. The front desk manager on duty at around 6:00 / 7:00 on Friday 30/10 really went out of her way and completely made the stay excellent - amazing customer service, thank you!",5,2020,10,31
111,"Great service, lovely room","Had a few issues with our stay, not within control of the the hotel, which the manger was excellent at handling.

Lovely room, great location, friendly staff all doing their best considering Covid. An all round great stay.",4,2020,10,29
111,Lovely stay at the Montcalm Royal.

The room had a beautiful view coupled with a  Lovely meal in the Aviary and the cocktails were excellent. *****",5,2020,10,29
111,Lovely Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, with lovely views from rooftop restaurant and bar.I stayed here one night as I was doing some project work just around the corner. I enjoyed the night views of London, including the Shard from the top of the hotel and the room was lovely.",5,2020,10,28
111,Unreal!,Most amazing night. The bed was like a cloud and just felt unreal. Unexpected birthday treat free of charge. All staff were very polite and friendly. Thank you Mary for greeting us and making it special ,5,2020,10,26
111,perfect in every way,"Friday night I was stuck in London- no trains home  - so I did a walk up to the montcalm ….now I had no charge in my phone so no access to e mail etc  , but aas I had stayed here before this was not an issue,,,, the front office staff were superb and looked after me properly  ...ok  now for the room  sumptuous in every way  ,, underground heating in the bathroom was the tops !!!!!  the tv  quite frankly the best in any hotel   huge screen it has full sky and is smart too so all the extra add ons  you tube  catch up tv  etc   .. now for the bed  amazing  ,, great nights sleep , you will not find a more comfortable bed in any hotel !!!!!  room service works till midnight and as promised comes well within 30 mins  …  morning breakfast was light continental and was enough ...lastly in these difficult times I felt completely covid secure  the place is spotless  and they even give you a covid safe bag with mask sanitiser  etc      great stay is all I can say",5,2020,10,26
111,Perfect in every way! ,"3 night stay in August Room 722 and 2night stay in October room 803. If i had to pick out of the two 803 was defo for me. I loved it. Walking in to the room i felt wow. I will be going back and requesting that room again. 

Both my booking was arranged by the hotel manager Deepak, very professional, polite and caring to cater for what we was looking for. 

Our first visit in August we wanted a quiet room as my partner is a key worker he wanted a break and a little rest. 

Upon arrival on both visits we was greeted and taken care of promtly. All procedures were explain to us due to covid and having one way systems etc. We was reminded about spa, restaurent booking etc and was told if we needed anything else just to contact reception.
Prior to our stay we was informed spa booking is half hour slots, gym can be used with no booking and the restaurant needed to be booked in advance. We decided not to use the spa during these difficult times but we have done so a few times in the past and have always enjoyed it with no issues at all. The gym is small, but when i used it no one else was in the gym so i managed to make good use of it. 
I would recommend booking spa and restaurents before your arrival as they do get full booked.

Both room that we stayed in had everything you would get in a 5* hotel, bathrobe, slippers, hairdryer, iron and board etc. Due to covid they were unable to stock the mini fridge but this was not an issue for us as tesco is a 2min walk and we bought a few drinks/ snacks and stocked the fridge ourself, which i found better to be honest. 

Room 803 had a seperate lounge area to the bedroom and two bathroom one with a bath tub and other with a standing shower. Room 722 had one bathroom with shower above the bathtub. 
I loved the fact you get sky in the room and have the option of mirroring your phone to the tv- so i was able to watch netflix on the big screen. Having a separate lounge area meant we had two tv which worked perfect because i wasnt stuck watching football when the other half wanted to watch sports. 
Also room 803 faces the square and you get a beautiful view of london city. Evenings were nice watching sunset from our room.

Oh but our tv didnt work, but after making a call to reception they sent the maintenance gentleman straight away to have a looked and he fixed it. 

Breakfast amazing on the 10th floor, service was very welcoming. Food was great. You can even go outside on the rooftop and can have a lovely view of London city.

Club lounge wasnt open in August but now is fully open. We went just the 1 time and once seated you get a menu with drinks and snacks. You order and this is bought to you. Your able to have continental breakfast at club lounge but we didnt use this at all we stayed upstairs as it was lovely on the 10th floor.

We are already planning our next visit again in December to celebrate my partners 40TH and i personally cant wait. Im sure the hotel team will be excellent to making his 40th super special. 

Once again thank you to Deepak he is truely amazing and to all the staff that helped us along the way and made our stay truely perfect.

111,Amazing awesome brilliant!!!,One of the best hotels we have stayed in honestly the hotel the staff were all second to none and couldnotdoenoughfor us. This will be our new home in london from now on thank you to all at Montcalm Hotel!!,5,2020,10,25
111,Excellent weekend ,"From check in to leaving we really enjoyed our time at this superb hotel. The receptionist checking us in gave me all the necessary information we needed without any waffle. I felt this set the tone for the whole weekend.

The COVID-19 precautions were logical for example all lifts going up were at one end of the hotel and down at the other end. The room was excellent, large bed, superb shower, robes, etc. 

We did have a club room so were able to access the club lounge for breakfast. This was a basic continental type of menu served at your table. I really enjoyed it though if you wanted anything cooked then this was available in the Aviary. This suited us as we were booked at the Duck and Waffle nearby on the Sunday. 

Tried the pub on site and had a super pint of Trump from a craft brewery with some bar snacks. Had a great meal at the Aviary rooftop restaurant on the Saturday.

The hotel staff are super friendly and efficient. 

Overall I could not fault the experience and I’m sure we will return for another visit.",5,2020,10,25
111,Rest and recharge,"Thank you very much I had a fantastic experience! It’s a beautiful hotel with great services, particularly the pool and jacuzzi in the city centre, and COVID safe. I highly recommend the club lounge for evening drinks and breakfast in the morning.",5,2020,10,25
111,Amazing stay!,"Stayed for my boyfriends birthday and it couldn't of been any better! From the minute we checked in the staff couldn't of been any friendlier and helpful. We were made to feel safe during the current times and we were even upgraded to a bigger room. The beds were the comfiest beds we have ever stayed in we wanted to take them home! Thank you so much, we cannot wait to come back.",5,2020,10,24
111,Friday night stay ,"We needed a break away from our usual routine here in London so it was very much a staycation.

Location is amazing. Walked from work and felt like I got away.

Had a drink at the rooftop bar which was lovely - cocktails were strong and view were a great combo. Just book ahead though to get seats but we happily stood. 

Rooms are spacious and fairly clean but maybe need a bit more attention paid to dusting (but that’s just being super picky as I woke to see this on the side table as you can see in the photo).

Shower had fantastic pressure and was super hot. Nice Elemis products. 

Unfortunately I did feel that the social distancing for the lifts is not what it should be. People crowded in (thankfully wearing masks). There needs to be a maximum number in the lifts and it should be enforced. Thankfully we were on second floor so we used the stairs. With a large number of ‘out of towners’ coming down and staying here there really needs strict control over this during peak periods.

We didn’t eat here as there are so many independent amazing restaurants near by. Breakfast at Lantana or Ozone is highly recommended. ",4,2020,10,24
111,It was great!,"We'd booked the Montcalm at the Brewery. On arrival they told us we'd been upgraded to a junior suite at the Montcalm Royal London House. What a great way to start our small break in London for our 25th Wedding Anniversary

The junior suite was brilliant, the service was excellent. It was ideally located to everywhere we wanted to visit, i.e. Spitalfields market, Hawksmoor etc

We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights there and we highly recommend.

Thank you to the Montcalm team :)",5,2020,10,24
111,"Good hotel in London, reasonable prices ","Me and my partner booked this hotel for our 3 year anniversary and had the best stay, the staff here are great and very welcoming. The food was nice too. It’s worth the price and stay even if it’s for one night or two. Would recommend 100%",5,2020,10,22
111,30th Birthday Celebration,"I celebrated my 30th birthday here last week Monday and I had such a wonderful experience from start to end. I paid for one night in the Montcalm club room and massage treatment at the Montcalm wellness spa. Unbeknownst to me, my mum and best friend had surprises planned  for me but needed help from the hotel staff to make it all happen. The first surprise was an extra night stay with a room upgrade, which manager Ankur was so helpful in assisting my mum book an extra night. She was guided through the process, everything was explained throughly and the booking was made. 

The second surprise was having my room decorated and getting a cake to me. For security purposes the hotel needed my permission to give my best friend  access to my room; manager Ankur ensured this was possible by getting my permission via email for my room to be accessed, without ruining the surprise. He continued to liaise with my best friend and assisted her throughout. 

When i arrived at the hotel, I received such a warm and welcoming reception. Ankur introduced himself to me, wished me a happy birthday and I was told I had a choice of being upgraded to a suite or stay in the room i booked. I was checked in very quickly and was given keys to both rooms so i could choose and was escorted by another member of staff who was so friendly and helpful. He first took me to the club room and when I got there it had been decorated with balloons and a cake and bottle of Prosecco were waiting for me. I was so impressed they were able to keep this as a surprise and allowed my best friend access to set everything up. As the room had already been decorated i decided to stay there. 

My family joined me for dinner later that evening at the hotel restaurant, 'Aviary'. The food was delicious and presented so beautifully and the service was also amazing. The waiter was extremely friendly and patient with taking our orders and everything came out very quickly. At the end of the meal, I had a dessert with a happy birthday message brought to my table; it was such an amazing gesture from the restaurant and a wonderful close to the dinner.

Later that night, I  went down to reception to see if it was still possible to upgrade to the suite. I met another manager named Julian who not only helped me change rooms, but assisted me with taking my things and some of the balloons to my new room. Each time I went down to reception the following night, I was met by Julian who was always happy to assist me with anything I needed; from a box of matches, an extra room key to bottles of water - whatever i asked him for he did it with a smile on his face and ensured anything i needed was brought to my room efficiently.

I was really impressed by how each member of staff from when I first arrived went above and beyond to make my 30th birthday celebration an incredible one to remember. From manager Ankurs' professionalism and great communication with helping with the surprises, to the staff who checked me in and brought requested items to my room, the gentleman from room service who was so patient and kind, the friendly waiter and waitresses at my birthday dinner, manager Julian who was always friendly and gracious with his help to receptionists Mihai who was always so jovial and happy to help and Fenna who was kind enough to grant me to a late checkout - THANK YOU!. You all made my 2 nights stay so amazing and a big thanks of appreciation for helping my best friend and my mum with all my birthday surprises. 

If you're struggling to make a decision on whether to stay here or not - STAY HERE!!!!!",5,2020,10,21
111,Irena,Friendly staff and so clean room. Great care for the customers and excellent communication.This was the top quality service ever! You have made our stay unforgettable! Thank you Montcalm Team you are doing great job 👍,5,2020,10,20
111,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here a few months ago and encountered a few problems, understandable as the hotel was getting used to all the new Covid regulations. Because of this the hotel manager Deepak reached out to us and listened to our suggestions, and we returned to the hotel last weekend to stay again over our anniversary. It was a completely different experience and we had an incredible stay, which felt both completely safe and very luxurious.

The check in was friendly and quick, the Covid measures were explained to us clearly and they booked a slot for us to swim the next day. We were very kindly upgraded to a suite and it was an absolutely fantastic room, a brilliant size with two(!) wonderful bathrooms. There were some wonderful, special touches in the room for our anniversary too which was so thoughtful and really made our day!

We had a wonderful dinner and drinks at the rooftop restaurant, a very good breakfast the next morning in the same restaurant, and a great swim in the spa area, all of which felt very safe, hygienic and a real treat.

The location is brilliant too - we walked to the sky garden, borough market and the Tate modern from the hotel the next day and it is only a 5 minute walk to Liverpool street station.

I would now absolutely recommend the hotel, it's a great place to stay with very friendly staff who went above and beyond for us, in a fantastic location. Thank you so much to Deepak and to all the team for making our stay and our anniversary so special!",5,2020,10,18
111,Fantastic service,"Stayed at the montcalm a few times and it's always great. Mary was extremely helpful and friendly, made sure we were very comfortable with our stay. The rooms are always sparkly clean and the rooftop restaurant and views are incredible. Thank you as always.",5,2020,10,18
111,Great Weekend,"Stayed for 2 nights in a club room. The rooms are spacious, modern and very stylish. The club room entitles you to a free continental breakfast which was superb, the staff in the club lounge are polite and very attentive. This area is also available early evening for pre dinner drinks. 
The pool area is very nice but quite small.
Great roof top restaurant with amazing views. Would definitely recommend if your visiting the city.",5,2020,10,18
111,Exceptional,"This is far most the best hotel I have ever been to.  The room with view, specially pool area and rooftop area were absolutely amazing. Stayed for just 1 night with my friend but we both loved it. Me & my friend would like to thank Mary For being so lovely and accommodating. Back for Christmas this year for sure..",5,2020,10,15
111,Loved it,Stayed with my fiancee as a surprise to our actual proposal date. She was surprised with the small little touches added to our stay. Upon check in Ken the Night Manager gave us a complimentary upgrade and the room was spectacular. Mary in the reception somehow got us a slot at the pool in the morning and we felt so good. Thanks to you guys for looking after us.,5,2020,10,15
111,Amazing,"After recommendations from my friends, I stayed at this hotel for my birthday on my recent trip to London. The hotel atmosphere was truly amazing and faultless. Staff named Mary at the reception is such an amazing person. She makes sure all ur expectations are met leaving you very satisfied with her customer relation services. I highly recommend this place for anyone planning an occasion or trip.",5,2020,10,14
111,Great customer service and venue!,"We held our company offsite at the Montcalm Royal London. The team has set up a beautiful space for us and were incredibly thoughtful and kind throughout our entire stay. It was also a fantastic location - centrally located so the entire team were able to get there quite easily. We had lunch upstairs at the Aviary which was fantastic and really easy. The staff throughout the hotel were incredibly polite, professional and thoughtful - they definitely went above and beyond! Overall, we had an amazing time and would definitely recommend coming back and others for future events!",5,2020,10,14
111,the best in London!,"stayed for 4 night for a dinner and meetings the following day. I have to say from start to finish it was a really good experience. the rooms are fresh, clean with comfy beds excellent food and service",5,2020,10,14
111,Pleasant stay,"Stayed with my partner for her birthday celebrations and gave her a surprise at this hotel. When I called the hotel lady named Mary helped in delivering exceptional service with all my requests for small surprises to be left in the room. She loved it and the whole enviroment itself. Room view was great and bed was really comfortable. Shall be back soon for sure, no doubt about it.",5,2020,10,13
111,Mr stanley martins,Stayed here in September however a bit late to post a review about our stay. But this hotel is an absolute gem and so are the team. We were pleased to being informed that we our stay was upgraded to a Montcalm Club room and the view from the room was amazing. The burger & sticky toffee were delicious from the in room dining menu. Thanks to Mary who helped us in every possible way to make our stay worthwhile with small little gestures as compliments. Definitely returning back in November for our parents anniversary and as a family trip,5,2020,10,13
111,Amazing staff,I booked this place as I previously visited the Montcalm Brewery. The Royal London House was worth the visit as it was very comfortable and the hotel took precautionary measures regarding the current situation. The room was clean and everything was spot on. A warm welcome by Mary and she looked after all my petty requests upon check in itself. Great job everyone and will be back soon.,5,2020,10,12
111,Wonderful service in difficult times. ,"I stayed here during September on business. The hotel was quiet so there were a few obvious changes such as different elevators for up and down, but overall it was a five star experience at a bargain price!

Staff were amazing and I would especially compliment David in the breakfast area. Breakfast was one of the best in London - a real full English - other hotels in the Montcalm group  should take note!

Great rooftop bar with amazing views. 

Fully recommended. ",5,2020,10,12
111,Really nice !!,Visited this beautiful hotel last week and it was a buzzing atmosphere. But our stay was great and we were pleased to meet Mary who gave us plenty of information about the hotel and its services. She even managed to get us a slot at the pool and rooftop bar. Breathtaking views I must say and above all me and my partner had a good night sleep as we requested for a quiet room.,5,2020,10,12
111,Will return back,"Loved our stay and we got a studio suite upgrade too. Thanks to Mary who went out of the box to do this upgrade gesture free of charge. Was definitely worth it, my girlfriend had a good time. Will definitely return back.",5,2020,10,12
111,Amazing,"Had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights as a weekend getaway and loved every bit of it
Upon check-in Mary took our temperature readings and gave us safety kits which were really good. We informed her about our special occasion being our 1year anniversary so the manager Ken was so kind enough to provide us with a club room with a view along with club lounge breakfast too. Unfortunately we didnt visit the spa or restaurant as we had other commitments. But overall it was perfect. Thanks everyone.",5,2020,10,12
111,Anniversary Stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm for a night to celebrate our anniversary, Mary (Reception) was very helpful from the moment we got to the hotel to the moment we left. She kindly upgraded our room, we had rose flowers petals on the bed, a bottle of Prosecco and the view from the room was amazing! We enjoyed dinner and drinks at the Aviary (restaurant in the rooftop of the hotel) which was amazing. The next day we made use of the relaxing spa and enjoyed a continental breakfast before we left. We honestly couldn’t have faulted our stay and will definitely be back. Thank you to Montcalm and Mary!",5,2020,10,10
111,Great Location,"Are you even a Londoner if you haven't taken a picture by the medusa at the Montcalm? 

We visited to the Montcalm for our anniversary and had a great time. The staff were all very friendly. Breakfast was nice. Unfortunately its not great for evening dining so we opted to go somewhere else. But for drinks the rooftop area is perfect.

The spa was a bit busy for the times we are in. We did have to book a time slot before going so I assumed this meant less people would be there but it wasn't the case. So we did our medusa pics and left shortly after. The room was very comfortable and we enjoyed the mood lights. I would return.",4,2020,10,09
111,Outstanding Customer Service,"This was a birthday gift for my partner and I must say I was quite hesitant on how everything will go due to the current situation. We have been quite stressed and overwhelmed recently and this trip was a breath of fresh air. 

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the location is nothing but the best. However, what makes this property stand out from the rest in the market is its staff. A special mention to Ankur, who has gone way beyond his capabilities to ensure that we receive a memorable experience. He looked after us throughout the entire stay and we even received some amenities in the room, which was a lovely touch. 

Thank you for your hospitality, Ankur! We will certainly be staying only here moving forward.",5,2020,10,09
111,Best choice of hotel,"I travel regularly to London for business purposes. This time, I have decided to stay in the Montcalm Royal London House and I must say I regret that I did not find this gem earlier. The building is absolutely outstanding. Location wise, I reach all of my meetings on time due to the convenient transport links. Staff is friendly and welcoming and the room was extremely comfortable. This will definitely be my number 1 choice of hotel in the future.",5,2020,10,09
111,Miss,"Lovely hotel , loved the underfloor heating , really comfy big beds such nice shower , visited for my 21st with my 2 friends and they left a bottle of Prosecco and some chocolates in the room such nice touch. Mary was really helpful on the desk",5,2020,10,06
111,Hotel fine but many guests completely Covid unaware,"The 4 of us only stayed here because the ‘Montcalm Brewery’ hotel remains closed (notwithstanding that we had a booking for that hotel). The staff at RLH (uniformly excellent) sorted us out with rooms and were suitably apologetic. The rooms were comfortable although I felt they needed some TLC and breakfast was good. 

However, the big problem for us was how rowdy the ground floor area got in these Covid times. I should say that we’re not especially fussy about the rules but when we arrived back from our evening meal at just before 9pm, the ground floor was packed out with little/no social distancing nor mask wearing. The lift etiquette was appalling - people just jumping into our lift (without masks). 

I’m guessing the current 10pm end time meant that people were just going crazy to pack in some Saturday night fun into a tight timescale but it made our (sober) little group feel pretty anxious. I appreciate that it must be hard for hotels to manage the current and ever-changing situation but having a staff member simply taking guests’ temperatures was a complete waste of time. Proper security for guests by way of oversight of peoples’ conduct is urgently needed along with clearer signage (about masks and lift capacities, for example).

My sense of poor guest security was only compounded when some late night prowler was banging on our door at 5am wanting a cigarette lighter!

From the reviews, it looks like our experience was well below the standard that other guests have enjoyed",3,2020,10,06
111,Great experience a real  nice hotel,"Nice rooms in a great location.The roof top is a must.They have great drinks and atmosphere is great 
Had Good night sleep and great experience. They have a lovely Spa.that was out of usedue to covid 19",5,2020,10,05
111,Aidan,"Great relaxing stay, shower was the best I’ve had and the tv was also the best I’ve watched. Daniel and Camelia were extremely helpful with everything and upgraded us at no extra cost. Great team and hotel.",5,2020,10,05
111,Very helpful,On arrival for what ever reasons my emails hadn’t been read however Alex was straight on the case to make it all right we was given a room upgrade as it was my girlfriends birthday Alex was very helpful . The hotel was amazing staff were friendly and helpful the room was amazing . Spotless and clean comfy bed well worth the money and we will definitely revisit again,5,2020,10,05
111,Beautiful,"Best service ever! Everyone was super helpful and polite. Can’t wait to go back, also extremely clean and room service was delicious. Absolutely worth every penny. This place is an absolute gem!!! ❤️❤️",5,2020,10,04
111,A true 5* experience- cannot fault this hotel! Incredible service,"My partner and I have just returned from a fantastic night at Montcalm Royal London House. I would like to say a big thank you to Mary on the front desk who made our visit extra special without realising how much it made our stay. My partner and I are frequent customers at this hotel but this weekend we wrongly chose to book a weekend at K west Spa hotel which we were HUGELY disappointed at! Long story short we were so unhappy we decided to cancel our Saturday reservation and book a last minute reservation at Montcalm, our favourite London hotel to resurrect the awful weekend we were having. Upon arriving, it was so refreshing to receive such lovely service by Mary and be offered an upgrade for being regular customers. This truly meant a lot to us after the awful experience we had just had at K West hotel, so thank you so much Mary, you made our weekend so much better. The staff at Montcalm cannot do enough for you and are always on hand making sure you are enjoying your stay. More importantly, the hotel is very clean and the amenities and quality of the rooms are 5*. We will never make the mistake of trying another London hotel ever again, and will always come back to Montcalm because we always leave satisfied and have such an amazing time! I would also like to add how helpful the spa staff were in fitting us in with a last minute spa session on Sunday as due to covid regulations; quite understandably the spa slots were booked but they still managed to fit us in and also a big thank you to Mary on front desk who extended our check out time to allow us to enjoy the spa facilities before we left. I honestly could not recommend this hotel enough!",5,2020,10,04
111,The staff have been amazing,"Daniel Concierge has been so helpful. Checking availability  for museums, suggesting The Queens House when most others were booked, then making our booking. He also recommended suitable places for us to eat, and ensured a table was booked. In fact all the staff have been very pleasant, patient and helpful. Thank you for helping make the first meet up with my 80 year old mother since lockdown a fun and relaxing trip to remember.",5,2020,10,04
111,Brilliant,"Lovely hotel, with amazing service from start to end. The staff are VERY attentive. Mary especially at reception was wonderful.

111,The BEST Luxury Hotel In London,"I had the BEST two nights of my life at the Montcalm RLH. We went there for our Honey Moon. 
Firstly, MASSIVE thank you to Joel Menezes. OMG what an incredible guy he is.. He was the one that answered the phone when I wanted to make the reservations. He was so nice and professional. He even arranged a WELCOME Package For us and recommended interesting places we can visit whilst at the hotel. Thank u sooooo much Joel. We enjoyed our stay. The welcome package was beautiful. I had to come Home with the card because I love the words in it. Joel thank you soo much. You are a professional. 

Unfortunately the Spa Slots were all fully booked but we managed to get a slot to use the pool and the jacuzzi. Ans MINE OH MINE What a perfection. Absolutely LOVE the pool and Jacuzzi. So many memories and pics were taken.
Oh least I forget, breakfast at the hotel was amazing.. LOVE LOVE LOVE 

Joel also recommended going to the AVIARY. We used the restaurant. Lovely waitress by the name ADELINA was veryyyyyyyy nice. OMG she treated us like a King and a Queen. Honestly my whole experience at the hotel was soo nice I will end up with a whole essay if I keep going on.. Adelina thank you so much for the way u treated us when we came to the restaurant. Your work ethics are Phenomenal. 

Lastly, the lady that attended to us when checking out too was very nice and pleasant. Her name is Andreea. 

Thank you MontCalm RLH. I had a GREATTT Time with my husband and we will DEFINITELY come back again. 100%",5,2020,10,04
111,Perfect Hotel,"Absolutely perfect hotel. 
We stayed for my birthday, arrived with birthday balloons on the bed and a cute little birthday card from guest services. 
Swimming pool & spa were beautiful, very clean and well organised time slots. 
Highly recommended this hotel",5,2020,10,03
111,Amazing - will definitely be back,Stayed at the Montcalm with a last minute booking as previously was booked for another london hotel and so glad that I changed. Upon arrival we were checked in very quickly and kindly upgraded for my partners birthday! The room was clean and spacious and the black our curtains were great. Will definitely be returning thank you for a great stay,5,2020,10,03
111,Midweek Overnighter on business.,"Never having stayed here before, I was unsure what to expect, however, standards were great, bed was really comfortable in the standard room and the look was very modern and contemporary.
Staff were excellent from Andreea on the front desk to Vito at the downstairs breakfast area. They were very helpful and went our of their way to assist with any queries.
The location was also very central for everything. I will be staying here again.",5,2020,10,03
111,Excellent hotel cannot fault,"Having stayed before we had no worries staying here during all this covid business, the hotel was spotless as always with extra measures in place that really do reassure you. The room was great obviously some things have had to change but that is understandable and for your own safety. The gentleman on reception couldn't do more for us, made us feel extra special and was an absolute charm. On checkout Andreea was very smiley and friendly and really did want to know if there was anything that could be done differently and happily the answer from us was a no. I will defiantly recommend all montcalm hotels and look forward to staying here again, shame its not more often. Thank you to all the staff and the work done to the hotel it was all greatly appreciated",5,2020,10,02
111,"Amazing stay, thanks Mary.",Booked this hotel for my partner's birthday celebration and it was amazing. Upon check in receptionist named Mary was so accommodating and gave us a junior suite upgrade. The Hermes toiletries were a plus to the room features. Luckily we managed to get a slot in the pool and the late check out request helped us a lot. We will be back soon.,5,2020,10,01
111,Great Modern Hotel,"Spotless Clean and very professional service throughout, the Montcalm provides the tranquility and comfort you need. Our room was clean and modern with all amenities ready or on request. Health procedures are in place to protect guests and staff. Would definitely stay again. Breakfast quality was very good.",5,2020,10,01
111,Fantastic,"We were looking for a place that could accommodate our request to relax, with pool and a private place to sit and drink. This was all met at the Montcalm Royal London House. The check in was amazing and Mary helped us in every way possible to make it a memorable one for me and my partner. Manager named Ken helped us to secure a spot in the rooftop bar as we came specially for that but had no prior booking. Our room was with a view and couldnt fault the services. Thank You everyone and we will return back next month with our friends and family.

Thank you once again",5,2020,09,30
111,Amazing stay and helpful staff,"I recently stayed at Montcalm Royal London house for one night. I regularly stay at this hotel when I’m in London for a weekend as the price is always reasonable and facilities and service always excellent so it is always my first choice. I’m not one of those people who leaves reviews but today I had to as I had such a fab experience. When I got to the desk to check in after a long long day I was greeted by Fenna who saw how tired I was and made the check in experience swift, easy and enjoyable. She even went the extra mile with my room and allowed me to discuss my floor preference and ensured to accommodate any requests I had. I always appreciate when someone goes out their way to help and offer an above board service and with a smile! She then called to check I had everything I needed when I reached my room which I really found a helpful touch and again showed her going the extra mile. I needed a dental kit the next morning and this was brought to me straight away without delay and the cleanliness and room was all excellent as usual so I was definitely not disappointed. It was a seamless experience from start to finish and I will definitely be staying again, can not recommend this hotel enough - never disappointed. Even though nothing extraordinary happened during my stay it is just the constant consistency of great service and little touches I appreciate the most on my stays so Thank you.",5,2020,09,30
111,Fabulous hotel!,"We went with another couple to celebrate my friends 40th birthday. 
Mandeep the manager was great as we was originally booked into the Marble Arch hotel but the spa area was not ready so Mandeep kindly moved us to the royal london and wow!! Nothing was too much for anyone, they put some treats in my friends room for her birthday and the aviary restaurant was delicious! 
Mary at the front desk was extremely helpful and great experience 😊",5,2020,09,28
111,Amazing Hotel!,Me and my boyfriend stayed here for our anniversary weekend and we had the best time! The staff are very friendly and helpful especially at the front desk. The rooms are the perfect size and I loved the mood lighting and underfloor heating in the bathroom. Location is perfect and cabs stop outside frequently so it is easy to get around the city. The food and cocktails at the rooftop restaurant / bar are unbelievable and its so nice to only have to pop upstairs to get this kind of experience. I cannot wait to re-visit!,5,2020,09,28
111,Weekend of Dreams,"I booked the Montcalm Royal London House for a weekend stay, as well as bookings at the Aviary Rooftop Restaurant and Bar for Breakfast and Lunch. The venue was wonderful and service second to none. 
I proposed to my now fiancé during my stay and the staff at the Montcalm were extremely supportive in planning and enabled the perfect proposal.
Mary in particular was very helpful, making our extended stay memorable; she is an asset to Montcalm! 
We’ll be back!
",5,2020,09,27
111,Great Hotel and Great Management,I was there for 3 days and more important than the high quality of the rooms was to see how professional was the staff. I was especially impressed with Michael Nunes due to his professionalism during all my stay in the hotel.,5,2020,09,24

111,Nothing too much trouble!,"The guest services team, particularly the lovely Andreea were very welcoming and helpful, they did everything they could to make our Birthday stopover special. The wellness centre and Aviary, roof top bar need to booked in advance and these amenities really make the stay. We watched the sun set before heading out to dinner. They have a one way lift system and COVID measures in place; we felt very safe.",5,2020,09,22
111,Good stay near Liverpool Street,"We booked the Montcalm as part of our weekend getaway.  The service was very good, staff were courteous and check in was seamless.

The room was clean and comfortable. 

The only negative - the hotel is loud, people making lots of noise in the corridors late into the night/early morning.",4,2020,09,22

Though I didn't visit all areas but it was an amazing stay and my son's made a good choice for hotel selection,5,2020,09,22
111,The best hotel i’ve been to,Me and my boyfriend came here for our anniversary together and from the second we walked in was welcomed by friendly & polite staff then they provided us with face masks & hand sanitiser straight away. A staff member named Mary helped us and went the extra mile to sort our breakfast in the morning and have rose petals on the bed as a surprise for my anniversary which was the best! She made sure we was happy with our room and even when we walked out to go for dinner checked again we was happy with everything! Amazing service will definitely be coming back here again!,5,2020,09,21

111,A beautiful hotel in a fab location!,"We are just having one more drink at the beautiful Aviary Roof Top bar at the Montcalm Royal London Hotel before returning home. A great hotel location with a short walk from Moorgate tube station. A variety of bars, restaurants and pubs nearby. Excellent breakfast in the glass surrounded restaurant on the top floor. We suggest booking in advance a table for drinks on the Aviary outdoor terrace in the evening if the weather is nice. Also, due to Covid we needed to book a slot in the spa to use the pool and jacuzzi in advance. Mary on the reception desk was very friendly and professional ensuring we had all the information needed for our stay. We will definitely return.",5,2020,09,20

111,Wonderful stay,"Just recently came back from this hotel. I had wonderful stay where i was to spend one night. The room looks perfect with comfy bed and perfect amenities. There was rooftop restaurant Aviary where  you can see beautiful view of London. I had access to the lounge where i got some free drinks and snacks.

111,Beautiful Hotel,"My boyfriend had booked the hotel for 2 nights as a trip away to propose to me! It’s a beautiful hotel and even though we stayed during the pandemic we didn’t feel it impacted our trip too much. We were upgraded when we checked in which was lovely, the only criticism I have is that when we checked in I wish they had given us a run through of the hotel amenities that were available for us to use, because apart from the rooftop restaurant/bar (The Aviary - which we did feel uncomfortable going up there as when we asked if we could have a drink in the outside area they looked at me like I had 3 heads which made us feel out of place even though we were staying at the hotel) nothing was signposted. Which in hindsight could have been on purpose to try to not have it overcrowded. We had booked a club room and until the second afternoon/evening we didn’t know we were free to use it for complimentary tea, coffee, snacks. It was only because a family member had stayed recently and told us about it the second day we were staying. We used it on our second evening for a glass of Prosecco each and a few nibbles and the following morning for a continental breakfast which was as beautiful. There are actually 2/3 bars/restaurants in the hotel which we didn’t realise until leaving which we would have loved to make use of and also the spa. All in all we enjoyed our stay! It’s a lovely hotel and a fab location for getting around London as there is a tube station around a 5 minute walk away and there is a lovely green area outside where you can sit with a coffee shop! Thankyou!",5,2020,09,19
111,Great place and very friendly and helpful staff,My friend had organized his birthday party at this hotel. It is an amazing place to hang out and celebrate with your friends.

111,Anniversary Trip,"Booked this place to celebrate 2nd anniversary with my partner and were blown away with the service provided by front of house team. Room was very clean and comfortable and we were handed PPE kit on arrival. This made us feel very comfortable, especially considering current pandemic we are living in! We enjoyed our SPA time and also roof top experience. Would definitely return and recommend to friends and family. Thank you Montcalm Royale London House team to make my trip enjoyable and memorable XX",5,2020,09,19
111,Amazing service,"We were about to stay just one night in the hotel but when we met Michael Nunes at the reception we were so impressed with his service that we decided to extend the stay for another 2 nights.

We thought Michael Nunes was the manager but he is just an employee. It would be great that all hotels would have a Michael Nunes on their reception.",5,2020,09,19
111,Absolutely loved it!,"I had a wonderful stay in this hotel. Team was just fantastic and very helpful. My Family and I really had a pleasant break and a comfortable stay.

111,Birthday Celebration,"My partner booked this hotel to celebrate my birthday. The moment we entered, we were blown away with the stature of this place and the way our occasion was taken care of. We booked a package of Prosecco and petals to be placed with an additional cost and to my surprise, balloons, chocolates were additionally placed in the room with a personalised hand written note! We managed to book rooftop restaurant for evening drinks and enjoyed city view tremendously. During this pandemic, this hotel has made sure that cleaning standards are top notch. We will be coming back during Christmas and have no doubts to be blown away again! Keep up the good work guys.

The cleanliness at this hotel was perfect and the location is great. The best part was the hotel staff, they were friendly and always accommodating of my requests.

111,Not 5 stars,"* Slow wifi - 2 mbit / s down at peak 
* Dirty windows, torn curtains
* Gym opens at 8am; clostrophobicly small
* Even the top end rooms are run down

Overall this just isn’t a 5 star hotel. Not sure what more there is to say.",2,2020,09,16
111,Another fantastic weekend at the Montcalm!,"I have stayed a few times and it just keeps getting better! Camelia and the team are wonderfully professional and went out of their way to ensure we were always happy. Our rooms was spacious and quiet, room service super quick and delicious and the views and service in the Aviary made for a perfect lunch spot! Thank you! ",5,2020,09,14
111,Fenna The receptionist was the best!!,"We came for our anniversary, the receptionist was very polite and upgraded our room. The room was wonderful, bed was very comfy, had everything we needed. So much to do in the area! However, we did come for a spa weekend and wasn’t even able to use the spa due to not being informed before hand that you had to book it so this was a little upsetting as we wasn’t expecting to go out the hotel much but we was able to find a lot to do round the area instead. Definitely would come again.",4,2020,09,13
111,I love this place! But please give more reservation options to hotel guests.,"I have stayed here a few times now. Recently on business and last year as a couple.

Great location, hotels rooms are great and the roof top bar is just lush. The restaurants and cocktail bar is unrivalled.

However, the only downside is that they do not keep specific tables in the rooftop restaurant / bar for hotel guests. So, if you turn up to the hotel for a stay, just realise at that point they have a rooftop bar, well, you may not be lucky getting a space!",5,2020,09,11
111,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed in a club suite for one night and had a wonderful stay. The room was spacious and comfortable with a lovely view over Finsbury Square and London beyond. The breakfast service was very efficient with a good range of choices. The hotel has a great location just a short walk from the tube. Dinner and drinks in the rooftop restaurant are a must and I strongly recommend.

Staff were all very friendly, professional and attentive. I look forward to staying again.",5,2020,09,11
111,Mis-sold,"I and my partner had booked a Montcalm club suite room at an extra £50 where you were supposed to be able to access clubroom with beverages and snacks. Also, have access to the rooftop and swimming pool. On looking at some reviews previous to our stay I read that the clubroom was closed. I phoned the hotel after about 40 mins of ringing we finally got through. We asked if this was the case and they confirmed it was closed and no alternative was offered. They also stated as we had booked through booking.com we would have no access to it anyway and then that it was only open a Friday and Saturday( our stay was a Tuesday) we noticed the review the night before. I asked how they could justify charging for a club room if the facilities were not available and they said the room was slightly larger. Not a justification in my opinion. We then were considering downgrading the room and asked about the swimming pool and rooftop as also read some reviews which concerned me about these facilities. I was told the swimming pool and rooftop needed to be booked in advance. You got a 30 min slot for swimming pool. The rooftop you went onto a separate website to book. There were very few slots left. After this, we decided against staying in the hotel and just made a rooftop booking. We stayed in a hotel that was half the price with similar facilities which had no problem in being clear about what was and wasn't available. We were very disappointed and stressed out at the bad communication. When we walked through the reception to go to the rooftop most things did look closed. The rooftop was lovely but we only had a one hour slot and couldn't stay longer so please be aware of this when booking. I understand things are not normal in current circumstances but the lack of transparency was pretty shocking. We got a refund in the end but even that wasn't straightforward!",2,2020,09,11
111,Really nice hotel will definitely go back,"Really top notch hotel, will definitely recommend. Mary was a nice and friendly receptionist also and streamlined the checkin and checkout appropriately and fast. The bed in the room was massive and it was a good location for all I had to do in London. There was a good selection of Tv Channels to choose from also. I wish I spent more time in the room but I was out and about. I also like the gadget on the wall, that you could use to control different elements in the room.",5,2020,09,10
111,Ruined 10 year wedding anniversary,"Myself and my husband booked to stay at the Montcalm at the brewery London  city for the night of 4th September. We booked the wow suite as it was our 10year wedding anniversary and we have stayed here previously for 3 of our other anniversaries and they have always made it special. 

Unfortunately we were emailed to say that we had been moved to another hotel(this one)  on the day of check in but assumed the hotel would be of the same standard oh how wrong we were. The only thing similar was that both hotels had the word Montcalm.

The hotel we were moved to was nothing like the Montcalm we booked it was not special it was a glorified business hotel the room was basic  unwelcoming and frankly not clean! Please see attached photos. Unfortunately for us we have stayed at the Montcalm at the brewery so knew what we were missing out on and so the whole stay we were comparing how awful the replacement hotel we had been booked in was.

Photos show stain on wall, that furniture was broken and draw would only stay shut with paper in it, the curtains didn’t close properly and there was a ladies underwear sanitary sticker left stuck in some furniture.

This stay was for a special occasion but staying here frankly ruined it it was no where near worth the same amount I feel we were robbed. Also the cheek of being told we had been given a complimentary breakfast when that was what we had already book. I was so angry and upset at a time we were supposed to be celebrating I daren’t raise it with the hotel staff as I was worried I would either shout or cry as this was not what we had book/ expected. 
 
This visit left us feeling utterly disappointed and knowing our 10 year anniversary was no where near celebrated the way it should of been.",2,2020,09,09
111,Miss Natasha,"This hotel was brilliant, all of the staff were so welcoming, our room was beautiful and clean, and Michael at reception went out of his way to make sure my boyfriend felt special on his birthday which meant so much to me and us, I will definitely go back again and highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good, affordable central location. It’s AMAZING.",5,2020,09,08
111,Absolutely amazing customer service and care!!,"My husband and I booked the 'Wow Suite' at the Montcalm the Brewery for our 21st Wedding Anniversary. Sadly because of covid it was closed and we were moved to the Montcalm Royal London House. Initially I was disappointed as having worked all through lock down  was really looking forward to the 'wow factor' and relaxing in luxury.
We honestly could not have wished for a better hotel experience to that of which we received at the Royal London! We were checked in by Camelia & Mary who went above and beyond to find a room that we were wanting for our 2 night relaxing stay. They were both so lovely and caring and went out of their way to ensure we had a 5 star stay.
Through out our stay all the staff were absolutely wonderful! Kind and attentive, even though they are trying to negotiate extremely difficult working circumstance's. Nothing was to much for them. The rooms were lovely and clean and well cared for. My husband and I have stayed at many hotels be it for business or pleasure but I can genuinely say this was the best care that we have received. When we checked out the manager came to speak with us to check on our stay. I made sure that he new that all the staff were just fabulous! We can not wait to book a return visit. I can definitely say that we got the 'Wow factor'! Thank you all at the Montcalm  Royal London House and look forward to staying again soon!",5,2020,09,07
111,Amazing Service,Stayed for my wife’s birthday and had the best stay. Was checked in by Mary who gave me a complimentary upgrade. Rooms were lovely. Amazing service and safety measures put in place. Will definitely be coming again,5,2020,09,06
111,Lovely hotel,One of my favourite hotels to stay at! Despite the current situation this hotel has made me feel safe and comfortable. Safety measures were in place and 100% recommend to anyone looking for a hotel. Mary checked me in and was so friendly and polite. Thank you montcalm hotel for a pleasant stay.,5,2020,09,03
111,"Far from a 5 star stay, worrying pool standards","Just returned from a disappointing one night stay at the Montcalm.

Check in at reception was standard but nothing special, however we received very little information about the hotel - no mention of the one way elevators, how to book the spa (we only knew this due to reading reviews before we arrived) or any information on the lack of club lounge (we paid extra for a club room and were never informed that the club lounge wouldn't be open). 

The most troubling part of the visit was the spa. We headed down in our robes as instructed, signed in and made our way to the pool. On arrival the water in the pool looked cloudy and I even jokingly made an off-hand remark to my partner that I ""didn't remember the pool looking this cloudy last time we visited"". Thinking nothing more of it, we derobed and made our way in. It was at this point that we noticed the water level was worryingly low, to the extent that the water didn't even reach up to the drains/filters positioned near the top of the inside of the pool. I honestly wish I'd taken photos at the time. Thankfully at that moment the Manager came in and informed us that due to a major leak they would have to power down everything in the spa and that everyone would have to leave. We wouldn't have stayed longer even if this had not been the case. To top it all off the spa were meant to phone us once things were back up and running so that we could return later in the day, but they never did (we wouldn't have gone  back, but it's the gesture and expectation as a 5 star hotel to follow through with your promise). 

We stayed in a club room and whilst spacious, there were stains on the carpet and a general run down feel to the place. 

There were so many relatively small things to our visit which went wrong, from lack of communication (we completely understand the decision to close the club lounge, but this should have been made much clearer or communicated to us), poor facilities, having to phone concierge on check-in for toilet roll as they hadn't put any in our bathroom and general apathy from most staff that they soon added up. As a result it certainly didn't feel like a five star stay compared to other hotels.",2,2020,09,03
111,Relaxation,"We stayed at the Montcalm RHL for a girls spa weekend .
We were welcomed into a warm atmosphere.

The reception staff were so friendly and helpful. 
Ankur, the manager of the hotel is amazing.
He was very kind, professional and always had a smile on his face.

They hotel maintained a high level of hygiene and maintained the standards of social distancing so well.
We felt so comfortable and relaxed.

I would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning in the near future",5,2020,09,03
111,Lovely stay again,"Came back for a special stay as me and my partner got engaged here in their rooftop restaurant and stayed the night in one of their beautiful rooms back in november, and we wasnt disappointed when we came for our second visit! Staff were so friendly as before, everything was so lovely and the room was gorgeous. Couldnt find a fault if we tried. Thank you for another lovely stay will definitely be returning again in the near future. Such a special place.",5,2020,09,02
111,Amazing,"My original booking was with the brewery on booking.com. Which upon arrive we found out was  
was unfortunately closed. However, Montcalm London City, had issued a quick response and solution at hand when arriving. They had the perfect room to match the one I had already paid for. The stay was for a special occasion, and in no time at all they were able to decorate the room with rose petals and some treats. Alongside this they had delivered excellent service, in helping organise a surprise visit for my partner. The night was fantastic and we couldn’t of chosen a more delightful hotel to spend such a joyful occasion in. If you’re looking for a hotel who caters to the needs of their guest and goes above and beyond, then Montcalm is the hotel to chose. Thank you again for your help Fenna and Andrei you were fantastic !",5,2020,09,02
111,Nice but not as nice as The M By Montcalm in Shoreditch,"I checked in at the Montcalm Royal London House on Friday for 3 nights to enjoy bank holiday weekend with some friends who live in London! I picked the Royal London House as the Shoreditch branch I usually stay at was still closed due to COVID. 

Check in
Check in was really fast, I was served by a lovely lady whos name I sadly can’t remember and Mary. Both absolutely hilarious and very sweet on arrival! They were both also very helpful throughout my stay and are an asset to the hotel! I was given my room keys and WiFi password within a few minutes. I was also given the option to place authorisation on my card for extras. I declined and this and it was no problem what so ever. This for me is a huge plus as I never order room service and I’m not a fan of waiting days on end for the charge to be refunded on to my card. More hotels should do this and offer a pay as you go service instead. My room mini bar had also been emptied, Addis perfect for me as I bought my own drinks and was able to keep them cold throughout my stay. Again I wish more hotels did this!

COVID
The hotel are taking really great measures to follow COVID-19 guidelines. On entry there are large hand sanitising dispensers and more at reception with gloves also available. Before I could go to my room I had my temperature checked and also was informed about the one way lift system. The lifts are disabled in the correct way so people can’t ignore the rules which I think is great. You can use the pool for a swim for half an hour a day, this is to be booked directly via the spa. All the guidelines were explained to me at reception during check in. 

The hotel and rooms sadly are not as luxurious as the M by Montcalm, the room carpets could could do with a bit of an update and if you’ve stayed at the M By Montcalm you may find yourself slightly disappointed as it’s certainly not as plush. However the bed was comfortable and the room size pretty decent.

Overall I had a great stay and I would  absolutely  return if the the Shoreditch branch remained closed.",4,2020,09,01
111,Girlfriends birthday,"We had the most amazing stay at the montcalm, luxurious stay and amazing customer service. We were helped by a helpful member of staff called Mary who took us through all guidance and rules in place and upgraded us! We couldnt thank her enough! Thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2020,08,31
111,Lovely stay,"Stayed last night at the Montcalm Royal London, had originally booked in the Chiswell street Montcalm, but for some reason had a email to say we had been transferred to the shaftbury Avenue hotel, I was quite miffed as it was our anniversary and particularly wanted to stay near the Barbican. I rang reservations and explained this and they transferred us to the Royal London. We had paid for a Montcalm club room and was given a room on the 8th floor with the most amazing view and for our inconvenience we were given breakfast as well. Bed was amazingly comfy air conditioner was great and a amazing marble bathroom. I think the young lady who checked us in was called Carmela she was so helpful and sent us a chilled bottle of Prosecco to celebrate our anniversary. Only one thing was there was the tiniest bottle of shower gel I had forgotten ours and feel in a club room there should be more left because there wasn’t actually enough for one shower each.
Had breakfast this morning in aviary restaurant manager was warm and wonderful and service was very good. Thank you and we will stay again well done all of the staff in very difficult times.",5,2020,08,31
111,"Amazing staff, lovely hotel",Me and my boyfriend stayed here late July. The hotel was lovely and had strict hygiene precautions in place. The hotel was very clean and the hotel was well signposted with hygiene instructions to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The room had a lovely view and the bed was super comfy. We were given a 2 hour late check out on the house which we really appreciated. A special shoutout to Aaron Fernander and Daniel Concierye who were really helpful and ensures that we had everything that we needed. Would deffo stay here again 😊,5,2020,08,29
111,Excellent!,Right from reception to room service was excellent!  Everyone was so friendly. Rooms were very comfy for a good night sleep. The Aivary Bar was lovely for drinks. Enjoyed a lovely swim in the pool too! Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2020,08,27
111,Harry Carrington,"Absolutely amazing stay at the Montcalm Royal London Hotel. The staff were amazing, very welcoming and attending our every need! The room was lovely and clean with perfect amenities. Will definitely be staying here again soon, will also be recommending it to everyone I know!",5,2020,08,26
111,Amazing Stay,"Firstly we got such an amazing price on Expedia for  weekday booking. The room with the view was absolutely gorgeous. It was very clean and the touchscreen control panel and moon lights made it even better. Mary helped us to get a fantastic upgrade after speaking to the manager. All in all, it was perfect with not faults.",5,2020,08,26
111,Last minute break,"We stayed for a single night at this location. The hotel is clean and the room was small but clean and tidy.

We were booked onto a specific package and the extras that were stated when we booked we not in the room upon arrival. I called reception but was met with a shocked response that what we had booked wasn’t included.

However I walked down to reception and explained and the extras were brought to our room.

The pool and jacuzzi are nice, make sure you book a slot in advance, you are only allowed 30 minutes each day.

Our room gave access to the club room which is currently closed, not the hotels fault this is due to COVID-19 restrictions, however this isn’t clear on the website and was one of the reasons we booked the hotel and a particular room.

Breakfast was tasty, however the service was very slow. There seemed to be no organization between the staff, for example a few tables were asked for the order twice. To manage the flow of people wanting breakfast the hotel could introduce a system to book a slot for breakfast. 

The hotel was clean and had several precautions for Covid-19, there are a set of lifts for up and separate for down. Lots of hand gel and also your temp is scanned when you walk in and at the reception desk. The hotel also give you a little care package.

Overall this hotel is nice, not 5 star as advertised but nice and the staff were genuinely helpful and trying to do a good job. One tip speak a little louder when wearing a mask 😷",3,2020,08,24
111,Couldn’t fault a thing,This hotel topped any stays we’ve had in London before. The rooms were really nice and included lots of personal touches. I also asked for a room with a view and that’s exactly what I got. The service of the entire hotel was flawless - always friendly and extremely fast to respond! Would definitely recommend this as a place to stay. ,5,2020,08,24
111,Always Lovely,"Lovely weekend away. Beautiful clean rooms and efficient staff. When I stayed you could openly use the gym and pool as long as you wished, however there are now COVID-19 restrictions in place which means you can only use the facilities for half an hour. This is their own rule and as a hotel cannot expect guest to pay the same room charges if this is the case. Other than that, always a great stay and would highly recommend for a city break/ business trip / romantic weekend away. Ordered 2 double Hendricks & 2 double Tequila shots as room service and this cost just over £100 - not the cheapest of places but so worth it!  ",5,2020,08,22
111,Great hotel with lovely staff,"We have stayed here previously and always had a great experience as the rooms are always well appointed, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. This is our first stay since lockdown, it was very well organised with clear signage and instructions. The staff made it very simple but were very thorough with masks, temperature checks and screens. They were friendly and helpful as always and we will definitely be staying again whenever we need a hotel in the city.",5,2020,08,22
111,My partners birthday weekend ,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London on a couple of different occasions and decided to return due to going out in the surrounding area for my partners birthday. I can’t compliment enough on how clean everything is, how polite the staff are, the safety measures that had been put it place due to covid-19. I couldn’t thank Deepak (Hotel Manager) enough for resolving a minor issue we had, was dealt with very quickly and in a very professional manor, thank you again! Will definitely be returning for another stay very soon! ",5,2020,08,21
111,Exceptional!,"My husband and I booked a last minute weekend staycation at The Montcalm RLH to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary after our initial trip got cancelled due to the current pandemic. The gentleman I spoke over the phone with to make our reservation was so friendly and caring and it was obvious that he really wanted us to have the best time. He booked us into a lovely room with a view and upon entering the room we were surprised with the sweetest card and a nice bottle of wine as a celebratory gift! We immediately felt like we had made de right decision by staying at The Montcalm RLH. We had lunch at the bar on the ground floor and dinner on both nights at The Aviary and the food and cocktails were delicious! The entire staff was so friendly and attentive and the couples massage was the icing on the cake! Whether you’re travelling to London or living in London and simply want to treat yourself to a nice stay and spa time in the heart of the city, I 100% recommend The Montcalm RLH! Thank you to all the team for having us and for making us feel so special! Xxx",5,2020,08,20
111,Luxurious,Mary made me feel very welcome and catered to my needs. The hotel is very luxurious and clean. Every request was dealt with. The room was very big and comfortable. Also has access to swimming pool and spa,5,2020,08,17
111,Girlfriends birthday,"Me and my girlfriend went to stay one night at the Montcalm, and we was not disappointed by an of the experience or interaction with anyone there.

The bed was a stand out, it was nearly twice the size of my double bed at home and was extremely comfortable, the shower was perfect, high pressure and a large space. I don’t know much about brands but my girlfriend says the brand of shower wash and shampoo was expensive. 

All in all, you can tell there was a lot of care in the prep of the room. I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay here. 10/10 ",5,2020,08,16
111,Lovely one night stay,"We had a lovely stay in this hotel. The decor is nice and the rooms are well furnished. The bed was very comfortable and the room was cleaned to a high standard. The staff were helpful. The amenities in the room were great. Lovely elmis bathroom products, powerful hair dryer, a good iron with a proper ironing board, a large tv, great lighting and mirrors. The bathroom was lovely and the shower was brilliant. There is a wonderful restaurant and bar with a terrace on the roof of the hotel, with lovely views of London. Booking is advised. Great location with tube station nearby. There are spa facilities and a lovely pool. We would stay here again! ",5,2020,08,16
111,Fantastic Hotel.,"Stayed last night with my husband and couldn’t find anything I didn’t love about this hotel. Beautiful room, wonderful service and attention to detail. Truly a 5* experience, I can’t wait to come back.",5,2020,08,13
111,Beatiful experience,"We stayed at the hotel due to my birthday celebration and we were amazed by the staff members and mostly Georgi Peychinov who is the manager of the Guest Experience team. 
Loved the small touches such as the handwritten card for my birthday and the macaroons left at the coffee table. 
Housekeepers have done a great job since the room was spotless and we were amazed by the personal care of Michal - one of the managers who made sure we will get the best of this stay.",5,2020,08,13
111,Beautiful experience! ,"Just literally finishing my stay at The Montcalm and it has truly been a wonderful stay and experience. I expected it to be beautiful but it truly exceeded my expectations. Staff are so polite, helpful and friendly. Rooms are gorgeous 👌🏾! We stayed here to celebrate my husband’s birthday as a surprise (and our 8 year anniversary) and the team where so accommodating with my requests and went above and beyond to make our stay truly special and romantic. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival curtesy of the hotel, had a beautiful set up in our room which included complimentary chocolates and a lovely welcome card and personalised message from the team wishing us a beautiful stay (Thank you!-really appreciated all your efforts). The attention to detail was impeccable (if you know about Hermes! This hotel had complimentary Hermes products throughout our room! Again a nice touch lending to the style and exquisite taste of this hotel). I was really impressed by the attention to detail that this hotel offers, particularly staff (from reception to cleaning staff). Spa treatments and facilities were wonderful, again the staff were so hospitable. Romantic dinner at the hotels rooftop bar and restaurant (The Aviary) which also was a beautiful experience and staff again wonderful. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely be back again! A little hidden gem. Good location also - close to Shoreditch Box Park (which was great for us to get lunch and vibe). Really great stay! ",5,2020,08,12
111,Wonderful stay,A perfect place for couples relaxation I must say. Mary was so helpful when we informed about her our last min anniversary plan. We got a Junior suite upgrade and it was fantastic. We have booked our stay for October already and cant wait for our parents to be with us this time and discover this great hotel and staff as well.,5,2020,08,11
111,Pleasant Stay,We recently stayed for a special birthday. We had booked a Montcalm Club Room. I wasn’t blown away by it if I am honest. The staff were amazing but having booked a Montcalm Club Room I expected our room to be a bit more wow then a standard and to be honest it wasn’t. There was no problems with the stay but I wasn’t blown away by it and not sure if I would necessarily choose this hotel over others I have usually stayed in in London.,3,2020,08,11
111,Comfortable stay,"The room was perfect, comfortable bed and nice large bathroom. The bar was very nice and had a great selection of drinks. Very enjoyable stay and would definitely stay again. Location was perfect just a few stops away from the main train stations.",5,2020,08,10
111,Amazing Stay & Birthday Celebration,"My wife and I had the most amazing stay at The Montcalm last week. It was her birthday and we wanted to have a proper celebration after a distressing week & The Montcalm provided this for us. They not only upgraded our booking but laid on a fantastic birthday welcome when we entered our suite - bottle of cold champagne, a cake and the manager, Deepak (who I must give a special mention to as he was amazing) arranged a special private session in the swimming pool for us. He also booked us The Aviary that evening so we could have a birthday meal with some family and friends. He got us the terrace which I would highly recommend as the views (and service) are fantastic. 
We had the perfect stay at The Montcalm - the staff were all wonderful - and they made my wife's birthday wonderful.",5,2020,08,10
111,Amazing stay,"After looking over tripadvisor for some recommendations, we found this gem which was close to commuting places. Our stay was fabulous and we were upgraded to a Suite room upon request. My girlfriend was pleased with the massive space in the room and Hermes toiletries too. Credit to Mary for being an absolute bubble since the check in. Thank you so much and definitely recommend the Montcalm.",5,2020,08,09
111,Excellent Staff and Stay aswell,The hotel was recommended by a fellow colleague and it was amazing. Got a great upgrade with a view and above all the whole stay with my partner was perfect. Enjoyed the pool though we had to book prior and staff named Mary was excellent when we checked in. Sadly we couldnt get to the Aviary but we definitely will visit again and try out all the areas.,5,2020,08,08
111,Really enjoying our stay,"Two nights away as a special occasion. Everything from reception to room to roof top bar is excellent. Lucky with the weather we can spend it looking out over London. 
Not cheap but worth the cost, we shall return.",5,2020,08,08
111,Excellent ,We visited last weekend for a friends birthday. We had some drinks on the incredible roof terrace and decided to stay the night last minute. Mary was fantastic and helped us organise a junior suite with breakfast which was amazing and topped off a brilliant weekend. Thanks again!,5,2020,08,07
111,"Brilliant facilities, overall cleanliness lacking","Me and a friend booked a one night stay on a Sunday to Monday. On arrival/checkin our room was upgraded, (which was lovely) And we had our temperature checked before being allowed into the rooms. 
The room it’s self was lovely! Massive bed and lovely bathroom. Although, overall cleanliness was not acceptable for a 5 star. The glasses/cups that were provided were still dirty (you could see where someone had previously drank from), the sides were all dusty, and extra towels that we had brought up to the room, one of them was dirty with black/brown marks on them!! Very disappointing.

When checking in the receptionist asked if we were going to use the spa facilities, which we said yes to, and she explained that some things were not available due to COVID which wasn’t a problem at all. 
However, she failed to mention that changing facilities were not available, and then when we arrived for a booked slot at the spa, the lady at the spa reception was rather rude to us because we did not have/were wearing the gowns and towels that apparently were provided in the rooms. We did not have gowns in our rooms, so we had to go back to the room and ring reception to ask for them to be sent up to the room. We tried ringing about 3 times with no answer, so had to go down to reception and then queue to ask. 
Then went back up to the room and waited for them to be delivered. 
Once at the spa we used to pool but were joined by couples who were overly affectionate for the public eye, this made both of us feel rather uncomfortable and were happy when they left. But other than that, the pool was lovely.

General cleanliness is expected not only for a 5 star but especially because COVID. Overall we had a lovely stay, but the cleaning and attention to detail needs to be worked on.",4,2020,08,05
111,Truly Amazing,"Where do I start? I booked this hotel with the hotel Manager Deepak Panicker who I must say was fantastic.He is a real asset to the company!The level of service from Deepak and his staff is extraordinary.  From my very first email to Deepak he made sure my stay was exactly how I wanted it to be as i was proposing to my partner. When I checked in the staff were very helpful and explained every procedure the hotel is following due to the covid-19 pandemic. The hotel was very clean and followed government guidelines to a Tee. This gave me peace of mind as my partner is also pregnant and made us feel very safe in the hotel. As this was a special occasion Deepak ensured everything went to plan from getting the best room in the hotel, complimentary breakfast, early check in, late checkout, free spa access and last but not least he even got the hotel staff to decorate my room with flowers and champagne for when me and my partner returned back to the room. I do not have one bad thing to say about this hotel and its staff.l I would highly recommend people to stay here as the location is perfect, hotel amenities are spot on and the level of service you would receive is excellent. lastly i would like to say a big thank you to all the staff at Montcalm and especially a big thank you to Deepak Panicker who made this magical weekend happen.",5,2020,08,04
111,Amazing!!!,"This is one of my favourite places in London! The staff are just amazing especially Indre and Jolanta! Both were so accommodating and made our stay simply perfect!!

Hotel is very clean and services all are just what you expect!!

5* is less for this review and high you recommend staying here!",5,2020,08,04
111,Great stay,Had such a great stay recently! Special thanks to Mary for such amazing customer service. We didn’t realise breakfast wasn’t included and Mary really helped us out which we appreciate. Will definitely be coming back again 😊,5,2020,08,04
111,Great Stay,"Had an amazing stay with my partner. Came to celebrate our anniversary. Staff very helpful, special mention to Mary who looked after us well. Lovely rooms. Definitely will be back. Recommended for any couples",5,2020,08,03
111,Excellent weekend away,"We booked the Quad room for our family weekend away. Having 2 inter-leading rooms worked well as we were travelling with a teenager. Both rooms were spacious and had all the luxuries, including air conditioning and underfloor heating. I liked that one room had a spacious shower and the other had a large bath, giving us the best  of both during our stay.
As this was our first trip post lockdown we felt the hotel set was well managed keeping guests safe.

The service was consistently good throughout the hotel, special thanks to the duty manager, Camelia who oversaw all our requests.

We look forward to visiting again!",5,2020,07,31
111,Frustrating and underwhelming,"I’m genuinely bemused how this property is ranked 7th best hotel in London on TripAdvisor. I stayed for one night in a Deluxe Double room. This is their entry level room and Standard would be a more accurate description than Deluxe. There’s nothing much wrong with the room, but it feels like a slightly upmarket Premier Inn rather than a 5* hotel. Despite the room being big enough for a seating area just one armchair is provided which feels anything but deluxe. The touchscreen control for the air conditioning, lights etc looks fancy, but isn’t very responsive. Overall, the room is simply underwhelming.

A true five star hotel would pride itself on service. The Royal London House simply doesn’t have sufficient staff to provide adequate service, never mind five star service. It took 40 minutes to have a bathrobe delivered so I could use the swimming pool. This was acknowledged at check out and the staff member apologised, which was a nice touch.

I was told on check in that I would find no kettle, iron or hairdryer in the room, they’d been removed to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission, but they could be ordered from reception. I ordered all three items, only to find that I had an iron and hairdryer in the room. Had these not been cleansed then?

The hotel operates a one-way system for the lifts with those at the front to ascend, the ones at the back to descend. This makes good sense, but the signs simply say “this lift only goes up” or “this lift only goes down” and don’t signpost you to where the lift is to travel in the opposite direction. Each time I used the stairs there were people waiting at lifts wanting to go down, but were stood at up only lifts, and didn’t know where to find the down lifts. 

While the website and in-room letter states the swimming pool and gym are closed, they are both in fact open. The spa takes bookings for the swimming pool, limiting occupancy to no more than four households at a time. The pool is tiny, literally five strokes end to end, but fortunately I was the only one swimming. Any more than three people in the pool would be too many. Also, the emergency lighting was flickering at full brightness which wasn’t very conducive to a relaxing swim.

Breakfast in the morning was served in what appears to previously have been the Club Lounge. There were just nine tables available and everything was a la carte (but without menus) so it seemed to be full English breakfast or nothing. Only one member of staff was working the space doing everything; greeting guests, taking orders, bringing food and clearing tables. As a result, service was none too swift. Breakfast was sadly underwhelming too. The English breakfast was lukewarm and served with half a slice of white toast and half a slice of brown. No butter, jam or marmalade was provided. Tea and coffee was served in paper takeaway cups for no apparent reason. Fortunately my breakfast was included in the room rate at no additional cost. I wouldn’t have liked to have paid extra for it.

I paid less than £120 bed and breakfast for the night. Maybe I should have adjusted my expectations based on this low rate. That said, there were other good 4* hotels in the City with rates below £100 on the same night, so their rate wasn’t super competitive. 

If you do choose to stay here I would recommend signing up to their loyalty club. By doing so my rate went from £125 room only to £116.45 bed and breakfast.

I do acknowledge that the COVID-19 situation makes things challenging for the hospitality industry, but now more than ever hotels need to up their game to encourage people to stay with them. As a result of my experience I can’t see myself staying here again, nor in all honesty, any of the other Montcalm hotels.",2,2020,07,29
111,Great anniversary stay! Thank you,"Staff very friendly, good to see corona measures in place which didn’t impact on our experience. Special touch was added to our room for our anniversary too which was lovely!! We would recommend the Aviary Rooftop too. 
Overall we wouldn’t hesitate in staying here again. 
Thank you",5,2020,07,27
111,OK. Not 5 star,"Booked 2 rooms to celebrate daughter's 21st birthday which was mentioned at booking direct with hotel. Booked 2 club rooms but unfortunately club currently suspended. No effort made to mark the occasion by hotel and rooms were, as a previous reviewer comments, underwhelming. The more expensive of the 2 rooms was battered and z overworked breakfast staff who seemed to spend most of their time dealing with demanding and grumpy guests, they tried very hard in challenging conditions and are a credit to the hotel.
Sad that a special occasion was marred by a disappointing stay.",3,2020,07,26
111,"Safe, great service and beautiful design","Elegant and luxurious decor and amenities. Very attentive, prompt and friendly service.

You are really getting your money’s worth. My partner and I stayed at the Montcalm for our anniversary and we couldn’t have been happier.

In uncertain times (covid-19) the staff at Montcalm made sure that everything was safe and gave a great service overall. Currently the hotel is quite quiet but that made it even cosier for us, and we got their full attention whenever we needed anything.

The only downside for us was that, at the moment, the breakfast buffet is not available (this might change soon). However, there wasn’t any warning when we booked, so we payed for the full price of the buffet and then were offered a cheaper breakfast menu instead (still delicious and top quality). 

I have to say that the hostess of the breakfast lounge was very helpful and she also offered us some pastries and fresh fruit for no extra charge because of this. So if you are thinking of having breakfast there, I would suggest you get in contact with them first and ask them if the buffet is available, as the breakfast menu can be payed right there.

Get booking, you won’t regret it!",5,2020,07,22
111,London Break,"Found an excellent deal for a 2 night stay at this hotel.  The hotel had safety measures in place and all the staff were so  helpful, ensuring I  had everything I needed to make my stay enjoyable - from the kettle in my room to myvraxi to the station. Enjoyed the Aviary rooftop for a drink late evening.  ",5,2020,07,21
111,Weekend away,Great family weekend very helpful staff tended to our every need my wife really enjoyed the views from the 09th floor room. Thanks KEN for arranging such a great room will defo be back next month. Thanks Zeeshan,5,2020,07,21
111,Great customer service,"I just wanted to thank the staff of the hotel, who gave great customer service and I'd like to refer a specific sfaff member called Mary who tended to our needs wonderfully! We had a great honeymoon expercience despite the COVID-19 circimatance.",5,2020,07,19
111,Perfect !,"Perfect stay! Went for our one year anniversary and a get away after lockdown ! Mary at reception was so lovely and very cheerful and happy to help! 

Rooms are lovely and clean, bed was comfy was high too! Location is fab too lots of places to eat and drink and near travel too",5,2020,07,19
111,Back to our favourite hotel,"We returned back to our favourite hotel in London on the 4th of July the day of reopening, and were presently surprised by the way the hotel was dealing with the new safety procedures due to Covid.  George made our stay extra special and is a very lovely asset to the hotel.  We are returning very soon for our 10 year  Wedding anniversary ;))",5,2020,07,17
111,Wonderful weekend,"Hotel was booked for my friends 45th birthday, upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite with complimentary breakfast and a bottle of Prosecco was sent up to the room . 

Room was fabulous with a huge and extremely comfy bed. The bedding was Luxurious and all feather filled. 

Beautiful large bathroom with Hermes toiletries, the shower was huge and had a rainfall shower. 

The Aviary roof top bar was the icing on the cake with fantastic views of the London skyline. Booking is a must as you cannot just walk in. 

Extra precautionary measures are being taken due to COVID 19 which was reassuring to see. Temp checked on arrival and sanitizers at entry. 
They also provided masks and mini hand sanitizers too which was a lovely touch. 

Breakfast was served to your table which was fine and the continental option was delicious. 

We had a lovely stay and would definitely return at a later date. .",5,2020,07,14
111,Amazing service & Beautiful hotel.,Julian greeted us at the front desk and was absolutely delightful! He was polite and friendly as he asked about our evening and what we had been up to! Couldn’t have asked for a better welcome! He then informed us that he was upgrading our room to a suite after finding out this was our first adventure out since lockdown. Highly recommend. A stunning hotel with a wonderful front of house team!,5,2020,07,13
111,A wonderful stay.,"Absolutely wonderful hotel. A beautiful rooftop bar with very kind and helpful staff. Was made to feel comfortable from the get go with the staff members at the door being very understanding and helpful especially through the current pandemic. 

Deepak checked me and partner in and in all honesty one of the easiest and simple check in and out processes I have experienced and I have stayed in a fair amount of hotels. He is a very exceptional member of staff and would recommend anyone who stays there to introduce themselves to him if they have any problems. 

Great stay and would 100% recommend.",5,2020,07,12
111,Resolved Issues,"Due to COVID-19 my hotel stay was canceled. While I originally had infinite trouble getting ahold of management to get my refund pushed through once I did get a hold of management, everything was worked out. While one employee did hang up on me, management ended up making it right. Once it’s safe to travel again I look forward to seeing what this hotel is all about.",4,2020,07,12
111,I just love this place. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!,"I thought I’ll copy and paste my the letter I sent to the Manager Alex after our last stay. It was nothing short of beautiful and top class service. They were so patient and kind to my children even with their tantrums. I just wouldn’t stay anywhere else. Here’s my letter to them for details of my stay.

Dear Alex,

I wanted to write to say a heartfelt thank you to you and your staff for making our stay at Montcalm magical. My children had a fantastic time! I think it’s fair to say that your hotel will now be our second home once we are in London. I was so taken away by the professionalism and service that I thought I’d write a list of things that makes Montcalm RLH the number one spot for us. After visiting another hotel in London due to Montcalm being fully booked, it made me realise how much your team deserves to be recognised. 
Here’s my list:
* very clean rooms and elegantly decorated 
* A+++ customer service 
* Breakfast was prepared with perfection and the restaurant was very clean. In addition, I like that the team was diverse.
* I love the notes the cleaner left in our room. It took all my worries away
* The pool was clean and warm. The refreshing drinks were a plus.
* Concierge was top class especially at the hotel entrance. Daniel was awesome booking restaurant and helping us made the best of our stay. I wanted to tip him but he wasn’t on shift when we were leaving.
* The VIP lounge manger and concierge were perfect when we missed breakfast. My children were so pleased. We spoke to a young lady there who I believe was from Poland who had a great conversation with my son. 
Finally, Alex you are an exceptional manager. Thank you for making our stay beautiful. See you soon.",5,2020,07,04
111,The perfect stay,"My partner and I stayed at the Montcalm to celebrate our anniversary and it was an unforgettable experience. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived and couldn’t recommend it enough. 

Valentina was especially welcoming and hospitable, arranging a complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion!! Good facilities and excellent location, only a short trip to Liverpool Street. The rooftop restaurant and bar was also great, convenient to have quite literally on your doorstep. 

Hope to come back soon!",5,2020,06,07
111,graeme,"This was the first time at this hotel as usually we stay at The MMontclam in Shoreditch. I was in London for a show at The Barbican and this Montcalm was slightly nearer,  it was just before the Covid restrictions.On arrival we were greeted by Tina who was fantastically friendly offered us fresh lemonade and hand cleansing equipment as the hotel we aware of the pandemic.All the staff were very helpful and the room was its usual quality which we are used to by now as we have used Montcalm many times. As we left Tina was on hand again to make sure our stay was a pleasant as possible. We will be returning as soon as possible.",5,2020,05,01
111,Amazing stay - Engagement Celebration,"We stayed one evening and one night in this wonderful Hotel to celebrate our engagement in February 2020. My boyfriend was helped and supported from the beginning to the end especially by Mrs Stevens ans all the hotel staff to organize the most incredible and unexpected surprise ever, and make sure everything goes perfectly (even we couldn't enjoy the rooftop due to a massive storm at that time). We definitely had a memorable experience and it will remain one of the happiest moment of my life. From the brightly decorated room, to the food/cocktails, to the Spa, everything was simply fabulous. I highly recommend the Montcalm and I hope we could visit soon again!",5,2020,04,07
111,Lovely visit,"This was my first time staying with M By Montcalm and it was lovely. Peter greeted me upon entry and took my bag right away. Fenna checked me in with a smile which was great. Peter took my bag all the way to my room and made sure I knew how everything worked. The room was very clean, very spacious and had a lovely view. The bed was huge, so was the tv Haha and the mini bar has a great selection for you to take from at an additional cost. You are provided with fresh fruit and water in your room and your bathroom essentials. Mary checked me out and again with a smile making sure everything was to my liking. Peter again took my bag right to the door and gave a warm goodbye. All other staff I met were wonderful and friendly and I will definitely be back. I also look forward to being able to use the spa when it is open again. Thank you all!",5,2020,03,22
111,Outstanding Hospitality,"We stayed to celebrate my special birthday in February and from the moment our cab drew up outside to the moment we left the building after checking out, the hotel staff in every department made us feel special, welcome and treasured as guests. Each of them could not have been more helpful and represented the very highest standards of customer care. The hotel is in an excellent location to easily get to most places in London, rooms are pleasant and spacious with everything you need, beds very comfortable and bathrooms pristine. 

We did not eat dinner in the hotel but having enjoyed the high quality, delicious breakfast would not hesitate to dine there. The rooftop bar is highly recommended and offers the same excellent service which permeates throughout this lovely hotel. I definitely got star treatment for my big birthday and would not hesitate to return.",5,2020,03,20

111,The hospitality & My stay.,"Upon arrival, from the entrance door to the check in desk the service was exquisite, friendly helpful staff. We were lucky to encounter such a welcoming  checkin lady called Mary who had the most wonderful welcoming smile, being that she was very humorous and always kept a smile on our faces, she was clear on what the hotel has to offer and made us feel extremely welcome to the hotel, I am a returning customer to the Montcalm Hotel and will be for the foreseeable future the rooms are beautiful, clean and modern. The facilities of the hotel has all that you need. Highly recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

111,Birthday Celebration,"Montcalm Royal London House is absolutely amazing! 
The staff are extremely considerate and accommodating. I booked one night stay at this hotel to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I initially booked a club room and was upgraded to a family suite! I was in contact with Francesca, who was extremely friendly and amazing. I ordered a birthday cake to the bedroom and got it complementary! 
The restaurant above , Aviary was also spectacular. 
Room service is also 24 hours. 
The bedroom was covered in rose petals and was spacious and clean. Even when we were leaving, the staff provided us with a box to pack the cake and carry home. 
It was an amazing one night stay and I will definitely be back! 
Francesca and Andrea were great help and very welcoming x 
10/10 !!",5,2020,03,10
111,Absolutely Amazing Hotel!,"I have visited this hotel twice with my boyfriend, once in June for his birthday and again in February for our anniversary. We will most certainly be visiting again!

The hotel itself is amazing, with a rooftop bar – called The Avairy - that was great for outdoor drinks in June and they had little igloos on there on our most recent visit so you can still enjoy drinks on there in this cold weather. The breakfast is also served in The Avairy in the indoor section where you can order from a menu or alternatively we had the buffet which has loads of choice – eggs, salmon, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, beans, cereals, fruit, muffins the list goes on! There is another bar located on the ground floor which also serves food I believe although we didn’t eat here. You can also play shuffleboard at this bar for a bit of extra fun!

The spa is lovely and open until 10pm which is great, we used the pool and Jacuzzi which was nice and a wonderful way to relax.

The rooms have beds that are to die for, huge and soft and comfortable. They also had mood lighting which you can set to all different colours or turn off if you wish. The showers are great with 2 different shower heads so you can either have a rainfall type shower or hold the head which you can manoeuvre yourself as well as set the temperature to however you like it. You can also get 24 hour room service which includes steak, burgers, salads etc. Another great feature is the touch screen on the wall where you can set the air con and even underfloor heating!

What truly made both our visits though were the wonderful staff at this hotel. Both times before our visits I emailed the Guest Experience team to advise that we were coming for a special occasion and they truly went above and beyond to make it absolutely amazing. When we came in June, I had spoken with Flavia from the Guest Experience team and we were greeted by her personally with a glass of bubbly each on arrival and then escorted to our room (with our bags even carried for us!) of which we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a Business Suite. The room was enormous to the point it had a sofa in it! The team had gone to great efforts, decorating the bed with rose petals and balloons for my boyfriend’s birthday, as well as giving us these amazing little macaroons and fresh fruit on the table. Again when we came for our anniversary, I spoke with Francesca beforehand who came to greet us, took us to our upgraded room and had decorated the bed with rose petals as well as giving us macaroons, fruit and a bottle of red wine for our occasion. All the staff are an absolute credit to this wonderful hotel as we were never once greeted without a smile, completely approachable and friendly – nothing was too much! Even when we left they called a taxi for us and put our bags in the cab. We honestly cannot express how much they all truly made our stay!

I strongly recommend staying here to anyone, as I did to my brother who has booked to bring his girlfriend here for her birthday. I informed the guest experience team and within hours received a response from January who told me they too would be getting an upgraded room as well as the special touches in there!

I have stayed at other hotels in London but The Montcalm Royal London House is by far and away the best, thanks again to all the staff – you are truly amazing!",5,2020,03,10
111,Its the staff that make it! ,After visiting here I realised that what sets apart five star hotel is the quality of its staff. Whilst the room and hotel itself were gorgeous- the staff couldn’t have been more helpful and really made us feel welcome and special. They were keen to do anything they could to help and nothing was too much of an inconvenience. The room was stylish clean and had some lovely slippers and toiletries. Absolutely faultless! ,5,2020,03,09
111,The best hotel and staff in London,"We stayed here on our first Wedding Anniversary and the experience was so good that we vowed to stay here every year for our Anniversary. This was our 4th stay for our Anniversary and once again we could not rate this highly enough. Francesca from the Customer experience team took us to our room where some balloons, a bottle of wine, some lovely sweet treats and ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate on the plate were waiting. Beautiful. Francesca was warm, friendly, courteous and incredibly helpful; offering to transport us to use the neighbouring Montcalm hotel facilities as the pool and spa was closed for maintenance in this one. The room was absolutely perfect as usual with every facility and comfort you can want with an amazingly comfortable bed. 
After a lovely stay, checkout was seamless and they were more than happy to retain our baggage while we made most of our stay in London for the remainder of the day. Tina was part of the customer welcome and support team and looked after us like we couldn’t imagine. She was kind, friendly, helpful and such a superb asset to the Montcalm team. We wish to tank both Francesca and Tina for the amazing service they provided and equally, the whole team at Montcalm Royal London House. 
This remains our favourite Hotel in London, not just because it is a beautiful place to stay, but first and foremost because the level of service is outstanding! If I could rate it 6 stars out of 5, I would. Amazing.",5,2020,03,09
111,Staff assistance couldn't have been better,"Spent a night in an upgraded room with incredible amenities for the price/benefit ratio. The staff was kind and professional during our whole stay. As the pool was under maintenance, the hotel paid for our transport in order to use the facilities of one of their sister properties.",5,2020,03,09
111,FANTASTIC STAY,"What a delightful hotel to stay in London. ALL the staff have been so attentive, helpful & efficient. We are in the Aviary which was truly excellent with great service & great food.Our room was so comfortable & had a great nights sleep. The coffee machine was an added bonus. The bathroom had great access & all the necessary toiletries. We will definitely return so a big “thank you” to all the staff who made our short stay so good",5,2020,03,09
111,More than a bit awesome ,"We stayed at overnight and enjoyed everything about the hotel. Staff were excellent,facilities were fantastic, the room was magnificent. Try and get up to the Aviary in the evening and soak up the ambiance over a drink or two,or enjoy a less formal drink in the lobby bar(we did both).
We'll definitely stay here again when we visit London. 
Many thanks Montcalm.
Michelle and John. ",5,2020,03,09
111,"Beautiful stay, highly recommended ","Amazing hotel and such lovely staff, would highly recommend, the views are really good from the rooftop, breakfast was really nice and such a good vibe and the cocktails were lush, we will be back soon ",5,2020,03,08
111,Amazing helpful staff ,"Spent a great weekend, two nights in an upgraded room with all the perks and couldn’t  have had a better time. 
We enjoyed the free breakfast and coffee machine in the room. 

The staff were excellent and extremely helpful and nothing was too much. 

Recommend without a doubt. 

",5,2020,03,07
111,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed 2 nights for business.  Room was very nice - large but I was upgraded at check in.  Spotless.  Staff are lovely very accomodating.  Short walk from Moorgate underground with lots of restaurants and shops nearby,",5,2020,03,07
111,Great experience and service,"We booked the hotel to stay the night for birthday celebrations. From start to finish the experience was lovely. We were greeted with warmth, Prosecco and vegan cookies. We were then lucky enough to get our room upgraded and Francesca’s team was amazing sending a birthday card and treats on the house. The room filled with luxury and was tidied up when we went for dinner. It has speakers too! When leaving checking out was smooth and the team wanted to ensure we had a good time. All the porters, receptionists (the whole team were lovely). We highly recommend booking them to make your stay in London one to remember.",5,2020,03,07
111,"It was a good stay, but there are lot of details that should not be overlooked in a 5-star property.","If this was a 4-star property, I would certainly give it a 10 rating, but for the 5-star a lot of attention to detail is missing. So, while I was generally satisfied with our stay, it could be so much better with some amendments. The bed was very comfortable (the pillows on the other hand not so much) and room service food was tasty. Wifi speeds were also the best I ever had in a hotel. There were however  lot of small annoyances and issues that should not happen at a 5-star hotel. The tablet in the room that controls pretty much everything from AC to bathroom lights did not work from start, but the hotel staff rectified that promptly. Still, it is a pretty unresponsive and unappealing solution that also randomly resets while playing quite loud startup music (even early in the mornings). The room maintenance is also somewhat subpar (gum residue on window shelf, broken window handle, etc.), which also resulted in a lot of noise from the street. Pool/SPA was way overcrowded. There was also an issue with club/lounge access, as it seems our rooms weren't properly marked in the system and it took two days to finally fix that (which is funny as club is right across the reception and I'm sure that hostess could check and resolve that within minutes). Staff friendliness  and concern seems very forced and not genuine. There was one exception to that, Mr. who brought our bags in the room and explained everything, unfortunately I forgot his name, but he was the true 5-star hotelier.",4,2020,03,05
111,Amazing,"My first experience at a Montcalm and it was absolutely amazing. Booked a stay for my birthday, unfortunately the swimming pool and jacuzzi were down for maintenance. However, I was very well looked after. All the staff were incredible but I would like to say a special thank you to Camelia and Ariana who really made this special for me. I will definitely be returning.",5,2020,03,05
111,Fantastic Stay,"Had booked a weekend at this hotel for 6 of us and am so happy this was our choice.
The staff were fantastic cannot do enough for you from arrival the lovely doorman to the slick reception staff who made checking in a simple process .
It was my husbands 60th birthday and I had asked for a Champagne in our room and on arrival we not only had champagne but rose petals, chocolates and macaroons  needless to say my other half felt very special.
Special mention to Mary & January who made sure that the 6 of us had everything we needed and more,  we will definitely be back .
Thank you to all the Staff for our truly wonderful stay
Sandra Rosie",5,2020,03,05
111,Best service in London,"From the moment we got dropped off in the taxi outside the hotel to the moment we left, the staff were just amazing. Excellent service nothing was too much trouble, thanks to January, Alina & Francisca.
Hope you all loved the cupcakes we left for you :)
Spa facilities were lovely and clean.
In the Avery restaurant, they had plant based options.
The sky garden was beautiful.
Can’t wait to come back again soon.",5,2020,03,03
111,Excellent,"Excellent stay. Very welcoming and friendly staff. The room was excellent, very clean with everything you need. I received a call just after check-in to ask if everything was ok. special thanks to all the staff.",5,2020,03,03
111,Very great experience,"I spent two days there and I was amazed. The room was sparkling clean and the toilet wonderful. I really appeciate the tech side in the room. The bar that they put inside the room with the price list is very friendly and interesting. There's a gym, a spa, a sauna and pool with lockers. The restaurant is welcoming with games for groups. Royal Montcalm really think about customer needs and it's as if they try constantly to avoid you unnecessary effort. The staff was very courteous. I really enjoy my stay there.",4,2020,03,03
111,Fantastic stay,"This was our first stay at this hotel and we were visiting London for partly business and partly pleasure.
Alina and Mary were both of excellent being very welcoming and attentive. The room was great, my wife loved the heated floor and the club lounge was one of the best we have used.
We are definitely coming back again. As one of my offices is near Bank I do need a hotel nearby and when bringing my wife this will be the first in my list. 
We didn’t even get a chance to try the spa!!",5,2020,03,02
111,Staff are amazing!,"Stayed a night here for my birthday and cannot fault this hotel or its staff at all! From the moment we entered we received 5* service. I am 8 months pregnant and requested a bath in my room, January the guest experience manager went above and beyond; giving us an upgrade to a junior suite to make our stay even more comfortable. The front of house staff, especially Arianna and Mary were lovely! Very smiley, warm and attentive to our needs. Like i said, i cannot fault this hotel or its staff who made our stay amazing.",5,2020,03,02
111,Such a great service !,"Kudos to Daniel and concierge team, Alina and Mary at the reception desk, you make a sunny day out of a cloudy one ! 
Service is at the highest level at the Montcalm Royal and makes it my reference hotel !",5,2020,03,02

111,Amazing!,"Never want to stay anywhere where in London. Beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms, beautiful room and cocktails, amazing facilities with coffee machine and sky TV in rooms. Came to London as a tourist but wanted to spend all my time in my hotel room!",5,2020,03,01
111,Amazing anniversary stay,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times and each time has been amazing! We last stayed in September for our anniversary, and upon check in was greeted by the lovely January who had already upgraded our room and had it decorated for our stay! The room was beautiful and had a great view which we had asked for. We will definitely be staying here again, it is by far the best hotel we have stayed in up London, especially for the faultless service you receive! ",5,2020,03,01
111,One amazing hotel,"We went for one night, as a weekend away. Cannot fault anything from service right through to facilities. Staff are very attentive and understanding as well (therefore you wouldn’t feel overwhelmed if you don’t like that level of interaction). Rooms are very modern, clean with lots of complimentary products and High quality facilities. Even though I spent one night there, my room was serviced with clean towels and tidied up for extra luxury touch. Underfloor heating in the bathroom was excellent considering I was freezing after a night out. Breakfast was good, with decent selection of cooked and continental choices, including a la carte menu. Amazing roof top bar and choice of places to Have a drink. I will definetely look to come back again this summer as this place is stunning. Andrea, a lovely lady also made my experience great ensuring that my stay is seamless. Thank you!",5,2020,03,01
111,Amazing as always,"My boyfriend and I stay here every year for our anniversary, this year was our 3rd visit and as always it was amazing. We stay for one night, the rooms we have had are gorgeous, and the last two years we have been upgraded! All the rooms are so spacious and have everything you could need, including the cool mood lighting! The staff are always so friendly, helpful, and happy. This visit we had Frances check us in and Mary at checkout who were both brilliant. The rooftop bar is gorgeous, we always pay a visit. We’ll be back again soon, hopefully won’t leave it another year!",5,2020,02,29
111,Lovely friendly accessible hotel,"I booked this hotel for a nights stay as we were going to an event at flight club around the corner for my husband's birthday. I needed an accessible room as I am a wheelchair user. Often we arrive at hotels and their idea of accessible is usually a token grab rail placed I the bathroom - not this time. Our room was wonderful. It was truly accessible, my chair fitted both sides of the bed, the whole way around the room and into the bathroom without issue. The bathroom was elegant and had all the equipment I needed - shower chair, rails,  lower mirror. There were pull cords in the event that I might need them. The lights were all accessed by conrol panels either side of the bed and we were able to add do not disturb signs to our door via a panel in the room that also controlled the climate  underfloor heating in the bathroom etc. Everything we needed and more. Staff even gave my husband a bottle of wine and some macarons for his birthday which was a nice touch.
We used the Spa downstairs which was lovely. Clean and fresh.
Again the disabled/accessible toilets throughout the building were actually accessible,  not just big doors with a rail. My large powerchair fitted without issue.
We had a clubhouse member room which allowed us access to the 'clubhouse' for canapes and drinks in the afternoon/evening. So much choice, we were blown away. So worth the extra. The drinks selections was fantastic. Food was all fresh. 
We had a meal in the Burdock in the evening which to be honest let it down the food wasn't great but still quite pricey for a bar.
We had breakfast at the Aviary in the morning which was superb. 
There's parking directly opposite the hotel, although the underground ncp is not wheelchair accessible, they allowed us to park upstairs. 
Our overall stay was fantastic. I would love to stay again one day.",5,2020,02,29
111,Amazing stay,Stayed a couple weeks ago for one night with my partnerand must say it was a lovely stay. One of the best hotels i've stayed at and one staff in particular looked after us and made our day so would like to thank Mary for all her help and being so funny and bubbly. Definitely will be visiting again.,5,2020,02,27
111,"Best stay, friendly staff, amazing amenities!","This was my second stay at the Montcalm. I couldn’t help but stay again since it’s location is very close to shoreditch. The steam room is great! Check in was speedy and also very friendly. I checked in with Alina, and after a few minutes of being in my room she called to make sure I was happy. Most hotels don’t take the time to make sure whether you’re happy or not, so I really appreciate that. Everyone’s always willing to help, and they make you feel always welcomed. I’ll definitely be staying here again! ",5,2020,02,27
111,Attention to detail,"Another great stay at the Royal London thanks to the wonderful Brigita for sorting my room and my lovely card in my room on arrival and the fab Mary for the warm check in.

Fantastic service all round ladies",5,2020,02,25
111,Fantastic  stay and at a great price ,"What a fantastic find!
Welcoming staff greeted with a glass of Prosecco.
Speedy check in and a very modern trendy feel to the hotel. 
Room was upgraded free of charge and was spacious clean and all the amenities you would expect from a five star hotel. 
Bar area and staff very accommodating and make a naughty spicy Bloody Mary 
Highly recommended.

Will be back soon. ",5,2020,02,25
111,Great family break,"We enjoyed our stay in a family suite.  We had macarons, fruits and crisps waiting for us in our room. 
We went to the swimming pool with the children as they re allowed at specific hours. We had a very good time. 
We ordered some food with the room service.  It was delicious. 
Many thanks to Mary.
We ll go back for sure.",5,2020,02,24
111,Much needed luxury break,"My wife and I have just spent the weekend at the beautiful Montcalm RLH. All the staff made us feel most welcome from the first moment we stepped in to the hotel. Due to not being able to have a massage as part of our original booking the guest experience team provided us with a room upgrade to a suite instead. We were then even more surprised when taking to our room to be provided with a lovely bottle of wine. This was a lovely touch and enhanced our experience further. Both my wife and I enjoyed every second the RLH and can't wait to return again soon. The RLH is stunning, clean and provides a luxurious stay in the city. A big thanks to January for making our stay perfect.",5,2020,02,24
111,Weekender ,"Great staff , really friendly, the Large suite added to a lovely high class weekend , Business class is always worth a good go if you can Stretch just that little bit more, we will come again I’m sure ",5,2020,02,24
111,Magnificent team running this hotel,"So my family can be a bit picky,  but we all came away loving this place and how the staff made the whole experience so great.   

My 10 year old daughter loved a birthday cake and balloons waiting for her on arrival, my son loved the Sky films and we all loved the pool and jacuzzi. A very special place.  What would we change? We'd have stayed in on our night there rather than going out for dinner!  

Also, my overtired 10 year old broke a glass at midnight and this was dealt with effortlessly within minutes by housekeeping.  These people really care about giving guests the best experience possible. I can be a bit cynical, but I couldn't recommend this place enough!",5,2020,02,23
111,Lovely Birthday trip surprise,"We were treated like royalty here! It was a lovely birthday surprise for me from my brothers and mum.
Greeted with fizz and cooked in reception, bowls of fresh fruit and jugs of chilled water everywhere.
Escorted to room, which was clean and comfy and equipped with posh coffee machine.
Spa and pool not massive but well kept and chilled. If management reads this I’d like to pass on thanks to the masseuse - didn’t catch his name but it was for Katherine at 10am 23rd Feb - who gave me one of the best massages ever, perfect pressure and attention. Was too chilled to say thanks at the time!
The breakfast was delicious, great selection. And the rooftop with its glass pods are a fantastic experience alone.
Overall very well kept modern hotel with fantastically attentive staff 😊 even said goodbye with a takeaway coffee!",5,2020,02,23
111,great welcome and stay,"just stayed for one night for the first time including a work reunion on the rooftop which was all excellent. we had a club room which included lounge access which gave us free coffee & tea in the afternoon, then free drinks (wine, beer and sprites/mixers) and canapé from 5.30pm, and also an excellent continental breakfast in the morning.  so all in all a very relaxing and value for money stay.",4,2020,02,23
111,Karen Woodley,"I booked at Montcalm Royal London as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. We had the most AMAZING stay. An upgraded room, amazing service and a little birthday gift. Will be recommending and will be back!",5,2020,02,23
111,Dr Intazar Bashir,"We visited during half term as a family of 5.
The reception staff were very helpful.
The rooms were clean and spacious.
There are specific times for children to visit the pool and they are very accommodating outside these hours if it is quiet.
Daniel on the concierge desk was exceptional.
We will definitely visit again and highly recommend it for families.
Great location.",5,2020,02,23
111,Great in all,"The team at the Montcalm royal house is amazing, friendly, welcoming and really good professionally. I appreciate the support from Andrea, Alina and Peter especially. Definitely, if I get the chance will stay there again.",5,2020,02,23

111,Fanastic Wedding Stay,"My new wife and I spent 2 nights at the RLH Montcalm following our big day.
They reserved for us a great room on the 7th floor (which they gave us a free upgrade to) with lovely views overlooking Finsbury Square. We also found champagne and a nice card from Guest Experiences.
The room was comfortable, and has many mod-cons and hi-tech touches, including a well appointed bathroom.
The hotel amenities are excellent also, with a spa and pool, sauna, steam and treatment rooms.
Our only disappointment was that all treatments had been fully booked some weeks in advance, so if you are staying here, make sure you book spa treatments well in advance.
The Aviary bar on the rooftop is excellent also, I would certainly recommend a drink or two up there, with great views of the City Skyline. If you are staying in the summer, this would be a key draw in my opinion.

But the real star of this hotel, above the lovely rooms, spa, rooftop bar etc.. is the staff! I cannot explain how friendly, thoughtful an helpful they are. I also noticed interactions with other guests which showed that, as far as I could tell, they really put the guest, and their needs, above all.
There was not a single member of staff, in whatever capacity they work that did not greet us or help us warmly and willingly. 
A very special thanks to them all, especially Flavia and January, for making this stay so special for my wife and I. We will certainly stay again, maybe for our anniversary. Thank you RLH!",5,2020,02,23
111,Another fantastic visit,"Just returned from a spur of the moment visit to our favourite  London hotel, in fact the only hotel we ever stay at when travelling as a couple or with our son whilst in London, we arrived at night so completely different staff than the familiar faces we see when arriving during the day, but were all equally as welcoming and helpful just lovely, and a special thank you to January for making our stay extra special as usual, feel part of The Montcalm family!",5,2020,02,22

111,Great experience,"I have stayed in numerous hotels in London, but the Montcalm tops them all for friendly staff, cleanliness, a great room and a wonderful atmosphere. I stayed with my daughter, Saturday 15th Feb, and can’t speak more highly of the way we were treated from the moment we arrived. From the big friendly fella on the door, Mary who greeted us in the lobby and Florin who showed us to our room, and everyone else that we came in contact with, a big thank you for making it a very memorable experience. Can’t recommend this hotel enough, if you are going to London and want your hotel stay to be part of your memories then book the Mont calm, it is fantastic, the staff care about what they do and they are brilliant.",5,2020,02,18

111,Friendliest staff and wonderful hotel ,"I won valentines comp for a 1 night stay, from the moment I arrived at the reception I was made to feel very welcome. ‘January’ was lovely and she showed me to my room where I was shocked to see rose petals on the bed, 3 big balloons, prosecco, a fruit platter and macaroons. The room was lovely and we had a great view of London from the 8th floor. In the evening we had drinks in the Aviary and Burdock bars. The breakfast was really nice. After breakfast we used the gym and the spa facilities for an hour before checking out.
I will recommend the hotel to all my family and friends and would love to stay again at Easter.
Thank you for a wonderful experience.

111,Mr jamie thomas,"I have stayed in many hotels across the UK and 10’s of nice hotels in London. I have to say this hotel has absolutely amazed me in all aspects. I don’t have enough words to write how amazing it is. Perfect customer service you feel so welcome from the second you get in the door.

Hotel is amazing and i am definitely coming back as i was very pleased with our stay! Definitely 10/10!",5,2020,02,15
111,Another Great birthday,"I will always recommend this branch, as I have been to M by Montcalm Shoreditch and Marble Arch which the customer service cannot compare the level of rudeness as a paying customer.  The location is great as it was 5 mins away from Ducks and Waffles(and other places in the city).  It’s close to the main road by away from the main road in the same breath.  My cake was lovely and so was the decor, I enjoy my breakfast upstairs where the venue of London is Fab which we took some amazing pictures from the rooftop bar. 
Once again I will like to thank the staff that made my birthday fab xox 

I will alway return, great customer service 
Thank you sooooooo much

111,Another fantastic stay,"This has been my 4th stay at the Montcalm within the past year and once again it has been a flawless one. The rooms are large and well appointed, the location is ideal within the city, and most importantly, the service is outstanding. They make everyone feel like a VIP and the staff is constantly asking if there is anything they can do for you. I spent 10 years working in the hotel industry and I can attest that their service is right up there with the best of them. Special thank you to Ms. January for helping me feel welcome throughout my stay. Well done and I look forward to returning. ",5,2020,02,14
111,If you want to feel special-stay at the Montcalm,"I stayed at the Montcalm, Finsbury Square for a second time now and both times, the staff there have mafe me geel welcome. My friend and I were greeted by Mary who checked us in and was so warm and friendly, she made me feel like a special rather than just another guest to check in like so many other hotels. The personal touch was truly appreciated. 

The Montcalm is a modern hotel with a lovely spa, although the spa needs alittle tlc in places, it has a warm jacuzzi, swimming pool, sauna and steam room and toiletries. Perfect for relaxing and you can even get flip flops to waer from the spa reception. 

I would definitely recommend staying here if you need a hotel stay in London. With Liverpool street within walking distance getting around couldnt be easier.

Great for a romantic stay, a get together with friends or just for some alone tome, the Montcalm will be perfect. 

Not forgetting the rooftop bar and restaurant where you can view London whilst drinking an amazing cocktail. 
",5,2020,02,13
111,Great hotel and facilities,"We stayed for two nights for my wife's birthday. The hotel is really nice and all the staff are all excellent. We were greated at the door by Mary who looked after us throughout our stay. We stayed in a club room which was really nice. This also gave us access to the club lounge which served a free breakfast in the morning and drinks and canapés in the evening. We had treatments at the spa which was really good. Pool, sauna, and steam room were good too. Also has a restaurant with roof garden at the top which has great views of the city. Good location for stuff to do and can jump on the tube anywhere. Again, Mary and her team were all really accomodating and went above and beyond. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back next year!",5,2020,02,13
111,Great Location and Service,Spent a night in this great hotel recently. Can't fault the services or facilities. The location is freat with good transport links and the 10thth floor bar has good views. The one on the ground floor and the area around that seems out of place for the quality of the hotel though.,5,2020,02,13
111,Perfect stay!,"Booked this hotel for my girlfriend and I as it was our anniversary and January the hotel manager made it a very lovely stay for us both. We were greeted with a glass of bubbly on arrival and was taken to our room by January and what a lovely room it was too! It is was so spacious, modern and the bed was huge and very comfy! The bed was so comfy it was disappointing when I got in my own bed when I got home lol. The spa facilities are also very nice and so is the rooftop bar.

111,Weekend in London,"Having stayed here before I knew what to expect, and it's fair to say it exceeded my expectations. I was celebrating my birthday this weekend and service as usual was exceptional. Daniel the concierge was amazing finding me a room with a better view when I enquired and then sending wine and macarons to my room, he really went the extra mile. All in all its the best value hotel in London, I haven't seen anything within the same price bracket that offers the same quality rooms and location paired with exceptional service! ",5,2020,02,09
111,Perfect hotel,"We have just been to this amazing hotel.Staff were there to open the door and welcome us.
We were met by Mary who was a happy  fantastic member of the team. We were shown to our room which was perfect in every way.The bed was so comfortable and for a busy hotel in the middle of London it was so quiet once in your room.The staff were helpful and always met you with a smile early in the morning and late at night. The whole hotel was spotless. 
The roof top bar was spectacular with stunning views over London.
We have stayed in many hotels but this is by far the best.
We are already planning our next stay.",5,2020,02,09
111,Birthday,"I stayed overnight with my friend to celebrate my 30th birthday. Our bags were taken from us upon arrival and a complimentary glass of bubbly was handed to us as we were escorted to check in where we met the lovely Flavia. I was then informed our room was upgraded to a business suite which was such a lovely surprise. Flavia then escorted us to our suite and throughly explained all the amenities. Complimentary macarons and fruit were beautifully arranged in the suite with a lovely 'happy 30th birthday' note from the guest experience team. We spent the afternoon relaxing in the stunning spa area and spent the evening having dinner and drinks at the Aviary on the 10th floor, which, along with delicious food, has amazing views, even at night time. We spent the morning having breakfast in the stylish club room and made the most of our time in the suite. I cannot fault my experience one bit. Flavia was so warm, inviting and friendly in her manner and made us feel right at home from start to end. All the staff we encountered throughout our stay were more than happy to help with any enquiries while we were there. I didn't want my experience to end. We were even given another glass of bubbly as we left. I just want to thank all at Montcalm RLH for making my 30th birthday extra special and unforgettable. It was everything I wanted and more. I most definitely hope to return in the future. Thanks again",5,2020,02,09

Mary was exceptional and took care of my reservation swifty and even kindly escorted me to my room. I couldn't have asked for a better service from this hotel.

The hotel itself was amazing. Great bed and nice heated bathroom floor which always does it for me. 

Breakfast was great although I went for the continental but was told the full English was on the 10 floor I think. I'm sure that would have been great too.

Overall the stay was great thanks to Mary and the its people.

We wanted to get into our hotel early and, ""Mary"" was taking care of us and found us a room available!  The beds, bathroom, heated floors were amazing!

From the moment we arrived Mary on reception had our every need met and question answered and we were most grateful for her generous and hospitable nature.   She took the time to get to know us during our brief stay and we would highly recommend her exemplary customer service charm. 
The Aviary rooftop terrace bar boasts stunning views of the city for a pre supper aperitif and our 8th floor hotel room faced onto Finsbury Square itself which allowed us to watch the world go by whilst enjoying a sumptuous English breakfast in our  room.

111,"Now I know what ""a home away from home"" means","Have stayed at several hotels in London over the years. The Montcalm Royal London House is not the biggest nor the fancier London hotel we have stayed in; but is is the one we look forward to coming back to in the last three years for several reasons, including its location and facilities, such as the club lounge. But the main reason we like coming back are the people of the hotel. The doorman at the entrance, the supervisor at the club lounge, and especially Alina at the reception, who greets you and looks after you as if you were family, are all factors that make us feel every single time, as if we are coming back home.",5,2020,01,28

The room was lovely and the bed was so comfy. The spa area was also great. I haven’t got anything bad to say about our stay. We were made to feel very welcome and enjoyed it very much.

The service from all members of staff was the main difference that really stood out, in particular, Mary who checked us in and showed us to our room. The room itself was beautiful, very modern with mood lighting and touch screen controls on the wall, and very clean. They upgraded us to a junior suite at no extra charge for his birthday which was a wonderful surprise. We would definitely stay here again, and would 100% recommend. ",5,2020,01,28
111,Best London Stay Yet!,"Visited the Hotel/Spa this weekend for my sisters birthday. On arrival the team met us with great manner and were immediately on hand to help us with bags check-in.

Concierge and reception were on hand at any time and the Spa facilities along with the rooms were fab. great stay exceeded my expectations",5,2020,01,28

On arrival at check-in we were offered complimentary Prosecco, January who checked us in was engaging, polite and very helpful, we were shown to our room by January who explained how things worked, the porter assisted with our cases. We received a free upgrade of room which was unexpected but very much appreciated. The room was clean, spacious with mood lighting and a very comfy bed.

The wonderful staff, the beautiful room and the Spa made the stay a memorable and really wonderful. Thank you to such helpful and friendly staff like Francis, Camelia and the lovely young man who went up with us to the room and explained everything. The room and bathroom was very spacious, clean and just heavenly with the great rainforest shower. There was everything one needs and more. ( great minibar, fruit, Wifi - easy to connect, TV, iron, hairdryer etc)
Technology made lights, nightlights etc super easy. The room was very quiet and the bed very comfy. We had a great nights sleep.
Breakfast in the Aviary was not only in a lovely setting with a great view but also with great choice and again such wonderful members of staff. 
It was a joy to see all staff so enthusiastic to make one's stay pleasant.

111,Beautiful hotel lovely staff,This is a lovely luxurious hotel and very good value for money. The rooms are extremely comfortable with  underfloor heating in the bathroom and lovely fluffy robes. The staff were very friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful. The hotel is just five walk minutes from a tube which means everywhere is within easy reach. I stayed for business but would go back again with my husband as there is a lovely spa,5,2020,01,23
111,Great hotel with an amazing staff,"A big THANK YOU to Andreea and the team for the world-class guest experience you provide. You are just a super friendly and helpful team at the reception which makes the visit so much more enjoyable. 
The room on the 9th floor with the balkony and the view is unmatched. 
It only got better with the breakfast on the 10th floor. :-)",5,2020,01,23
111,Wonderful weekend ,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Montcalm RLH this weekend. It was a wonderful stay.

Definitely want to visit again. ",5,2020,01,22
111,I absolutely love this hotel,"This is my second stay already in January due to a client close by and I was so excited to be going the second time because I enjoyed it so much the first time.  What really works are the size of the rooms - which are quite big, large flat screen TV, complimentary water, lovely beds and such friendly polite service. Over and above this you have two excellent restaurants to chose from and a small pool/jacuzzi/steam.  For London prices this is not bad value either. Please another client in this location so I can stay again sooooooon....!",5,2020,01,22
111,The Best Hotel By Far,"A big big thank you too Deepak & the guest experience team & the Montcalm hotel, was 48 hours prior before the booking & I had emailed the hotel in regards to my wedding on the day I booked the hotel. I spoke with Deepak who instantly replied back to my message in regards to an upgrade and also in regards to my wedding. Within 12 hours of the message I received an email
From the guest experience team who had told me everything was set. The service at the desk too the room was amazing. I can say by far this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. I felt like it was the hotel from home alone which is crazy. The hotel staff was lovely especially the guy who checked us in, I can’t remember his name but it started with a G. They done amazing thank you guys, this is my go too hotel from now on.",5,2020,01,22
111,Lovely Sunday stay,"I have just spent one night here and despite it only being a very short stay for an early business meeting on Monday I was very impressed with this hotel.
I was greeted at reception by Mary who was very attentive, friendly and helpful. She told me everything I needed to know about the hotel and offered me refreshments which was a nice gesture. 
Check in was super easy. I was then shown to my room by a lovely gentleman and my room was amazing, huge! A very large and very comfortable bed, fantastic bathroom and all the in room facilities you could want. My only gripe was that my room was next to some sort of generator so I didn’t have the best sleep nor did I ask to move.

I managed to have dinner in the rooftop restaurant (Avirary) and the food was delicious, very nice meal.",4,2020,01,22
111,An Excellent Hoetl,"All I can say is that every aspect of my stay was excellent and the service from all of the staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.

The room was exceptionally clean and the hotel provided all of the amenities you would require.",5,2020,01,21
111,Perfect stay,"We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Suite, which overlooked Finsbury Square. The suite was spacious and it was a real luxury to have a choice of two bathrooms. The staff spoiled us with a fruit plate, macaroons, chocolates and chilled prosecco.

The Club Lounge was a nice relaxing place to start the evening prior to going out for dinner. The weather was very wet and windy  due to Storm Brendan, and we really appreciated how the Doormen organised a taxi for us to get to Le Gavroche so that we didn't arrive all bedraggled. 

Breakfast the following day at The Aviary was delicious and a lovely way to start the day. There was an excellent selection of hot and cold food.

Every member of staff that we encountered was friendly and professional, and made us feel like valued guests.

We're looking forward to returning in the future.

",5,2020,01,20
111,Best London Hotel for the price bracket,"Jut back from a two day business trip to London and spent one night at the Montcalm. Beautiful building overlooking the square, easy to get to from the tube station. Very friendly and attentive (but not over-bearing which is one of my pet hates at higher end hotels) staff. Looked after well on check-in and throughout stay by Mary, with Andreea also pleasant to deal with on check-out. Modern, comfortable well equipped room (one of most comfy beds I have had in a hotel). Excellent spa in the basement of the hotel (hot tub, pool, sauna, steam room), spa was on the small side as you would expect in Central London but was empty in the morning (circa 9am) so didn't matter as had all the facilities to myself. Stunning rooftop bar with 'seating pods' that could be booked overlooking the square and surrounding area, well worth a visit. Will definitely be making the Montcalm my new London base for future business trips and looking forward to my next visit already.",5,2020,01,20
111,AMAZING HOTEL!!!!,"Everything was FANTASTIC from check in to check out. The hotel itself is very clean and orderly with unbeatable amenities! Beautiful decor, friendly staff, great food, rooms are a great size, bed super comfortable...literally everything was great! Perfect location and central to all public transportation (taxi, underground, and buses)
We will only book at this hotel for future travels to London!!",5,2020,01,20
111,Fantastic Hotel,"This was my first time staying at the Montcalm Royal London House and I promise you it will not be the last.
I had a lot of fun there, the customer service was exceptional and the room was spectacular. It was quiet and very clean - it definitely exceeded my expectations.

Mary was fantastic, very friendly and extremely helpful! I cannot wait to stay again.",4,2020,01,20
111,Fantastic Hotel - Great Service,"Stayed here for a business trip, great luxury hotel conveniently located in the head of Finsbury square. Good breakfast and great bar with a view on the top floor. A special thanks to Andreea from the front desk for her help and great service!",5,2020,01,20
111,Fantastic in every way.,We visited the Montcalm for a family get together. We were so impressed with the customer service and attention to detail. Nothing was too much trouble and the little extras we received made our trip even more superb. Prosseco at breakfast when they learned we were there for a birthday celebration. We even received an upgrade to allow us use of the Premier lounge. Absolutely fantastic. Would 100% recommend. Will definitely be back.,5,2020,01,19
111,Amazing hotel!!!,"This is my 3rd time staying here and can never fault a thing! The rooms are beautiful and spacious, the restaurants are fantastic, the roof top bar is the perfect spot to take in the awesome view of London and the customer service is impeccable. January Stevens and the team do everything they can to make sure you have the perfect stay. I can’t wait until the next time I get the opportunity to stay here again. ",5,2020,01,19
111,New favourite,"I stay in London regularly for work. I've stayed in endless hotels and generally find them overpriced and under loved. It's quite difficult to find good value for money.

But the Montcalm offers just that. 

The bedroom itself was quiet, very comfortable and well maintained with a large TV and what looked like a brand new and well designed shower (that didn't flood the bathroom!)

I particularly like the gym and spa area. The sauna is hot. The jacuzzi is pleasantly warm and the swimming pool isn't too cold. All the showers worked with plentiful hot water. The gym is well equipped for cardio and lifting. And everything was immaculately clean. 

You generally can't take any of these things for granted in central London hotels - and especially around this price point.

I left impressed and will consider regular stays.",5,2020,01,17
111,Stunning service from all the staff,"I stay at the Montcalm Royal London House when travelling for work. I find this hotel one of the best for customer service, all the staff go above and beyond, from the doormen, to the concierge, reception, and restaurant staff. This is always my first choice when staying in London as the rooms are very quiet, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.",5,2020,01,16
111,Another great stay for NYE,"Our 3rd or maybe 4th visit here
 
Had a club room as usual which gave entry to the lounge for complimentary early evening drinks and canapés and cold meats, cheeses and pastries for breakfast.

Enjoyed a few cocktails in the Sky bar on one of the nights and meal in the Aviary..  second night it was private party for NYE.

Recommend as  good for families as have nice sized adjourning rooms ",5,2020,01,15
111,Wonderful romantic birthday,"We stayed one night in this wonderful hotel for a romantic birthday celebration. Location is central London. Rooms are large and beds are comfy. I liked the dark corridors. We used the spa in the evening and in the morning, not big but neither crowded. Great view in the rooftop restaurant (with open terrace), the kitchen is really nice and my mini birthday cake was very lovely with my name and candle. The staff is super professional, helpful and friendly - they made us feel special. I'd like to thank to Alina for the warm welcome and for her extraordinary care and attention during our stay, and to Andreea for her the prompt help at the check out. I absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,14
111,"5* service from Alina, amazing expereince","I spent 5 nights at the Montcalm, and really loved everything about it. The rooms are plush, the spa/pool is great (it's bigger than looks on line, and super nice).  What really knocked it to the next level was the service - incredibly kind and lovely staff across the hotel. In particular, we met Alina at the front desk and she made us feel so welcome and at home. We'd been having a tough time with medical issues and she went out of her way to make us comfortable - it was genuinely touching.  Couldn't recommend more. I stayed in the Andaz nearby, which is much more expensive, and preferred the Montcalm in every respect.",5,2020,01,14
111,Unusually Fantastic Service,"I received a free upgrade at reception. I’m used to upgrades as I’m a regular business user at a number of hotels other hotels. Montcalm had no idea of this.  What impressed me was that Alina on receptionist didn’t judge me as a black man in a black hoody. (I’m normally smart). I was treated with the same level of service that I’d experienced when I’d stayed in the past. 

I was unlucky with a couple of facilities that didnt work as they should. TV and coffee machine. The service I received at 5:30am was better than many hotels at peek time. I actually believe a
Hotel should be judged on how they deal with the issues. Breakfast was provided immediately without me asking. Fresh coffee delivered to my room with a smile. At checkout the manager came out to see me. Then when I happened to visit another day, the receptionist Alina who checked me in, remembered me and ran out to apologise! I couldn’t believe she’d read the case notes and cared so much about the little things. This all left me so impressed.

So congrats to whoever looks after guest relations at the hotel.",5,2020,01,13
111,Very nice place to stay when in London,"Very nice hotel, conveniently located. I stay there quite often because it is close to my London office, and I see it as the best among the options in the area. Rooms are functional and large, considering the area, the breakfast buffet is also excellent. The personnel is almost embarrassing kind and professional. Special thanks to Alina and Estefania who welcomed me during my last visit.",5,2020,01,13
111,Management at the Montcalm hotel,"I would like to say the service that me and my partner received from the manager Camelia is excellent. Me and my partner couldn’t ask for anything more. The service, the room with the view we got provided was beautiful. I would definitely recommend to friends and family that this hotel is the best in London. 
Camellia  as a manager was very helpful and there’s not a lot of managers in hotels I could say that about. She always checked in with us and made sure everything was okay.",5,2020,01,12
111,A perfect experience,"I booked a trip to London as a late Christmas present for my girlfriend, and we both agree the Montcalm Royal House was the best hotel we’ve stayed in in the UK. From the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and polite offering us a complimentary Prosecco when checking in. The staff showed us to our room, which was laid out beautifully with rose petals on the bed as I requested with the concierge team, we were shown round all the facilities and how to use them. Best room I’ve ever stayed in. On checking out, Michael was very helpful in ensuring we had the best experience possible, thanks Michael! A perfect experience.",5,2020,01,12
111,Anniversary stay,"Me and my partner visited the hotel for our anniversary last night, we were lucky enough to be checked in by Camelia. She was amazing from start to finish and when we mentioned it was our anniversary she even managed to upgrade us to a Junior Suite room! 20 minutes later we had a knock on the door and she had sent a dessert and a bottle of champagne with a lovely message. The hotel it’s self is so lovely, clean and modern with a lovely bar/restaurant on the 10th floor. 

The rooms were nice and quiet and the beds were so comfy. I would definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury hotel to stay at. 

The only downside is that the spa area is quite small but the hotel makes up for it in other areas. 

Camelia - thank you again for making our stay even more special!! ",5,2020,01,12
111,One of the best hotels I have stayed in - an all-round delight,"Booked a one night stay here through Wowcher. Not sure where to start with this excellent hotel. On arrival we were immediately made welcome with a glass of Prosecco and a friendly receptionist called Andreea looked after us very well. 

The spa and gym facilities are excellent and made you feel immediately relaxed despite being in the hustle and bustle of London. We were upgraded to a juinior suite which ad Sky TV in the room, a spacious bathroom and a very comfortable bed. In the evening we had access to the Montcalm lounge which offered free alcoholic drinks and canapés. The staff in there could not have been friendlier and catered to every need. 

We then enjoyed an excellent meal at the Aviary before a deli pow buffet breakfast. Our receptionist at check out Valentine was equally as friendly. The night before I had left my coat in the lounge and the staff were so attentive. Deepak kindly found my coat after a search and the service from him and the rest of the team was faultless.

If you looking for somewhere to stay in London, the Montcalm would definitely be my first choice - an all round fantastic stay",5,2020,01,11
111,Nice hotel - great staff,"I stayed In this hotel multiple times during different trips. From the moment you step into the hotel, you are made very welcome by all the staff. Every visit I've had the privilege of having Andreea at the reception, ensuring a professional and smooth check-in and check-out experience. The rooms are spacious (especially to London standards) and are very clean. Make sure to get a drink or a bite downstairs in the Burdock where the host Sam takes great care of you and mixes the best cocktails. 

This hotel defines how hospitality should be, every single time again.",5,2020,01,11
111,Great place,"It was a great pleasure to stay in Montcalm hotel. Good location for businessmen and tourists. Lots of pubs, clubs and restaurants nearby. Great polite staff starting from the doorman Alexey to receptionists. The Rooms design is extraordinary with mood light and Control pad for A/C.    Thanks to manager Ken  for a hospitality and complimentary Full English breakfast in Aviary. Cosy restaurant with a stunning view and igloos. Special thanks to concierge Dan for helping us to choose a good restaurant and I will definitely visit Uzbekistan.
Prices for the hotel are very much worthy, it’s really hard to find a hotel with a good location and price. Thanks for Hospitality.",5,2020,01,11
111,Lovely hotel & excellent staff,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for his 40th birthday in December.  The staff were exceptional from when I called and discussed his cake & balloons being delivered, and they were very accommodating.  To the weekend we stayed there, and when the balloons were delivered the 0 was deflated the staff went out of their way to purchase another and then arrange it all in our room.  I would like to specially mention Flavia who was a lovely lady and so hopeful.  
As well as the staff being outstanding, the hotel is lovely, nice rooms, great spa, and fab bars and in a great location.  We have recommended this hotel to our friends and would definitely stay here again.",5,2020,01,09
111,Beautiful hotel,"Me and my fiancé had an amazing experience during our stay from December 31,2019 to January 2,2020.

A special thank you to January, Michael and Flavia for making our stay extra comfortable.",5,2020,01,09
111,Miss Nida Vaqar c/o Deepak Panicker,"Had a stay at the Montcalm for New Year’s Eve ! Starting from us walking in through the doors with such a warm welcome from the doorman to the check in and the check out and everything in between was spot on ! Quick and extremely friendly check in- a member of staff even took us up to the room! We were welcomed with drinks and a beautiful kind welcome note and chocolates and goodies ! The room was perfect with hygiene being on point and super comfortable. The room service was super professional and friendly and quick. They catered to our every need that we requested. The spa staff was super friendly and the spa area was super clean and beautiful and amazing to use. 
The views were amazing from the room! 
Deepak and the team looked after us extremely extremely well! Words are not enough to express how amazing our stay was! 
DEFINITELY going to go back and stay ! 
Well done to Deepak and the team! Keep it up !",5,2020,01,08
111,Amazing (second) Stay,"This was our second stay in a club double which saw us upgraded to a suite!! The views over Finsbury Square are phenomenal. The staff from reception, club lounge, spa and guest experience seem to be even nicer every time we stay!
We really look forward to our next stay to be treated like Royalty once more.",5,2020,01,08
111,"Nice room, good breakfast, very professional and friendly staff","I've been there now for the third time. This time also a very pleasant stay with a nice room, a good breakfast and very friendly staff. So
next time when in London I will choose this hotel again. From the rooftop bar and restaurant you have a nice view. Maybe I should try it in summer. 🙂",5,2020,01,07
111,Wonderful Service and an Excellent Hotel,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the Deluxe Double Room for one night, we were celebrating our anniversary, which I mentioned when making the booking as I wanted to see if I could purchase/arrange something special in the room for when we arrived. I hadn't heard back from the hotel, which was fine, but we entered our room and there were flower petals on the bed, a tray of treats and a card from the staff! We were both so thrilled, and I can't thank the team at the Montcalm enough.

In terms of the actual experience, the service was perfect from the second we entered the building: the doorman guided us to the check-in desk, and helped with our bags when we got our Uber after checking out, we even had a member of staff come to our room to show us the different features of our room and how to use the aircon etc. The room itself was lovely, spacious and had a very comfortable bed, we even had a glimpse of the London skyline from our window! We ordered room service which was quick and delicious and the breakfast in the morning was just as good.

We went out for dinner in the evening, and the hotel is in a great location, we walked to Shoreditch (10-15 minutes at most) and found an amazing Italian place called Gloria, but there were about 50 other options close by!

I would highly recommend this hotel, and thanks again to all the staff, especially those who helped make our experience so memorable.",5,2020,01,06
111,First class hotel and service,Excellent place to stay in a great part of London. Fantastic welcome - really felt looked after and that they appreciated our business. Spotless room with modern fittings and amenities. Nice spa/pool. Good value for money. We had dinner at the Aviary Rooftop Restaurant - lovely food and excellent service. The staff kindly arranged a special 'birthday' decoration on my son's dessert (it was his 21st)! We'd definitely consider the hotel again when we next stay in London.,5,2020,01,06
111,"Beautiful hotel, amazing staff - a great stay!","I’m so pleased I came across this hotel, upon checking in the staff at the front desk were so friendly and helpful, we were taken to our room which was lovely and had everything you could need! We unfortunately didn’t get time to make the most of the rest of the hotel but as we have booked to return in March 2020 we definitely will be! So pleased to find a brilliant hotel in a great location - couldn’t recommend more!",5,2020,01,06
111,Fantastic Hotel and Experience,"I booked the Montcalm for my wife’s birthday. We had a room which was reasonably priced but what we got was worth double. I am sure they upgraded us. 
We had 2 hours of shuffleboard in ‘Burdock’ followed by a bottomless Prosecco brunch. After which we retired to our 8th floor room. 
Everything was as you would expect from the presentation of the hotel. Clean, welcoming & professional. 
The thing that set the hotel apart was the staff,  nothing was too much trouble and everything was efficient and very well polished. A special mention to Elisha who was our waitress, she made our lunch experience more than just the food and drink. 
I would definitely recommend a visit to the Montcalm if you want to treat yourself to a piece of affordable luxury!
",5,2020,01,05
111,A great quiet stay at a lovely hotel,"The rooms were clean, the bed comfy and the hotel in a quiet location that was still quite central. What more can you want?!

The gym was a bit small but good enough.
The breakfast was unfortunately not the best. The choices were limited, but it was not so bad that it was an issue. All around the hotel you can find great places to have a good breakfast.

The staff were really friendly. I would recommend this place any time!",5,2020,01,03
111,Birthday Celebration,"We have just had a really lovely stay at this hotel from 1st-2nd January for my husband’s 60th birthday. From the moment we arrived the service we received was impeccable. All staff we had the delight to meet were always polite, friendly and helpful. The facilities were good, we had a Club Room which was a really good size and very well equipped. The hotel is located in a very central part of the City with Liverpool Street and Bank in walking distance. All in all a lovely experience. We will definitely be back!",5,2020,01,03
111,A piece of a heaven 🤗🥰🤩,"Can’t believe I missed out on giving this property a raving review on TA and although more than half a year later, it certainly feels like yesterday on how pampered I felt during my stay. Little luxuries everywhere. Plush pillows and silky soft bed linens. Super comfy and elegant beige armchair! Daily little cookies with coffee. High end bathroom amenities that make you smells fresh the entire day. Immaculate housekeeping services daily. You don’t see anyone literally but being pampered with excellent 5 star services! Doorman was sweet. Front desk lady was great to grant me an early check in. Concierge was detailed when rooming me. I couldn’t ask for more and loved it every moment when back in the room (other than more sunshine as it was raining and wet thru out the whole week in London when there! Arrggggghhh) thanks for the memorable stay. I will be back. ",5,2020,01,03

111,Absolutely spectacular - Highly recommend ,"Stayed a night here for my wife’s birthday, the service we received from check in to check out was phenomenal, the quality of the room itself was amazing, I loved the bedroom mood lighting, took advantage of the pool and jacuzzi alongside the sauna and steam room and I was not disappointed, food at the hotel was very nice and the staff who I encountered throughout my visit were all very nice and helpful! ",5,2019,12,29
111,Alice fenton,"Me and my partner absolutely loved our stay at the Montcalm it was the break we needed ! Really helpful at the check in desk where the concierge helped me with some parking tips .
 
Rooms were amazing never wanted to leave the bed ! Spa facilities spectacular and we made use of the gym also great variety !
 
Such a great stay we would deffo return 💕",5,2019,12,29
111,A fantastic way to spend an anniversy,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Montcalm twice in the past two years. Each time the experience had gotten better and better. The staff are extremely polite, your bags are taken up to your room and from stepping inside it's like stepping into another world. The staff where super friendly and even remembered us! I highly enjoyed the experience and although we had some minor issues with things not being in put in place (we ordered some choclates on the website) things where fixed quickly and the room we got was fantastic! The staff did everything they could to keep things going and both me and my partner loved it! We will certainly be visiting again and would like to thank the staff for making our special occasion even more special!",5,2019,12,29
111,beautiful 5-star hotel,"The rooms are clean, new, modern, beautifully appointed and first class.  The lobby bar is warm and friendly, with another sports bar down the hall:  take your choice between a more laid-back vibe, or a louder higher-energy experience.  The staff were all super friendly an eager to help. A great choice and experience that I would be happy to repeat.",5,2019,12,28
111,Great!!,"My stay at Montcalm was fantastic. Very nice rooms and everything you asked for. Alina from the reception, she helped me very well with everything! And thw subway is nearby 
the st. Pauls is very close. I'll defentily come back again.",5,2019,12,28
111,modern 5 star luxury,"Modern, comfortable and luxurious rooms in black and white design. Lighting and AC are operated via build-in touchscreens. Hospitable  and welcoming staff. Elegant restaurant and rooftop bar with nice views over London. Pub was not available due to a private party, the executive lounge proved a comfortable and well-stocked alternative. Very reasonable rates for a 5-star hotel in he City of London. Next time when in London, we'll come back.",5,2019,12,28
111,Great hotel right in the City,"I’ve stayed here a few times and really love this hotel. The rooms are great, especially the super comfortable bed. Check in is easy and Mary who checked me in was really friendly.

I particularly like the rooftop bar with views over the City. I recommend it.",5,2019,12,28
111,Amaizing stay over,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend just the day before Christmas, somehow I made a booking just for 1 person🤦‍♀️. On the front desk we meet Alina absolutely lovely person, I explained her all situation with Mr. surprise and she made sure that we have all what’s we need. The room was lovely and  clean. No many ppl in the pool...
Once again Thank You Alina all team who served us those days.
Happy New Year to everyone 🎉🎉🎉

Me and Mr.Surprise",5,2019,12,26
111,Fantastic Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed here for a night (December 22) on a 2 day trip to London for her 18th birthday. The hotel is amazing - the rooms, spa, food and especially the staff are all deserving of a 5 star rating. The extra touches for her birthday (macaroons and wine in the room, plus mini cakes with a candle at dinner) made it all extra special, and were very much appreciated.
I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,12,26
111,Good but could be great,"Walking in to the hotel on Wednesday 18th December I thought I was in a night club, dark inside with loads of people milling around the entrance, shown to check in where the receptionist said something but I couldn’t hear with all the noise, then made my way to my room. Quite corridors with thick luxurious carpet, I entered my room which for a double luxury I found to be large (compared my many I’ve stayed in, around London). The lighting choices were vast and colourful, night lights, bedside lights, desk lights, full room lights and a mixture of all. The electronic pad outside the bathroom allows you to manage the underfloor heating in the bathroom, lighting in the bathroom, air conditioning and a few other things. The room comes with a large Flatscreen TV with all sky channels. The bed was like sinking into a cloud it was so soft yet supportive ( i suffer with multiple back issues). Breakfast is served on the 9th floor in the aviary ( not that anything in my room including the TV hotel information told me this, a friendly hotel guest showed me). A great selection and friendly service available for breakfast with great views across the local roof tops.  Check out was simple however make sure you check for any minibar add one you’ve not actually had. ",4,2019,12,26
111,Could be better,"I had endless trouble with reservation 
Staff could be more trained 
Check in process is long , specially you had a long haul flight and staff doesn’t care 
Hotel is in Finsbury square , Moore gate metro is 10 min away 
Hotel has pool , fitness center and spa 
Bar and restaurant 
The included breakfast is just yoghurt and muesli  and fruit 
If you want cooked breakfast you must pay about £15PP which is on 10th floor 
Bottle water per day 
Daily house keeping 
Despite informing hotel about cleanliness 
My bed was squeaky  and bedsheets not clean enough 
Underfloor heating 
Laptop safe 
And minibar - pay as you consume",3,2019,12,25
111,Mrs,"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in London ! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the Alina and staff, our names were mentioned on the board and we were upgraded to a better room(free upgrade). The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible. We had two great nights here, which obviously also added up to the experience. Alina is an absolute gem and made sure whatever we needed was taken care of- a big THANK YOU to her !",5,2019,12,25
111,Visit,"Best hotel I’ve stayed in by far. Roof top bar was stunning,  immaculate rooms, staff were extremely attentive, polite and well presented. The staff couldn’t do enough for you. Will be returning in the New Year ☺️",5,2019,12,24
111,Amazing,"We had a great time at the hotel.  super friendly staff, who will help you immediately!  we were able to put the stuff in advance at the hotel, so that we could enter the city.  it is well located, namely 5 minutes from the liverpool street station.  The food is also very good. it is highly recommended!  and wonderful to unwind after a nice day in london.",5,2019,12,23
111,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL ☝🏾,"This hotel is truly an experience, the interior are absolutely beautiful and just amazing, so comfortable and warm, and their staff is incredibly dedicated to meet your needs. This is really 5 Star🤘🏾",5,2019,12,23
111,2nd visit this month ,"I have just returned from my second visit to this amasing hotel! 
The wow factor starts the moment you walk towards the door and the doormen takes your bags opens the door and guides you to reception where you are given a glass of bubbles on arrival. I stayed earlier in month with my girlfriends and we used the bar both on ground level and the stunning aviary! We also used the spa before we left which was a lovely way to end our stay! 
On both occasions our rooms have been great! Big Thankyou to Camilla for our upgrade to our beautiful suite with club acces which was a lovely treat. 
Thankyou to Michael who checked us out and Sunny our Barman who looked after us so well too!

Highly recommend and can’t wait to return a perfect hotel and the staff make this place even better ! 
Thankyou again 🙏🏼
Merry Christmas ",5,2019,12,22
111,Pre Christmas minibreak,"From the member of staff who first opened the hotel door, right through to us checking out with Camelia (duty manager), every single member of staff has been so friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend this hotel. And we hope to return soon.
Fantastic breakfast. Great bar with rooftop views. 
Great start to Christmas!",5,2019,12,22
111,Perfect stay,"Everything was faultless. Friendly and professional staff, clean everything, comfortable bed and room and relaxing little pool and steam room for guests.

Would absolutely stay again and highly recommend. Great price for what you get in London, and I have stayed in many hotels in London at this price point and am notoriously fussy.",5,2019,12,21
111,Great stay and Spa,"Made a one night stay via a Wowcher deal including a massage and Spa session and had a fabulous time. Hotel staff were super attentive an the Spa session and room were lovely. Breakfast food was lovely but service was a little erratic, although we did hit the restaurant at peak time. ",5,2019,12,21
111,Always a good business base,"When staying for one night prior to a business meeting, I need the accommodation to be efficient- convenient location; slick check in/out; comfortable bed; cool, quiet room; and a good shower. There is invariably no time to spare to waste time sorting things out. I find this hotel ticks all the important boxes for me.",4,2019,12,20
111,Great spot,"We stayed here for my 30th birthday a few weeks ago. The hotel was beautiful - great rooms, comfy beds and lovely swimming pool. Every single staff member we met was very friendly, attentive and helpful. They decorated our room with balloons on my birthday. Will definitely come back on our next trip.",5,2019,12,16
111,One of the best hotels I've stayed in. ,"From the delicious prosecco on arrival to the amazing buffet breakfast, the montcalm was the height of sufisticated luxury. The room was clean, tidy and details like the automation system controlling lighting, under floor heating and the aircon made it that cut above the norm. The Aivery bar is truely stunning. Perfect cocktails with that view! We will be back! ",5,2019,12,15
111,"Lovely hotel, attentive staff","A really wonderful hotel with great facilities. Staff were friendly, welcoming and unerringly attentive. We were greeted with prosecco on arrival and the offer of take away coffee on departure. They couldn't have done enough. ",5,2019,12,15
111,Was better last time,"Me and partner love this hotel but our experience this time wasn’t as great, walked in and was ignored, receptionist was rude, a lady we bumped into was lovely. And check out again the lady who served us was rude too. Everything was fine apart from the check in and check out. The spa receptionist wasn’t great either, it seemed as thought no one wanted to be there. I worked in hospitality and there was days I wanted to go but you can at least fake it. Really annoyed because I do love this hotel, just a bit disappointed.",4,2019,12,15
111,"An oasis of understated elegance, in the form of a hotel.","From the fine gentlemen opening the door for you and helping you with your luggage, it feels like you're coming home; to a place where there are people who anticipate what you might need, and suggest it to you, before you ask; from the dimmed, yet sufficient warm lighting, which somehow envelops your senses, giving you the feeling that your brain is in a spa: I recommend this hotel. I'm sure the upstairs terrace would be lovely in the summer. The food and their specialty beer are a must try. This isn't a hotel where you would bring small children (thankfully)!",5,2019,12,14
111,Great stay again,"This was our second stay at The Montcalm Royal Hotel. We chose this hotel again as we were going to a wedding nearby.
We had requested if our room could be available early as we needed to change into our wedding outfits. 
The staff on reception were most helpful. It was very much appreciated and meant we were able to enjoy the wedding without having to rush. 
Our room was perfect and comfortable just like our previous stay. 
I love the roof top bar and restaurant. Because of the views it is popular for private functions as was the case this time so we couldn't enjoy a drink up there before hand. 
No matter there maybe an occasion in the future.",4,2019,12,11
111,Recommended!,"The hotel is in a perfect location and the rooms are well designed and very comfortable. 
And Alina is a first class hotel receptionist. She made me feel that my staying at the hotel was personally important to her. Professional, attentive, friendly, helpful, proactive and smiling. I wish I could find Alina in every hotel where I go :)
See you soon!",5,2019,12,08
111,"Highly, highly recommend this hotel","We stayed for only 1 night and I wish it could have been longer. I planned this stay for my partner's birthday and the staff were incredible from the moment I booked. Not only did we receive a room upgrade for a special occasion, bit the staff arranged for birthday balloons and a complimentary dessert in the room. The room was on 8th floor and had stunning views over Finsbury Square and the London skyline. The room was really big with a gorgeous ensuite bathroom. We really could not have asked for more from our stay. There are plenty of great places to eat, drink and go out within 10 minutes of the hotel. I am sure the spa would have been amazing but I unfortunately forgot my swimsuit. The Aviary rooftop bar was also gorgeous and the cocktails were amazing. Extra special thanks to Flavia who ensured our stay was absolutely perfect and also to Esta Tania. Flavia made us feel so welcome and so special. Thank you to a wonderful team.  ",5,2019,12,08
111,Ultimate luxe and quality,"The perfect hotel for staying in London.
Rooms are so good and clean. Super friendly staff. Georgiana and Camelia helped us so good everything was more than I expected so this is my second home for when I'm in London. ",5,2019,12,08
111,Can't fault this hotel,I have stayed at this hotel multiple times in the past. And this stay is no different. Service at the front desk whilst checking in was seemless and the staff were very friendly.  The room has a lovely view facing into the square.,5,2019,12,06
111,Best hotel in London,"This will be my wife and I's 2nd trip to this superb hotel. Ideally located in the city of London near Morgate Underground station.  We visited the roof top restaurant for dinner and enjoyed a 5 star meal. We were welcomed to the hotel By January, the host manager and also Camila they both took their time to show us to our rooms and explained all the high tech functions of the room. I'm sure this will not be our last stay as we had champagne and macaroons waiting for us to start celebrating our Anniversary. Thanks to all the staff at the Hotel.
Riaz And Hoa",5,2019,12,06
111,Feeling like home in a five star hotel,"It was our second stay at Royal Montcalm and I must say that this was again a fantastic experience.

First of all , the hotel is very well located in the city of London, so you are not in the super touristic area but at the same time, with the tube or bus you are very close to the tourist attractions. Otherwise you are close to Shoreditch which is a super cool district, young, less crowdy, with many markets, restaurants, shops, art shops...

The hotel is really providing 5-star services. Our host Maryi Camelia has taken care of us during our 3 days with kindness, care and making sure that everything was fine for us , as if we were invited by a good friend in his house ( And not like in the hotel chains ).

All the staff is great and during the day there were always complimentary attentions, could be prosecco, cakes, coffee,... 

The hotel is surrounded by a pub on one side and a kind of gastro-pub on the other side, and there is a beautiful roof top bar. So during the evening's there is a celebration atmosphere typical of London.

We hope to go back soon !!",5,2019,12,06
111,Excellent ,"Excellent place to be for a job trip, there’s spa and gym available from 6.30 am. Close to the subway and personnel has always been kind and available. Open bar and breakfast included. Couldn’t recommend a better place if you are in area. ",5,2019,12,05
111,Amazing ,"I stayed here earlier in the year for an event we were holding in their meeting rooms and I loved it so much I booked a stay for fun last weekend.

This hotel is amazing, as soon as you get out of the taxi to the front doors of the hotel, you are welcomed, looked after and treated like an old friend.

The cocktails are superb, I highly recommend the gingerbread sour! All of the food was delicious and the complimentary bottle of fizz tasted all the more sweeter!

We had the loveliest lady, January, who looked after us during our stay and nothing was too much trouble for her. Everything about this hotel is quality, the rooms, the staff, the bar and rooftop terrace.

How could I forget to mention the rooftop terrace! Our room opened up to the most amazing space with wonderful views of London. We felt like frauds in such a fancy place, but the staff made us feel welcomed and like special guests.

If my budget allows, I would most definitely book into this hotel again, and I would recommend it to anyone for business or pleasure. 
",5,2019,12,04
111,Another great stay,"Everything about the Montcalm is excellent and welcoming. I checked in easily and was shown to a lovely room on the 8th floor. Unfortunately there was a party above in their rooftop bar and the music was a bit loud. I spoke to reception and in five minutes flat I was in another room on the 7th. Whisper quiet and perfect. The beds at the Montcalm are incredibly comfortable as well, so all in all, yet another great stay there. Thank you to everyone at the hotel.",5,2019,12,04
111,The hotel is now like a home for me in London.,"After 5 stays at Montcalm hotels and the third stay at this particular one, the Montcalm Royal London House has become like a home for me in London, where I travel to often for work. 

You can just tell that these guys are serious hotel operators - they recognize their repeat customers, remember their likes and dislikes and simply have hospitality in their blood - from the doormen, the staff at the reception, to the house keeping staff - everyone seems to be on their game! 

The rooms are very well equipped and the bathrooms have under floor heating, which is something that is probably severely under appreciated until you actually experience a warm bathroom floor in the middle of a winter night. 

And then there’s the roof top bar which seems to never be empty and offers a fabulous view of the neighborhood and square below. Even the lobby bar and the attached pub are great places to hang out for a relaxing drink or dinner, after work. I like lively places when I travel for work, as it makes me feel less lonely. The Montcalm RLH offers this in spades.",5,2019,12,03
111,Overnight stay for a special birthday,I was so impressed with this hotel. The staff were amazing and went out of their way to make my partner feel very special on her 60th birthday. The facilities are lovely and the hotel is very clean and modern unlike a lot of expensive hotels in London that can seem very tired. I wish we had more time to spend in the hotel and this will be our first choice for our next London stay.,5,2019,12,03
111,Amazing hotel and amazing customer service,My Fiance and I stayed here for the second time and I can honestly say the service was the best service we have ever received! Camelia was extraordinary and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect! They even put balloons and chocolates in our room to celebrate our birthday. We will definitely be staying again very soon!,5,2019,12,02
111,Nice stay,"The second time in this hotel and again a good experience. I'm not coming so often in London but definitely this is one of my favourite hotel to stay. People are kind, friendly and very helpful at anytime. Especially Alina at the reception who was very helpful and professional and answered to all my questions. Definitely when I will be back for next work trip this hotel will be my choice again.",5,2019,12,01
111,Best customer service :) ,"I stay in the Montcalm almost weekly for business and I absolutely love staying here - the hotel is really comfortable and in such a great location. The Aviary is perfect for drinks and dinner and the hotel has all her necessities you would want. 

The standout part for me is the customer service - Camelia is such a superstar she is the sweetest and always makes an effort to check me in really fast and has the friendliest personalities. I always look forward to checking in every week as everyone is so professional and I’m always welcomed with a smile :) It makes my home away from home extra special. 

Thank you Camelia and team :)",5,2019,12,01
111,Weekend Away,"Booked this hotel and it was well worth the price. Camelia the on call manager was so attentive towards us and the service was amazing. The spa was lovely, cannot fault anything. The room was beyond my expectation, from the cleanliness to the minibar and the best bit a short walk away from moorgate underground station ",5,2019,12,01
111,Excellent hotel!,I booked this stay for my partners birthday and it was the best place to book. Staff were so friendly with everything. They even went the extra mile to put balloons for his birthday and have us a birthday plate with a few extra which was a great touch. Igloo bars set up on t he roof top which were so nice. Hotel is situated close to the underground so it was very convenient. Our day was very pleasant. Definitely can’t wait to come back!,5,2019,12,01
111,Perfect 👌 ,"Lovely hotel, attentive staff, great breakfast. Rooms are fab, very quiet, massive TV, comfy bed. Can’t really fault this place to be honest! Even has sports bar one end which was heaving but couldn’t hear it at all. Great location and we were looked after excellently from arrival to check out ",5,2019,12,01
111,Excellent hotel and service,"Great rooms, excellent service from everyone from the bar staff and reception to the doormen. Rooftop bar is amazing and spa was the perfect way to cure a hangover. Would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,11,30
111,Amazing!,"From the staff to the accommodation and service, Montcalm was an amazing experience and the perfect stay for mine and my boyfriend’s anniversary. The hotel is so well-located and beautiful and cosy inside. We will be back again!",5,2019,11,30
111,Incredible stay - couldn’t fault it,"The hotel is amazing in every way. From the moment you arrive every aspect of the experience was flawless and you are made to feel so special. My boyfriend took me for my birthday and we were both very pleased. We have stayed at multiple hotels from this chain and have never been disappointed, this was our second stay at this hotel in particular. I’d highly recommend visiting the swimming pool and jacuzzi while there as well as the rooftop bar/restaurant called The Aviary, great views and a lovely breakfast. 
Special thanks to Flavia who was brilliant, we felt extremely looked after and are so appreciative ",5,2019,11,29
111,Comfy beds with a twist of luxury,"Really enjoyed my stay. The bed, pillows and duvet were some of the comfiest I have stayed in for a long time! Makes all the difference.  Massive bed, massive TV, and I may well end up going back there just to stay for a few days, so I can get a decent nights sleep and relax in the room! Staff were fantastic, very attentive to your needs. Alina was great on reception and really looked after us for our entire trip. The staff up in the Aviary were outstanding, and the bar is a beautiful setting in its own right. Stefan on the door was very professional and his customer service levels were excellent. I really appreciated the way the staff looked atfer us in general and if you hear someone snoring, it will be me, lazing in the room in those lovely beds!",5,2019,11,28
111,"Nice hotel, lovely staff","First visit to the hotel. I gave up trying to get registered into the Club. The app failed with http failure messages, the request I made last week are so far unanswered and nothing from the manual form request I made in the hotel.

But app issues aside both Alina and Andrea on the reception desk were lovely, very helpful.

The room was superb. Heated floors and a huge bed. The smart tv wasn’t so smart, and it’s volume couldn’t go very high (40 was not 40!).

I had a room service meal that was a burger and fries. The food was nice, no complaints there. Delivered by a very nice man. I did find it odd the hotel charges extra for room-delivery, providing a tray. Isn’t that just room service?

I had the 10th floor breakfast. For me quite pricey but this is central London. The food was nice though. Again the staff were attentive and very friendly.

So overall a nice, if pricey stay, and forget the app/club.

I wish the review here could split out the staff as they were all great. I’d mark the staff 5/5. I’d mark the hotel prices as 3/5. Food quality was 5/5.",3,2019,11,26
111,Hotel and concierge,"Dear Sirs,

It was great pleasure to stay at your hotel. Stay was nice,will say excellent mostly from great people working in hotel. From Doorman,restaraunt,front desk all rspeccialy i was having problems with my leg difficulty walking-they we're even helping me get out of car..Just Superb.

111,Beautiful hotel & location with amazing staff.,"Really enjoyed my stay! It is especially nice to be comfortable and happy on a business trip with the added extra of a nice gym & spa to make sure to keep an almost normal routine while away from home. The staff at the Montcalm Royal London House we excellent from the moment the door was opened for me to when it closed behind me, every member of staff looked after me throughout my stay. I would highly recommend to stay here for business or pleasure.",5,2019,11,26
111,Fantastic Stay at Montcalm Royal House.,"Have to say super impressed with the hotel. Alina at reception (for check in and check out) is credit to the hotel. Very friendly, helpful in a wonderful professional manner.

Rooms were modern, high-end, clean and very comfortable. Common /sitting areas were great - bars, restaurant etc. 

Will certainly be staying again, could be a top pick for my London visits.",5,2019,11,26
111,Refurbished old building,"Theme was dark wood.. clean hotel but I didn't feel that safe as a solo female traveller.  With a pub at lobby you get many drunkards walking around and the lift access does not require additional security of room key! Room cannot be double locked so single lady traveller may not feel safe. Room comes with multi color lighting .. so it makes you wonder what is this hotel famous for..

Nice touch would be nespresso machine in room, and complimentary biscuits as snacks. Breakfast buffet was simple mot alot of variety. Location wise is 10min walk to Liverpool station.",3,2019,11,25
111,Amazing stay!!,Great hotel in a very central location. Staff were very accommodating and friendly. Modern and very clean. Had a great sleep until the fire alarm went off at 9am on sunday morning when I wanted a long lay in! Apart from that I had an amazing time at the montcalm will definitely be back😊,5,2019,11,25
111,"Excellent service, exceeded expectations!","A lovely staycation only made possible by the attentiveness of the front desk and staff at the Montcalm Royal London House. From the very moment you are ushered through the doors, you are greeted with the warmest smile, quick and efficient check in/out process and rooms that are extremely clean (not noisy as well considering we're in the city). Kudos and a big shout out to Flavia, Stefania and Andreea for the memerobable experience! Shall be back soon. ",5,2019,11,25
111,Our Mont calm experience..,"We stayed at this hotel for a Saturday night. 

It was a anniversary celebration. 

Mary on reception booked us in swiftly with a professional and courteous manner.

January Stevens, the guest relation manager made us feel especially welcome, even having rose petals spread over our  bed, drinks and macaroons at the table all courtesy of Mont calm!

Every member of staff we encountered was polite and welcoming. 

We loved our experience and will be back!

Highly recommended.

Thankyou Mont calm!",5,2019,11,25
111,My mums 65th birthday ,Well not sure where to start. This hotel is worth its stars. We stayed 1 night for a special occasion. From booking to leaving the experience went smoothly and I was made to feel that every penny was worth it. All of the staff went out of their way to make our stay more than just a stay but an experience that I wont forget. The room wasnt huge but had all mod cons required and a view of Finsbury Square. The Club lounge was well worth paying for and we really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere after a hectic day spent doing tourist sights. Flavia looked after us during our stay and the added extras were a sweet touch. One of my most memorable trips and will definitely recommend and hopefully return for another trip.,5,2019,11,25
111,Amazing stay,"We have stayed at this amazing Montcalm for 2 night. We have had a very nice room with a huge TV in and a welcome card with macarons on the table what a amazing treat from the hotel. The Spa was amazing, we enjoyed ourselves very much. Alina who check us out was very polite and friendly she offered us hot drinks before we left.
We definitely will be back. This hotel is absolutely amazing.",5,2019,11,25
111,Always a great stay! ,"When staying in London this hotel is always our 1st choice. We have looked at other properties and none come close to this one for how much it offers and at such excellent value. 
The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff are always professional, attentive and very friendly. The breakfast is fantastic and offers plenty of choice with high quality produce.
We have stayed here several times and having just returned from a stay it never fails to impress us. We were checked in and out by Mary on this occasion who deserves a mention and a special thanks to January who is amazing! January literally cannot do enough for you and is a big part of the reason we keep returning. We look forward to staying with you again soon! ",5,2019,11,24
111,Relaxing weekend away,"Lovely visit, fantastic room and breakfast and a nice visit to the spa. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Would have been topped off if we were able to book the Aviary but sadly there was an event there.",4,2019,11,24
111,Absolutely amazing room and service,Stayed overnight for a special occasion - they made every effort (including wine and balloons in the room) to make the experience special. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the room was great. Definitely recommend.,5,2019,11,23
111,Another Fantastic Stay!,"This is our second time returning to the hotel and it will not be the last. Unfortunately something unexpected came up meaning we had to change the dates of the trip and eventhough we had a non-refundable booking, the team managed to change our dates without any excess fees etc for which I am very grateful. Our trip to London was a birthday present for my dad so I contacted the concierge team to organise a little something upon arrival however my expectations were beyond exceeded! Not only did we get a room upgrade but also complimentary cakes and drinks. Special mention must go to Petar from the concierge team who went out of his way to make my parents' stay perfect - organising breakfast, transport around London, suggesting restaurants & attractions - he really made their weekend feel very special and effortless. Best hotel in centralThank you all and see you !",5,2019,11,21
111,Still Amazing,"In our opinion, the Montcalm RLH remains the best hotel, based on value for money v service in London.

After a couple of years of being open, the Hotel still remains fresh, well kept and relevant.  The cleanliness of the rooms and service are fantastic.  In fact we stayed in the same room in August 2018 as we did a few weeks ago and we could clearly see the Hotel have invested in the up keep and refurbishment of the room.

The main pull for us however, in a very competitive and aggressive market will always be the people.  All Hotels in London are pretty, right?  But it is the people that deliver the experience.  And the Montcalm RLH again delivered.  Despite the inevitable churn of staff, the new Team made it their business to find out we were returning guests.  We had a couple of reservations whether we would feel like the new kids on the block.....this was totally unfounded!!  The new GM, Deepak, the new FOH Manager, Camilla and the Guest Service Manager, Alex (may have some of the titles wrong, but close enough), catered and more for every need we required.  They have the great quality of making it feel professional but relaxed at the same time.  These guys will never fail in keeping you happy, they are a credit to the Montcalm Group.

Go there, be nice to these guys, the Reception Team, Cleaners, Waiting Staff and Maintenance have only one goal - deliver the experience and keep you happy.....how can you fail to enjoy your stay......until next time and thank you.",5,2019,11,20
111,Long Weekend away,"Was staying 2 nights with friends (all down from Edinburgh) Great location for access to West end and connections from Kings Cross. Staff very helpful and considerate, doorman & check in desk staff especially good. Defo will consider another stay, next time we head souh",5,2019,11,18
111,Anniversary,"Me and partner stayed here on Saturday for our 1 Year Anniversary and was treated like royalty to say the least! 
Such a beautiful hotel with the loveliest staff, we was given the most gorgeous suite overlooking London greeted by a bed covered with rose petals and a bottle of red wine! The spa facilities was wonderful and went down a treat after a heavy night out in London! The stay was unreal start to finish and we will definitely be going back ☺️",5,2019,11,17
111,"Great place, great people, amazing family time","We had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for a family reunion and to celebrate 2of our members. The staff who helped us accommodate was incredibly nice and helpful. Our experience during the stay was very good due to all the small attentions and pleasant surprises from the representatives of the hotel ( Dorian, Alina, Andreea) when they found out the reason for our stay (2 birthdays 🎉).
Also, at breakfast we have met Victoria and Oliver who brought sunshine and smiles on our days.
We will definitely come back with the first opportunity.",5,2019,11,17
111,Most beautiful hotel!,"The hotel was amazing! I recommend the stay well package 100% the massage was brilliant and the spa area was lovely. All of the staff couldn’t of done more for me and my boyfriend and they made the room special as I mentioned it was his Birthday! Everyone was kind and helpful, especially January who went out of her way to make sure everything was okay for us on our visit! Thankyou January! X",5,2019,11,17
111,Superb!,"Best hotel I have ever stayed in! 
The room was spacey. The bed was so comfy! The staff were the most helpful and attentive staff. Everything was to the highest quality. Perfect stay! And can’t wait to come back in August!",5,2019,11,16
111,Another amazing stay at the Montcalm,"We’ve just had another fantastic stay at the Montcalm. Flavia and her team were very accommodating. The rooms are large, clean and really well kitted out. The spa area downstairs is included too and we used it a couple of times during our stay. Honestly can’t recommend this hotel and the fabulous staff enough.",5,2019,11,16
111,Beautiful,"I have had an amazing stay with my boyfriend for my birthday at the montcalm. They were all so accommodating and could not walk past staff without asking if we were okay, a smile or needing anything.  They upgraded our room and had beautiful service. Spa facilities were great as well as well as the concierge within the aviary. The concierge walked me through the food as I have allergies and made me feel at ease. Such a beautiful setting and would fully recommend as well as returning. Made me feel incredibly special and welcomed",5,2019,11,16
111,Wow,"Wow the people, the experience i will never forget Andrea was unbelievlable very attentive and caring.
Best hotel in London overall we’ve been to will go back absolutely with many firends and with the family☺️",5,2019,11,15
111,Great location and accommodations ,"I was in London for work but my usual hotels were booked up. Travel agent recommended the Montcalm and I wasn’t disappointed. 

The location is excellent, right in the heart of the City and a few blocks from my office.  There is a nice park right in front of the entrance. Rooms were clean and quiet, and the room rate was very reasonable. 

The best part of the Montcalm is the rooftop bar.  Great view and if it’s cold, there are several of these weird pods that keep you warm.  If you need to stay in the City, this hotel fits the bill. ",5,2019,11,14
111,"Great staff, few minor issues and big let down by the aviary","Firstly I will say the staff in the lobby and reception areas couldn’t do anymore to help you. Upon arrival there is a champagne reception and staff did everything to get us into the room ASAP, even though it wasn’t initially ready.

As for the room itself it was well decorated, but let down by a few things simply not working. One bedside plug socket was broken, a plug socket was broken under the TV and the smaller mirror light was also not working. These may all seem minor, but things like charging your phone next to the bed are pretty normal, and you wouldn’t expect this from a 5 star hotel. In addition, we felt the room was a little on the small side, again... this is minor but all contributes to the overall experience.

We added on the option to have access to the club lounge, this was a nice add on with a variety of drinks/alcohol/spirits. So if you do enjoy a drink you’d make good use of it. However if you aren’t particularly a big drinker, the snacks and canapé’s aren’t that great. 

The biggest let down of our stay was the aviary. We tried to go for breakfast here one morning but experienced nothing but horrendous service, a long wait and finally... no food (or plates) on the breakfast buffet, just one single sausage. Appreciate this might be under different management, however advertising the aviary and it’s roof top views as part of the hotel, make it part of the reason you book. And as such this was a real let down for us. We did mention this to staff and exchanged contact details upon check out to help resolve... but we’re nearly a week later and heard nothing about the compensation that was discussed with the manager.",3,2019,11,14
111,Very pleasant stay,"I keep coming back to the Montcalm because of the wonderful staff including the doorman from Moldova, the concierge from Bulgaria (who arranged my transport to airport) and Mary from reception. Also loved the macarones that Georgiana had delivered to the room.

Only breakfast area in Aviary could use a bit of extra staff to cope with extra guests during peak times...",5,2019,11,14
111,Home away from home!,"I had a wonderful experience staying at the Montcalm Royal London House in the city of London.  I stayed for an extended stay of 5 weeks.  The concierge team headed by Andre was so helpful and sincerely cared to make sure all of my needs were met and offered me help to book tours, day trips and shows.  They truly cared to ask how I was doing and if I needed anything.  The guest services team headed by January Stevens were inviting, friendly and again knew I was working long hours and made sure I had every convenience they could think of to make my stay seem more like my ""home away from home"".  I enjoyed chatting with Alex the doorman.  He chatted and joked with me as if I was a friend and always provided his help to make sure I had an umbrella to keep dry during my travels.  Ricardo and the room service team were attentive and happily delivered my bucket of ice daily.  THANK YOU for making the Montcalm my home away from home for the last 5 weeks.  I will truly miss all of you!!  I can't wait to refer you to my friends, colleagues and family as THE place to stay in London!!!!  See you again someday!!",5,2019,11,14
111,"Amazing visit, 100% recommend.","Recently stayed at the Montcalm Royal House hotel to celebrate a one year anniversary w/ my gf. I have stayed at couple 5 star hotels in london and I must say this hotel has to be one of the best and most pleasant stays I've had. The entire staff was extremely kind and welcoming. The rooms were clean and much bigger than shown in the images. The staff was able to accommodate all the requests promptly. Alina was extremely helpful ! Overall, I would definitely come back and stay at the hotel.",5,2019,11,13
111,Amazing visit.,"I had booked this hotel for a double whammy weekend. My partners birthday and our engagement.  The hotel were so warm and accomadating to all my requests and the guest expereince team worked hard with me to make the weekend perfect. 

On arrival, I was told that they had given a complimentary room upgrade.  Once we gained access to my room, they had decorated the bed with an array of balloons saying happy birthday, delivered a sweet birthday treat and also had a complimentary bottle of prosecco in a bucket on ice waiting for us. 

The room itself is perfect. Bed was very comfy, pillows were lovely and soft, the decision to which was down to us. 

Big bathroom with a luxury shower head.  The room was accompanied with a few extra lovely features, a nescaffe coffee machine with complimentary pods. Sky tv with the full package. Slippers and bath robes etc. 

We had a lovely view from our room aswell. 

We booked a stay well package which entitled us to breakfast ( to which we had delivered to the room) and a treatment in their spa. ( We both opted for a massage. - which was 10/10). 

The hotel has all the features you need for a lovely weekend. A rooftop bar, a spa, a club lounge, a ground floor bar. And a team that will be willing to go the extra mile for you. Very Very impressed.",5,2019,11,12
111,Great hotel in a great location ,"Stayed again at the Montcalm, numerous reasons for picking the Montcalm. The location is superb very near Liverpool Street station, and it has a very secure NCP car park opposite which the hotel gives 50% discount to the charges. The bedrooms are well equipped and very comfortable. There is a lovely bar on the roof with great views of London, the choice of cocktails is huge. On top of all this the service is excellent, the staff are very helpful and professional.

Definitely my first choice of hotel when visiting London",5,2019,11,12
111,great hotel in the city center,we had our company conference in the Brewery and I stayed in the Montcalm Royla London house. it was a fantastic stay and all is very well organized. very friendly welcomed by the buttler and by Mary at the reception. Mary is a very kind and polite pesons who gave me all the explanations of the hotel services. at check out i was helped by Alina who has great service skills. great job to all the staff!!,5,2019,11,12
111,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff","I booked a room at the Montcalm from 8-10 Nov as a surprise for my parents who visited London for my mother’s 60th birthday. Even prior to seeing the hotel in person, I knew that it would be fantastic after speaking with the staff who were both professional and personable. As it was a special celebration, they arranged a surprise of a card, macarons and a lovely bottle of wine upon arrival to the room. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they went above and beyond to make their stay extra special. The hotel was spotless, smelt incredible and was tastefully decorated. Thanks again to all members of staff. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2019,11,12
111,Always a Pleasure,"I travel a tremendous amount for work with the sprinkling of personal travel.  I can truthfully say that my experience at the Montcalm Royal London House is always a pleasure.  It starts from the welcome that I receive at the front door all the way through check-in and check-out.  Every aspect of the service at the hotel is appreciated from the prompt service that cleans and cares of my room, room service (always prompt and helpful), first floor Burdock Cafe (love the morning lattes), to the wonderful staff that brings up my luggage and the quick response when I need a car service.  With the amount of travel I do, it is a rarity to feel so welcomed when I walk in the door.  Instead of feeling like just another hotel, it's a bit like my second home at times.  Overall every level of the staff starting with the management and each individual is exceptional.  I've stayed here for business and leisure.  Both have been truly outstanding.  A huge thank you to the entire team.",5,2019,11,11
111,Fabulous stay for daughters 21st,"Stayed for 2 nights in luxury rooms. Staff couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. Loved the welcome drink, great attention to detail. Facilities in room excellent, beds are so comfy! Special birthday prosecco and macarons a lovely touch! Great breakfast in The Aviary and also ate in Burdock,delicious food. Only slight criticism was the slow service during our Igloo experience. Staff not as attentive as the hotel staff especially considering the cost.  Still a magical experience. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to return.",5,2019,11,10
111,Very relaxing stay,We were spoilt rotten by all the team at Montcalm.  From being greeted with a glass of prosecco to the macaroons and wine in the room as I mentioned it was my wife's birthday.  Pool is incredible and staff genuinely friendly and helpful. ,5,2019,11,10
111,Awesome services,"I’ve stayed to Montcalm 4 nights for a business trip and I can say it was one of the best places I’ve stayed until now. Awesome accomodation conditions and excelent services. The stuff was really great, from checking, to restaurant, spa and checkout. I can only remember Camelia’s name from the stuff but also the others were great. Thanks for everything!",5,2019,11,10
111,1st anniversary and second stay ,"My boyfriend and I have stayed here once before earlier on this year and loved it so much that we wanted to spend our 1st anniversary here. 
We told the staff in advance that it was our anniversary and they upgraded up free of charge to a beautiful large room. 
On arrival, a lovely lady called January sat us down in reception (with a drink of course) while our room was being made up. We were then escorted to our room, which was absolutely amazing. We had a little message and card wishing us a happy anniversary and a lovely bottle of red wine. It was perfect!
The hotel is absolutely beautiful, clean, tidy and well kept. I can’t fault the staff at all, they are all so polite and treated us like royalty on both occasions we have visited. We will most certainly be returning 😁
The location is very central to Shoreditch and many other great places! Would certainly recommend this hotel any day of the week! 
Thank you all again for making our anniversary so special!

111,In London to watch a show and see an exhibition,"We had an overnight stay at the Montcalm.All the staff where extremely pleasant and Mary had an infectious smile ! The room was great, clean and well equipped.We didn't have breakfast but it looked very nice.We will be back again .",5,2019,11,09
111,Third stay," This is the third time I spent the weekend at royal house finsbury. We had something to celebrate and at are arrival I mentioned it to reception and they told me the room would be ready in 1 hour. When we got to the room it was decorated in most beautiful way (see pics attached) and as always all staff from the doorman to the bar restaurant provided excellent service friendliness to gives you the feeling of coming to your family. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and pool which were fantastic! I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for perfection efficiency friendliness and relaxed atmosphere  all staff highly professional and somehow they manage to give you the feeling you are only guest in hotel. Of all the hotels I have stayed in i would rate this hotel more than 5*. 

The concierge Andrei is absolutely fantastic .

Will definitely stay here, when i come back.",5,2019,11,09
111,Andreea (sp),"I'm unsure of the spelling, but she is a front desk concierge, and really set the tone for my stay. Andreea, like the hotel, is excellent. Polite, lovely demeanor, helpful - as are the rest of the Montcalm staff. Excellent staff & fabulous hotel!!",5,2019,11,09
111,Fantastic Hotel and Wonderful Staff! Made a surprise weekend very special!,This hotel is absolutely fantastic and has great rooms and facilities. However it was the staff that made our stay even more special. I recently travelled here for a surprise weekend for my girlfriend. I briefly mentioned this when booking. However when arriving we were treat like royalty and there were so many added touches that made the birthday weekend one to remember. We were greeted by Flavia who was fantastic for the duration of our stay. We were given glasses of champagne on arrival at check-in which was a really nice touch after a long journey. Flavia wished my girlfriend a happy birthday and made her feel very special. Our bags were taken for us and then Flavia showed us to our room and mentioned to myself that there were some added extras provided complimentary for us. There was wine and cake brought to the room and we were given club access as well. All in all a fantastic service and a wonderful stay. I couldn't thank Flavia more and thought she was a truly fantastic ambassador for the hotel.,5,2019,11,08
111,"Excellent hotel, great experience! ","Overall a great experience, everyone working for the hotel has proven to be professional and very kind!

111,Definitely worth a repeat Visit!!!,"Wow, what can I say, right from the doorman to being checked in and ushered to our hotel room. Our experience was nothing short of amazing and thoughtful. Spent the weekend with the Mrs to celebrate her birthday and dare i say we were treated excellently well. Special thanks especially to Flavia and the Guest experience team for making our stay a great one. I will definitely be recommending the hotel to my friends and family!
Keep up the great work Flavia and the entire team.

111,In-sane,"We arrived at Friday night 23.00. We arrived and the door was held open for us, our baggage was taken out of our hands and we were guided To the reception. Kind people welcomed us and moved us to our room which was really insanely luxurious, the only downside : it didn't had a view. Solution : we were immediately told we were going to get upgraded the next morning. And so it began, we slept as angels so nice on the comfy bed, had amazing roomservice (bestburgerintown) and showered gracefully under the rain shower. Then we woke up and had breakfast, good quality overall. We were then being moved to our next room on the top floor of the building, insane view, we even got a bottle of champagne to say sorry for the first night (we even thought the first room was insane but OK, we now have a view as well). All on all, our stay was truly insane. We highly recommend coming here. Thank you Camelia and your personnel for all the care. We will never forget it. Much love, Thomas and Bianca Vugts.",5,2019,11,05
111,Many Thanks,"This was my third visit in last 12 months.

The Montcalm and it’s staff erased those fears!",5,2019,11,04
111,Absolutely superb!,"Got back this evening from a lovely stay at Montcalm.  From the moment we went to check in, the customer service was the best we have experienced in London.  The rooms are excellent with all the mod- cons. It was our anniversary and they left lovely special touches.  We will defo be returning!",5,2019,11,03
111,Amazing hotel,"We booked at this hotel last minute, as we had a voucher to use as a gift for my birthday.

We will come back soon ♥️. Many thanks, Nina & Flavius Videa.",5,2019,11,03
111,Another great stay,"My second time here, and again the service was excellent, room very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

111,Perfect in everyway!!!,"I booked this hotel for my husbands 40th Bday.

From the moment of booking till we left the hotel the communication, and experience was off the scale! January Stevens helped ensure the stay was one to remember.

111,Weekend Stay 19th - 20th of October,"My partner and I decided to treat ourselves to a weekend trip minus the baby down to London for the weekend. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by very friendly doorman who did offer to help us with our bags.

As we checked in we were again welcomed by the lovely January who made us feel really welcome. Not only that but she kindly upgraded our room to a bigger room including ‘Hermes’ toiletries which was a lovely touch. She also kindly added a complimentary breakfast for the next morning which consisted of hot and cold drinks, toast, croissant, hams and cheeses. 

We didn’t spend to much time at the hotel as we were out and about most of the time however when we were there we were treated so well by the staff. I must say everyone on that front desk at reception is very polite and friendly.

The room was spacious, lovely bathroom and with large tv and coffees and teas etc.

Would defiantly stay again. Big thank you to January and her team! Until next time, Ben and Charlotte x",5,2019,10,31

111,AMAZING - Birthday treat for my boyfriend,"We had a fantastic stay here. I would first of all like to thank Dado (the Guest Experience Executive) who helped organise this for me, she went above an beyond to make this a fantastic experience for us. I would also like to thank the lady who checked me in (I can't remember her name but she was lovely and very helpful) and I would also like to thank Mary who checked us out. All in all the stay was amazing. The room was fantastic and spotless, the rooftop bar was excellent - the only thing was that they wouldn't let us in the igloos despite them being empty and the rooftop closing 40 minutes later which was a little disappointing but certainly didn't ruin the evening - the pool and Jacuzzi were great as well. It was our second stay here because we stayed back in January and the customer service has not changed a bit - was outstanding back then and still is now. I would recommend everyone to stay here. Thank you again for our amazing stay! ",5,2019,10,30
111,"Fabulous stay,amazing facilities","I have stayed in this hotel 10 days and I booked through Expedia. My booking had some complications because started the following day but Andreea from the reception helped me in fixing the issue and also provided me an early check-in because she understood I was tired after 10 hours of flight. While she was solving my issues invited me to have a sit and a cappuccino, during my stay was friendly and helpful and all the time that I passed by the reception she smiled asking me if was anything that she could assist me with.
I would highly recommend this hotel for the amazing service received from Andreea that made me feel home and important.",5,2019,10,30
111,Staff is very friendly and professional!,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Montcalm Royal London House for three nights a few days ago (end of October). We were delighted to see how warm, friendly and professional was the staff there, which is really what makes a hotel outstanding. We felt even better than at home! Besides that, the hotel's facilites and views are superior and it is certainly worth staying there if anyone has business in the City of London or wishes to visit the landmarks or any other establishments in the vicinity.",5,2019,10,30

Thank you Andreea for the quickly help provided all the time that we needed during the stay, extend the booking, book a table on the rooftop and so on.

We will be back when we come in London!",5,2019,10,29
111,Excellent service,"Beyond the beautiful hotel with clean, designer details, what really made this hotel ""Excellent"" for me was the service. Alina Stanciu at the front desk made sure I had everything I needed and more at check-in, followed up once I'd gotten settled, and then again partway through my 8-night stay in case there was anything else she could do to make the stay welcoming and comfortable. What fantastic customer service! I visit London for work a few times a year, and the Montcalm Royal London House is my new go-to hotel for future visits. Thanks Alina!

111,Superb birthday visit,"Stayed here weekend of 20th October 2019. My husband and I stayed here for a birthday London trip.  Upon check in we were taken care of by Camelia who upgraded us to a suite upon hearing it was my hubby’s birthday.  We had our luggage taken to our room and were shown around the suite where everything.  Shortly after settling in a knock at the door brought a surprise from the hotel of Prosecco, Chocs and macaroons which we were so thrilled about and felt thoroughly spoiled.  We went down and used the pool and spa which were lovely.  In the evening we had an excellent meal in the rooftop restaurant and took in the views from the rooftop bar.  The hotel was impeccably clean and the service from every member of staff was the best we have experienced even  thought it a nice touch when the doorman went and got us an umbrella to take out with us for our walk as it was raining.  We will most definitely be back to visit this hotel soon.  Thank you for a wonderful visit.",5,2019,10,28
111,"Superb hotel, comfortable beds, large room, staff and service faultless","From the moment we arrived we were really looked after by the staff. They could not have been more helpful. The bedroom was really comfortable. We had a basement room so no view but it was night time and tipping down with rain so we hardly missed that. Towelling robes, large screen TV and an extremely comfortable bed made it a  great place to rest for the night and I seriously enjoyed my lie-in the next morning! My only slight problem was the tablet-based control for the air conditioning, bathroom lighting etc. It kept failing and rebooting itself, so in the middle of the night this was a bit of an inconvenience when I just wanted to use the bathroom! I'd rather just use a switch by the door, honestly! I am sure if it works well it is very smart. We didn't eat or drink here because we were booked into Galvin's La Chapelle in Smithfields, but would like to come back to use the rooftop bar in less inclement weather in future. I would defnitely come back to this hotel again if we were staying in this part of London.",5,2019,10,28
111,Review,"My partner took me here to celebrate my birthday and this wasn't mentioned into the booking. Everything was amazing, the room was extremely clean, spacious and the bed was very comfortable.
A special thank you goes to Andreea which was lovely and really helpful for all our stay, from the beginning when we had some issues with the payment and also a duplicated booking by mistake. She also upgraded our room as it was a special occasion, presented the hotel with all the facilities and opening time and even when we called her for extra help she was incredibly kind. She was really friendly,  communicative and really  attentive in sorting out the issues.

We were treated like VIPs from the moment we arrived - prosecco on arrival, luggage taken to our room, enormous TVs and all the mod cons in the room, delicious continental breakfast and a 12pm checkout! Our only complaint was the sofa bed wasn’t very comfortable! Thank you for a lovely stay and to all the staff - including Mary at reception - for making us feel so welcome!",5,2019,10,27
111,Great stay!,"We have just returned from a fantastic stay at the Montcalm Royal London house. From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out the experience was really positive and all the staff were extremely welcoming. Lovely little touches and a very personal experience. A special mention must go to January, the duty manager, who manages to strike the perfect balance between being warm, welcoming, thoughtful and professional. We will definitely",5,2019,10,27
111,Amazing,"My partner took me here to celebrate my birthday.  Everything was amazing, the room was extremely clean, spacious and the bed was very comfortable. All the staff members were  extremely helpful and attentive. I would highly recommend!",5,2019,10,26
111,excellent service at outstanding hotel,"The Montcalm hotels in general holds a very high standard, but the one at Finsbury Square is on top of the list. We have made this our main hub for London with many visits over the last year. It's the combination of being on the ""roof"" of City with high personal service on all levels that appeal to us. Especially thanks to Camelia, front desk manager. Her attention to details throughout the stay show guests that staff make an extra effort on all levels. The Hotel roof top bar is an oasis in City and the rooms are very comfy and clean.",5,2019,10,25
111,Danny provided an outstanding service!,"Danny (Daniel), who works at the front desk of the Hotel, was nothing less than amazing. He provided me with the most wonderful service I have ever received in any hotel I have ever stayed in before. Every time I had a question no matter how small, he took care of it immediately and in the most professional way there could be. Danny is a person who made me feel at home during a work trip that was not easy to handle (because of the long work hours I had during my stay in London) and that is something anyone would value immensely. The Montcalm Royal London House is lucky to have someone like Danny working for them, someone who goes beyond their work duties, who works tirelessly to provide the highest service standard in the hotel industry and who takes care of the guests as if the Hotel was his own house. Any hotel that has the fortune to have Danny as part of their work team has a valuable asset that is not easy to replace and should never be replaced. Danny made my stay at the Montcalm Royal London House just wonderful!

PS. If I could give the Montcalm Royal London House more stars just for having Danny as part of their staff I would :)",5,2019,10,23
111,Amazing birthday weekend - thank you Flavia!,"Me and my husband stayed at this hotel recently for my birthday. We were greeted by the lovely staffs at the front desk and after checking-in, we were met by Flavia who showed us our room. After realising it's my birthday, she had made sure we had a very special stay with lots of lovely extra touches. We were extremely well looked after by Flavia and the amazing staffs, nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was extremely beautiful and comfortable, just wish we could stay for another few nights! We look forward to returning for another special occasion in the future!",5,2019,10,21
111,Comfiest bed ever!!!,"Had a lovely night stay here this weekend, beautiful views from the rooftop bar. Lovely rooms immaculate and super comfy beds!
Decent tea and coffee making facilities and the staff cannot do enough for you
Breakfast was lovely. Good selection and excellent quality! 
Will be back.
Thank you",5,2019,10,21
111,The most amazing hotel with outstanding staff,"The best service I have ever received at a hotel, from the moment we arrived. The staff were incredible friendly and helpful. Me and my boyfriend were staying for my birthday which they was not aware of until they asked if we was celebrating anything. we was given two glasses of Prosecco and offered to use the club lounge whenever we wanted. we was taken to the room by the most wonderful friendly staff. Once we saw our room we called reception to see if they had any rooms with baths. Without another question the guest experience manager came and spoke to us to see what she called dado, she was absolutely amazing and couldn't have been more pleasant and wonderful to her.

She upgraded our room instantly, we was taken to the most AMAZING room I have ever stayed it. with a filled fridge and a bottle of Prosecco delivered to our door we felt like royalty, Dado was absolutely fabulous and have never been made to feel so welcome throughout our stay.

we only stayed the one night, we didn't want to leave. we spent the next afternoon in the spa with was beautiful, very clean and well maintained facilities.

Before leaving, dado offered us to again use the club facilities.
Our overall stay was absolutely spectacular, all the staff were extremely helpful but doda couldn't do any more for us and she really made our stay and my birthday so thank you all very much!!

I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, 5 stars all around!!",5,2019,10,20
111,Best anniversary EVER.,"I'm usually too lazy to write reviews but this time I would feel guilty not to. I have booked a room for me and my boyfriend just for one night and the experience was perfect from the moment we walked in to the one when we left (really sad moment btw). At the check-in with Estafania, we got offered two champagne glasses. Then we followed Flavia to our amazing deluxe double room. When we told her it was our anniversary she kindly gave free access to the afternoon drinks and canapes,  free breakfast for the following day and some macaroons (which sadly I couldn't eat but I felt too bad to say that).
We spent the afternoon in the free swimming pool and jacuzzi and despite being a Saturday afternoon it wasn't packed of people and we had a wonderful time. In the evening we checked out the lovely rooftop. Meanwhile the following morning we had a continental breakfast buffet and I was happily surprised to find a lot of dairy-free options.

The service was impeccable, everybody was smiling and ready to help. 
We honestly felt so welcomed and pampered throughout the whole experience and I would definitely recommend it even for one night.

PS: Big Kudos for the bed, which was literally heaven.
PS 2: Thank you again to Flavia and Estefania!",5,2019,10,20
111,The BEST birthday weekend!,"I’m just on my way back from the most gorgeous birthday weekend ever, thanks to this beautiful hotel and the incredible hospitality. 
We arrived yesterday afternoon greeted with a glass of Proseco, the lovely receptionist Estefania asked if we were here for a special occasion. I told her it was my birthday weekend, she instantly replied back saying she will upgrade our room for the occasion. I was so grateful to her, as we did not expect anything extra but what we got was 10x more than I could of imagined. 
An equally lovely lady called Flavia then greeted us, with our room key. Flavia then escorted us to our room, while doing so she told us our breakfast in the morning would be complimentary (feeling even more grateful at this point). As we reached the 9th floor Flavia showed us to our room. WOW. Room 915 was incredible, my jaw instantly hit the floor. Spectacular views greeted us and we wondered around our suite, two beautiful bathrooms, a gigantic kingside bed and a bottle of prosecco (on ice) were just a few things that took my breath away. I couldn’t believe we were being treated to such luxury that I had to give Flavia the biggest hug. 
My partner and I leisurely got ready to go for birthday drinks and had a lovely evening with friends. Merrily we arrived back at the hotel around 3am, we ordered room service which was really tasty and caught up on Strictly (both televisions had full package sky boxes) it was lush!
Breakfast was delicious, freshly squeezed orange juice and homemade sour dough bread, went down a treat. As we were checking out, we mentioned we would of liked to have used the Spa facilities. Within seconds Flavia called downstairs and ordered us two bathrobes incl slippers and we made our way to the Spa! 
We spent a couple of hours lounging by the beautiful pool and jacuzzi, then headed to the steam room and sauna. Bliss. 
What a weekend. 

I hope from reading this review you can clearly see the thought, love and care that went into making my birthday the best one yet. Thank you so much Estefania and Flavia, the smile you gave me hasn’t left my face! You went above and beyond for me, I can’t thank you enough. 

We will most definitely be back!",5,2019,10,20
111,Great hotel ,"We stayed for two nights as a celebration for my partners birthday and this hotel did not disappoint. We were greeted by lovely staff, glass of bubbly whilst checking in. Our room was a good size very modern and had more than everything we needed. Breakfast served in the aviary was lovely, very well done and delicious!! The spa area was lovely and relaxing it does get a bit busy considering it’s not the biggest pool area but not an issue. We will definitely be back again as the hotel is so central, has a couple of bars to have a drink in and relax, the views from the rooftop are amazing! ",5,2019,10,20
111,Great location with excellent service,"I stayed here for three nights on a hectic business trip. Totally enjoyed myself. Staff was super helpful. I was checking in after coming off a 12 hour flight. There was an issue with my credit card and found out my room reservation had been cancelled. But Miguel at reception helped resolve it so that I could check into the room immediately, settle in quickly before heading off to work.  

Thanks Miguel!",5,2019,10,18
111,Five stars are not enough,"I had the pleasure to stay at this beautiful hotel a week ago when I was visiting London with my boyfriend for his birthday. We got from Heathrow to Liverpool Street by tube and then walked not even 5 minutes from the station to the hotel. The check-in was warm and quick (go Gennaro!!) and we immediately got the news they gave us a free upgrade! The room itself was to die for; wonderful view of the square, giant flat screen tv, enormous shower, clean and modern design, delicious tea and coffee and the bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever lied on. Since it was my boyfriend's birthday they were so kind as to put balloons all over the bed and offered us complimentary dessert, fruits and wine. Honestly, I've never been pampered that much and this is also why I will do my very best to go back as soon as I can!

PS: Never seen leaving Vogue magazine in rooms to read, as a big fan of the publication I couldn't appreciate that more

THANK YOU for a wonderful stay",5,2019,10,18
111,Great experience,Spent a night in this hotel during my business trip and I really enjoyed my stay. Had luxury room and beautifull view. Staff was really kind and helpfull. Special thanks to receptionist Alina for warm welcome as well as good bye :),5,2019,10,17
111,Weekend Trip With Friends,"I stayed in the Montcalm Royal London House for 2 nights with 2 of my closest friends! We were really excited after reading previous reviews but we felt a little left down at different points during our stay! At check-in, staff were somewhat uphelpful, they seemed more interested in chatting among themselves. Also at checkout, we had to request a bill breakdown 3 times before getting it. Reception staff definitely need to work on manners as everyone else we came across in the hotel were lovely, especially the doormen who were very helpful at all times. The rooms were lovely and spacious, with comfortable beds. The only downfall of the bedrooms are the touchscreens that operate the AC/Lighting, etc. They are unresponsive quite a lot of the time and look slightly battered from overuse. Overall, we had a nice stay in this hotel but there is definitely room for improvement.",3,2019,10,16
111,The Perfect Hotel! 10/10.,"Had the most incredible time visiting the Montcalm Hotel Royal London House. The front of house team were so polite and welcoming, the night Manager Ken was exceptional. He gave us a complimentary upgrade as it was a special occasion and made us feel so special. He is a credit to the team! 

They have something for everyone from craft beers, great views of the city and dining options for everyone. My partner and I had a relaxed beer in Burdock and played the Shuffleboard. The young lady who was the floor Manager recommended the wine & the linguini, I must say it was delicious and complemented the dish really well. 

We went upstairs to enjoy a cocktail on the roof top and enjoyed the astonishing views of the skyline. The room we stayed in has its own private balcony and the room met all our expectations. Breakfast was beautiful and the service we received was fantastic. My partner had the buffet and I chose the a la carte. There was plenty to choose from and I would recommend the Brioche French toast, crispy bacon, maple syrup, cinnamon sugar!

If you are looking for somewhere special to go this is certainly the place.",5,2019,10,16
111,An absolutely wonderful stay,"I absolutely loved staying in this hotel. booking.com had slightly messed me around, and when I arrived I was a bit upset. They took incredibly good care of me, and spoiled me due to the booking.com mix up. Alina on reception was so incredibly friendly, and all the staff were so accomodating. They even gave me a free upgrade for my troubles (even though they weren't responsible for them). The room was absolutely stunning, with a beautiful view, and the bed was honestly possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! The location is perfect, and the upstairs restaurant is absolutely stunning (the views, the food and the service). All communications with the hotel since have been excellent, with Flavia helping me with various things. I travel to London for work frequently and there is no question that I will be back. Jess x",5,2019,10,14
111,Weekend in London,The hotel was such a beautiful hotel.  Little restaurants around. It is located near the metro station which is very handy.  Room service was was a1.  They have a really lush pool so don’t forget to bring your swimsuit.  Rooftop bar with such an amazing view.  I highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely be staying here again when I go back to London.,4,2019,10,14
111,Superb ,From the moment we arrived and the doorman opened the door the whole experience was fantastic.    Reception noted it was our wedding anniversary and wife’s birthday weekend.    The room was fabulous could not not complain about anything.   A lovely complimentary collection of soft drinks and chocolates.  Every single member of staff we encountered was smiling and superb.   Breakfast on 10th floor has a massive selection and with views over London is a tad expensive but being a buffet not a problem.     Great tube links   3 min walk to Moorgate or 5 min to Liverpool St     Will be staying there again ,5,2019,10,14
111,Weekend break,"Our stay at the Montcalm was very enjoyable. The staff were very warming and attentive and our room was comfortable, clean and modern with a lovely view. 
It is within close distance of most of London’s main attractions which is great.
As this was a mini-moon the hotel staff left us a bottle of Prosecco in our room free of charge which was a nice gesture. I’d definitely recommend staying here and will be returning. ",5,2019,10,13
111,Memorable Experience,"Our experience at Montcalm cannot he described any less than amazing. The staff are very friendly and professional and give you priority as soon as you walk in. We are return guests to this hotel and we wouldn’t choose anywhere else to stay. Husband and I loved it.  Thank you once again Ms Stevens and the staff for such a memorable time. Definitely recommending.

111,One night stay ,A great stay at The Montcalm great spot for Spitalfields. The service from all staff was outstanding so rare these days. Front bar was fun and upstairs Aviary Restaurant was bustling great atmosphere and food and service excellent. Front desk v helpful thanks Miguel ,5,2019,10,13
111,Sky,"Booked with this hotel my boyfriends 21st let them know I wanted to have some extras and they sorted everything out for me without a fuss! Lovely staff and great service! The room was big and the beds are very very comfy! If you want a hotel near central London around a quiet area, this is the hotel for you. The rooftop is something you do not want to miss!",5,2019,10,13
111,Outstanding ,"5 star service! Rooms were amazing and also the staff were very welcoming and went above and beyond to make sure my partners birthday celebration was one to remember. 

Highly recommend to anyone visiting London!",5,2019,10,12
111,Best Hotel to date !,"Me and my partner stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House this weekend for 2 nights and we both agree it is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff on reception could not have been more helpful and welcoming, the door men too, and most importantly the cleaners who certainly fulfill there jobs. Our room was spotless our whole stay, bathroom and kitchen facility re-stocked, overall perfect. The spa facilities where fabulous too and the rooftop bar made our stay even more enjoyable. We cannot wait to return and stay 3 nights in an upgraded suite to which should hopefully be in a few months !
We look forward to visiting again.",5,2019,10,12
111,Very good,"First time staying here, location was very convenient for my office at Bishopsgate. Room was clean and modern, and a good size for London standards. Room was nicely fitted out - very large tv, lots of places to charge mobile devices, etc - very modern design. Very friendly staff. A few things I did not like - I think there was a gym but there was no information in the room about where in the hotel it was. Some of the movie channels were pin protected - but no information about where to find the pin. And one day housekeeping removed the tv remote control from the room and I had to ask for a replacement.

Overall a good stay but some improvement needed before worthy of five stars. ",4,2019,10,09
111,Thank you so much for a wonderful stay :),"This review is especially for January Stevens the Duty Manager who went over and above anything l have ever experienced when visiting a hotel (and l do travel extensively) to ensure l had a wonderful stay. I can only apologise for not writing it sooner.

The Montcalm Royal London House is a beautiful and majestic hotel to stay in, with lovely rooms, in the heart of the Capital- with a wonderful roof top bar which is a bit like a nightclub in the sky at the weekend. l would live here if l could afford to! Anyway, l digress...

On arrival l was greeted by a friendly door man who took my case to reception. At reception l was greeted warmly- l have stayed here before but this time l’d booked through their own ‘club’ which you can join via their website and gives you exclusive discounts. There was home made lemonade and Prosecco being offered to guests on check in (and also at check out).

January looked after me marvellously throughout my stay. She gave me an up grade, a lie in and a free breakfast, she also took me to my room personally, she was wonderfully warm, friendly, kind and conscientious. It was a fabulous experience- Thank you January- l do hope to see you soon!",5,2019,10,09
111,Nice and clean,The room is clean and comfortable. I love the walk in shower too. Its been a good number of years since I've been here. Had a meal in the restaurant Nearly hotel superb service thank you so much......,4,2019,10,08
111,Honeymooners,"Such a beautiful hotel with great touches and interior. Myself and husband stayed here for 2 nights for and our honeymoon and we enjoyed our time ever much. The staff went above and beyond here from the time we arrived until we left always offering assistance or just greeting us. A very special thank you to January Stephens at the front desk for making our honeymoon special with the small things that you did, you went above and beyond and made our stay such a pleasant experience. Thank you we will definitely be back.",5,2019,10,08
111,Anniversary Visit,"Absolutely fantastic place to stay. Great location, great food and fantastic facilities. The staff were very welcome upon arrival and pulled out all the stops to ensure we had a great weekend. 

We will definitely be back.

This will now be my number 1 London hotel!",5,2019,10,07
111,Excellent Hotel,Excellent attention from the doorman to the reception. The rooms are beautiful clean just amazing. I must say BRAVO to whoever is in charge of the hospitality. Always someone available to help you with anything. Thank you 🙏,5,2019,10,07
111,Lovely hotel,"Lovely room, check in was smooth with polite and professional service. The room was nice, and the bed especially comfortable.  The spa was nice, although the receptionist made a bit of a fuss because we didnt arrive with our robes on (we were fully dressed as we had been for breakfast); I'm not sure why this was such an issue, but my friend felt obliged to retrieve them for us all from our rooms.  I'd have given the hotel a five if it wasnt for that and the fact that our room key wasnt extended in line with our late check out, meaning we were stranded outside our room with only our robes on!!  This could of been better, but the hotel itself was nice. ",4,2019,10,06
111,Mixed feelings,After my last stay was really looking forward to this but even with a club room booking wasn’t too happy with my room. On the 1st floor right at the back in a corner with each morning being woken up by staff and trolleys guess given my only window overlooked that space. Back after a 2 day again stayed for 1 day and got a lovely room this time. The staff here are however a class apart very helpful and extremely nice. Even helped with storing my luggage whilst I flew out and back. Will definitely be back just hoping for a better room.,4,2019,10,06
111,Highly recommend!!,We had a great stay at Montcalm. Room was just beautiful with the most amazing shower. We were greeted by extremly friendly staff on the doors before we even entered the building. The desk staff were equally incredible making us feel very welcomed and appreciated. The hospitality felt so personal i cannot wait to stay again ! Even got walked to our room. Thank you for a wonderful visit,5,2019,10,06
111,Excellent Service and Hotel,"As unbelievable as it sounds every time I visit the Montcalm the experience is better than the last.  ALL members of staff are extremely pleasant, friendly, helpful, courteous and professional at all times.  The hotel and rooms are 5+ Star.  Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,10,04
111,Lovely quiet hotel,"We stayed on a long weekend in London at this hotel. Room was comfortable and relaxing and despite its location it is very quiet.

Staff were helpful and courteous and really couldn’t do enough for us. 

If we are back in London for either business or pleasure this will certainly be our hotel of choice, perfect!",5,2019,10,04
111,Simply the Best,"I've been to this hotel quite a few times now and its simply the best luxury hotel in this price bracket. 

The staff are amazing, friendly and warm. From the doorman I think his name is Spasi, to the front of house person called Georgina I felt very welcome.

The food and drinks are all first class and the interior design is plush is 5 star. 

Oh and don't get me started on the roof top bar, what a nice vibe it has there.

The cleanliness is second to none and I can't wait to go back there again. 

One more thing the duty manager Camelia always makes sure that all her clients are well looked after and that my stay goes beyond expectations. So a big thank you to her.

Thank you again Montcalm Royal London, I hope to see you all again in the near future.",5,2019,10,04
111,Amazing!,This is our second time at the Royal London House and it was even better than the first time. Our flight from America landed early in the morning and Camelia was so kind and helpful to let us check in early which meant we could rest. Daniel from the concierge desk is such an asset to your hotel. He gave recommendations for lunch and dinner which were both great. He was so professional and friendly throughout our stay and on departure he even walked us to the doors with our luggage and hoped he’d see us again. We couldn’t recommend this place enough and look forward to returning again.,5,2019,10,01
111,Fabulous service and hotel,"Experienced probably the best customer service at this Montcalm, the guest experience manager January went above and beyond in making us feel welcome and comfortable. Easily my first choice hotel in London going forward.",5,2019,10,01
111,"Stunning Hotel, Incredible Staff","The hotel was stunning with a modern feel. On arrival we we're upgraded and given a free bottle of Prosecco as a welcome gift. The staff were incredible, offering an amazing level of service beyond anything I've seen before.",5,2019,09,30
111,CLASSY,"From the welcome at the entrance to the Prosecco given at check-in, the Montcalm exudes class and polish. The service was top drawer, and all the employees were very friendly and warm. Our rooms were nicely sized and well appointed. All functions (think heat/air, lights, bathroom floor tile, etc.) were controlled electronically on a wall pad. We were there for 3 nights and loved every minute of it.",5,2019,09,29
111,Great Service,"I visited in July. Arrived in the night so didn’t get a proper view of the hotel. I had a room were the view wasn’t that great and was able to change in the morning. What I love about this place is their professionalism, customer service and their ability to put their guest first and rectify concerns.
The manager Alex Stroie was absolutely amazing. When I explained to him the type of room I was looking for, he immediately got staff on board to prepare a couple rooms. He gave a realistic timing to return  while I spent some time on the rooftop bar. I also had complementary Prosecco and treats in the room. 
On checkin out, I joined their guest club. Hoping to visit soon with my children. Alex was able to also recommend packages they can arrange to explore London. 
The pool area was small but lovely. The rooftop bar was breathtaking. It was perfect for the London heat.",5,2019,09,29
111,Absolute luxury ,What an amazing hotel. Ten out of ten! Last night we sat in the club bar and enjoyed complimentary drinks and cnapes included in our room price.This morning we went for a swim in the pool and then indulged in the hot tub. Followed by a delicious buffet continental breakfast. The room was spacious and spotless. Most importantly ALL the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Andreea served us at the reception and was a lovely young lady; friendly and cheerful.  We enjoyed our 30th wedding anniversary in the most luxurious way. We are definitely returning.  ,5,2019,09,29
111,Great Staff!,"Very welcoming staff and was my room was upgraded either due to having to wait for a room or having stayed at The Montcalm previously. Special shout out to Dada who was extremely helpful going out of her way to attend to me when some of the underground lines were closed on Sunday 22nd Sept.
All good, excellent housekeeping promptly bringing me extra water on request.
Highly recommend, but for me it is the staff that make it so memorable.",5,2019,09,29
111,Brilliant Attention To Detail,"I had organised my wife’s 50th Birthday Party last weekend at Montcalm London House and I must say it was a great experience.

I had planned it with the full cooperation of Michael the Duty Manager who I must say has probably been the best person I have ever dealt with at any hotel I have stayed in (and that’s a lot!).

Michael, in the month build up to the event was very quick to organise all the rooms I reserved for my wife’s friends and family members and was very quick to respond to my emails (of which there were quite a few) due to the important nature of my wife’s 50th. Noting could go wrong and it didn’t.

We had 50 guests and all of them were very impressed with Michael and his welcoming team.

The function was held at The Aviary Glass Box which was again organised to perfection.

If anyone staying in London requires to be professionally treated and feel welcomed you need to be staying at this hotel. I have stayed at other Montcalm Hotels in London but this by far has been the best one, mainly because of the actions of Michael.

Thank you and I have stayed here again today just 4 days later!!!

Paul Stanger",5,2019,09,26
111,Great place,"I absolutely love the hotel, my second time staying and it was just fabulous! 
I had a bit more time to enjoy the facility’s now,  fantastic Spa and gym facilities! 
And the rooftop bar is incredible! Dado one of the staff members was very helpful and took the time to give me some good recommendations and find my way around! 
Thank you, and see you a next time!",5,2019,09,25
111,Wonderful atmosphere and very friendly and professional staff,"As a guest you feel very welcome at the Montcalm, checkin/checkout. Rooms modern and very comfortable and, not to forget, very nice rooftop restaurant and terrace with great service. I felt everyone in the hotel was very much focused on making me feel welcome. ",5,2019,09,25
111,Miss Thomson,"· From the moment we arrived in our cab outside we were greeted with an umbrella as it was really raining when we arrived. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our room wasn’t quite ready so they brought us a beautiful tray of tea while we waited. Andrei at the concierge was amazing he helped us to book and pay for a last minute show “Thriller” it was amazing a definite must see. He even went to extra lengths of printing our tickets out for us. Every member of staff we came across we’re so polite, pleasant and NOTHING was too much trouble. We will def be back st some point we highly recommend this hotel and all of it facilitates. The melody spa was amazing too we came away as it was my partners 40th and the treatments we had were amazing. We had such a great stay so thank u all very much.
 · It was all amazing really the only thing I would say is there’s not many beds in the pool area and the ones that were there had towels reserving them and they weren’t being used. It wasn’t a problem tho we just moved the towels to one side to use them as we wanted to chill and read.",5,2019,09,23
111,Partner's birthday made perfect,"We visited last week after a theatre trip and the stay was wonderful. The hotel made some additional preparations for my partner's birthday, which made the stay even more enjoyable. The room was not ready when I checked-in (early), but when we arrived later, our luggage had been sent to the room already.

We had club breakfast, which in the Aviary was beautiful. The staff were welcoming and accommodating, the food was wonderful and the view from the roof terrance in the morning was gorgeous.

I've stayed here a few times now and I find it rather difficult to find fault with the hotel. The guest experience staff are so accommodating and can't do enough to make sure the stay is as you'd expect.

Thank you for a great time and thank you for making my partner's birthday so lovely.",5,2019,09,23
111,10/10 for Customer Service!!!,"We arrived for a family wedding weekend @ The Montcalm Royal London House we made a mistake and thought this was the hotel we booked into however it was their sister hotel 5 minutes away. Family members were in this hotel therefore we would prefer to stay here in the end as they had already checked in. January the receptionist arranged a refund from sister hotel and re booking at this hotel...all we had to do was sit in their very modern comfortable reception area sipping complimentary Prosecco (tea/coffee and minerals were on offer too). 
We were upgraded to a suite which was great for getting ready for the wedding and complimentary continental style breakfast was added for both my Husband and I and our family friends so that we could eat together.
From the moment we arrived January and staff were outstanding, professional welcoming and could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.
The location for us(non londoners!!!) was fabulous very close to underground and even though we were central London the square area outside the hotel made it feel less urban!!!
Our family friends ate in hotel bar ( we had pre- booked family meals for the wedding party) they said food was fab! Roof top terrace is busy but great buzz and great for a pre dinner drink:)
I cannot recommend this place enough !!!I will definitely be back or to their sister hotels in the future.",5,2019,09,23
111,Excellent hotel near many key offices,"I have stayed in this hotel for 4 times in the past 3 years. I travel often to London for work in Ropemaker street. Location of this hotel is very convenient as it is a short walk to work and to Tube stations. There are plenty of restaurants and bars near by. Their brewery in ground floor is a very good after work hangout place. Rooms are very spacious, fittings are modern, staff are courteous. Last time when I visited them, I left my passport and laptop in the taxi cab. The staff there were very helpful in tracing them back. A big shout out to Nicoleta for her help during this. Keep up the good work Montcalm!",5,2019,09,23
111,Birthday getaway made even more special!,"Booked a room with Montcalm for my wife's birthday. Wanted to treat her to a spa experience but decided to stay the night too. The place has exceeded all expectations. the rooms are very clean, cool and just stunning. We had our 3yr old with us who also got a small gift and a teddy! She was so happy. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. They will not disappoint! Kudos to January Stevens. She has gone the extra mile to make us feel very special. Thanks again for the wonderful experience. We will never forget it.",5,2019,09,22

111,Lovely anniversary stay,"Just home after a wonderful 1 night stay at this gorgeous hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted by concierge who were happy to take our cases and escort us to reception. At reception we were handed with a glass of Prosecco each whilst we waited to check in. There were plenty of staff at the desk so we did not wait very long at all before being greeted by the lovely Camelia who checked us in. We had previously advised the hotel that we were staying for our wedding anniversary so we were over the moon when camelia told us we had been upgraded to a suite and she had added breakfast to our booking!! Concierge took our bags and showed us to our beautiful suite, there was a plate of fruit and some macaroons waiting for us. The room was lovely, very large with a small kitchenette with fridge and mini bar, bathrobes, slippers and Hermes toiletries. Once we were settled we headed up to the aviary for a drink, we were so lucky that it was a beautiful day, it was very busy on the rooftop bar so there was nowhere to sit but there was a great atmosphere and we enjoyed taking in the sights. We went for a stroll in the local area and we were a little disappointed that the area didn’t seem to have a lot to offer, most shops/ restaurants were closed (sat afternoon) there seems to be building works everywhere so I think in a few years time it will be bustling. It seems the roof top bar is the only place to be as this is also open to the public, when we returned from our walk people were queuing to go up to the rooftop. Location wise it’s only a few stops on the tube to the busier areas of the city. Breakfast was lovely with the usual continental offerings plus bacon, sausages, beans, scrambled egg, mushrooms, tomatoes, toast, cereals, pastries, fresh juice. Check out was friendly and hassle free with concierge offering to take our bags and call us a taxi. The staff all seemed to be happy and genuinely cared about your stay and couldn’t do enough for us. Next time we will definitely stay for longer as I would have liked to have tried the well-being centre and pool. Thank you Montcalm for a fabulous stay :0)",5,2019,09,22

111,Superb Hotel and Staff,"We have now stayed at this Hotel 6 times and I can honestly say it is the best I’ve stayed in. We first stayed for our first Wedding Anniversary and loved it so much that we vowed to spend every anniversary there. The Hotel itself is modern and beautiful. The staff are outstanding and will pull out every stop to ensure you are happy. Our last stay in September 2019 we were looked after by the Guest Experience Manager called January. She was absolutely lovely and made us feel so special. 

The Montcalm Royal London House does an amazing job! 
Thank you and see you soon!",5,2019,09,22
111,Great hotel,"Really enjoyable stay, well presented and kept hotel. Really like the lobby space where you can eat and get coffee on one side, and the other is a nice bar area for drinks. Balcony apace upstairs used for conference reception drinks, great views of the Square. Recommended",5,2019,09,20
111,Top notch in every way,"I stayed here recently when on business, as my other half was in town and we decided to stay somewhere both central to Moorgate and a bit more upmarket.  Oh my goodness, we could not have been more delighted.  We were allocated a (huge) junior suite, the bed was enormous and comfy, the toiletries were amazing, and the breakfast was brilliant (although it's in the upstairs restaurant called The Aviary - if you're not a fan of dead birds, do NOT go there).  We really couldn't have asked for more.",5,2019,09,20
111,Excellent service delivery,"Stayed over night to celebrate my wife's birthday. Staff was very accommodating and service was 5 star. The room was nicely decorated and there was a serious attention to detail, a bottle of bubbly was waiting for us along with some nice treats. The view was excellent and room was clean. Breakfast on the roof was very nice and the staff were also polite and helpful. Will definitely recommend to friends and colleagues and I look forward to coming back again.",5,2019,09,18
111,The most fantastic weekend,"Just come back from a fabulous weekend here.  It was my husband's birthday and our anniversary the hotel did everything to make it so special.

111,Mountcalm  Royal Delivered Excellence,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay and had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The staff were excellent and went above and beyond to cater for our every need. A lovely adjoining room was arranged for us on our arrival as we were a party of 4 celebrating a special birthday.We also receive a complimentary breakfast each day in the lovely rooftop restaurant, as we had to wait a short time until our rooms were ready due to the switch. We were made to feel that nothing was too much effort. Many thanks to Dada and all the hotel staff for making this a very special stay.",5,2019,09,17
111,Exceptional service,"I have stayed over the weekend with few friends. The hotel is amazing with its perfect location. However what I found exceptional there is service. Staff was very friendly and helpful and made is feel very welcome. Daniel in concierge helped to find (and book) a hairdresser and a table for a dinner which is not easy last minute on Friday night and for 6 people.
All the staff were very attentive.
Definitely one of the best stays ever!",5,2019,09,16
111,Fabulous hotel,"This was a return visit to this wonderful hotel for myself, this time with my husband, and we were made to feel like old friends.

A special thanks to January Stevens for the extra touches that made our stay one to remember.  We will definitely return.",5,2019,09,16
111,"Excellent - efficient, clean and friendly","We have just stayed at the Royal London for three nights as part of a belated anniversary and the experience from the welcome, concierges and check in staff through to the room and facilities was excellent and well managed. Michal, January and all the staff were helpful and efficient and the assistance before we arrived in making sure we had a quite room as requested in our booking dialogue was clearly acted upon. My wife used the pool each day and reported that to be excellent, as was the view from the Aviary bar! The location for us was also ideal as it's a ten minute stroll to Liverpool Street station and the delights of the markets and brick lane etc or for access to the underground network to get around the rest of London. We have been fortunate enough to stay in some of the best hotels both in London and throughout the world and this was as good as some of the 'best' and better than most!",5,2019,09,16
111,More than Great!,"Dear Team of Montcalm Royal Londin House,
many thanks for these great 3 days we spent in your house.
Starting with a really  friendly check in we started our trip to London, The club rooms

Thanks for all especially by Mrs January!! Best Greatings from me an my son. M& M",5,2019,09,16
111,One of London's best kept secrets,"Having stayed at many of London's 4 & 5 star hotels I was expecting a pretty normal hotel... Wow how wrong could I have been.  I added a note on my booking to advise the hotel it was my wife's 50th birthday not really expecting anything other than clean, pleasant stay.  What a surprise the staff upon arrival were friendly, attentive and nothing seemed to much of an issue. Our room was upgraded to a junior suite but wasn't quite ready so we were led into a club lounge where we were provided with complimentary drinks and snacks until it was... Great start! Within 10 mins we were taken to our room where we were then greeted with rose petals spread in the bathroom and over the bed in a heart shape, a tray of treats with Happy Birthday written in chocolate! Now that's not the norm! The room was lovely, well spec'd and exceptionally clean.  The Aviary bar on the 10th floor provides a lovely space to have a drink and take in the views of the city.  There are 2 further bars downstairs and all of this within spitting distance of Liverpool Street! This has to be one of my best stays in London and we will definitely return!",5,2019,09,16
111,Highest standard of room and service possible...,"The Montcalm Royal London House is certainly a 5 star experience. We booked the Montcalm as a base whilst moving across London. The quality of rooms and service exceeded our expectations.
On arrival, I was welcomed and ushered to the check in area, front of house staff immediately offering to take suitcases. A whole bank of check in desks awaited me - no lengthy wait to be checked in. Monica and colleague efficiently booked me in.
Our room was fully modern, good sized, with plush carpet, very comfortable bed and pillows. All the extras are included, Nespresso machine, kettle and selection of teas and complimentary water and fruit. The bathroom appeared brand new and was fitted to a high spec, with quality branded toiletries.
Unfortunately, due to an event going on outside the building, I could hear music which was audible, as I was trying to sleep, and I relayed this information to Michael the Duty Manager. I'd like to thank Michael personally for investigating the source of the noise, and for kindly offering me an alternative room which was very quiet and special. 
The whole team at the Montcalm seem motivated and ready to make their guests' stay memorable. I would also like to thank the young concierge who helped carry my bags.
I must also comment on breakfast at the Aviary. This is a stunning restaurant on the 10th floor, with views across the City of London. It was a superb start to the day to enjoy breakfast in such a beautiful, bright space and I would highly recommend it. 
The breakfast offering was comprehensive, and hot beverages were made to order. Service again was quick and attentive.
I have no hesitation in giving the Montcalm a 5 star review and will definitely return here again, either myself or with family.",5,2019,09,15

111,Amazing Place and Amazing Team,The 6 days spent in this hotel were amazing. The room was amazing so clean and spacious. I loved the gym and I would really have loved to use the pool but I didn't carry my swimsuit. The fruits offering was amazing. Definitely going back there if I am in London again.,5,2019,09,08
111,Superb stay,"My wife was there for a business trip and my son and me were for vacation.

Hotel is very good situated close 2 metro stations liverpool and moorgate (6-7 minutes) as well as a bus station (1 min). A very safe area on evening.

The room is clean, bed is comfortable, wifi is perfect and bathroom is always clean.

Breakfast is delicious. The hotel has a small pool for relaxing.

Staff is helpful and they always smile. We had a very long  check out because of a system prb  but the manager solve it at the end.

I will be back and of course i recommand this hotel for everyone.

Expertly appointed, nice staff, spotless, great bathroom and super comfy bed. I even had a package delivered there and they handled it with no problem.  Conveniently located to financial district meetings and dinners...and the price is not bad for this area of London...a good value for the quality of the stay.  I’m making this my go-to hotel for future trips. ",5,2019,09,05

111,"Amazing hotel, spa not so good","My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel for our first wedding anniversary on the night of 31st August 2019. The hotel is amazing, you are welcomed with a glass of bubbly and very friendly staff. Our room was decorated with balloons and macaroons along with a lovely welcome card, we felt like very valued customers! We ate lunch and tea in the Aviary restaurant at the top of the hotel; lunch we both just had starters, these were lovely and a good price, for tea I had the chicken dish which I thoroughly enjoyed, my husband had the steak and he wasn’t too impressed, for the price we do feel that it was an average piece of steak and could have been better, moreover we did enjoy the meal and cocktails, dessert we both had the brownie which was Devine! 
The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we’ve ever slept in, which is a massive tick in our books! 
On a bad note, We did have a spa day on the Saturday and to be quite honest it was the worst spa day I’ve ever been to with the most rushed treatments! I bought a spa deal from wowcher after booking the hotel which was for 3 treatments each and a glass of champagne; treatments were a back, neck and shoulder massage, head massage and facial, when I booked it said treatments were 30 minutes each however on my voucher it said 50 minutes for all 3 , I put this down to wowcher and just thought as long as it’s a good 50 minutes I wouldn’t mind. My therapist didn’t ask me for my skin type, if I had and aches and pains in my back, she started with the back massage which was pretty basic and didn’t do the same movements on both sides of my back, the oil was just that, an oil no fragrance/ essential oils added, onto the facial, if you can call it that. She started off by Toning my face, then cleansed, and repeated this about 6 times, she was going so lightly over my face with cotton wool pads though I could tell she wasn’t getting all my make up off and there were parts of my face she totally missed like my upper lip, neck and eyes. She then put a mask on my face, left it for about 2 minutes whilst she pushed on my hairline with one hand, she was not getting my pressure points at all and one hand?! I actually thought maybe she was on her phone! She then wiped the mask off put a dry flannel over my eyes with a beanbag on top and told me my treatment was over and she would be outside for me! I was super shocked it was that quick and I left with Male up still on, my husband said his wasn’t great but he got a face massage and said his back massage was very good. The spa was very busy and we didn’t stay for long after our treatments, we also had to ask for our champagne. 
The hotel was so amazing we will definitely return and recommend it to our friends and family however I will not return to the spa!",4,2019,09,03
111,Amazing stay at a lovely hotel,"I stayed here for three nights and cannot fault it. The hotel staff really make you feel so welcome and can’t do enough for you. The room was great and had everything you could need - amazing air con, slippers, dressing gown, sky tv! The bed was sooo comfortable and I loved the mood lighting. I had the continental breakfast on the ground floor and really enjoyed it. I also had lounge access which I didn’t know, so with this I could have free drinks and canapés in the lounge was was lovely. Can’t fault this hotel and really felt like I had the 5 star treatment.",5,2019,09,03
111,Michael is Montcalm's best Asset.,"Michael on reception is a total Gem, and a Gentleman, we booked a room only to find out that he had upgraded our room to a club room. we were able to use the club facilitys which was very nice. the hotel itself is very nice and very lively at night with a pub on the ground level and roof top bar on the 10th floor, all were superb, but as i said for us to meet such a enthusiastic young man who just wanted to please us was a breath of fresh air well done Michael and see you soon!

I would like to thank Flavia for helping me make this stay extra special for my special occasion and all of her help, she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. The only downside i have is that i selected iron cotton fragrance and upon entering the room i could not smell this and the next morning i found the machine and it was turned off and also filled with lavender, apart from this my stay was a 5/5 and i will definitely be back. Thank you",5,2019,09,02

111,London mini break ,"I booked a family room so that we could spend the weekend in London for my husband’s birthday. Kids are 8 and 5. The room I booked was meant to be all one room, with a sofa bed in the lounge area and a separate bedroom. What we actually got was 2 rooms with the adjoining doors propped open. This meant there were 2 points of entry, which I was a bit uncomfortable with. I ended up locking the door of the kids’ room and putting the suitcase in front of it.
The rooms were very comfortable, lovely bathrooms with nice toiletries. Not much hotel info, not even on the pool times or restaurants. Lots of nice freebies (juices, macaroons, fruit).
We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night. Friday was pretty noisy after 9pm, people who’d been drinking for a while shouting outside. The Aviary on the 9th floor seems a popular location for evening drinks etc (they had a “greeter” standing by the lobby lift for this crowd). Not sure if that’s where the noise came from. Saturday was better, the City is much quieter on the weekends. We were on the 2nd floor, and I’d asked if it would be noisy when I checked in and was assured that no, it was overlooking Finsbury Square so very quiet.. Luckily my kids are good sleepers so it was just us disturbed.
At check in we were asked about breakfast, I explained that I’d separately booked the Aviary for the Sunday morning (husband’s birthday). Booking.com had given me the option to include breakfast in the booking - £25 each for each morning, £200! So I’d booked without breakfast, intending to have a cheaper option on Saturday and then Sunday do the a la carte. My 5yo is very fussy and certainly would not eat £25 of food. Anyway reception tell me that if we pre booked through them it would be only £17.50 pp. I had a think and then went back to clarify, they asked why I wanted the a la carte and I explained about my daughter, they then said they would not charge for the kids. So the breakfast ended up costing only £35 instead of £100 if I’d booked via booking.com!
Even better though is that as a hotel guest you can have a complimentary continental breakfast in the club lounge (opposite reception) which we did on the first morning. Only told this at check in, no info on website or even in the room! Basically everything available that you’d get in the Aviary except the Full English. Cereals, pastries, toast, ham & cheese, yoghurts, fruit, juices etc. For free! Really nice and I would say just as nice as the Aviary. Don’t pay extra unless you really want a Full English (be warned, ours was cold).
We went to the wellness centre both mornings, pool is very nice, not big but fine for a quick dip. Lovely warm jacuzzi (actually very warm!). Sauna and steam rooms also available and the small changing rooms were nice and had good shower facilities. Kids over 5yo are allowed in the pool 9-11am and 3-5pm (nothing on website about this, told during check in).
I felt that the hotel website could be a lot more informative, all the little details had to be gleaned verbally from reception as the website was completely silent and there was no hotel information in the room. I like to check the details beforehand (e.g. so I don’t tell the kids they can go swimming, pack their things and then find out that they’re not allowed in the pool at all) so I’d definitely like to see them improve that for the future.
Overall a very nice hotel, good location especially for City, Tower, Shoreditch etc.",5,2019,09,01
111,Great hotel,We love coming to the Montcalm Royal London House. The rooms are spacious and the connecting rooms as family suite very convenient and the service and food is great. The hotel has a bubbly atmosphere at night and the shuffleboard downstairs is heat fun.,5,2019,09,01
111,OK hotel. Nothing special.,"Stayed here for 2 nights for our anniversary. My husband and I were very excited and had really high expectation because it was ""5 star"". 
We've booked a double room and on my booking I also stated that we're spending our anniversary. The reservation team are very helpful as I needed to amend my booking. 

When we checked in, the reception was a bit busy and we've noticed customers are treated differently depending who the receptionist are talking to because there was one couple who were checking in next to us and we overheard that their receptionist was telling them about the different facilities, opening times, even the free drinks in the lounge. We've waited for our receptionist to tell us the same thing but she didn't. I ended up asking her instead, for the opening times of the facilities and breakfast. (and just ignored the free drinks). 
Upon checking out, we felt that again it was the same. There was another couple who was checking out next to us and we heard one of the receptionist congratulating them because they're celebrating their ""special occasion"" too and she was making sure that they had a good stay and enjoyed the facilities and the restaurants. We never really had any treatment like that despite us being in the same situation as that couple. That to us was very disappointing. It was our anniversary and we thought we picked the right hotel... 

The room was ok... it was too small for the price that we paid. We stayed in other hotels where a ""double room"" is bigger. Nothing really special. Breakfast was ok - view was spectacular. The team at the Aviary, very welcoming and helpful. 

Overall, we feel like we had too high expectation and it didn't feel like we're staying at a ""5 star hotel"". We still wished that we spent our anniversary somewhere else specially when we felt like we were treated less or differently for some reason compared to the other 2 couples who where there to stay and celebrate their ""special occasion"". And for the price that we paid, we really expected the experience to be better. 

Will we stay there again? NO. We've stayed at different hotels before and celebrated our anniversaries there and we've received a much better treatment. 

Just to note, we don't have anything against the hotel because this might only have happened to us, but just really wanted to share the disappointment we had experienced in this ""5 star"" hotel.",3,2019,09,01
111,AMAZING! An un- forgettable weekend,"From the very second we stepped in to the Montcalm it was amazing. Met by very polite door staff with a big smile. Next we went to check in where we were given a glass of complimentary champagne. THEN we were given an upgrade to a suit as it is our 2nd Anniversary. We were shown to our room by a really polite and lovely man & greeted to macaroons and fruit in our room. We had already booked in at Aviary which as well was absolutely incredible, amazing food, drinks, service and view from the terrace. We also were able to gain entry to the Members room with had unlimited alcohol & canapés which made for an amazing before dinner treat. From the second we stepped in to the Montcalm we felt so relaxed, the staff cannot do enough for you and every single member of staff were so attentive. Thankyou so much for making our anniversary weekend so special. We loved every second of it and can’t wait to come back.",5,2019,08,31
111,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here in June/July for a long weekend and enjoyed our stay. The head of customer relations lady was very nice and made us feel welcome on arrival. It was very warm in London during our stay and this hotel is very well air conditioned! The corridors are very cool and the plush soft carpets feel good underfoot. The rooms themselves are excellent with top class facilities and gadgets.

We went to the rooftop bar a couple of times but only once were able to get outside on the terrace due to overcrowding. Beware that this is a popular place for young people to drink at night time - non guests fill the lobby and queue on the stairs to get to the terrace. The bar downstairs also gets busy with non guests and we saw it get rowdy a couple of times. Was not an issue for us and you won't hear the noise in the rooms, just mentioning it as older couples may find it a little off-putting.

Location is good - close to Liverpool Street, Moorgate and Old Street. There's a Marks & Spencer very close too if you need anything.",4,2019,08,31

I rate the hotel highly because the staff are very friendly and efficient in their dealings, the rooms are comfortable and large with everything you need, bathroom's excellent and breakfast is very nice, set at the top of the building.",5,2019,08,30
111,An amazing hotel,"After reading reviews before deciding to book this hotel for the bank holiday weekend, I wasn’t disappointed and was very delighted with my choice. I had an incredible experience. On arrival I had been upgraded, this was a pleasant surprise and much appreciated.The hotel is of a high standard and the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff makes the experience even more special. The trip was a treat for my niece who had travelled from Newcastle to celebrate her GCSE results. I’ve stayed in many hotels for work etc this has to be one of my favourite hotels and I would definitively come back here. Thanks again.",5,2019,08,29
111,A great experience ,"We showed up before our check in time.  January greeted us immediately and offered every possible concession to make our stay easier.  She was incredibly welcoming and professional and also easy to talk to.

The room had a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, and user-friendly controls.  They even left extra decorations and treats with a card because we were celebrating our honeymoon.  ",5,2019,08,29
111,Always welcoming and great to return to,"Been coming back to this hotel everytime I get the chance and have to work in central London (Moorgate/Finsbury/Shoreditch area) The competition nearby does not stand a chance on value for money and detailed hospitality quality - from the rooftop for breakfast and after work social to the high-end rooms or pleasant details as a craft brewery on building. 

Great staff in all areas, always very welcoming, warm and helpful. Special kudos to Misu for the personal hospitality in the club lounge. ",5,2019,08,28
111,Excellent Birthday Visit!!!,"We have just enjoyed a wonderful weekend break to celebrate my partners 75th Birthday. 

We arrived on Thursday 22nd August and were warmly welcomed by Dado. I had already advised the hotel that it was my partner William's 75th Birthday and this was acknowledged as soon as we entered. Dado quickly escorted us to the reception area where we were quickly booked in. Dado asked us if we would like a glass of champagne while she advised us of the facilities of the hotel. Our suitcases were already there when entered our club room a lovely front facing room overlooking Finsbury Square. A lovely piece of chocolate cake each and an ice bucket of complimentary drinks were there for us also for us to enjoy. The bed had been festooned with happy birthday balloons which made my partner feel special. The only disappointment we had was that I had booked a twin room because we sleep better, but the bed we had was been given was a double. Because the room was so nice we decided not to make a fuss and accepted the bed situation.

 After unpacking we went down to the club lounge as we had complimentary use of with our room choice. There was a good choice of soft drinks and alcoholic drinks. The alchoholic drinks were available between 5.30pm and 8.00pm. Although we found the complimentary snacks more limited than other club lounges we have visited. What was available was tasty.

We returned to our room to rest for the following days visit to St. Paul's Cathedral. As almost all room controls except the curtains are done either by buttons by the bedside or a control panel by the bathroom door, it took us a little time to work out which button did which but it became second nature. However because of the situation of the control panel by the bathroom and layout of the room the control panel light shone directly onto the beds and disturbed our sleep for the rest of the night.

The following morning we decided that before we went for breakfast we would report the problem that we had with the control panel light and that we had actually booked a twin room rather than a double. The receptionist apologised and told us that although they could not turn off the panel, they could arrange for a temporary cover to be placed over it. She said she would also arrange for the bed to be changed to a twin

We visited the club lounge which was serving a complimentary continental  breakfast which we found had a very good variety of tasty and good quality items of cold meats, salmon, breads pastries, juices etc. Tea and coffee was also available to order from the attending staff. 

After enjoying breakfast we left for the day to enjoy the City and visit St Paul's. There are 3 subway stations which are within easy walking distance of the hotel. Also there are good bus routes which stop close which we found very convenient.

Upon returning to the room we found that although the promised panel cover had been attached, the beds was still made up as a double. I rang and reported our disappointment that the beds had not been separated. The receptionist told us that she would ring housekeeping to see would could be done. After a short time Dado from customer relations rang to say that there had been a misunderstanding between housekeeping  and reception and said that the beds could not be separated. Dado seemed to genuinely  care about our situation and wanted to rectify the situation to our satisfaction. She offered an upgrade to another room which turned out to be a junior suite. Dado then came to our room and guided us to the new room which although did not have the nice view but was a much larger room, but more importantly had the required twin beds!!

The remainder of our stay went without a hitch and upon checking out the customer relations manager came and apologised in person for the problems we have had.

In closing my review I would just like to thank all the staff at the Montcalm Royal London House for a fantastic time and to especially Dado for her attentive and caring manner in which she helped with our stay.

111,Perfect Hotel,"What can I say about the Montcalm , I stayed in many hotels **** and ***** all over the world, but this experience was the best ever, from the minute you walk in the door ,your treated like your someone famous. The staff are friendly and helpful , and so professional.The room we stayed was upgraded to a junior suite because our original room was not ready, ordinarily i would have got annoyed, but they were so apologetic ,and also the three glasses of complimentary Prosecco ,that was being offered to you soon has you got to the reception , might have to chill me a bit.
Anyway the room was perfect.If  you stay be shore to also book a table in  the Aviary their rooftop restaurant and bar looking out over London.Excellent
Thanks to all the staff,Dada,Flavia,Estelauis and Alex in the restaurant.See you soon.",5,2019,08,27
111,Amazing hotel,"I booked this hotel for my partners birthday and we both absolutely loved the hotel. We stayed in one of the Montcalm Club Double rooms, which was definitely worth it for the slightly higher price. So spacious and luxurious with great little touches in the room like personalized mood lighting and the comfiest bed we have both ever felt! Had access to complimentary drinks and canapes from 5pm - 9pm, followed by breakfast buffet in the morning. All of the staff we're lovely and will definitely be booking soon to stay again! Favorite hotel in london!",5,2019,08,27
111,Fantastic Stay,Its the second time I'm staying at this hotel in the last few months and I'm so happy I chose this place again. Great service from check-in all the way to check-out. We were given a beautiful room with a lovely complimentary champagne. Cant recommend this enough. Definitely will be back seeing as this is the only hotel I use when I'm in London. Thanks again to the team but also to Alex for the chat and hospitality. See you soon.,5,2019,08,26

111,Great place to stay!,"I found this place on TripAdvisor and was not disappointed. Stayed 4 nights with my family of 4 (2 teens). We had 2 adjoining rooms that were clean, spacious, and quiet. We all enjoyed a great nights sleep each night. It is an easy to walk to trendy east end spots or nearby tube stops (5 mins). Only enjoyed the rooftop bar/restaurant once due to weather, but great views and such a nice place to relax for food/drink. Service was great and check in and check out were easy.  I would absolute come back here again!",5,2019,08,25
111,Excellent hotel ,"Spent 2 nights here over the BH weekend and very happy with our stay. 

Friendly, welcoming staff, lovely clean and spacious room and great rooftop bar.

Short walk to Spitalfields, the tube and Breakfast Club (went here twice it’s that good) 

Lovely hotel and on our list for next time we stay in London",5,2019,08,25
111,Total comfort and joy,"Once again this hotel delivers on every aspect from our welcoming ‘sparkly’ drinks through to our personal goodbye. Dado made it her business to make our short trip memorable xxx
All staff are to be congratulated on their professionalism. 
Please go .... you will love it!!!

111,Little city break ,"I stayed here with my partner and son for 3 nights. Beautiful hotel, great service with a lovely small spa area.
Lots of nice bars and restaurants in close proximity. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. We upgraded our room and had access to the lounge which is open all day until around 10pm at night with a free bar and snacks available at all times which is perfect if you have children, breakfast was also available here daily which was fantastic.",5,2019,08,24
111,Entertain my cousin and his wife,"My cousin & his wife were visiting from Canada so I booked them, my wife & myself into the montcalm as I know this hotel very well but i had not been back since November due to a operation but to say the hospitality and attention to detail were amazing would be an understatement to the wonderful staff at the hotel from the porter at the main door to the night staff always pleasant and smiling 
Especially a big thank you for the hospitality given to us from dragoslavia, georgi, Alex and camellia 
And the amazing olivia in the aviary breakfast lounge 
You were all that good I had only booked one night but the way we got treated and looked after my cousin and his wife asked could we stay for a second night which the hotel were so so quick to sort out for us 
Many many thanks from 4 wonderfully happy customers

111,Amazing,Lovely hotel from start to finish amazing experience. Staff so friendly it's in a ideal location. You can't go wrong here so much to see and do nearby. Best hotel we ever stayed in will definitely be going back,5,2019,08,21
111,Superb customer service!,"We stayed here for one night as a get together with friends.  The service from the start was amazing.  Really attentive, nothing was too much trouble.  Little touches that made the difference - macarons delivered to the room and access to the Club Lounge.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  We had adjoining rooms which was lovely.  Huge TV and use of the spa was very welcome.  The location is excellent, close to station and major transport links.  The roof bar was an added bonus when the sun came out!  We will be back!",5,2019,08,21
111,Exceptional hotel and Flawless Service,We stayed at Montcalm Royal London house from 9-12 Aug. this year and enjoyed  well appointed thoughtfully designed rooms and exceptional service.  They moved us to a bigger room to accommodate our son and exceeded our expectations through flawless superfast service and responsiveness.  The hotel has a fantastic rooftop bar and restaurant and centrally located.  Will surely want to stay again,5,2019,08,21
111,Exceptional customer service,"My partner and I stayed for 1 night at Montcalm in Finsbury Square to celebrate my partner's birthday.

We were treated to a complimentary bottle of wine, had our room upgraded and we were gifted a vegan dessert upon our arrival.

Staff were very friendly & nothing was too much trouble. The guest experience advisors were very accommodating to all of our needs & left a lasting impression.

We will definitely return on our next trip. Thanks for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2019,08,20
111,Service Beyond Reproach,"I stayed at the Montcalm hotel and I have to say the staff were amazing. They were able to accommodate a last minute surprise for my fiancée which was amazing. I would like to give a special thanks to Georgina for her excellent service and Alex for going above and beyond. 

I will be back again very soon.",5,2019,08,20
111,Very nice hotel,"This really is a very pleasant hotel - well decorated and comfortable.

It is well located - only a few hundred yards from Moorgate tube station.

My room was spacious and clean - everything you needed and more.

Only down sides to me were fairly small stuff. The staff were generally helpful but their poor English led to a few frustrating conversations, my card keys didn’t work and the attention span of the member of staff dealing with my check out was poor (but only as he was trying to oversee a colleague who initially ignored a guest to chat to her friend and then was not doing a good job of dealing with the customer - however, that just meant he wasn’t dealing with me well either!). 

They need to add the extension number for room service to the card in the room too as it’s missing at the moment.

So generally really good and some small stuff to sort out. Overall, you will have a very pleasant stay here.

",4,2019,08,19
111,Great,"Amazing stay, staff very friendly, helpful and professional. 
The room was very large with a comfortable bed .
The location was also very good  The rooftop bar and the view was amazing
Clean and tidy, comfortable stay, will definitely recommend and return",5,2019,08,19
111,The staff are all really friendly and helpful.  Service was excellent.,"We had a fantastic weeks stay here and the room, the bathroom and its facilities were fantastic. The Hotel is near Monument Tube and Liverpool St Station so is in a very good area. The rooftop bar had fab views, but the service there was terrible service if you want a drink outside.  We waited along time for our drinks and had to go inside to get them!  We didn't eat there as there are plenty of restaurants around the area but we did have room service for breakfast once and ordered a continental breakfast which was plentiful, but make sure you ask for everything on the continental menu as they forget the juice, the cutlery etc.  Overall we had a fab tie here and I would go again and stay here definitely.",5,2019,08,19
111,Can not fault this hotel,"This is the second time we have stayed here, staff are always so helpful, nothing is too much trouble.
Rooms are very clean and have everything you need for your stay.
Just a few minute walk from the tube and taxis always a few minutes away.
Roof top bar is beautiful, and at winter, the igloos are a must ",5,2019,08,19
111,Very Flexible with a Good Value,Me and my husband stayed their lastweek of July. We had a long flight but arrive earlier than expected. We where greeted by smiling concierge and assisted to the reception. We thought we could not check-in but a very helpful and smiling receptionist YAN tried to ask her duty manager if she could give us a room earlier and they did help us quiet well. That was something to us. She gave montcalm a good reputation. We had a great time at the breakfast aviary and the room although the toilet was not really cleaned properly but they were quick to send housekeeping to resolve it. Its also close to station. When ur there look for Yan she will help u with a smile. The sports bar is also entertaining. Thanks everyone... will be in touch!,4,2019,08,17
111,"Amazing service, well appointed rooms, gorgeous hotel!!","First of all, I wish I could clone the Duty Supervisaor, Camelia, for every hotel I stay in around the world. She is awesome in every way and I will sing her praises, and this hotel, to all my friends and colleagues coming to London!  The check in service is excellent, the rooms are spacious and beds are super comfortable. There is a terrific pool, spa service and great room service to make this experience such a pleasure. Beyond the physical features are the wonderful staff, led by Camelia, who are so customer service focused that guests are well served - I felt thoroughly spoilt!",5,2019,08,17
111,Amazing!!!,"Been for one night just to relax and could have not been better. 

Outstanding guest service, professional and warm staff, always happy to help

Cleanliness spot on, bed super comfortable, great offer of minibar and room service

Temperature was perfect 

Will definitely recommend and return ",5,2019,08,17
111,Outstanding customer service and hotel,"This hotel massively exceeded my expectations. I was upgraded to a better room because there was a small problem with the initial room and also given a free breakfast. The customer service during my stay was extremely impressive. I was even met by the guest experience manager upon checking out, just to make sure everything was ok! Then received a follow up email as well. Little touches like this are the difference between regular hotels and a 5 star experience.

The room was very large with an extremely comfortable bed, great TV (appeared to have just about every Sky Channel, HD as well!), Nespresso machine, LOVELY toiletries and air con - which was so nice to have in the summer. I wish I had spent a bit more time in the room to be honest but I did have London on my doorstep so made the most of it.

I cannot fault the hotel at all - every single member of staff was professional, friendly and efficient. The hotel itself is really nice. The rooftop bar is a great touch and adds a lot to the experience. The location is very central, just a few minutes walk from Moorgate tube station and you can very quickly get to most of the touristy bits of London. May be a little far out if you wanted to go to Buckingham Palace and the like but still, only about 10-15 mins on the tube.

At night, the place comes alive and has what looked like a nightclub at the rear of the building. Lots of people seemed to be attending the hotel for drinks and it looked like a great atmosphere. Despite this I would have had no idea from my room as I could not hear any of the noise (I was on the 7th floor though!).

I will definitely stay here again.",5,2019,08,17
111,Above and Beyond What We Expected,"My wife, daughter and I were extremely impressed with our stay at The Montcalm Royal London House. From the first staff greeting to the last “Have a great day!” we felt more than welcome here. Our 10 day stay would not have been as smooth without the staff’s wonderful help. Our room was larger than expected and the pool/hot tub were perfect after a long day. Make sure you include the member’s breakfast and the afternoon canapés if you can. The food and drink were better than what you’d expect from a hotel (ok, a US hotel I guess) and again, I can’t say enough about how nice the staff was. A few reviewers have commented on having to walk through a restaurant/bar before getting to the lobby but it wasn’t an issue at all, especially with staff grabbing the front door as we returned every day. We’re sad our stay ends today but when we come back to London, there will be no guessing where we’ll be staying. Oh, they even took the time to have balloons and some treats in the room as we arrived on our daughter’s 7th birthday; Above and beyond.",5,2019,08,16
111,Exquisite,"As soon as my girlfriend and I entered the hotel the staff was very friendly. It was my birthday, they even sent birthday macarons to the room with a card. I had special requests for my room and they were met and even exceeded. 
The location was also very good for a 5 star hotel with a good price. The rooftop bar and the view was breathtaking.
The next day we ordered room service breakfast from the a la carte menu and it was very delicious and worth the amount spent. It was definitely worth it. Will definitely go back.",5,2019,08,16
111,"Once again, an excellent stay","We have stayed in this hotel on several occasions and made it our hotel of choice when visiting London.
Everything about the hotel is first class, with the positive experience starting when you check-in. The staff are friendly, welcoming and helpful at all times. The rooms are very comfortable - I'd recommend booking a club room with lounge access that includes continental breakfast and evening drinks.
Location-wise the hotel is close to Liverpool Street train and underground station and easy walking distance to St Pauls Cathedral. Spitalfields Market and Brick Lane are also very close.",5,2019,08,16
111,Gorgeous 5 star Hotel in London,I looked for a 5 star hotel in London including a pool and I found the Montcalm Royal London House. It's at least half priced than teh other nice 5 stars Hotels near the center of London. The service if superb. Room very clean. All people are very nice (especially Camelia and Dado). There is also free breakfast included (not a real buffet with eggs but very nice though). Only negative point : it's a little far from the touristic center of London (15 min driving) but London is a huge city (!!). ,5,2019,08,15
111,Probably the best night's sleep in a hotel,"Wonderful hotel, welcoming and professional staff and probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in away from home. Would definitely stay here again on a visit to London. Loved the location and we were given a large room that had a luxurious feel to it. ",5,2019,08,15
111,Cool and Modern,We stayed at montcalm hotel with my friends and the rooms were really nice and modern with skytv for free. Check-in at the reception was YAN and she wAs very polite and lovely. The rooftop bar was so cool. Cheers!,4,2019,08,14
111,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HOTEL........ FAULTLESS !,"We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel for 2 nights to celebrate my daughters 18th Birthday with family, so we had two rooms. They were spotlessly clean, very modern  and the most comfortable beds any of us had ever slept in !
From the minute we arrived we were made so welcome from all the staff and to be honest they could not have done any more for us.  
In particular CAMELIA & FLAVIA at the reception were absolutely exceptional.
We were upgraded and had rooms next to each other.  When my daughter went into her room it was decorated with balloons & banners. Also a bottle of champagne waiting on ice for her.  In our other room we also had a lovely bottle of Prosecco and some homemade Macaroons.
Later they gave my daughter the most amazing home made chocolate Birthday cake. 
The roof top bar and Aviary were stunning with very friendly and helpful staff.  
Great place to have your breakfast, over looking London.!  The Full English breakfast was delicious and very fresh, with a superb amount of choice for all. 
The other Bar/restaurant on the ground floor was excellent for both food & drinks, and again with very friendly staff. 
We used the Gym, Pool, Sauna and Steam room and can honestly say it was the best Spa facilities I have used and immaculately clean.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definitely in my opinion give it a rating of OUTSTANDING.!
Thank you ALL for making our stay so perfect.",5,2019,08,14
111,THE best hotel experience I’ve had!,"This hotel, is by far, the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. The staff are superb and serve with finesse, the rooms are amazing and the amenities are plentiful.

We booked this hotel not knowing the brand but based on the reviews on TripAdvisor it was a must! I could tell you looking back we were not disappointed! We were greeted at check in by Miguel who spoke Italian to us and gave us all the necessary pointers and information to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had the Club Twin Bed room which was fantastic! The beds were among the comfiest I’ve ever stayed at in a hotel and the room was full of little touches that made it all better! (Nespresso, daily fruit/treats, electronic console for room, pillows which you were able to choose and a fragrance in the room of your choice). 

We had breakfast and appetizers included which was really worth it! Top quality dishes and food which certainly did not disappoint! The staff in the lounge were super helpful and attentive to our requests and I’d like to thank them! The Pool, Spa and Fitness area were among the most extensive that I ever used! Ultra modern, pool, sauna and fitness Center which were clean and equipped which everything!

Out of all the 5 star chains I’ve stayed at around the world this one certainly is the best! Whenever I’m in London I will be staying here. Ultra-modern rooms, amenities and the best staff! I would recommend to everyone!",5,2019,08,12
111,Superb throughout,"We visited the Montcalm for a weekend away in July 2019.  From the moment we entered we felt welcomed and appreciated the cleanliness and service provided by all of the staff.

Greeted with a smile and a glass of sparkling wine, we were able to check in with ease and given a room earlier than expected to drop our bags. 

We chose Montcalm because having stayed at another Montcalm in London, we knew the beds were the best around! 

We utilised the spa and swimming pools in the morning, which were open nice and early - the pool was heated and the entire area was very well maintained and spotless.  

Overall:
Service: absolutely superb from all of the staff who were always attentive and pleasant to speak to

Room: the room was very clean and bathroom was brand new with superb shower

Spa/ Pool: lovely and warm, clean and great to use - especially after a busy day out in the city. 

Location: really good, central location and walking distance to tube stations / short taxi rides to most places you would want to go. 

Bar: the rooftop bar was great too with superb cocktails and views

Overall, I would definitely recommend over other similarly priced hotels in London as this place is great.",5,2019,08,12
111,5 star service,"From the moment I stepped into the hotel I was received very warmly and professionally, I’d like to give a big thank you to Misu for being a great waiter and being very verbally engaging and helpful while serving me drinks. I would highly recommend Montcalm Royal London House purely because their stuff deliver exceptional service, and more.",5,2019,08,12
111,"Very nice hotel, great customer service.","This is a really nice hotel with modern styled rooms and a classy feel about it.  Check-in staff were extremely polite/friendly and when our room wasn't quite ready we were immediately offered champagne in the club lounge.  Our rate had access to the club lounge included, which we thoroughly recommend... help yourself to unlimited drinks and canapes (inc wines, beer and branded spirits).  We also had access to the Spa which was immaculate, with a nice pool, Jacuzzi and sauna/steam rooms.  We also had drinks in the 'Aviary' which is the rooftop bar with great views of the city.

One small observation, the rooms are a little on the small side for their description.  We booked a 'junior suite', which realistically was more akin to a large double room elsewhere, however when I queried this we were immediately offered an upgrade to a 'business suite' which is a larger room, so can't complain really.  Bathroom was immaculate with a huge shower.

All in, a very nice hotel with plenty of helpful and polite staff.  Not the largest of rooms, but made up for by the lounges, bars and Spa.  Definitely recommended.",5,2019,08,12
111,Fantastic weekend!,"Another amazing stay at the Montcalm Royal London House, this past weekend. Stayed in a family suite with my parents and five year old niece, and could literally not find fault with even one part of our weekend. Every part of our stay from check in to check out was flawless. The hotel staff here are incredible and the customer service you receive is second to none. A special thank you to Dado and her team, who went above and beyond (as usual) to ensure that we had the best stay possible. When we arrived to our room, there was a wonderful little hamper waiting for my niece with a selection of juices, yoghurts, popcorn and sweets. Needless to say, she was delighted with herself! We also had a bottle of champagne and some macarons waiting for the adults. Such a nice little touch! Dado was on hand throughout the weekend if we ever needed anything, and we were always welcomed with a warm smile any time we saw her. She honestly couldn't do enough to make you feel special. Having mentioned to her that we were taking my niece to see Mamma Mia on the Saturday, we arrived back to our room the following day to find laminated pictures of the Mamma Mia cast and dancers, a lovely teddy bear, heart shaped confetti and balloons on one of the beds. There was also another little hamper of drinks, sweets and popcorn awaiting my niece again. These small touches are truly what makes this place so special and a five star experience and why I keep returning! Looking forward to my next stay here.",5,2019,08,12
111,Relaxing Break,"The hotel is fantastic, very stylish and comfortable. I requested a top floor room and upon arrival thats exactly what they gave us. Very nice that they acknowleged my request. Staff were very friendly and welcoming - and the room was fantastic. Very relaxing and comfortable. Had a very nice view of Finsbury square. I didn't have the chance to use the facilities ie. bar, swimming pool -  but for sure I will do next time.",4,2019,08,12
111,5 stars out of 5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay! I only wish it was longer. Didn’t get to experience enough of the hotel due to work constraints, but the room was fantastic and staff couldn’t have been nicer.

Brilliant location, loads of bars and dining areas to take advantage of. 

Would highly recommend.",5,2019,08,12
111,Fantastic support from concierge,"Dorian, the concierge was incredibly helpful  last Friday in trying sort out an urgent problem I had in trying to access an online form and then sitting me down with a coffee to get it sorted. Many Thanks",4,2019,08,12
111,Best City stay so far in London,"We stayed there to end our 4 weeks holiday to relax and we go exactly what we were after. Staff was super friendly and gave us a little surprise on a special occasion. Close to a lot of shopping areas and great cafe, Roof top bar offers an amazing view of city.",5,2019,08,11
111,The best city stay so far,"I have to say that was one of the best city hotels I have ever stayed in. I had such a comfortable and accommodating stay. My partner and I loved the facilities and standards of the room equipment, fixtures fittings, the overall hotel decor and the staff. Sometimes city hotels can be on the garish side but the Mountcalm Royal had a good balance. For me a comfortable bed, no noise, privacy, cleanliness, warm showers, helpful but not imposing staff, great coffee are important and you ticked all the boxes on those.

We really liked the continental breakfast that was provided and the health suite was a welcomed way to wake up in the morning.

Location is awesome too for exploring and enjoying east London. Black Rock Whiskey bar next door is quality too

In the way of improvements I’m not sure what else could be done. Free Prosecco in the rooms? Who knows?

Just keep it up 👍",5,2019,08,10
111,Amazing hotel and staff,"Hi I have stayed here once with my wife and on another occasion with my son after another good win as a professional boxer both times superb,upgrade to the club lounge if the hotel is not to busy just ask you will get upgraded free it amazing any drinks and canopees free from 5 till 8 pm ,all the staff are great ,Dado the manager thankyou for another great stay see you again, also roof top bar and roof top terrace the best I've been too excellent,regards MR D GODDARD",5,2019,08,09
111,Unexpected,"Turned my idea of a hotel inside out. Instead of venturing into the depths of the hotel to find out what the craic is, this one wears its atmosphere at the front and back of house, so to speak, through which you must venture in order to discover the relative serenity of your overnight accommodation. 

Raised eyebrows.

As did the supreme efficiency and professionalism of the staff on duty this evening.

Recommended.",5,2019,08,08
111,"Wonderfully warm welcome, so family friendly","I had a fantastic stay in the Montcalm Royal last week with my children.  The family suite is enormous, there is a separate room with a convertible sofa to sleep two which has its own en-suite bathroom.  Amazing view from 9th floor, too.   The staff are so friendly and helpful, included breakfast is fantastic.  We didn't try the pool as I didn't even know there was one until we got there, we chose the hotel based on its perfect location, everything else was a welcome surprise.",5,2019,08,08
111,Pleasantly Surprised,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but the room was beyond my expectations, and was spacious and well set out. I had requested a quite room, which was exactly what we got.

We arrived at the hotel, just before 3 pm, and even though it seemed to be organised chaos, we a number of people booking in, we were advised to go to the roof top bar, have a drink and the room would be ready on our return to reception.

Special mention needs to go to Dobi, who ensured our stay, from beginning to end, was a pleasant experience and Catalin for his assistance.",5,2019,08,08
111,Smith,"Just come back from a two night stay at this hotel thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the staff were lovely and very helpful, great location,the food was delicious and the room was excellent.
Will definitely be recommending to my friends ",5,2019,08,07
111,Mr,"My favourite place to stay for a special , luxurious getaway very clean , lovely staff , the room is set with mood lighting and is beautifully furnished and comfortable ; 10/10 . The views from the roof terrace is amazing . The leisure facility is second to non , it puts the icing on the cake . The swimming pool and jacuzzi was like a natural waterfall . We had a lovely time and we definitely aspire to stay again.",5,2019,08,07
111,"Great hotel, great service, great location","The location is great, but then that really depends on where you need to be. The staff are exceptionally helpful. The rooms are really good, modern, clean and with the facilities you'd expect.

My only complaint is that the outside area of the 9th floor roof bar is sometimes booked out for private, corporate functions, so not available to guests, which I think is poor. An area should always be available to guests.",5,2019,08,06
111,Fantastic stay,"Stayed here for a couple of nights with my partner for our anniversary. Instantly made to feel incredibly welcomed and handed a glass of Prosecco upon check in. Really comfy room, large bed, control panel, flat screen TV. Bottle of Prosecco and a personalised card in the room to wish us a happy anniversary which really made us feel special. The team are lovely and attentive, a special thanks to January for such a great stay. The only negative would be that they take the first nights deposit as well as a £100 deposit upon check in which may take a few days to go back into your bank account. All in all, 10/10.",5,2019,08,06
111,"Elegant hotel, attentive staff, great location","Lovely hotel with attentive staff and a great location, near two tube stations. Can't say enough about Alex, the manager, who helped us sort out a minor glitch upon our arrival.  Would definitely recommend!",5,2019,08,06
111,Great Hotel,"We stayed in the Montcalm Royal London House for 3 nights. It was my wife's birthday , and we recieved an upgrade courtesy of the hotel. As a further lovely gesture , the hotel placed a  birthday card with a lovely bottle of Malbec wine and other assorted complimentary treats in our room. This very nice gesture , and other little items made us feel we were very valued as customers. The room was perfect , clean , and the bed was extremely comfortable , iand we were insulated from the noise of the outside world in a very quiet room. 
The staff were all extremely welcoming , obviously well trained in accomodating customers , and we really felt that the hotel was the perfect location to explore London over the few days we were there. 
Breakfast was just right and set us up very well. The tea/coffee making facility in room was perfect. There is nothing to fault in the quality of the room , the room service , the reception , and overall feeling that we were being extremely well looked after. 
We ventured to the rooftop bar on one occasion - but it was just a bit too busy for our liking. However - its views are amazing!!
Would have no hesitation in recommending the Montcalm Royal London , and we look forward to being back some stage soon. ",5,2019,08,06
111,Club lounge,"Great customer service form Misli and Ana Maria, really made my experience in the club lounge that extra welcome! Really impressed, cannot recommend this hotel enough, great start to my business trip, 

Thank you",5,2019,08,05
111,Superb,"My sister and I visited for her birthday and the stay was exceptional, with lovely little touches like a birthday in the room. The staff are all incredibly welcoming and helpful. We certainly plan to stay there for every London visit going forward. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2019,08,04
111,Amazing Hotel,"I stayed here Saturday 3rd of August to the 4th. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and couldn’t do anymore to help us. We arrived around half 7 after an action packed day in London. We were very quickly checked in and given our room keys with instructions of how to get to our room and floor. Once settled in and ready we went up to the roof top bar where were weren’t actually able to go outside unfortunately which we was gutted about as it was a selling point for me, however the bar upstairs is very lively with beautiful views of London at night. The hotel has spa facilities that we used the following morning, all very clean and staff were fantastic. All very friendly and polite. I came out feeling relaxed. Being a busy working mum to three on top of a full time job and trying to maintain a home with my husband the spa was just what was needed. The location of the hotel is very close to bus routes and tube stations so although not right on the doorstep to local London attractions it’s not too far or long on the Tube. I will be recommending this hotel and be back myself. ",5,2019,08,04
111,"Great vibe, great location ","This hotel is well located with access to 3 underground stations within a 5-minute walk. It is on the vibe-filled Finsbury Square which is a bus-stop to a number of busses.  
The roof-top in this hotel is a popular bar with a great vibe.
The rooms are modern and well appointed with all the controls at finger-point.
The room service was however disappointingly poor in terms of length of time taken for an order to be delivered.",4,2019,08,04
111,Business Stay,"I had booked 4 Junior suites for my colleagues and their partners, we arrived to the Hotel and was immediately greeted by a hostess offering either a glass of prosecco, real lemonade or still water. 
We arrived earlier that the stated time the rooms would be ready but we could start the check-in process and leave our bags in the storage cupboard (they are then in your room when you arrive). 
We then decided to visit the Aviary bar (9th floor) for a drink in the sunshine and see the views of the city, it was busy so we waited for a seat to become available (the 9th floor is also where breakfast is served). 
The room had all the amenities you would require with the luxury addition of Hermes bath products, it also has the full Sky TV package if you wanted to stay in your room for a while!.
We visited the executive lounge on the ground floor as a meeting place and this was a great rendezvous area where we could stop for canapes and drinks. 
We didn't get the chance to enjoy the Spa facilities or restaurant dining, but maybe next time!
I would definitely recommend this hotel for a city stay with easy access to travel links and spitalfields market.",5,2019,08,03
111,Outstanding,"The whole experience was fantastic and the level of service Miguel provided was over and above, very professional and exactly what you would want from a hotel. I had a beautiful room with a roof garden and amazing views. Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2019,08,03
111,Great hotel with few minor issues,"It was my second time staying at this hotel and it was good.
Location is great, very close to Moorgate tube station (Northern line) and walking distance (around 10 minutes) to Liverpool Street (Central line).
There are plenty of great places to eat around the hotel and Starbucks is close as well.
The hotel has few good restaurants/bars, so if you won’t feel like going out to grab something to eat, you won’t starve. Something important to know - one of their restaurants, Burdock, doesn’t accept cash - the bill can be only settled either through charge on your credit card or your room.
The room itself was comfortable (junior suite), with great bed (every day I had a very good night sleep). The bathroom was spacious, with powerful shower (which is what I’m always looking for).
Service was also very friendly throughout my stay.
Although it was a good stay, there are few issues that should be addressed.
I had to make few changes to my reservation and the conversation with hotel was too long and confusing. I have received communication from them through at least 4 different e-mail addresses, which was very frustrating. My suggestion would be to have a single point of contact that would eliminate unnecessary e-mails and would save a lot of time. I’m glad that they still managed to sort the issue out, but it was just bit annoying.
Another thing was the letter (on the picture) that I believe every guest receives. The circled part is what bothered me a little bit. It really feels that they don’t want anyone to discuss on social media if there is an issue with your stay. Maybe it’s just the way this part was worded, but still I don’t find it appropriate.
It should be everyone’s choice to address their concerns in any way they like.
Overall I really liked the hotel and I will definitely stay there again when visiting London next time.",4,2019,08,02
111,50th Birthday Treat,"Stayed at the Montcalm Royal as a 50th birthday treat for a weekend in London from my sons. The hotel was fantastic and contributed to a wonderful weekend. The staff were very welcoming. Flavia, the manageress on duty, upgraded our room, sent macaroons to the room with a personalised birthday message and  booked us in for complimentary breakfast. All in all a memorable stay. Would certainly stay again even if it’s not my birthday!",5,2019,08,01
111,Short trip to London,"I visited the Montcalm Royal House for a short London trip with a friend. Liverpool Street Station is close, so we arrived by Underground. 
To the Hotel: Nice room, good breakfast and polite service.

Definitely will come back in the future!",5,2019,08,01
111,Super,Stayed for one night. Hotel in quiet little corner. Check in was fast and staff friendly. Room was comfortable and good size for London and bathroom clean. Everything worked perfectly- AC was great. Nespresso machine/ tea in room and dish of fruit. Great night sleep- quiet and refreshing. Pool was a little crowded so only had a quick dip and a sauna. Gym was perfectly adequate. To be honest to be able to enjoy these facilities in. London hotel is an added bonus. Hotel was well situated to Liverpool Street tube - 5 mins walk and then a straight hop on the central line to Oxford Street. Had breakfast in club lounge which was also great- no eggs but plenty of bakery fruit etc. All in all a great hotel and would visit again.,5,2019,07,29
111,21st Birthday Night!,"I booked very last minute for my 21st Birthday Night for me and my boyfriend to save the long journey home directly through the website and was very satisfied with the service from all the team we met and very grateful for the surprise upgrade!

Highly recommend! 

Also the bar and restaurant on the roof is amazing!!!",5,2019,07,28
111,Absolutely amazing!,"We cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The staff went over and above to ensure we had the perfect stay. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and the room was immaculate. I visited for my birthday and the staff had provided extra amenities in the room, from sweet treats to a complimentary bottle of wine. The staff genuinely care about you and your stay. The view from the rooftop bar is sublime, the food is fantastic and the building and decor itself is beautiful. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.",5,2019,07,28
111,Amazing customer service and hotel,"What an amazing customer service from the lovely hotel receptionist Georgiana , very welcoming and helpful. Upgraded me to the junior suite free of charge, what a lovely room and hotel will definitely be coming back here. Two thumbs up!",5,2019,07,26
111,"A great hotel, great location and superb staff","Apart from the fact that this is a hotel that lives up to one's expectations (down to the full bottle of water and macaroons in the room), I was taken unwell in the hotel. The front of house lady, Aga, kindly and competently, took me aside, enabled me to spend some time quietly in a busy bar/restaurant without any fuss. She had several groups to feed and water but took the time to look after me.",5,2019,07,26
111,Exceeded my expectations.,"Three nights stay for holidays;

Very modern, comfortable and spacious room. 
Friendly and polite staff.
Cleanliness at it's finest.
Unreal roof-top views from the Aviary Bar/Restaurant at the 10th floor.

Would definitely visit again.",5,2019,07,24
111,Fabulous service and excellent location,"I used the Montcalm as a stop over on my way through London back to Essex after a long weekend away.  I chose the hotel as it had great reviews and was 5 minutes walk from London Liverpool Street.
I arrived around midnight and the staff were so accommodating and friendly which is just what you need after a long day travelling.  I also got a complimentary upgrade.
I will definitely go back and recommend to all my friends!",5,2019,07,23
111,"Once again excellent stay, attentive service","From checkin to check-out the staff is always attentive and service minded. I would definitely recommend a club room as this also offers access to the club lounge. Rooms are spacious and have a strong rain shower, a mini bar, large TV and super comfy beds. The location close to Liverpool street station is a plus. For me, this is the ultimate getaway location when coming to London!",5,2019,07,22
111,Affordable luxury,"I stayed for one night in a deluxe double. Lovely modern room, free smartphone to use. Good mini bar and snacks. Good sound proofing - can't hear other guests. Great little gym, pool and sauna. Stylish and fun roof top terrace and bar. Very polite staff. Two complimentary glasses of prosecco. What can I say, I left content and relaxed. I'll definitely return.",5,2019,07,22
111,Friday/Saturday stay in July,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Montcalm Royal London House - this was the third Montcalm that we have stayed in and the best so far! We splashed out on a nice (Montcalm Club) room as we were celebrating my wife's birthday.

The service from the team was impeccable, from check in to leaving. We loved the club lounge, the spa and our meal at the Aviary - the dinner completely surpassed our expectations. 

The room was extremely comfortable, spacious and beautifully air conditioned.

All in all, an excellent stay and we shall return!

Thanks to all the staff.",5,2019,07,22
111,Amazing birthday trip,"We stayed here for one night for birthday celebrations. Upon arrival the service was quick and efficient. The staff were amazing making sure we had the best possible time. My partner had communicated with Dado and Michael (I think that’s the correct spelling) that it was my birthday, and they decorated the room with petals and balloons, and a personal flower bouquet and ballon for myself. It was so thoughtful and well presented, making the trip even more special. It was lovely. We then see Dado and Michael when leaving and they were both lovely. She made sure we had an amazing time and everything was ok, and explained she was the one who decorated the room. The spa was lovely also, and had a lovely receptionist. Overall I had an amazing time here! Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,22
111,Excellent would recommend 10/10,Excellent Venue and Service for Girlfriends 21st birthday. The staff where extremely helpful especially Georgina and Dado who sent treats and free drink to the room. Spa was amazing and relaxing hotel is very modern. Will definitely be coming back.,5,2019,07,22
111,Superb in every way,This hotel lived up to its reviews without a doubt one of London’s best - i will stay again over and over. The one small niggle is the fitness club purportedly not open 24hrs and i was shouted at whilst exercising early one morning this they must resolve - for the rest its a winner location service rooms etc,5,2019,07,21
111,Weekend away in London,"Having stayed in a lot of hotels in London, I have to say this is the best. From the moment we arrived by taxi to the moment we left by taxi today. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by the duty Manager, January (that’s her name). It felt like we were visiting an old friend. She is amazing. 

Nice and easy check in. She even took us to our room to show us how everything worked. A very smart iPad system on the wall which controls the AC, lights etc. The room was large and tastefully decorated with everything we needed. 

We went to the Aviary roof top bar for a cocktail and to see the views over London. We were offered late checkout, a complimentary continental breakfast. George who was managing the breakfast area this morning was so nice as well. 

We was greeted by January again this morning. She made sure our stay was memorable. Every detail of this hotel has been well thought out and the design is modern yet classic. We couldn’t fault one aspect of this hotel. Customer service was perfect. If you are staying in London, this is the hotel to stay in.

Thank you so much for a fantastic experience 

Mark and Leanne Mascar

don’t be put off by hotel’s location as a tourist to central London.. Moorgate tube station within walking distance and on circle line.
Special shout out to January Stevens (duty manager Sunday 21st July) and duty manager for Friday evening 19th July (I’m sorry I didn’t get his name..) both of whom went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable and memorable. We shall be returning!! ",5,2019,07,21

The room was spacious and modern - the touch pad controls are awesome! The black out curtains were perfect and the bed incredibly comfortable - we woke up feeling refreshed and relaxed. I would also suggest visiting the Aviary roof top bar, perfect for views of London city and great for a instagram picture! Thank you for having us and we look forward to coming back again very soon. 

P.S A special thank you to Tiago and Nicoletta.",5,2019,07,20
111,Excellent hotel ,We have stayed at a few of the Montcalm properties and this is by far the best (the others are great too!). The rooms are really smart with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. We were travelling with our 6 month old baby and the staff really looked after us. In particular Dada went above and beyond to ensure our stay was relaxing and special. Our room was lovely and peaceful. We used the pool and spa too which are great. Will definitely stay again when in the city. ,5,2019,07,20
111,Wonderful stay,"Incredible hotel, the staff are so friendly and will go out of their way to do anything for you.

The staff are so attentive, personable and professional.
Thank he roof top bar despite the rain was excellent.
Clean, comfortable and at a price point that I feel delivers more than what you’re paying for, especially in London.
Upon check out I was looked after by Dobi, who honestly went above and beyond in making sure I was comfortable during my wait at the busy reception, provided me with a drink and a final lovely impression of the Montcalm.
 10/10 will stay here again!",5,2019,07,20

It's a 5 minute or so walk from Moorgate so easy to get to and is well located to reach areas like Shoreditch or the city.  When we arrived the staff were very welcoming and served us with a complementary glass or prosecco and then told us that they'd upgraded us because it was a special occasion - they were really lovely.  The room was clean and well equipped and the roof bar is a cool place to have a drink if the weather is nice - you can see over London for miles around.  We really enjoyed our stay and the staff couldn't have been any more helpful - they were fab.,5,2019,07,20
111,Luxurious hotel in a great location,"Had the pleasure to stay at Montcalm RLH twice in the last three years and both stays have been wonderful. The hotel is conveniently located near Liverpool Street and Shoreditch, with Moorgate station less than a 10-minute walk away. The rooms were spacious and well cleaned; in addition to this, they are equipped with a nifty screen that serves as the main control center for lights/air conditioning/heating and more. Staff was helpful and kind, especially Miguel at reception who helped us in the best way possible. Would definitely recommend",5,2019,07,18

111,Mrs Douglas,"My daughter and I stayed here for Wimbledon Finals weekend. This is a superb hotel. The room was incredibly well appointed and soundproofed within, therefore no noise from the extremely popular rooftop bar was audible. Every effort had been made to ensure comfort and the management provided an extra topper for the mattress (of an already v comfortable bed) as I am pretty arthritic and comfortable hotel beds are difficult to find, this was reassuring. All members of staff were helpful and courteous throughout. My daughter had mentioned that it was a special birthday for me and a delicious cake and bottle of prosecco on ice was waiting for me on arrival. The reception staff were all delightful, but I would especially like to mention Flavia who was extremely attentive. Thank you Flavia, Stefan and all your colleagues for making our stay superb. This hotel deserves its 5 stars and we would definitely return.",5,2019,07,18
111,Amazing hotel,"Attentive staff, amazing atmosphere from the main entrance to the time of check out. We booked room on 8 floor and they gave us upgrade with continental breakfast which was opposite reception. Nice selection of food with professional staff. Specially thanks to Georgi from Club lounge who welcomed us and was friendly, polite and attentive to the details. On the time of check out they offered us to store the luggage due to we had a late flight in the evening and we could walk around London. Definitely we will come back. Thank you Montcalm Royal London House for perfect hospitality! Sam",5,2019,07,14

111,The best staff ever,"The hotel is amazing, but what is really distinguishing the place from all the others is definitely the staff. They were all so incredibly friendly, welcoming and helpful. You expect a good service in a 5* hotel, but they went way beyond that. Everything was simply perfect. 
Special mention to Krasi from the club lounge. She was so nice and friendly. It's definitely worth it to have an access there.
Thank you everyone. See you again.",5,2019,07,12
111,Classy,"The room was comfy and nice! The breakfast was good but ordinary and nothing special - cold continental cut. Coffee in the room! 
The terrace was amazing but closed most of the time. The view is outstanding though. The staff was super nice, the reception ladies Cami and Yan were super friendly and asked me for a coffee while waiting for them to print out my invoices.",5,2019,07,11
111,Lovely Treat,"Beautifully renovated hotel. Super comfy bed. Smart, contemporary decor. Good room facilities - iron and board, tea and proper coffee, effective air con and loved the mood lighting. Even had a smart phone for use during stay. Nice pool and spa area. Smart rooftop bar with great view. Staff extremely friendly. Next time would hope to choose a room with a view.",5,2019,07,10
111,Anniversary stay,"Me and my husband stayed here for our wedding anniversary and the hotel made our stay and our anniversary so special.  When we checked in to our room, we discovered we had been upgraded to a room with two bathrooms and a lounge, they had decorated our bed with balloons and rose petals and we had two fruit platters, truffles and a bottle of Prosecco.  There was a slight issue with the air con whereby it wasn't cooling the room but within 10 minutes of letting them know someone was in to sort it out and it was fine after this.  It was nice to have 2 bathrooms as I do tend to hog it when getting ready so my husband could just use the other one rather than wait like he usually has to!  Toiletries were Hermes and smelt lovely.  The room in general was gorgeous and the bed was super comfortable - we both had perfect sleeps.

We went up to the Aviary and had some nice cocktails up there.  Lovely views and a nice vibe so worth a visit.  We also used the bar downstairs and had a few games of shuffleboard - the bartender explained the rules as we had never played before.  I have to say that all the staff at the hotel were so friendly and their customer service was superb!

Breakfast was up at the Aviary and it finished off our stay nicely having a scrumptious full English breakfast overlooking the city with views of the Shard in the background.

The hotel is well located and we walked to Spitalfields Market and Brick Lane from there which is a good way to spend your day.

Thank you again for making our 5th wedding anniversary a memorable one and we will be back!",5,2019,07,09

The bed was so comfy that my partner had already ordered the mattress topper off Amazon before we'd even left! The staff were brilliant too, really representing what a high end hotel this is.

The bar / restaurant on the roof is well worth a visit, though was a bit too busy on the Friday night for us, but there's no end of alternatives within walking range.",5,2019,07,08
111,Perfect hotel ,"My partner and I have visited London numerous times over the past few years but this time was made special with the help of the hotel. We got engaged whilst in London and the hotel helped to make the stay extra special for us. The staff couldn’t do enough for us, they were helpful, friendly and fantastic in every way. I would like to thank Jada especially for helping to organise a surprise for my fiancé on our return to the hotel following our engagement. You helped me to make our day amazing and that is something I can never thank you enough for. 
The hotel is perfect, we felt welcomed and special from our first moment walking through the doors. Excellent location, food, atmosphere and cleanliness. I would recommend the royal London house to everyone. Thank you all again. ",5,2019,07,08
111,Wonderful way to start our trip,"Excellent stay at the Montcalm Royal for a quick weekend trip in London before we head to France. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. We had had a tea reservation but had to change it and the front desk was able to get us in at The Savoy the following Saturday when we would be back in town when The Savoy had told us it would be a three to four month waiting list.  We were so thankful and delighted.
The rooftop restaurant was wonderful for the food, drinks and atmosphere on a beautiful day. 
Love the touch of the fruit in the room.",5,2019,07,07

111,Great hotel with an amazing staff. ,"Rarely do I take the time to write about a place that I stay at during vacation, but this placed wowed me.  It felt like I was with family. The warmth and care provided by staff people like Flavia and Dado was incredible.  Cool roof top bar and restaurant combined with an awesome pool/ sauna in the basement.

111,A real 5* experience,"I visited London for a few days with a friend and what can I say - since the moment we set foot in the hotel I knew I made the right decision picking it. We were greeted so warmly from the very beginning. It seemed like everyone from the staff were going out if their way to make us feel welcomed and sure they did. The room and the facilities were also amazing. I can't think of anything that was not perfect. However the highlight of the whole experience was the club lounge. We had the pleasure to have access and we definitely took advantage of that. The place has such a great and cozy atmosphere with a very good variety of snacks and drinks to pick from. And what can I say about the staff there - except that they were amazing. They were all so friendly, helpful and welcoming. 
So as an overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone and undoubtedly I would come back myself as well. Thanks to everyone for the amazing experience.",5,2019,07,06
111,Wife's surprise 60th Birthday with family,"Very attentive hotel staff who helped make the weekend a successful surprise family get together. We were upgraded to a mini suite which was a nice touch. The facilities at the hotel are very good but we arrived at midday on a particularly hot Saturday lunchtime & the public bars etc were full to the brim. We did however go up onto the roof terrace on the Sunday & the views over the City skyline are quite spectacular. 
Ps The bed was super large & ultra comfortable !!",4,2019,07,06
111,Amazing Hotel and 10* Experience!,"My partner and I celebrated his birthday at the hotel and the service was second to none. I had been in contact with the hotel and guest experience team ahead of our stay. They were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great time. 

The room was decorated with balloons and rose petals and they were always on hand for any requests we had. 

Don’t even think about it, just book - this hotel is AMAZING, you won’t regret it! I’ll definitely be booking again soon.
Thanks again Flavia and Dado.",5,2019,07,05
111,"Fantastic service, great facilities, room could've been better","Firstly the service at the hotel was exemplary, attentive, personal and very pleasant.  The spa facilities were clean, enjoyable if only a little busy on a Friday afternoon.
We had a club room on the 9th floor - at the foot of the stairs to the Aviary.  This is important - on a weekend, it'll be very noisy outside your room as people come in and also leave (more noisily and drunk).  It's ok if you use the second door inside your room but if I was given the same room, I'd probably request to move (before I'd unpacked in the room!).  
The room itself,  nice and comfortable.  Bed was really nice - soft but lovely mattress. Had a coffee machine, ironing board and plenty of space.
The sofa bed wasn't very comfortable to sit on and was also broken on one of the arms.  The electronic lighting in the room was nice until the system crashed and we couldn't turn on/off the lights.  The shaving mirror/light was faulty and didn't work.  There was also some damp repair to the ceiling that hadn't been completely finished (I did report these on checking out though the receptionist didn't write it down so I bet the next people also have these issues).  These were minor things but not what you would expect in a club room in a 5* hotel.
The club facilities were cool, a private bar area in the evening and a pleasant breakfast in the morning.
The experience was great, a nice hotel with superb service - just make sure you get the right room!",4,2019,07,03
111,Wonderful hotel in the heart of London,"Wonderful hotel with attentive staff.  Beautifully clean rooms and pubic areas. Food in the bar was very good too.  Few minutes walk to tube station.  Though location is walkable for those able to, to lots of places of interest.  Roof top terrace with great views over the city.  Lovely place to sit in the sun with a coffee in the morning. Open till 10pm at night.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,02
111,Amazing breakfast,Had breakfast again at Aviary yesterday and as always it was very busy. Host did a great job finding us a table. The florentine eggs were yummy and great coffee too. Look forward to seeing you next month!,5,2019,07,01
111,Great affordable luxury London hotel,"Stayed here twice now - it is now our go to place to stay in London as other hotels on the same level are £60-70 + more expensive. 
Good location, short walk from tube, staff are amazing, rooms are spotless and spacious. 
We were greeted with prosecco on arrival (no special occasion required!) and nothing is too much trouble. 
Spa is awesome and overall this hotel is excellent value for money. 
Rooftop bar is obviously massive bonus and again - other hotels which are more expensive sometimes don't have one. Incredible views. 

Would book again and again, cannot fault it.",5,2019,07,01
111,Spectacular,"All I can say - wow. From start to finish my stay at The Royal Montcalm Royal London House was exceptional. Warm welcomes when entering the building and friendly staff who couldn't be more helpful. I had the pleasure of staying in a large suite with my partner; elevated on the 7th floor with tremendous views made sure this apartment was luxurious from top to bottom. Can't wait to come back in December, if not a little earlier!",5,2019,07,01
111,Great Service,I visited for my 21st Birthday and absolutely loved my stay. Myself and my friend were made to feel so welcome and we had macaroons brought to the room as a birthday treat. It was lovely and they went above and beyond to make us feel relaxed and comfortable. I thoroughly look forward to my next visit to such a lovely hotel.,5,2019,06,30
111,Very modestly priced luxury,Very warm reception and service + great facilities including Spa access (Pool/Steam Room/Sauna/Treatments/Gym) + Great rooms + Room service/Mutiple Bars/Restaurant/Lounge + great location = winner.  Will return.,5,2019,06,30
111,Best of the best,"Had dinner in Aviary last night with my family and everything was beyond and above my expectations. From the staff to the food, the drinks and the rooftop terrace, everything was just exceptional! Special mention to Anais who was a total sweetheart, will definitely come back.",5,2019,06,30
111,Can't wait for our next visit!,"We've visited many hotels over the years and countless ones in London. This is our new favourite - from the moment we came through the door and were greeted on the steps, a drink in hand 1 minute later right through to the time we checked out. A perfect stay.",5,2019,06,30
111,A fabulous hotel with staff that couldn’t do enough ,"Having just returned from a weekend away staying at the Montcalm Royal London House, I was eager to share what a great experience we had.

From the minute we walked through the door there was a level service applied that you rarely see. 

Reception, concierge and housekeeping staff all polite, courteous and couldn’t do enough to help in any way possible. 

The room so very well equipped with a very large TV and sky. Bed was large and very comfortable.
In our bathroom there was the biggest shower we’ve ever had in any room we’ve stayed in. It was a very large bathroom too.

A great stay which I’m sure will be the start of many in the future.

",5,2019,06,30
111,Excellent Stay in London,"This is the 2nd time I stay at The Montcalm Royal London House, it’s still an excellent experience, room is clean, near under ground station, the best is staff are nice, everyone has smile face, even the door man,  when I stood outside smoking, it was rainy, the door man passed an umbrella to me, very considerable.... I definitely will stay here again next trip.",5,2019,06,29
111,Amazing experience,"Went to the Aviary restaurant for dinner and what can I say, it's just amazing! Lovely cocktails, food is incredible and the view from the terrace are just splendid! Service is outstanding, will definitely come back!",5,2019,06,29
111,Perfect stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for 1 night at a weekend. Our suite (703) was fantastically well appointed with not 1 but 2 full bathrooms, one with a shower and one with a bath; large smart TVs in both lounge and bedroom and nice views over Finsbury Square. We had room service supper on our return from the theatre which was freshly cooked and delicious and breakfast (full English buffet style) in the Aviary Restaurant was very good indeed. There is a public car park literally over the road from the hotel which we found extremely convenient...I mention all of these amenities and features, but what actually made our stay was the level of service from the great hotel team. From the moment we arrived to the second we checked out we were treated like the most important of VIPs. Every request or question was greeted with a friendly smile and a quick, efficient resolution. I overheard other guests asking for some tourist guidance and the concierge went out of his way to ensure that they left the hotel informed and confident about where there were going and how to get there - he was patience personified! We were genuinely impressed by the team at this hotel and I would thoroughly recommend it if you find yourself in the City of London and looking for somewhere to stay.",5,2019,06,25
111,Amazing experience.,"Very helpful & friendly staff, in special Dado. Great experience, definitely going back soon.
Great location, very clean, delicious food, exotic cocktails and great service.

111,Excellent,"Very cozy good place , friendly staff especially the receptionists Dado and Georgiana very helpful , super clean , me and another couple of friends enjoyed the day on the terrace and spent the whole weekend in the hotel",5,2019,06,24
111,Thank you aviary breakfast,"Been coming to the Montcalm for months every 2 weeks. Aviary breakfast has always been great, very busy weekend service and even though it can be hectic, staff and management are always on top. See you in 2 weeks. Thanx Lina for great coffees and Geovanni.",5,2019,06,24
111,Wonderful experience- great service and great location!,"After a warm welcome from Miguel at the reception desk, I had checked me into my allocated room.  I happened to ask if I could have a quiet room as I had a busy few days and needed to some rest. Estefania overheard our conversations and remembered this request from my previous visit to the hotel. Therefore, between Miguel & Estefania they allocated me the perfect room.
The hotel is situated in great location. Minutes from Moorfield tube stations and restaurants and bars very close. With walking distance (10mins) to the City of London Guildhall where I needed. All 
of the staff are very friendly and helpful
",5,2019,06,22
111,Depends....,"This was the first time I’ve stayed in the City in over 30 years. I’m usually in the West End, and have come to know (and seriously appreciate) a couple of hotels there. This, then was a sort of a new experience for me. 

I don’t know if this is the scene (and vibe) there all the time, but I was a little disappointed at the restaurant options – not because of the food, but because the noise was almost thunderous in both restaurants. The restaurant on the roof was so completely over the top that the one night I ventured in there I just couldn’t stay. To be fair, it may have been taken over by a private party. I don’t know, but in that case another day might not offer that kind of experience.

The room was fine – not one of the large rooms I had come to expect from the reviews, but still quite nice, clean, and certainly well-equipped electronically. The bathroom was quite small, but also modern, very clean and very nicely equipped. 

What made my stay there pleasant, and what would bring me back (because there’s no doubt that it’s a convenient hotel if you are in the City), is the staff. Every person I encountered, every time, was A+. It was what you would expect in a Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons. They were really exceptional. ",4,2019,06,21
111,Outstanding service,"Excellent staff from hotel entrance when you just walk in and then to reception, lounge every one was supportive and professional. Camelia, Andrei, Yliceleta, Dorian & Ivan everyone are great and professional. Whenever we will visit london this hotel will be our only option.",5,2019,06,20
111,Awesome Camelia,All the staff were extremely helpful but Camelia was over and above everyone. She paid special attention to making my visit a really great experience. The hotel was spotless and very comfortable. Will be back again for sure,5,2019,06,20
111,Outstanding customer service,All the staff were extremely helpful but Vladot was over and above everyone. He paid special attention to making my visit a really great experience. The hotel was spotless and very comfortable. Will be back again for sure,5,2019,06,20
111,Great customer service!,"We booked this hotel very last minute, having decided to extend our trip to London. We booked online and took the liberty of asking if there would be any chance of an upgrade, as it was my husband's 50th birthday (nothing ventured, etc etc!) On arrival we were offered a glass of Prosecco (this looked like a standard offering to anyone, so bravo if so!) and after check in, a very lovely receptionist took us to our room and I can honestly say she looked as excited as she said she was to see us. The reception team had taken on board our cheeky request and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was huge! As we were settling in, another member of staffed knocked, and presented my husband with a plate of macaroons and a card, which we thought was a lovely touch.  Check out was simple and just as friendly - certainly the three team members we met really seemed to enjoy providing great customer service, and I would definitely return to this hotel, just for that.",5,2019,06,20
111,Will be back,"So nice, staff are so attentive, so much attention to detail. I really enjoyed staying here. 
Lovely location as well, walking distance to old street. 
Didn't get a chance to use all the facilities, but on first impressions, I will be back for more of the 5* Montcalm service! 
A hotel that really lives up to its name!",5,2019,06,19
111,Pre-Arrival Review,"We are about to embark on our bucket list 20th anniversary/Second Honeymoon. Making arrangements to stay at the Montcalm Royal London House was the best such experience I have ever had! Not only are we getting an exemplary Five Star ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ Hotel at 3 or 4 star prices, we seem to be getting the most amazing staff ever! I had special requests for the anniversary and problems planning our day. Jasel at your service, Flavia in Guest Experience and Andrei the head concierge could not have been more professional, warm, gracious, and helpful if they tried!!!!! This may be the highlight of not only our Paris and London Pre-Cruise but our Princess British Isles Cruise itself. My expectations are truly high!",5,2019,06,18
111,Perfect combination for business and leisure,"I've came in London for business and stayed in the hotel for two nights. Starting from the first day everything has been with no faulty from the operations to the catering. Monica and Camelia have been very welcoming upon the check-in. 
The Italian manager showed us all the facilities and when he brought us in Aviary their colleagues had extremely care of us. The food and service was great but the top was the skyline of the entire city and the cocktail bar!
I definitely recommend this little pearl! Thank you",5,2019,06,16
111,"Great Hotel, well worth a visit","Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for my 30th. Had an amazing weekend and the hotel was the cherry on the top. 

The hotel itself is modern, clean and friendly. All staff were eager to help us with anything we needed. We upgraded to a club room which gave is a must. We got access to the club lounge (free food and drink!), a big room with Sky, coffee machine etc etc. The hotel also has a roof top bar (very busy at weekends), spa and gym. It's in a central location, not too far from tube stations. 

A special mention and thanks to the Duty Manager. She pulled out all the stops for us. Some of the best customer service we have received. We will definately be back.  

Thank you",5,2019,06,16
111,Smart hotel,"My wife especially enjoyed playing with electronics in the room which included mood lighting, do not disturb signs, smartphone to borrow. Staff helpful.
A minor disappointment was that the big advertising on 'fruit platter included' turned out to be just three items of fruit!",5,2019,06,16
111,Best experience ever,"Stayed for couple of nights in this hotel for the first time and literally all the staff has been one of the best that we ever encountered in all the hotels that we visited. Everyone from the doorman, guest experience, reception and club lounge was so welcoming that we felt like at home!
Special mention to Alex and Michael the two managers, Georgiana, Gennaro and Georgi the club lounge manager.
All of them made our stay epic!
Thank you Montcalm, we will definitely be back! ",5,2019,06,16

111,Fantastic 5 star hotel,"Incredible birthday I spent with my best friend at this hotel. Rooms were luxury, clean and tidy. Dinner at the rooftop bar was slightly pricey but excellent quality food was delivered so money was not too much if an issue. HUGE thank you to Flavis Dabo who was the guest experience team member. She was fantastic, she made sure that at every single opportunity possible that everything was running smoothly. Flavia set up balloons in the room for my friends birthday and even got her a card. The food was incredible other then breakfast that needs to he looked into... Service however could not be faulted and I can not thank Flavia enough for her excellent service during our stay. She really made us smile every step of the way and people like her make you return time and time again. I hope she becomes manager one day. ",5,2019,06,15

111,Excellent hotel in a great location!,"This was my second stay in this excellent hotel. It is just a few minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station and set in a quiet square.

The mini bar was great. It was my birthday and they left me a birthday card and 4 macaroons with a caramel basket! It was so lovely of them to do this.

Mr&Mrs A",5,2019,06,09
111,Our go to in London!,"This was our second visit to this hotel and we have decided it’s our favourite place to stay in London. 

We stayed in a club room for one night while celebrating our 22nd Wedding Anniversary. On arrival the doorman was welcoming, the reception staff were smiling and efficient as were all the staff we encountered.

The rooms feel clean and modern with spacious bathrooms. It’s so quiet you don’t feel like you are in central London even though Spitalfields market and the eclectic Shoreditch area are a short 5-10 minute walk away. The beds and linen are good quality and the hotel goes that little extra way to make you feel important to them. 

Special mention to Georgiana who made us very welcome and we look forward to returning soon.

",5,2019,06,08
111,Great experience,Great experience and great service. The room was brilliant. The services that the hotel provides are great. And a big thank you to Flavia from customer experience for the perfect organisation of my wishes !,5,2019,06,08

Definitely to recommend to friends and parents. ",5,2019,06,07
111,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! An unforgettable stay in the heart of the city ,"Although I am from the UK, I have been living abroad for the past 15 years and wanted to find a good base to meet up with friends and family whilst in London. I originally chose a hotel nearer shoreditch but then found Montcalm RLH and changed my booking. I didn’t regret it! 

Having stayed in many famous chains throughout Asia over the years, I wasn’t sure how this hotel would compare. I couldn’t compare it- a truly exceptional hotel and experience. From a friendly check in and welcome (thanks to the check in staff, January from the Philippines) to attentive bar staff and porters, I felt like a valued guest. 

The service is not pretentious (which it could be given the quality of the hotel and location) and the rooftop bar & restaurant (AVIARY) is unique with its views of London and the decor. Sadly, I didn’t have a chance to use the pool, but I am sure this would also have been high quality. 

The breakfast had a good variety of food and was also well managed.

I would fully recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a stay at somewhere a bit different than the typical chain hotels and that wants to be close to the action. Walking to Monument, London Bridge etc only took a few minutes.

I will definitely choose to stay at Montcalm RLH next time I stay in London. Thank you to all the staff there and see you next time! ",5,2019,06,07
111,Great accomodation in London,"I have been guest in this hotel during a working trip in London. The hotel is very elegant and nothing to say about the service, very punctual and available. The room are well furnished and high tech. The breakfast is really good and served over a beautiful terrace on roof top.
Recommended for couple ora workers.",4,2019,06,05
111,What an experience!,"An absolutely wonderful stay: faultless! We were treated like royalty by all members of staff from check-in until check-out. Montcalm made a special occasion all the more wonderful. We were especially touched by the hand written note, along with the wine and sweet treats to congratulate us. 
We’re just sad that we only booked for one night - we will definitely be back.",5,2019,06,05
111,Exceptional,"This is a beautiful hotel with amazing staff. We arrived on a Sunday night for a work conference the next day. The rooms were large, airy and beautiful with very comfortable bed and great shower. The Aviary restaurant had a great atmosphere and great food for dinner and breakfast. It is however the staff that make this one of the best hotels I have stayed in. They were exceptional in their helpfulness, friendliness and general customer service. I highly recommend and will definitely hope to return. ",5,2019,06,04
111,Can’t even put our stay in words!,"This was my second visit to the hotel and my goodness did they impress again. The first time myself and my boyfriend were upgraded for my birthday however this time I took my sister as celebration for graduation and we honestly can’t describe how impressed we were. The room we were upgraded to was absolutely incredible, the bed extremely comfortable and floor to ceiling windows with an incredible view. We literally didn’t want to leave the room so ended up ordering in instead of going out. Once again the spa facilities and pool were perfection, perfect after a warm day in the city. Nothing is trouble for the staff here they go above and beyond. I can’t recommend the hotel enough, whenever I come to London the Montcalm will always be where I want to stay. 
Thank you",5,2019,06,03
111,Amazing Stay!!!,"Arrived at this hotel on Saturday for a 1 night stay. We were greeted in reception by a helpful gentleman who took our bags and helped us check-in. While waiting to check in we received a glass of champagne which was a lovely added touch. Once we were checked in we were shown to our rooms and shown how to use all the rooms facilities, this was great as we then knew how to work all the mod-cons!!!

We spent the afternoon in the spa which has a pool and Jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. There are also loungers and lemon water available. Towels are available at Spa reception for guests who are staying at the hotel. 

On arrival back to our room after the spa the room doorbell rang and we were greeted with a beautiful plate of macaroons as  gift from the hotel. Again a lovely surprise. 

Our room had club room access from 5.30pm-8.30pm so we enjoyed drinks and canapes which were delicious. In the evening we ate out at a restaurant but the hotel had a lovely buzz of people queuing go to The Aviary rooftop bar. We requested late check-out and was given until 1pm complimentary.

On checkout the hotel were happy to have our bags while we went out for lunch and we received a 50% parking voucher for NCP Finsbury square which was great!!!

All in all a great stay 10/10!",5,2019,06,03
111,Perfect stay,"Our stay here was one of our best hotel experiences ever. Service was perfect, the rooftop bar had a really good vibe to it. I think the price of the hotel is very good for the servise you get. We’ll definitely be back here.",5,2019,06,02
111,Outstanding,"A beautiful hotel with the most attentive staff. We had some very small issues with our room when we arrive, light bulb here and there etc. The hotel staff dealt with this immediately, they could not apologise enough. We were offered a complementary breakfast, had a bottle of Prosecco brought to our room along with some macaroons! And when we returned at night, a second bottle of wine had been left for us. The issues were dealt with in an exemplary fashion. We would love to stay again and would recommend to anyone.

Very close to the Moorgate tube station.",5,2019,06,02
111,Heidi,"I stay regularly in London hotels for weekend breaks and can honestly this is the best hotel I have stayed in . The staff are amazing, so welcoming and the service first class.

Great specious rooms, comfortable bed, multimedia system works great
Trendy rooftop bar with wonderful view of the city and cool music and atmosphere 
Super eggs Benedict served in the downstairs coffee shop",5,2019,05,29
111,"GREAT team, AWESOME facilities!","The staff were amazing!

We went for our anniversary and Flavia with the assistance of Dado made it a great experience. Alex was the first person we met at the door and despite being new he had a great manner. Valentino was excellent too and helped to take our luggage to the room as well as showing us how to set the ambiance with lighting, air conditioning and the underfloor heating for the bathroom. 

Alex the manager at reception was also excellent and January made checking out another nice experience again with Flavia. This was the BEST service I had received from a hotelier and I can't praise the team enough for the attention to detail, caring approach and willingness to ensure we enjoyed our stay!

The only complaint we had was parking in the area is VERY expensive so the next time we will either use public transport or Uber.",5,2019,05,28
111,Amazing,"All was perfect. The Montcalm’s crew ate very pro and nice. 
The room is very comfortable and the whole hotel is so design. 
And what about the rooftop !!! Incredible view and the cocktails are unforgettable 
Sure we’ll be back as soon as possible",5,2019,05,28
111,"Lovely Hotel, Great Staff","So many hotels to choose from and what a feeling when you know you got it so right. A lovely hotel in a great location, fab staff and a great terrace bar. I would highly recommend. Special thanks to Flavia and Camelia for really wanting to make our stay memorable. Would definitely go back. With so much to do and see didnt get chance to use the Spa facilities and pool - next time!",5,2019,05,28
111,"Always amazing, a must stay hotel.","Every time we stay here we always have the best stay they go beyond for their guests.

The first time we staid here was just because and we fell inlove with the beautiful hotel. 

The second time was my boyfriends birthday so we wanted it to be special, we added on the breakfast for downstairs and well my partner is very picky and ended up wanting to go upstairs they accommodated this straight away with a phonecall letting them know we where on our way up, they even put in sweets and a card into our room.

The third time was Valentines day, this day they had wine on arrival a very good touch seeing as all where couples.

This time its for my own birthday and once again we where given an upgrade (you don't need one all rooms are beautiful) but it was a lovely touch for us, not letting it down once again sweets and a card where in the room.

honestly they are consistently amazing staff always friendly and happy to help with anything they can.

Its a must stay! don't think twice. we make it our special occasion hotel! ",5,2019,05,27
111,Superb!,"Stayed for a special birthday, was upgraded and had drinks on arrival. Dado and Miguel + there team were superb. Excellent location and very nice spa / pool facilities. Will definitely stay again - Highly recommend!
",5,2019,05,27
111,Perfection...,"Not really sure how to some up in words how amazingly helpful and generous this hotel and the team behind it are! We stayed here this past weekend for our wedding weekend in Shoreditch. 

In the run up to our special day we had a few things that needed organising such as extra chairs in the morning if so the bridesmaids etc could all get there hair and makeup done together. Not only did the team help with this upon our arrival we were pleasantly surprised with an amazing upgrade on the 7th floor looking out over the square. The room and its facilities were amazing! My now wife!... took a video she was soo happy and excited by the room! So much space for her and the girls to get ready! I was jealous I didn’t get the stay in the room on the night before the big day but she did! 

But seriously everything about this hotel from start to finish is brilliant or as I say in my title perfect. From the moment you step out of your car you are treated like a VIP and welcomed into the hotel, through to the easy and friend check inn. 

I had a special requested which was to surprise my wife to be on the morning of with a diamond necklace as a wedding day present. The events team were so helpful, when I arrived they simply said rest assured we will sort it out and wow did they! They set the necklace within a silver platter covered it with roses and took it up to her room pretending to be room service! I hear there were tears which isn’t great as the girls were getting there make up done at the time but you can’t buy that extra service - they just really put the cherry on top! 

So if you are thinking about staying here don’t think just do it you won’t regret it! 

Just a quick special thanks to Miguel, Este Fania, Flavia & Dado! Really we thank you for making our wedding weekend and stay more memorable! See you next year for our anniversary! ",5,2019,05,27
111,Most incredible stay - blew my mind,"After messaging to say we were staying for a special occasion we were welcomed to the most incredible upgrade, up to a suite... and ice pop cocktails on arrival! .The room was incredible and welcomed us with macaroons & fruit quickly followed by a bottle of Prosecco delivered to our door. The staff were amazing and so friendly - Dado & her team went above and beyond for us and we had an amazing stay. The roof top bar is a great way to start a night in soho & the breakfast the perfect way to start a Sunday. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for an amazing bank holiday weekend.",5,2019,05,26
111,Exceptional in all areas,"Our only regret is that we could only stay one night! From the moment we approached the grand entrance to check out, we were lavished with comfort and exceptional customer service. Camelia exceeded all expectations for customer service as did the other staff. I loved being greeted with a glass of bubbly and being upgraded to the most gorgeous room which had everything you could possibly want or desire. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel not only for its luxurious feel and first class customer service but also for its incredible value for money. We are already planning our return visit!",5,2019,05,26
111,Great hotel and cheaper than a cab home !,"Stayed here last minute for a night out in London , great downstairs bar and roof top bar. Room was clean and new. Staff were all fantastic . 25 quid per person is a bit steep for breakfast but this area of the city is a tad quiet on weekends so it’s a captive audience  but overall Would definitely use again ",5,2019,05,25
111,Most amazing experience ever,"I visited the hotel and had the most amazing experience there. It was my husbands birthday and they arranged everything so perfectly. I dealt with Dado From guest experience, Camilla who was the manager for reception and Tsvetomir who was apart of the maintenance team. Definitely will be coming back best hotel experience I have ever had. Very friendly very attentive and very funny petiole who love to help. I am so happy I chose this hotel in particular to host this the food, spa and roof experience was amazing. 

Thank you again Montcalm!!!

111,Great choice,Lovely hotel in a great central location. Rooms are very clean and comfortable with everything you might need and a huge cosy bed with crisp sheets. I asked for an early check in and a late check out and it wasn’t a problem. Also has a great rooftop bar/restaurant with beautiful views of London skyline. The hotel is very reasonably priced for the location and the quality. Ticks all the boxes for me and I’m quite picky. Will most certainly be staying again.,5,2019,05,25
111,great service and well equipped bedroom,"helpful and efficient team from reception to rooftop bar. delicious food and very accommodating bar team, restaurant was closed early due to bank holiday so we went to the bar and got the last order!
loved the spacious and powerful shower. Tricky to have silent night in central London, because of the noise, reception helped to move room although we haven't asked for help.",5,2019,05,24
111,Brilliant hotel,"Our 5 day stay was a combined retiral/ birthday gift from our daughter in a club room . The hotel and facilities were excellent at all levels . What made our stay really good was the excellence of all the staff . We would like to give a special mention not only to the professionalism but to the  warmth of our reception from  Nico and Estefania on our late arrival , they suceeded in making us feel special which would make us return to the Montcalm.",5,2019,05,23
111,One night in London,Amazing view in the room. I could admire the view from my bed. A cup of cava to welcome me and a dinner at the hotel in the last floor where there is a rooftop that was perfect for such a nice weather,5,2019,05,22
111,One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had,"- Staff are exceptionally attentive. 
- Location is fantastic. 
- Quality of the hotel impeccable. 
- Great spa and gym included. 

I stayed one night on a business trip. I haven't been this impressed by a hotel ever - only ever writing a review when something is outstanding. I travel to London once every 6 weeks and will certainly make this hotel first choice.",5,2019,05,21
111,Always brilliant,"I stay at this hotel regularly for business and can say that from the moment you check-in the staff are fantastic and very accommodating. The communal areas and rooms are lovely with great modern facilities...touchscreens, underfloor heating, Hermes toiletries etc. Great location, very close to Liverpool St and the open air Aviary Bar rounds off a hard day nicely",5,2019,05,20
111,Birthday getaway ,"2nd time of staying at the Royal London, this time for 2 nights! 2nd time in a club room. This time the club room was smaller than the first which was a little disappointing considering we stayed for 2 nights not one as the first time.Celebrated our birthdays and this was celebrated by a bottle of wine and balloon being brought to the room. The club lounge is very worthwhile and never busy, a relaxed atmosphere. We also fined at the aviary, whilst pricey it was an excellent meal. We went to the spa, it was quite busy this time around so we didn’t stay long. All in all, a good visit, would have been nicer to have the bigger room or a room with a view. Maybe next time! ",4,2019,05,20
111,Very nice hotel,"We want to thank Camelia for the good services provided.She helped us a lot and her attitude was very nice. The hotel and services were very good.
The rooms were nice and comfortable. The location was also good and convenient.
Best regards,",5,2019,05,20

111,Literally amazing,"Booked a nights stay for my boyfriends birthday and the staff at the Montcalm went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and that it was special. The lady at reception Flavia Monica - is honestly one of the sweetest girls I’ve ever come across! So attentive and lovely. I would stay here again just because of the people at the reception! Treated to two glasses each of champagne on arrival! The room was so lovely, underfloor heating in the bathroom and jars of sweets with a fully stocked mini bar it was literally amazing! The only thing I wish would have changed was the fact that the TV would only go up to a volume level of 40 and I just couldn’t work the nespresso machine properly for the life of me but on our way home Flavia got us both a latte to take away and honestly there’s just so many small things that made this stay memorable and made us feel special. We woke up late and didn’t get to use the spa which I was gutted about but they still said we could use it even after check out, but it’s a shame as we had to go home anyway. Love love love.",5,2019,05,19
111,Business ,Excellent service from the front desk: Estefania and Camelia from Montcalm Royal London House. They went above and beyond to try to make my stay as comfortable as possible.

111,5* hotel,"I highly recommend this 5* hotel. The customer service as soon as you walk through the front doors right up until the conclusion of your stay is fantastic, the staff work so hard and always with a smile on their faces and so helpful. We stayed in a deluxe double room which was spacious with great facilities, bed and pillows very comfortable. In the evening we went to The Aviary rooftop bar, delicious food and cocktails, and again 5* customer service. Special thanks to Estefania on reception and Flavia for my complimentary bottle of wine in our bedroom as a birthday treat for me! I’ve already recommended this hotel to my family and friends and we will be returning. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable. 🎂🍾🍸",5,2019,05,18

111,"Great stay, fantastic staff, brilliant location",We stayed for a weekend travelling for leisure as a couple.  The staff were exceedingly friendly from the off which only added to the experience.  The hotel is conveniently located for underground stations and it was straightforward to get there from Gatwick via London Bridge.  Don't miss the roof top bar.,5,2019,05,16
111,Excellent rooftop bar & hotel in city of London. ,"Visited the Aviary with friends, such a wonderful place with amazing views and service. Been looked after and nothing was too much.

111,Fantastic Hotel!,"I stayed in may for a night for my partner and my joint birthday trip away from our children. well, what can I say, they went beyond my expectation and more. The location, room, and all the staff are fantastic. they put birthday balloons in our room and gave us lovely macaron plus red wine. We called them before to require to provide us a vibration alarm as we're both deaf, we did get good equipment to ensure our safety stay. Thank you!! will definitely stay again!",5,2019,05,14
111,Wonderfully surprised and grateful for the service ,"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and job promotion, and were upgraded upon check in. All staff were attentive and courteous in providing top notch customer service (which is somewhat lacking in some 4 or 5 star hotels). We hope you’ll maintain your good standards and treat all guests alike; not just the VIPs. It’s the small gestures that often sets one property apart from the others. ",5,2019,05,13
111,Fantastic service,"I came to this hotel as a first time visitor, for a one night stay in a Junior Suite with two friends, to celebrate our 50th birthdays. The hotel is lovely with a beautiful roof terrace and nice little spa, though what made our stay really exceptional was the service we received - just amazing from start to finish! All the staff were so friendly and helpful. We totally loved our stay and would definitely go back.",5,2019,05,13
111,"Excellent hotel - excellent service, very accommodating","We came for one night - first time visitors. Excellent first impressions of hotel and room - there was only one problem - my wife was specifically hoping for a bath tub and our room only had a shower. Very quickly the front desk sent up a man to show us an alternative room which ended up being on the top floor - floor to ceiling windows (much better skyline views) and was more of a junior suite with a connecting room to an additional lounge area and a full extra bathroom - this time with a tub. 
Staff were very diligent throughout rest of our stay - thank you to Dada on front desk especially",5,2019,05,12
111,Can’t wait to return!,"The service there is amazing, every single member of staff is warm and welcoming. The rooms are great, we got a complimentary upgrade and the suite was big and amazing! The restaurant & rooftop terrace is also a great vibe and we really enjoyed our time. The pool at the spa can get cramped which was annoying but the facilities are really nice regardless. Overall a great visit!",5,2019,05,12
111,Wonderful!,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. The hotel was perfect and the staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful, providing us with drinks upon arrival and taking our luggage up to our room whilst we sat and enjoyed our Prosecco. We loved the spa facilities and enjoyed a brilliant massage too. A big thank you to Camelia! Can’t wait to go back.",5,2019,05,11
111,Made our stay very easy,This hotel was able to make our trip very comfortable.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere a little bit special.  We saw Krasi a few times and she was very helpful and a real highlight of the stay :) everything was taken care of for us and our trip was very straight forward. Until next time Krasi and the rest of the staff.,5,2019,05,11
111,Excellent,It was my second stay at the hotel and I got upgraded to a Junior Suite which was most welcome after 2hrs of delayed flight and hard day at the office. Perfect location for meetings.

111,"Great hotel, great service","Lovely hotel close to what we wanted to see in London, will hopefully be back! Club Lounge was a good addition and Krasi made us feel very welcome while we were there.
I have travelled quite a bit and this hotel is definitely one of the highlights.  Staff were all great but when we go back, hopefully Krasi will be there to look after us again :)",5,2019,05,08
111,Fabulous hotel with an amazing rooftop bar/restaurant,"We had an amazing stay at the Montcalm Royal London House on 19th April 2019.  The staff could. not do enough for you (especially Flavia).  We stayed over the Easter period and Flavia told our teenagers to help themselves to the chocolate goodies which were part of an amazing Easter display in the reception area.
The hotel is very clean and there are wonderful perfumed aromas around the reception/lobby areas. We stayed in the quad rooms as we have two teenagers which were spacious, and very modern.  The bathrooms were also spacious and  beautifully designed.  There is also a complimentary smartphone which guests can take out and use whilst sightseeing.  This is really handy. 
The restaurant and rooftop bar really made our stay special.  The food is great and the views from the terrace are fantastic.  There was a great atmosphere.  We also had use of the Club Lounge, again this is a fantastic perk where you can get drinks, snacks and breakfast (if this option comes as part of your room package).
The hotel ensures there are plenty of staff around when checking in/out to make the process run smoothly (again, nothing is too much trouble).  It also helps that there are complimentary glasses of fizz handed out to you.
The hotel is also in a convenient location, with bus stops and the tube only a few minutes walk from the hotel.  
We cannot praise this hotel enough and we are going again in the summer.",5,2019,05,08
111,"Great Hotel, Great Service, Cool Vibe!","Had a great stay recently at the Montcalm Royal London.

111,Absolutely Sublime,"My partner and I, had the most amazing time at the Montcalm hotel. It was really a place where paradise was reached. Thanks the brilliant customer service by Flavia and Camelia. They went above and beyond to make it special for the both of us, which I appreciated a lot. Exquisite food and rooms. I guarantee that we will be coming back to the Montcalm Royal London House Hotel again. I have so much memories to add on during the day and the Hotel was a definite main factor of it all. Mine and my partners gratitude goes out to the team. They will be forever remembered. I'm glad she enjoyed it, she couldn't stop smiling the time that we spent there. All thanks to everyone who was involved. :)",5,2019,05,06
111,Great hotel with the best service and staff.,"It has been the best hotel I've stayed in until now.  The staff's response when in trouble became one of the great memories of the trip!  Thank you.  A clean and stylish space in the room.  The hotel has a pub, a spa and a sauna, making it very comfortable.  There are various stores around, and it is convenient.  It is a wonderful area where you can taste the new London.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  I will always stay when I go to London.  Thank you very much.",5,2019,05,06
111,A great surprise,"The architects who converted this old brewery into a hotel did a great job.

111,Amazing Service and Hospitality ,"Spent 6 nights at the hotel with my family. The stay at the hotel was really pleasant with spacious, well maintained rooms and quick service. The lounge near the reception was fabulous to relax over with some great snacks and drinks along with polite and excellent service from the staff especially Krasi. The spa area is great and relaxing. Would definitely visit again and recommend this hotel to others.",5,2019,05,03
111,A marshmallow bed and the wow factor!,"I was greeted at the steps to the hotel, my bag was whisked off and I was guided to the reception. I was granted an immediate upgrade and was really pleased when I saw the junior suite. The hotel is lovely and I enjoyed all the gadgets like mood lighting. The bed was like a huge marshmallow. The duvet and pillows like clouds and I was really comfy. The little details count, from the extra plush slippers to the wonderfully scented toiletries, the fresh fruit and the complimentary mobile and taxi ordering service.
The best thing about the hotel was the customer service. Fabulous staff from the door, to the reception, to the bar and restaurant.  The £15 glass of Chablis was a bit of a shock, but on the whole, a wonderful experience with the WOW! factor at every stage. Thank you for the pleasant stay, Montclam.",5,2019,04,30
111,Another Great Stay,From the time I arrived to be greeted with a big smile on the doormans face and then to be offered a nice cool glass of prosecco. The whole experience is special and the staff always seem to go that extra 10% to ensure that my stay is just simply perfect.

They go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and more! Will definitely be back again next time we visit London!",5,2019,04,29
111,Birthday weekend in London ,"We were in London this weekend for our joint birthdays and it was perfect, from checking in on Saturday to when we left at lunchtime today. 

Greeted with a glass of very nice prosecco while we waited to be seen on arrival as it was a little busy but we didn't have to wait very long.

Fidel checked us in and very kindly gave us free club lounge access plus breakfast for the duration of our stay which was a lovely treat.

The room was lovely, had everything we needed and extremely comfortable.

Staff were very accommodating and we had room service which arrived within the timeframe promised and delicious! 

We will definitely look to stay here again when in London. 

Keep up the good work! 

We have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world and this is up there with the best. 

Keep it up!

111,A Birthday Stay ,"A truly magnificent stay had at the Montcalm. Hotel is situated in Finsbury Square which was a tube ride from central London and actually quite peaceful compared to the hustle and bustle of London. We stayed for one night for my birthday and was greeted in the room with a selection of cakes saying Happy Birthday and a handwritten card from the staff. The room was immaculate with views of the city and was quiet and ultra modern. Really enjoyed the little touches such as the Elemis toiletries, the mood lighting and the TV facilities. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in at a hotel, you just kind of sink into it. Waterfall shower, really spacious and a few different options to suit your pressure preference. The room was spacious. Worth a visit is the rooftop bar just for the views, admittedly we went on a Friday night so it was busy and a few guests were quite lary but were swiftly moved on. Little windy so pack a coat if going outside of summer! The staff were beyond helpful, they went above and beyond to check we were comfortable and well looked after. Even offered to make us a cup of tea as there was a short queue for checkout. Beautiful place, worth the price and excellent service. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2019,04,29
111,Great hotel,"The stay at Montcalm Royal London House was one of the best experiences we had. The staff is amazing, helpful and coming forward to satisfy customer's needs. We recommend this hotel 100% for a stay in the City but outside of the usual rush and noise. The hotel has lots to offer, we used the pub to have some vegan food, roof top bar to enjoy views with a nice cocktail at hand. Did not have a chance to try breakfast but went to the top floor to enjoy some sun while breakfast was served and it looked very nice. Rooms are nice and clean, beds comfortable. There are usual things you would expect from a hotel room there. We had a great stay.",5,2019,04,27
111,Miss,"I absolutely love staying at this hotel. It never disappoints! 
Amazing customer service from Claudia who checked us in and checked us out! She was so kind and friendly and really made the stay even more special.  She really cared about our stay and was eager to find out if we enjoyed our visit. This is by far the warmest greeting I’ve received at a hotel.",5,2019,04,26
111,Exceptional,"Stayed here during Easter weekend, fantastic hotel and service. We was met by cameila at the check in desk, who upgraded us to a suite which we found excellent. Really genuine staff and happy to help, great location and easy to get around. Spa facilities was very good and overall enjoyed our time here, highly recommend to stay here if ever in London. Ask for cameila.",5,2019,04,26
111,Great room but...,The hotel is nice and the rooms are breathtaking but the beds are some of the worst I’ve come across in a long time. Think old cheap spring mattress. I don’t understand why they spent so much of everything in the room but went cheap on the mattress? The automation of the lighting and a/c was impressive but it had a software issue in the morning and shutdown. The location was very nice. ,4,2019,04,25
111,Birthday Weekend In London,"Fabulous stay at the Montcalm, wonderful welcome and amazingly luxurious facilities. 
The room was very clean and had everything and more we could have wanted. 
The roof top breakfast was incredible. 
Location was perfect and the staff were very helpful in arranging things for us.
Already looking forward to returning!",5,2019,04,24
111,First class hotel,"We stayed at this hotel about  a year  ago  and had a wonderful stay although we had a small problem at breakfast time due to a celebrity booking the top floor outside as nobody was allowed there- I was very disappointed and complained - the manager at the time apologised and said that they would put it right if we stayed again - 
So I booked the hotel with the manager  Michael he brought up all my information on computer and said he would make sure he would look after us - we arrived and Michael greeted us on arrival - and did he do us proud upgraded us to a suite on 7th floor  an£ with free breakfast too - the room was stunning - my wife said she has never seen a hotel,room so clean - now that’s  a compliment!  The staff/ team were excellent in every department - we have stayed in some top hotels over the world - but this is the best it caters for everybody - a big thank you to Michael (Manager ) fantastic job sir congratulations to you and your staff
Mr and mrs Ashwell hope to stay again soon",5,2019,04,24
111,London Holidays,"We stayed at Montcalm Royal London House for 6 nights. Superb Elegant & Spacious Rooms with open views of London Skyline. Specially the roof top bar is to die for. The staff is very friendly and helpful in all ways. Specially Miss Camelia at the front desk was so helpful and polite full of light gesture and smiles. A superb person at heart. Also Mr.Goerge and Krasi at the lounge opp the reception were very polite and all the time serving with a smile.  
Would recommend a stay and I would also repeat to come back to the property soon. 
Bunty Vohra (Saranjeet Singh Vohra)",5,2019,04,24
111,Loved it ,"Stayed here for the Easter bank holiday after staying last month too. Both times were special occasions and the hotel catered very well and made our stay really special . 
Reception staff are so lovely, Dado especially ensuring everything was perfect for me and my boyfriend and going above and beyond. 
The facilities are clean, roof top terrace such a good hot spot in the sun and the location surrounded by tube stations. 
Will defiantly return time and time again!! ",5,2019,04,24
111,Good Venue for City Break,"Only stayed one night as we were in the City of London for the weekend.
Location was great with good access to nicer part of London. The hotel is extremely welcoming with all staff from the Doorman right to reception (which was a tad slow). Very smiley and chatty.
We booked a suite, which was 'nice' but for a suit i would've expected it to be roadside and not facing into a courtyard of air-con ducts, it was also abit dark.
It was though well equipped, with everything you would need. Good mini bar (not free), but only 1 bottle of free water for 2 people in the room.....?
The Aviary bar we went for a coffee and was lovely, although the layout was a bit odd. I also would think that patrons to the hotel get priority which wasn't the case. I did hear guests complaining about the amount of people up there and waiting for 20 minutes for a drink, which resulted in walking out? 
Overall a really great hotel, well priced and great position. But be wary of your room and whats its facing.
Would return definitely.",4,2019,04,23
111,Anniversary Stay,"Fantastic nights stay, the room was upgraded on arrival at no extra charge and was also provided with some cakes etc in the room for our anniversary. Loved the rooftop bar, the weather was also great so perfect night stays. Brilliant service from all the staff, friendly, very helpful and polite. Only very minor negative was the room was quite warm even with the air con on full power but we managed okay.",5,2019,04,23
111,Amazing Getaway,"I checked in with a welcome drink of Prosecco quickly followed behind, I had previously phoned the hotel to organise something special for the room as we were celebrating a birthday and it did not disappoint. Dado on reception make us feel extremely welcomed and looked after us the whole stay. Definitely found a favourite hotel in London.",5,2019,04,23
111,Fab Hotel,"This is a great hotel, the room was very spacious, good bed and huge TV. They also left some fruits and Easter eggs for us on the table. 
The spa, a bit small, but has everything you need and looks beautiful. 
The staff in the reception are great as well. I had the pleasure to meet DADO, she was so nice and accommodating, very pleasant and friendly. 
Will definitely go back.",5,2019,04,23
111,Quiet oasis in the busy city,"This is a lovely, contemporary hotel tucked in the back corner of Finsbury square. It has an open top bar to take advantage of the city views. Superb lighting throughout the hotel, 3 very popular bars, one with a snooker table.

We paid for the Club twin room and because this was a trip to celebrate my daughters birthday we had an immediate upgrade. The room had plenty of space, very clean and modern with views over the small park area. We were treated to bottled water, cake, strawberries with chocolate and fruit in our room on arrival.

We had access to the club lounge which offered continental breakfast, drinks, tea and coffee. They also put on a few nibbles and free drinks in the evenings. To take advantage of this you must book direct with the hotel and not through any other booking site. Even though booking.com say you have access to the lounge by booking the Club room, according to the hotel this is not so. Book direct to be sure as it is a valuable extra in an expensive hotel. 

The spa was wonderful and early morning (7.15am) I had the place to myself. Jacuzzi, decent size pool with swimming jets (button is at the far end of the pool, one on either side of the waterfall pipe. Also steam and sauna rooms. 

Special mentions to Camellia and Krasi from the club lounge who made us feel welcome and special guests. 

",4,2019,04,22
111,Amazing ,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was just amazing. We were greeted with a warm welcome, the welcome drinks on arrival were a nice touch, we were then taken to our room with the bags brought up later for us. Inside the room was champagne fruit and some little sweet treats. 

I had a massage and it was one of the best massages I have ever had. I highly recommend having one while you are there! 

Lastly I just want to say a big thank you to everyone. The staff went above and beyond during our staff. In the restaurant I didn’t like my starter the next thing I knew the waiter was bringing me a completely different one at no charge or anything. Both my husband and myself felt like VIPS the experience was something we will never forget. ",5,2019,04,22
111,so luxurious!,Just had a lovely 2 night stay. Everything was perfectly clean and the facilities were fab. Loved the prosecco when we arrived was an excellent touch! Only problem we experienced was a rude cleaner who was very impolite but other than that all the staff were lovely and helpful especially the doorman he always remembered us and had a smile. ,5,2019,04,22
111,lovely hotel and hospitality,"Experience: Second time staying here and overall amazing. Dado and Flavia from guest experience made sure that our stay was extra special - we were upgraded to a huge room with nice touches, and my sister had a lovely surprise. They organised everything in advance and the service we received from all staff throughout our stay was perfect. 

Hotel: very busy and quite rowdy (easter weekend), the rooftop bar was extremely busy and there was a queue. I do think the hotel should prioritise hotel guests in times like these because it wasn't that pleasant when there are drunk people walking in and around the hotel. The spa was very nice though.

Room: we were upgraded to a massive business suite. All the usuals for a 5 star, however the smart technology was a bit slow. 

Overall, I recommend this hotel for its service and atmosphere (young, fun, classy).",5,2019,04,21
111,Amazing stay.....,"Having stayed in some 30 plus hotels in recent months....this hotel deserves a standout review. The location is superb, the rooms are second to none. The bed quality and comfort combined with the superb linen and super pillows....the sleep quality is awesome. 

I had the breakfast buffet twice here. Served on the 10th floor with great city views. Food was tasty with a range of hot and cold items. Cappuccino was excellent. 

What makes that hotel special though is it's staff. They maintain a strong standard with a great balance, all of whom were friendly, welcoming, professional and competent. A real air of quality with a warm manner also. 

Well done Montcalm RLH. I can't wait to come back.",5,2019,04,21
111,An honest review ,"Just got back from staying at this hotel, on arrival the building is beautiful and huge, it’s easy to get to from kings cross just get off at Moorgate tube turn right and keep going straight!

Once inside the hotel is lovely with bright lights and a massive reception, we got no welcome drinks but had our room upgraded. On arrival we had to pay £150 incase of any damages? Not sure if that’s now been refunded or what but it’s a bit excessive at the start of your holiday.. could have been used for spending money but anyway.

Shown into our room it was on floor 7 with a beautiful view of the city, you could see the shard! Shower was lovely, nice toiletries and heated floor.

When we first got there the room was absolutely boiling!! Air con is easy enough to use if it stays on but be prepared to feel sweaty on a night!

We got two little boxes of chocolates for my birthday, they were soooooo nice! Thank you for that!

The bed is quite big but really comfy with plenty of pillows and a nice big duvet.

The spa is absolutely beautiful but what I would say is advice people which lifts to use to get to the spa because if you use the ones closest to the hotel entrance you end up getting a lift full of drunks, vile.

The pool is lovely and big with huge jets of water and the hot tub is really hot! Sauna isn’t too hot and doesn’t really do a lot but the steam room is probably the nicest ones we’ve been to! Nice having the fruity water ready after you’ve been in there!

Ok so the last day and this is what has taken the star off the review because I really do think a 5 star hotel should NOT be allowing random business workers, obnoxious, snobby, vile people into the building to get drunk and cause a scene. People have paid a reasonable amount of money to stay here and the last night was an absolute joke!! Drunk men getting thrown out and hitting the door staff, being so violent! Drunk women slapping the staff and falling on the floor shouting and swearing things like “you’re dead” a little boy was crying and people couldn’t get out the door, the door staff handled the group very well and are a credit to the hotel but my advice would be don’t let none hotel guests up to the aviary - you wouldn’t have this from guests, I know a hotel has to make money but surely you get enough from actual guests. The drunk people in the lifts shouting and screaming, running around is an absolute joke, it’s supposed to be 5 star? Maybe charge entry for none hotel guests and it would stop the problem. We couldn’t even get a drink because it was so busy and full of these awful people. 

The hotel is lovely but there’s a few things for me that stop it being a 5 star. 

",4,2019,04,21

111,Amazing Time & an amazing service,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Montcalm Hotel for a weekend retreat over Easter. We were wonderfully greeted at the door and handed champagnes at reception. Dada the Guest Experience Manager was Absolutely Amazing! Her hospitality was wonderful and we felt welcomed and relaxed from the moment we walked in. The checkout experienced with her was equally pleasant. She was keen on making sure that we had a good stay and that we were taken care of. It was truly a luxurious standard and the staff make the experience worthwhile! They are attentive to their customers and are very hospitable. Simoné from the Aviary restaurant was very funny and made our dinner experience very pleasant! 
We will totally book again and we can’t wait to be back!",5,2019,04,20
111,Definitely coming back! ,"      This is our third time staying at Montcalm and it’s our favourite place to stay when in London.The rooms are always incredible . The rooftop bar was great. The staff is super helpful and great with directions or recommendations.A great thanks to Dado who warmly greeted us at our arrival and went to all lengths to make our stay an incredible one. She  really made the whole stay extra special! We will surely be choosing Montcalm when we return to the city!",5,2019,04,19
111,Great service,"Another great stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. This is now our sixth visit (third this year) and it never disappoints. The staff are wonderful - at reception, in the club lounge, and the friendly cleaning team. A special thanks to Dado who went out of her way to make our stay comfortable - she is a real gem. The hotel was spotlessly clean as always, and room service ordered at 4am was hot, delicious and very well received! We had a relaxing few hours down in the spa too! One of - if not the - best value hotels in London.",5,2019,04,18
111,"FANTASTIC, AMAZING, EXCELLENT","Me and my boyfriend stayed here for my birthday and from start to finish it was simply amazing! The staff are exceptional and not only did they upgrade our room which was a surprise, they had a birthday plate of goodies awaiting for me in our room! 
ALSO they helped my boyfriend create the perfect setting to propose to me on the terrace of The Aviary and of course I said YES!!!! 
I cannot put into words how thankful I am to the staff in the hotel and restaurant as they have helped to make this such a special memory!! 
We will certainly be staying again!",5,2019,04,17
111,Great service in the Club Lounge,"Visited the Club Lounge several times during my stay. Many thanks to Krasi for her lovely attentive service in the Club Lounge advising on my options, ensuring sufficient food was available and providing a nice decaf coffee.",5,2019,04,17
111,Short and sweet,"Had the pleasure to stay at your wonderful property for one night, unfortunately it was cut short from the original 3 nights due to a family emergency! 
Needless to say, the stay was exceptional, rooms were fully loaded with all the high tech gadgets that one would expect, modern, airy, high ceilings, a very lovely room!
Staff were the best part of this all, very understanding and appreciative of the circumstances and I commend them on their real human appreciation for assisting in the circumstances and I can only speak highly of them, especially the night manager and manager in the morning I spoke with. 
This has definitely placed this property high on my list for future stays in London. 
Most grateful for everything and look forward to staying much longer at your property in my upcoming visits.",5,2019,04,16
111,Krasi - montcalm royal house of London,"tayed at the montcalm royal house of London and had access to the club lounge.  The hotel is great, however, the club lounge experience was exceptional.  Had the pleasure of interacting with Krasi who provided an exceptionally high level of service!  I've stayed at numerous high end hotels and none compare to the level of service provided by Krasi. Krasi provided helped turn a mundane work trip into a great experience.  I highly recommend the montcalm and Krasi!",5,2019,04,16
111,good friendly service,"On arrival (Fri) there was free processco welcoming drinks offered to guests.  Krasi was most helpful, pointing out different areas of the hotel.
The receptionist who checked me in remembered me on check out.",5,2019,04,16
111,Review of hotel,Only gave 5 stars because Krasi is the best. Exceptional service! Went to get drinks every night and never regretted it. Love the atmosphere and location (super convenient for our particular trip) but seriously krasi is the best.,5,2019,04,15
111,Perfect!,"Great experience for a ‘special’ birthday weekend with a friend. The hotel was in a great location just 5 mins from Old Street tube station. Rooftop bar was really special as were the spa facilities. However what elevated the stay from great to exceptional was the attentiveness of all the staff we came into contact with from the doorman to the bar staff but most of all our thanks go to Dado and Flavia from the ‘Guest Experience Team’. They looked after us so well and nothing was too much trouble for them. We would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly and hope to make a return visit very soon. Thank you again!
Chris & Fiona",5,2019,04,15
111,Amazing hotel!,The hotel overall was amazing! We were given complimentary drinks whilst we checked in. The room and the spa was perfect- not too busy. Would recommend to anyone! Topped it off with the aviary rooftop bar.,5,2019,04,15
111,Beautiful hotel & excellent service ,"Visited the hotel for 2 nights. We were greeted with champagne upon arrival which was a very nice touch. Staff were very friendly and we got upgraded. We went to our room and I had a lovely plate with cakes on saying Happy Birthday - very nice surprise. 
Room was very spacious, TV was huge and the bed was so comfortable! There is even a pillow menu!
The room was very modern with a touch screen to control the aircon and lights. There was even mood lighting around the bed and underfloor heating. We had Elemis toiletries which smelt divine and gowns and slippers were provided (so we did make use of the spa after a busy day of exploring which was very busy but nice and clean.) 
Location is also excellent!! 5 min walk from Liverpool Street and also a lot of bars and restaurants nearby.
The only small downfall was how busy the rooftop bar was (I suppose that’s a good thing as it shows it’s a good place) However, we were told we had to wait to go onto the terrace because it was so busy. I personally feel that hotel guests should have priority (it seemed to be a lot of business people who were out there after work on the Friday.) The rooftop bar did not sell prosecco which was a little disappointing as I know the downstairs bar did but there were plenty of more nice drinks to choose from. Rooftop had beautiful views and we were lucky enough to of had the weather for it.
Will defiantly recommend to family and friends and will be back in the near future. Thank you for a memorable stay. ",5,2019,04,15
111,Stunning Hotel and Stunning Service,Me and my husband have just returned from this stunning hotel set a few minutes walk from Moorgate Station. The rooms are decorated beautifully with lots of fantastic mod cons. A visit to Aviary (the rooftop restaurant) is a must for their superb food and to enjoy a drink on their rooftop terrace. We had an awesome experience and would like to say thank you in particular to Dada for overseeing our stay and making it truly unforgettable. We can’t wait to visit your lovely hotel again!,5,2019,04,14
111,An amazing experience,"What can I say from the minute we walked in we were pampered beyond belief. The staff here are amazing nothing was too much trouble it made our stay extra special as they really did go above and beyond. We have travelled over the years and this was one of the best friendliest hotels we have stayed in. From the front of house staff to house keeping, Spa staff and waiting staff it was a perfect stay. A must is the Avery roof top terrace. So my thanks to Dada and her team especially Krasi such a lovely young lady. Well done we certainly will be back Kimmy x",5,2019,04,14
111,Kay,"Fantastic value for money, super friendly and helpful staff, beautiful space on rooftop The Aviary, great views of the city and fabulous place to sit and relax.

Special thanks to Camelia for being so helpful and I am totally looking further to coming back.",5,2019,04,13
111,Exceptional staying,Excellent stay with one of the best suites in the city!! Special thanks to Jada and Nicoleta!! The service was great and especially the concierge. I had everything before i even ask!! I highly recommend it!,5,2019,04,13
111,Excellent,"After some initial problems on my first and second stay I have to give the hotel, the management team (especially January) and all the staff credit for making significant improvements. Rooms and beds are incredibly comfortable (for my taste), well appointed and house keeping excellent. The food and bar options are very good and housekeeping has been excellent. Super responsive team when you ask for something. Location for the city is great and small gym and sauna on site good to work out and then relax in. Many hotels I’ve stayed at and many responses on trip advisor say “thanks for your feedback, we’ll be sure to let our teams know” but very rarely do you see changes and improvements in operating procedures implemented - Montcalm have been excellent at this and the hotel and team continue to improve. Very good. ",5,2019,04,12
111,PERFECTION and Incredible Service!!!,"The service, hospitality and room have been perfect every time I’ve stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House.  I stay at this location with every trip into London.  The staff is extremely welcoming and accommodating, no matter what time of the day I am checking in.  The Montcalm staff truly does make my stay a home away from home.  I usually stay for a week at a time on business travel; although, I’m planning a personal trip this summer and plan to stay at this location as well.  Every level of the staff is fantastic from the time that I’m checking in and throughout my entire stay.  The staff works tirelessly with warmth and personal touches to take care of the needs of their patrons.  Their service is not just going through the motions to complete to task at hand, they truly care about their guests.
The location is conveniently located near the tube, they have an exceptional on-site rooftop restaurant called the Aviary.  I’ve had Sunday dinner at the Aviary, weekday breakfast, and enjoyed evening cocktails during the week.  The Aviary has always exceeded expectations and service.  They also have an on-site spa and gym.  We’ve even used their corporate meeting rooms on-site for company events and catering.  At all times the staff was professional and totally took care of all needs of our stay and event.
I can truly say, that my hotel stays at the Montcalm Royal London House are my best travel experiences throughout the year and I travel a tremendous amount for my position.  I stay approximately 90 to 100 nights per year at hotels throughout the globe and my trips to the Montcalm are my favorite.",5,2019,04,11
111,Fantastic Hotel for leisure and business,"I stayed at this hotel for work and couldnt promote it enough, great staff and the Avery Bar is amazing.
The room is full of great gadgets and the show is really good. i was even offered a coffee for my onward journey.
kieep up the good work",5,2019,04,11
111,Excellent! Perfect combination of business meets pleasure!,"Every couple of months I travel to London for work and every time I make sure my travel agent is aware of securing me accommodation in the Royal House Montcalm. I just love it.
The service is first class, the rooms are great, the location perfect (tube couple of minutes away), the 10th floor restaurant/bar/roof top is just what you need for the evenings and the spa/gym/small pool is simply an unexpected extra treat.

It’s a no-brainer... Please expect me back soon!",5,2019,04,10
111,Amazing staff,"The staff here are really what make it better than the rest. Been to a lot but these guys are definitely the most attentive and caring. Always there to open the door for you, take your luggage, go the extra mile. Hotel outside doesn’t look amazing but inside the hotel is incredible. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. The mood lights in the room is a cool touch and all accessible from a touch screen built in. Will definitely be returning. Great location too.",5,2019,04,09
111,The most perfect surprise,"When searching for a hotel as a surprise break for my soon to be 21 year old daughter, I struggled to find the perfect combination of understated luxury with a personal touch.  So many places look amazing with similar facilities of wonderful spa, swimming pool and other amenities but what truly makes a difference is the people.  Having booked Club rooms I emailed the hotel to ask if I could arrange for a balloon, not too much just a recognition of the occasion .. what followed was exceptional.  Flavia contacted me by phone and email to arrange the surprise, asked if there was anything else that could be arranged, room with a view etc.  We arrived and were absolutely blown away by the warmth of welcome, the absolutely lovely Flavia personally helped at check in with prosecco on hand, accompanied us to our rooms where my daughter was greeted by dessert and an enchanting sky of balloons.  This level of consideration continued throughout our stay, with Dado, also from the Guest Experience team finding us at cocktails in the Club lounge to ensure we were happy with our stay, and at reception Estefania and Camelia on check in and out were welcoming, friendly and efficient, as were all other members of staff we met.  A hotel in the heart of the corporate city could so easily have provided a hollow sense of luxury but it is obvious that this group aims to deliver an experience with a sublime sense of soul.",5,2019,04,08
111,super stay,"What a fabulous night , we had the wonderful stay

 The food was exquisite and the flavours so delicate. The sommelier paired the wines to perfection and even though many would not be our normal choice you can instantly taste  I also like the space around your table and the very personal service. The team are so friendly.",5,2019,04,08
111,Fantastic hotel right in the heart of London,"Great friendly staff, rooms are good with the best bed we have stayed in.
Great price with 2 tube stations around the corner. 
Would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly go back again 
Great bars one with shuffleboard tables which was fun to play with friends or just couples",5,2019,04,08
111,Excellent service,"I booked my parents a room here to stay while visiting London. The front of house staff were so helpful from check in. They accommodated our request for a bath in the room and were so lovely, warm and welcoming to my parents. They made them feel at home and while it is a lovely hotel it didn’t feel stuffy or obnoxious in atmosphere. I can’t soeak highly enough of the staff. The room was lovely, clean and spacious and my parents loved the whole experience, including the complimentary nibbles and beverages that were in included because we had booked a club room. I have booked them into Montcalm at the brewery, the grange hotels and andaz previously and this was by far the favourite, so will definitely booking here in future. Thanks for making them feel so welcome and for a great stay!",5,2019,04,07
111,Fabulous hotel for a short break,We only stayed for one night but the service was impeccable- we were greeted with complementary Prosecco while we waited to check in and the whole experience was a pleasure. The room was spacious and stocked with fine toiletries and Nespresso coffee machine etc. We had spent most of the day sightseeing around the area and we finished our evening with a couple of cocktails at the roof top bar of the hotel.,5,2019,04,07
111,A fantastic hotel,"I would like to say a very big thank you to all the staff at the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to find out our room had been upgraded as I had sent a message about it being a birthday celebration and the celebration of finding out we are expecting out first baby. This was a huge surprise, I have never experience an upgrade before. Thank you. Our room was spacious, clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable and there was minimal noise throughout our stay. Thank you once again, we shall definitely be returning again.",5,2019,04,07
111,Excellent hotel and service,"Excellent service. Glass of prosecco on arrival. Staff friendly and welcoming. Two bars down stairs which is brilliant if you want to have an evening not to far from hotel room. Rooms were clean, and outstanding. Beds were so comfy and big, TV had so many channels, bathroom had heated flooring which was lovely when leaving the shower. Rooms were so spacious. Breakfast was lovely. I enjoyed having my morning coffee on the rooftop of the hotel as the view was lovely. The hotel is directly opposite an NCP car park which is perfect if you dont enjoy having to travel to far to your car like myself. I couldnt recommend this hotel enough. Will definitely be visiting again :)",5,2019,04,07
111,Great Experience,"Amazing place to stay in the heart of London. The staff are friendly and helpful, specially Claudia who was welcoming and gracious at reception and very accommodating. Will definitely come back for my next visit to London.",5,2019,04,07
111,Highly recommend! ,"Service was excellent and the staff couldn’t do any more for us, I felt they were genuinely interested in making a stay pleasant and comfortable. The rooms are modern, clean and well appointed.  The shower was awesome which for me is always the acid test for any hotel! Oh and the bed was sooo comfortable! 
There is a rooftop bar but we gave that a miss as it was too busy - instead we used the downstairs bar and played shuffleboard on one of the three tables they have. This proved to be the perfect pastime for us and certainly gets people mixing and interacting. 
The hotel is well placed for the City and Shoreditch area which was perfect ! 
Highly recommend. ",5,2019,04,07
111,Amazing experience,"Great location, very clean and good atmosphere. 

Staff were lovely and couldn’t do anything more for you. Little Stephan made us feel welcome at breakfast everyday and always smiled (made an excellent coffee).

However, unfortunately the hotel has a lot of stuck up guests. Never been surrounded by so many rude guests. Credit to the Montcalm staff for dealing with such rude people. Manners cost nothing ...",5,2019,04,07
111,One of the best ,"We spent the weekend at the Montcalm and I have to say it was a refreshing experience. Tired of hotels charging extortionist rates and then penny pinching, this hotel has got it very right. Good value and a very good standard. 

When we arrived we were offered a glass of champagne, nothing was an issues. Our room was a decent size, plea to of capsules for coffee., clean, fresh and comfortable. We had breakfast at the members club, simple but very good. Again they got the balance right. Staff were very friendly and the hotel has a good buzz about it. 
Well done to all, refreshing to see someone getting it right. Recommended 

In all ",5,2019,04,07

Many thanks

111,Excellent location,"Second visit to this fantastic hotel, first visit I had booked a club room and this time I upgraded to a Montcalm club room. Very disapponted when entering the room as this was smaller than the previous room we had stayed in and only had a double bed. Immediately went back to reception and was instantl6 given an alternative room with no hassle at all. Apart from this I would cenrtainky come back to this hotel again as the location is fantastic only 5 mins from Moorgate station and 10 mins from Liverpool Street and easy access to various locations. The hotel is extremely clean and service excellent by every member of staff. Welcome fizz whilst checking in. Club lounge has great selection of drinks. The onl6 thing I would say is the canapés are filled through the evening but as other lounges do they take away any remaining food  and bring fresh hot canapés the old canapés are left in the servers and topped up by newer snacks. This means there are snacks left that have been out from the start and unsurprisingly are less appetising being cold, certainly wouldn’t let any of these minor niggles put me off staying again but has meant a four rather than a five.",4,2019,04,02
111,Anniversary Rendezvous in City of London,"Superb hotel, fabulous facilities, clean from top to bottom, buzzing atmosphere since downstairs is what seems to be a rather popular, up-market, ""hip"", public bar (the same can be said of the rooftop bar). This appealed to myself and my other half as we're in our mid-twenties and the atmosphere appealed to us. Great room, great location, lived up to its reputation, would definitely come back but I'm tempted to try the other 2x Montcalms in London first! Five stars.",5,2019,04,02
111,Nice hotel with good service,"Good hotel with decent sized room for London, good pool and jacuzzi and spa area.  Only negative realy is that breakfast was not as good as i woukld expect. Room was excellent and the club lounge realy useful.",4,2019,04,01
111,Exceptional stay!,"Our stay was absolutely exceptional! All thanks to the deputy manager January and Flavia. We was welcomed with a chilled glass of Prosecco and a warm smile, which is always nice.

Me and my Fiancè came in celebration of my partners Birthday. Prior to our arrival January was extremely helpful in ensuring everything was ok. We had a lovely room with an amazing view & was surprised with a lovely platter treats that had 'happy birthday' on it. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. The Spa was also nice.",5,2019,04,01
111,Stunning 5 Star hotel,"We can’t wait to return !
Great Location with fantastic rooms and with 5 star service .The Montcalm club lounge made the weekend for a few pre drinks & canapés .We visited the Avairy Bar for a drink which has a stunning view & is a must do .",5,2019,04,01
111,Mr ward,Excellent hotel..lovely staff..we first came to the bar last November to play shuffleboard.  When we were visiting our son and his partner again..it was the obvious choice..and we weren't disappointed..we will definitely be staying again,5,2019,03,31
111,Excellent Once Again,"We stay here every time we visit London and cannot fault our experience during every visit.
The rooms, service and facilities are second to none...all topped off with the most friendly and attentive staff. 
We would like to make a Special mention to Dado who always makes us feel so special with the extra little touches, including prosecco in the room for our Anniversary.
Many of our friends and family have stayed here following  our recommendation and they would all return again.",5,2019,03,31
111,Breakfast was awful,"Hotel was lovely and so was the room, however the breakfast was absolutly awful! For the amount of money you pay for it, the variety of food was minimum and the quality of food was vile! Don’t eat on the roof top bar for breakfast!!!",3,2019,03,31
111,Perfect stay for business ,"I booked one night here to stay over for work. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

The bar above is excellent with lovely views of the city.

The rooms are new, stylish and well equipped.

I can’t wait to stay there again.",5,2019,03,29
111,Great Conference rooms / facilities,"A huge thank you for all of the team for helping out during our conference on 14th of March 2019.

Great facilities, huge space, cloakroom, catering and a perfect service.
 
Daphnee, Georgi and a team were extremely helpful.",5,2019,03,28
111,short business trip,"Alone of all the physical facilities being very, very good, I'd like to especially emphasize the friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff at the reception with each and any ask for help that I raised.",5,2019,03,28
111,8 nights in London,"We stayed 8 nights at the Montcalm while visiting London. When we arrived, at check-in, we were asked to pay for our entire visit upfront. I found this unusual and insulting. Did they think that we could not afford paying for our room? This is the first time we had such an experience. Other than this incidence, overall our experience at the hotel was pleasant. The staff were friendly and cordial. Our room was nice and the room service was good. The breakfast selections were rather limited, but the evening snack bar was a nice touch. Overall we were happy staying at the hotel. However, because of the incidence while checking in, I have to say that I will probably not stay at this hotel again.",4,2019,03,26
111,Birthday Trip,"I have never been treated so well in a hotel before. I recieved a birthday greeting on arrival and an extra glass of prosecco. When I got to the room the standard was amazing even a phone you can use during your stay with unlimited everything. In the room we were welcomed with a birthday treat of chocolate covered strawberries, red velvet cake and a chocolate brownie. We made use of the lovely spa facilities; jacuzzi , swimming pool , sauna. The bed was so comfortable and felt like sleeping on a cloud. In the morning we had breakfast on the rooftop level and the views and level of service received was amazing. You should definitely stay here even if you are just staying on your own.

Definitely will come back !!!",5,2019,03,24
111,Lovely stay,Had a great stay at this hotel. Prosecco while checking in and had balloons and cake in the room. Room was also upgraded for free. Unfortunately did not have time to visit the club lounge for free drinks or go to the rooftop bar however I will be back to make sure I do those things next time. Bed was very comfy aswell and room service breakfast was amazing,5,2019,03,23
111,Magical stay at Montcalm,"Stayed at the Montcalm two weeks ago - nothing was too much effort for the team who were instrumental in helping me create a magical proposal for my (now) fiancée!

From having a room upgrade, coming back to said room covered in rose petals and Prosecco to arranging a post-proposal dinner in the top floor restaurant, Dado, Flavia, Claudie and the team were so helpful and we could not have asked for more.",5,2019,03,23
111,One word - Excellent,"I stay in Montcalm Royal House every time I come in London (which is often) and I'm absolutely delighted with the facilities as well as with the service. I'd definitely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to London. The location is in the center of the London City where everything is accessible and it's very easy to travel around as so many Buses, Tube, DLR stations are only walking distance away... In my humble opinion this is one of the best hotels in London.",5,2019,03,23
111,Perfect Birthday Trip!,We booked this hotel for my birthday weekend as we were going to the Igloos on the rooftop bar. The hotel was quite cheap for London so thought we might as well stay rather than get a cab home. Arrived at the hotel and the hotel staff were really lovely all of them keen to wish a happy birthday. The hotel rooms were lovely and clean and the bed was SO comfy! I have to say also they had a good coffee machine and good amenities in the room. Particularly the glass wear in the room was really nice!! All the bath extras were Hermes which were really lovely. Would 100% stay here again!,5,2019,03,22
111,A great hotel - has everything and superb service,My third stay at this hotel recently and it gets better each time! Camelia on the Reception desk made us very welcome and as the hotel was not full upgraded our room. Plenty of complimentary drinks and fruit in the room and the business lounge is great value with good wines and snacks and a great breakfast. It's good to have a selection of places in the hotel to eat but there are plenty nearby too. The spa is excellent but need to book early. Easy to get to as well- close to Moorgate station,5,2019,03,21
111,Amazing hotel with Fantastic hospitality,"We stayed for two nights at this hotel and loved every minute of it. The hotel is amazing. The attention to detail is wonderful from drinks offered on arrival while booking in, to a pillow menu! 
The full English breakfast was fantastic and we could not fault the food and drink. 
We had entry to the club lounge which gives you free drinks and canopes! This I definitely recommend. The rooms were complete luxury and had everything you needed and more! 
We had wonderful nights sleep while there too.  
The spa was lovely and it was great to unwind after a day of walking about. 
The location was perfect with a tube 2 mins away. 
What makes this hotel stand out is the hospitality and friendliness of all the staff. They could not do enough for you and their helpfulness was genuine for the love of them wanting you to be 110% happy. 
Camela and Monica were so helpful on the desk and the Duty Manager Michael, made us feel as if we were the most important guests in the hotel!! 
It was not possible to fault this hotel in any way. 

Thank you for a lovely stay and we will be returning again and telling all our friends to visit you too.",5,2019,03,18
111,An absolutely AMAZING stay at the Montcalm. Flawless service!,"My Partner regularly stays at this hotel for business when he is working down in London and has always told me how fantastic the hotel is. As it was my birthday last week, we decided to book a trip to London and stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. I was unaware that my partner had already called the hotel beforehand to notify them that it was my birthday, but all became apparent once we had arrived. We were greeted by a lady called Stephanie who was lovely. She made us feel so welcome and told us that they had given us an upgrade to a more superior room due to the special occasion- we were very grateful! We were then passed onto another lady who showed us up to our room. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she was brilliant. She was new to the job and made us feel so welcome. On the way to the room she had told us that she'd prepared us a little 'special something' to mark the special occasion. We were blown away upon entering the room- it was stunning. A large bedroom with a HUGE bed, two immaculate bathrooms and a separate sitting room. Awaiting us on the side table, which the lady had prepared us, was a selection of alcoholic/soft drinks, a fruit platter and a tray of macaroons. We didn't expect any of this so it was very much appreciated and got my birthday celebrations off to an incredible start. As for the rest of our stay, the service remained consistent and we cannot find anything worthy of criticism. The Aviary on the top floor was stunning and offered skyline views across London whilst you enjoy a drink or some food. The location was ideal and only a short walk away from a tube station. We will definitely be returning. We cannot recommend this place enough! You will not be disappointed!!!

111,great service and accommodation.  awful restaurant,"Arrival and check in were excellent.  Great service, nothing was too much of a problem.  Welcomed the complimentary glass of champagne.  We had a junior suite, which was stunning.  Very modern designs and everything worked brilliantly.  The bed was really comfortable.  Our biggest disappointment was the dining room.  We expected a 5 star experience to match the 5 stars to date.  It was a Friday and we did not want to go out to eat, so booked a table on 10th floor.  On exiting the lift, the booming of loud disco music and people shouting to each other to be heard hit us as the lift doors opened.  We were shown to our table but could not hear ourselves speaking.  After 2 minutes, it was too much for us so we left.  Went to the bar near the entrance.  Had a toasted sandwich.  Not quite 5 star dining and a huge disappointment.  Will probably try another top hotel next time we are in London.",4,2019,03,18
111,OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE.,"Great stay at a great hotel.
We were there for 1 night during a mini London vacation.
The personal service and hospitality from Cammelia and rest of staff makes you feel welcome from the minute you enter.",5,2019,03,18
111,Very nice hotel and great customer service!,"My sister and I stayed for 3 nights. The hotel and rooms are very nice, modern and clean. The original room that was given to us was facing large noisy aircon units, but the staff went out of their way to find us another room and make us happy. All the staff really care about the guests! Special thanks to Dado, Valentin and Daniel for their excellent customer service. Also, we really enjoyed the Club Lounge and the rooftop bar Aviary.",5,2019,03,17
111,Top class customer service,Absolutely stunning hotel. Best we have ever stayed in. Amazing bars and atmosphere. Most notably the best customer service we have ever had. Huge thanks to all the staff for an exceptional job. Highly recommend,5,2019,03,17
111,lovely hotel,"Fabulous location. Very welcoming staff at check-in. The room was excellent, very clean and modern with everything you need. I received a call just after check-in to ask if everything was ok and did I need anything which was nice.
Would definitely return again",5,2019,03,13
111,It exceeded my expectations and the staff are so friendly wil definitely be staying here again.,"‘It exceeded my expectations and the staff are so friendly wil definitely be staying here again.’

➖ Nothing at all

➕ The extra large room and bed. The large screen TV with full Sky channels. The facilities, staff and location was all perfect. Could not fault anything. Special thanks to Dado for looking after us as she always does. This was our second stay here and the hotel made sure we was well looked after and even upgraded us to the business suite. Great hospitality!",5,2019,03,12
111,Birthday,"Gorgeous hotel. It was wonderful and spa was lovely. Phone in room didn’t work very well, and had to ask for a dental kit, but all was attended to very fast and efficiently. Wonderful staff, and felt very well looked after.",4,2019,03,12
111,Incredible hotel and brilliant staff,"I arrived at the hotel with my boyfriend, who's birthday it was - I had dropped a note to the hotel about a week previously to ask if they could get me a ""happy birthday"" balloon for the room, when we arrived and walked through the door the bed was covered with balloons - little things like that mean a lot, and the staff were beyond brilliant. 

The room was outstanding, with a massive flat screen TV, and the state of the art functions in the room were like something from the future!

To conclude, the staff and rooms are without a doubt the best in London - I have stayed in over 40 hotels in London in the last year due to work, and could not recommend this particular hotel enough - I most definitely will be back.",5,2019,03,12
111,Great location.,"We stayed in Finsbury Square.It is in a great location and easy to get to. Close to Moorgate tube station and also a good walk to the tower of London and other sites. Great bars, love the shuffle board, and a beautiful restaurant with a fantastic view. 
The staff are very friendly and helpful. This was our second visit and we will be staying again next time we are in London.",5,2019,03,12
111,A fabulous hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and it was a lovely experience from start to finish. The staff are absolutely wonderful and can't do enough for you. The room was lovely, the bed was divine as were the feather pillows. An electronic panel on the wall to control lights, air conditioning etc. One gripe about that is the light that it gave off at night, which couldn't be dimmed, but no biggie. There were Elemis products in the bathroom. Gave them a personal reason for our trip and that had rose petals and a rose on the bed as well as a bottle of prosecco with macrons. A wonderful touch. The roof bar is amazing with fabulous views. The spa was very nice as well, a nice sized pool and jacuzzi. All in all highly recommended. Will be back for more!!",5,2019,03,11
111,My favorite place in London !,"The Montcalm is very well located. Rooms are large and very quiet. I like the gym and the spa. But, most of all, the staff is the most professional and kindest you can dream of in London ! A no brainer...",5,2019,03,11
111,"Amazing staff, amazing service, amazing stay!!!","If I could personally thank all the staff I had interacted with, I would. Upon entry, I was instantly greeted and shown to the hotel reception where I was swiftly checked in by a lovely receptionist. She was on hand to answer all my questions and very polite... despite the million questions I had! We went to the spa which was lovely as well. When ordering through room service, it was very efficient and quick. I will definitely be staying again and recommending to friends.",5,2019,03,11
111,Utterly superb!,"Put simply, this hotel is amazing! The staff are absolutely superb, just the exact right level of service - helpful, friendly, courteous but not hanging on your shoulder constantly. From walking through the main entrance to the reception is a beautifully designed contemporary walkway with dazzling chandeliers and leather booths. As you get to reception you are always offered a complimentary glass of bubbly to enjoy as you check-in (which is smooth, fast and painless). We have stayed twice for our wedding anniversary and both times they have done something special for us. The rooms are outstanding with beautiful coloured mood lights and even fragrance atomisers to make the room smell nice. Everything is utterly spotless. The Aviary Rooftop bar/restaurant is so cosy and welcoming with a lovely cocktails to order and enjoy on the balcony with sheltered pods. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough, I have stayed in some top 5 star hotels but this remains my top rated one to stay in. They have the balance just perfect.",5,2019,03,11
111,Excellent Stay!,"i stayed at the hotel for a 3 night business trip. Upon arrival, my luggage was taken from me. Check in was efficient and shown to my room. The room its self was well presented, clean and had everything you could need. I didn't get chance to visit the gym/pool area but I don't doubt this would have not disappointed. 
Well done to all the staff. Excellent food at breakfast and the service there was superb.",5,2019,03,11
111,Another great experience with Montcalm,"Lovely hotel with great staff. 
Have stayed at the one in Shoreditch previously and had a great experience there also - and Royal London House did not disappoint. 
The rooftop bar is amazing, and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Claudia who checked us in was very warm and welcoming and made us feel at home right away. Weywould definitely return!",5,2019,03,11
111,"Wow, wow and just wow!!","Where to start? This hotel and more importantly, the staff are beyond words. There are just not enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe the breathtaking experience that we had at the Montcalm Royal London House. We stayed here on the night of our proposal and Dado was absolutely superb. She was instrumental in helping me to organise the perfect evening! She met with me beforehand to discuss my requirements, showed me the rooms and once I had booked the perfect accommodation, she decorated the room with rose petals and had printed photographs of us and placed them around the room, including a photo that I had only sent her two hours ago! Dado was an absolute delight to work with, she was so helpful and genuinely caring towards us and she ensured that no stone was left unturned so that we could have the perfect evening. Biggest thank you to Dado for all of her help and thank you to all of the staff at the hotel for putting together the most amazing evening for us!",5,2019,03,11
111,Phenomenal,"Currently sat in the worlds most comfiest bed at the Montcalm after having the best sleep. This hotel is the most amazing place I have ever stayed, this was a late birthday treat as I had to work my birthday and the impeccable kind staff went out of their way to make it extra special for me! A free room upgrade along with a mini birthday cake and chocolate dripped strawberries washed down with a bottle of complimentary wine, I genuinely want to thank each and every member of staff here, you are an absolute credit to this hotel and make it what it is!! I will be telling everyone back up in the lakes how incredible this place is and have already planned to return in the summer! About to get up and go enjoy a morning swim and some breakfast before flying back north, beyond 5 star and couldn’t recommend enough!!! Thank you so much",5,2019,03,11

thank you for the present for our anniversary we really enjoyed our stay at The Montcalm Royal London House",5,2019,03,10
111,On the way to becoming a regular at the hotel,This was my second stay here. Room was great; Staff was attentive; Onsite restaurants were great for meetings and the location was great for all of my business meetings and outings. My travel agent keeps trying to route me to a better value hotel but I refuse to go elsewhere unless it is their sister hotel in Shoreditch.,5,2019,03,08
111,Afternoon Tea in their roof restaurant,Excellent place for Afternoon tea.   We had it served by very friendly and happy staff in one off the glass pods on their roof.    Beautiful views.   Lovely sunny evening.   We were well looked after   Food was fresh and tasty.   Would definitely go again.,5,2019,03,08
111,Igloo RooftopTea at The Aviary,"We had tea for four as a special celebration on 22nd February and it beat all our expectations. The rooftop location gave us a bird's eye view over London in a quirky glass igloo. It was a perfect spot to watch the sun setting after wonderful champagne cocktails and a delicious spread of sandwiches, scones and cakes. There was a wide range of teas to choose from.

The Aviary Restaurant itself is very stylish and has a buzzy, vibrant atmosphere. The staff were absolutely charming, service was prompt and efficient with attention to all our needs. They were quick to offer to take photos of us all so that we have a number of happy reminders of the day. It was a very memorable afternoon. We recommend it highly.",5,2019,03,08
111,Exquisite!,"If you're in London for business around Finsbury, this is the place you should stay. From outside it may not look cosy but you quickly change your mind once you step into the hotel. Starting from doorman (Thx. Alex) to the reception staff, hostess to waitress (Thnx. Auora) everybody is friendly, helpful and try their best. Many times I've been in London but rarely I encountered such hospitality. Room are exquisite! Using the available space with modern decoration to simple but high quality design of bathroom worth to mention. I attached some photos this review to give you an idea. 

Hotel is at the corner of Finsbury Square; very central surrounded by restaurants, cafes and bars; quite entertaining area. You should also spare one night at roof restaurant. There is an open terrace with beautiful nigh view also good for smokers(!). 

Strongly recommend for your business trips.",5,2019,03,07
111,The art of hospitality,"When you enter the hotel you will be immediately surrounded by a warm welcoming atmosphere- the friendly doorman, a smiling receptionist or a welcoming passing by employee. The rooms are cosy and well furnished, a very modern shower will help you to forget the stressful flight to London. I really recommend a welcome cocktail at the terrace or if it's daytime a coffee to enjoy the beautiful view over the city! 
At the end of the day - lay down in a very luxury cosy bed and enjoy the beauty of this hotel.",5,2019,03,06
111,Always blissful!,"We try to stop here for birthdays or our anniversary.  Beautiful hotel with welcoming lovely staff. Love the facilities and rooms are lush. The views from the bar are brilliant

I would recommend a stay at this hotel and I have already recommended the hotel to a friend.",5,2019,03,05
111,Excellent service and facilities. ,"I have stayed here several times over the years. I have always had excellent service, and with the addition of great facilities, in a very eclectic and central area of London, it’s a go to space for me. 

This trip Dado and Nicoleta were outstanding. Always attentive and helpful.  All the staff are great. 

The Montcalm is close to excellent transport (Liverpool St is a 7 min easy walk) and some great restaurants of all flavours including vegan/organic. 

Shoreditch is an exciting area to enjoy and relax including many local gyms and yoga/Pilates studios. 

Then rooftop bar and terrace plus lobby cafe is a beautiful addition and makes working from the Montcalm easy and enjoyable.  The Club room is an excellent addition for busy Execs and a quiet meeting space. 

",5,2019,03,04
111,London visit,The Montcalm was a great base in the city for getting around. Easily reachable from Euston which suited us. Rooms very comfortable and clean.

111,Best hotel ever!,"Hands down to the best hotel in London. Clean, amazing staff. Michael and Camelia, you guys are beyond amazing when it comes to your service and being there for your visitors. You’ve always gone above and beyond. In addition, the hotel has a lovely rooftop bar which is worth the visit every time. Rooms are huge, clean and bathroom is not only big but has underfloor heating, it’s amazing and just how it should be...especially during the colder months. The bed is comfortable and big and in addition, there’s always fruit and water in the room. You’ve got everything you need and more in the room.

111,Staff are wonderful ,"My husband and I stayed for a long weekend. A really lovely hotel the staff were brilliant, wonderful reception at check-in and really helpful throughout our stay. 
Rooms are quite small, but not a squeeze. Bathrooms are clean, shower is good, don't think any of the rooms have a bath if that's something you are looking for.
Pop up to the rooftop bar for a drink it's lovely.
Great location, close to a number of tube stops, reasonably quiet around the hotel. ",4,2019,03,03
111,The Millers,This is the second stay for us the first was with friends with an adjoining room which worked really well. This time was just me and hubby as always it’s a lovely hotel the one thing that seems to disappoint is the pillows!!? Sounds ridiculous but it’s soooper important. We would stay again but would appreciate them taking notice of this comment.,4,2019,03,02

111,Great stay in London ,"We had a lovely break at the Montcalm and were very well looked after. Facilities were great and we felt very at home there, with super comfy beds and beautifully cleaned rooms every day. Some really lovely touches from the hotels such as gifts for the kids (magazines and goodie bag in room) and snacks for us on arrival. We both feel that this is now our favourite London hotel! The kids loved the pool also, which we luckily had to ourselves most mornings. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and made it a very comfortable stay for us. Highly recommend to staying here. We are looking forward to returning soon.",5,2019,02,27
111,Faultless!,"Decided to book hotel this after reading its good reviews and it did not disappoint at all. Check in started off a bit bumpy when the receptionist blurted out ""so who has a birthday""  - I had written that is was my husbands 40th so a nice room would be appreciated, but announcing it clearly showed I had mentioned it to the hotel and therefore any room surprise was blown. Anyway, never mind, the room was lovely and strawberries dipped in chocolate and cake, along with a bottle of wine was brought to the room which was a very nice touch and very much appreciated. 

The room was exceptionally clean and the towels were big and fluffy. Not the usual postage stamp size you sometimes get. 

Slept very well and shower was fabulous. 

Staff were really attentive and friendly and you were acknowledged by all of them throughout the hotel. Very polite and very respectful staff that's for sure. 

We checked out and 4 hours after I realised I didn't have my kindle. So we returned to the hotel (luckily we were still local) and the staff confirmed I had left it in the room. 

All in all this was a really good hotel experience and we will return without hesitation.",5,2019,02,27
111,Perfect!,"I stayed here for 5 days on a business trip & was thoroughly impressed! As I arrived the doorman opened my cab door, carried my luggage & held an umbrella over my head to shield me from the very British weather! Check in was fast, friendly & informative (as it was my first stay in the hotel). I'd booked a Montcalm Club Double & the room was everything I wanted. Very modern, stylish, extremely clean, lovely lighting, fully stocked mini bar & a large comfortable bed. I've found some modern hotels to be quite clinical but my experience was exactly the opposite, friendly staff who went out of their way for me in every aspect. The bar was lovely (bar staff brilliant, even designing me my own cocktail to taste & giving me & a business associate a few complimentary drinks - lovely!) The rooftop bar was beautiful & as it was my final night, I met some friends & we had a great time. The perfect end to a busy work trip. Room service was prompt & the food was gorgeous but due to my dietary requirements, I was quite limited (I'm used to this & it wasn't a problem) but after my first two nights, extras were thoughtfully added to my meals. I thought this was a lovely touch & a complimentary bottle of wine on my final evening really made my stay special. Looking forward to returning next month!",5,2019,02,27
111,Feeling more than welcome,"We've only stayed 1 night in this beautiful hotel, wished it were more. The staff gives you the feeling that you are a very special guest. Friendly and very helpful. We had lunch and breakfast on the rooftop, very relaxed and delicious food. The room was beautiful, liked the possibilities for a choice of pillows, fragrance in the room. We certainly will come back. ",5,2019,02,27
111,Lovely hotel!!,"My partner and I stayed here at the weekend for his birthday and I must say what a lovely hotel. 
The staff were excellent and really accommodating. 
The rooms are very clean both that and the spa area are nice. 
I would definitely recommend staying and I'll go back again! ",5,2019,02,26
111,Beautiful Experience,"This hotel was truly amazing, would recommend to everyone!

We stayed for two nights. The room was lovely, when we first arrived I was greeted by Flavia who was so lovely, she took care of us for the whole trip and made it such a lovely experience for us. Anything we needed she was there to provide. Once welcome, they explained that they had upgraded our room to the Montcalm club double as we were celebrating our anniversary, they view was amazing!!! We had access to the spa and the club lounge,  this had free drinks (non-alcoholic and alcoholic) sandwiches, sweets, salads, fruits. It had a large variety of snacks. The club lounge was open between 5:30pm - 9:30pm.
The room had complimentary snacks there for us, a minibar (not free) and a handy guide phone. This phone we could take out with us and use the map we could use it to to make calls, it was very handy. 

On the first night we had dinner at the Aviary and breakfast there the following morning, the views from this rooftop restaurant are so beautiful! 

Overall, the service was 10/10 staff are lovely, very friendly, and helpful! They went above and beyond, and always had a smile on there faces. Very grateful, will definitely be back!",5,2019,02,26
111,Great stay but would not give it 5 stars,"I had a great stay and even got upgraded to a junior suite with fruits and macarons. 

The service is really good and the staff really friendly, the breakfast is tasty and overall the rooms are nice.
My room was rather quiet and I slept very well.

Nonetheless, I would not give it 5 stars because of some (important) details: the bedsheets are not really high quality, the sofa in my room looked old or poor quality, the quality of material in the room is not high-end (e.g. demarcation between carpet and bathroom is not well finished, the curtains are not all the same length and not great quality).

I had a great stay but to me the difference between a 5 stars and a 4 stars hotel lies in these important details.",4,2019,02,25
111,Always a high standard!,"I had a great stay at the Montcalm – it’s always a pleasure to stay here.  I was lucky enough to receive an upgrade to my room which was a lovely surprise!

My view is that the team always demonstrate excellent customer service skills and in my experience, guests are always met with a smile and never kept waiting for more than a few minutes.  I like the tiny touches like walking around the desk to personally hand over the key card or direct a guest to the lift etc.  

I tend to use room service for my evening meal so that I can relax.  The food is always high quality and delivered by another staff member representing the hotel in a positive manner.

I’ve had breakfast up in both The Aviary, which is my favourite, and in the smaller room near reception – staff are always very attentive and efficient.  It creates a great start to my working day.

I love having to work in London and look forward to my next visit.",5,2019,02,25
111,Excellent hotel,"So me and my partner just stayed here for our 10th anniversary, yes my partner called ahead to make our room special for me. But the amazing service we got from an absolutely fantastic woman called dado was next level, she went above and beyond to make our room and time the best, aswell as all the staff there were all 1st class, the room aswell was perfect, this hotel is definitely one me and my partner would be visiting again, and would highly recommend it if u want a quality experience from the time u get there to the time u leave!!",5,2019,02,24
111,Excellent ,"Just returned from weekend in London this hotel has all that you need fabulous room, rooftop terrace good quality food with many extras and amazing staff all very polite and helpful.  In particular Flavia was exceptionally courteous and keen to feel sure we enjoyed our stay.

Overall a real treat we will be back!

Many thanks

111,Excellent pub situated in Hotel,"The Longarm Bar is part of the Royal London Hotel in Finsbury Square and is great for lunch or an evening drink. Quirkily the pub is within the Hotel, separated only by a set of double doors. On one side posh hotel, on the other traditional boozer. The pub features some great real and craft ales along with a good range of wines and spirits and is great for a quick lunch. Really recommended among its offerings are the burgers with straight and curly fries and the deep fried cauliflower which is to die for. Good atmosphere, nice staff, give it a try!",5,2019,02,24
111,Anniversary,"What can I say... we have not informed the hotel this was our anniversary trip away.  First night is in and can honestly say it’s my favourite hotel I’ve stayed in (this is an anchievement in its self as live in hotels due to business). 
As we came all the staff were welcoming and directive for where to check in. 
We then both recieved a glass of processco and proceeded to room.
Little luxuries as to Elemis products, nice slippers (not you’re cheap hotel slippers) bathrobe, an amazing stock of mini bar, touch screen panels for lights, heat/air con, underfloor heating, dental sets, digital bathroom scales, the perfect mattress and pillows. 

Turn down service which didn’t expect with little chocolates on the pillows. Looking forward to enjoying the hotel bar and spa facilities for rest of our stay. 

Good sing this hotels praises all night but time to settle.

111,Paradise ,"Booked online for one night with my partner for Valentine’s day.  Originally only supposed to stay one night. 
Arrived at the hotel at around 3pm and instantly seen too by various members of staff, offered drinks, nibbles and had our bags taken from us instantly! 

Taken to our room by a lovely young man and was absolutely amazed. The room was decorated with petals, drinks and fruit left for us. 

Got to use the spa facilities but had to be at a meal reservation for 8pm so didn’t get to make as much use of it which was a shame. 

After an amazing night my partner and myself knew instantly we had to book another night and actually make the most of this beautiful place. My boyfriend then met Dado, she looked after us so much, gave us another beautiful room to stay in for another night, we had complimentary breakfast, use of the spa facilities again. Without realising there was a rooftop bar which just made us speechless!! 

I want to thank not just the lovely amazing beautiful Dado, but all the young girls on reception, the gentleman who delivered our room service, the young ladies and men in reception and around the hotel who made sure we were okay offering drinks and not letting me get it myself! The doorman, for always seeing us in and out and carrying my things. The ladies who looked after us in the spa area always cleaning and making sure we were ok. 

I can say this is the first hotel i’ve ever stayed in and will not be the last time i come here. Thank you for making our Valentine’s day so special and can not wait to come back to our now new little UK getaway. Cannot fault anything. Thank you for treating us like royalty! For someone who works in customer service, i couldn’t ask for any better or add any improvements. You guys are amazing.

Cannot wait to come back!! ",5,2019,02,22
111,Perfectly run hotel - Enthusiastic staff,"Very well run hotel, staff catering to your every need and asking for constant feedback, making sure you enjoy your stay. This includes the whole staff, from the reception to the bar downstairs, to the restaurant above. This is the first time I receive so much attention. I would recommend the hotel to everyone especially when travelling alone as you feel very welcome.",5,2019,02,22
111,Luxury!,"Fantastic luxury stay at the five star Montcalm Royal London House set on the centrally located Finsbury Square. A grand modern hotel, with exemplary customer service and a lush designed, tech savvy room. Wonderful facilities including the roof top bar and the must try spa.",5,2019,02,21
111,Fabulous hotel!,"Stayed last night at Montcalm Royal London House and once again delighted by the hotel, the amenities and the service - the beds are heavenly I didn’t want to get up this morning!  From the experience at check where I was given a glass of fizz to checking out my experience was excellent - I will definitely be back!",5,2019,02,21
111,Just superb!,"Have stayed here 3 times now and each time it’s just class. Staff are so friendly and professional and make you feel like a vip. Rooms and facilities are more then your average London hotel. Fab touches like the slippers and robes make it so comfortable. Elemis products in the bathrooms are a real
 Treat. Club rooms are a great touch and worth the extra few pounds. 

Will be booking my visit soon!! ",5,2019,02,20
111,Five star service in a luxury hotel,"Our stay was only 2 nights for a weekend in London. I chose Montcalm Royal London House because of its close proximity to a number of tube stations, walking distance to Shoreditch and the roof top bar. There are a number of bars, one with shuffleboard but the views from the roof were great, although you can no longer see the 'Gherkin' like you can in there promotional pics and it was probably the most expensive round I've ever bought. The only thing holding me back from give it 5 stars is the decor, the furnishings are premium and the rooms couldn't be cleaner but it was little on the tacky side, with shiny black surfaces and multi coloured mood lighting in the rooms this didn't have to be on but illustrates my point. Under floor heating in the bathroom was a nice touch and there was multi media device you could take out the from to use a guide around London, it was something I'd not seen before but felt I didn't need as I had my phone. I can't fault the service it was excellent and I would consider staying here again.",4,2019,02,20
111,“Good location..amazing staff”,This is my fav hotel in London.. the staff is always ready to help right from the check till the check out we have met amazing members of staff. The rooms are huge with large tv screens.. wifi.. an all that a five star hotel has..roof top has a breathtaking view and also the rooms overlooking the square. Breakfast on 10th floor looks great with many options. Pool is small an nice with jacuzzi an gym on same level. Managers welcome on arrival an makes sure your request are looked after.parking is avail just opposite the hotel with discount from the hotel.Worth it!! Recommended ,5,2019,02,18
111,"Good rooms, atrocious leisure facilities.","My partner and I stayed here for her birthday. We booked a club room. At check in we were advised to bring our robes and slippers down to the leisure facilities if we wanted to use them. We were not offered to have our bags taken to the room as you would expect from a 5*.  

As soon as we unpacked we decided to go down to the leisure facilities. We were immediately told that we should have changed in our room and come down in our robes and slippers. Not quite what the lady at check in stated. We thought this was very bizarre but the lady at the leisure reception said it was very busy at the moment and there was a very small amount of lockers and certainly gave the impression that we should just come back later.

We were not deterred and returned in our gowns with a few raised eyebrows en-route. Certainly wasn’t the best of experiences. 

Immediately we realised why the leisure receptionist was so keen to deter us and get changed upstairs. The swimming pool and leisure facilities were woefully small and completely inadequate for a hotel this size. In fact, it was very “cosy” even with just eight other people in. It certainly couldn’t accommodate any more than that - which is just five rooms including us. The swimming pool must be lucky to be 12m long and to be incredibly frank, was just used as an apparatus for the other couples to be “affectionate” with each other. Certainly not suitable for the younger members of society (if they were allowed to enter). We left after ten minutes being incredibly cramped and completely underwhelmed. The gym looked equally pathetic with just two treadmills and a light assortment of weights in a small area.

The room itself was a stark contrast. Incredibly comfortable, modern and spacious for London. There were many quirks such as the touch screen control and ‘Handy’. However, there weren’t many complimentary items.

As we booked a Club Room, we were entitled to access to the Club Lounge. The breakfast was continental and very pleasant. The evening canapés finished considerably earlier than what we were told on check in but were very good for the short time they lasted.

All in all unfortunately it was an underwhelming experience but the location and comfort of the room bring the rating up. However, if this Hotel was transplanted anywhere in the UK outside of London, it would just manage to make 4*. They seem to be very lenient and liberal when awarding 5* in London.",3,2019,02,18
111,Weekend away,"Just quick note to say many thanks for the hospitality and welcoming for our stay. We booked a room in 8th floor and we has access for continental breakfast in ground floor opposite of reception. The waiters and manager  in Club Lounge went beyond and above to make sure we will have an amazing breakfast and also great drinks in evening. Special thanks to George who was so attentive during our visit in Club Lounge and explained to us about  the hotel, the two bars and roof top restaurant which we strongly recommend. On our check out day the concierge team been so kind and professional  to take our luggage down and arrange a taxi.  We will come back for sure. Thank you

111,Perfect weekend,"That place is like little piece of paradise. From the moment when the doorman greet us throughout our all stay we were surprised from that amazing place with professional staff. With  beautiful Aviary restaurant and club lounge space, amazing bedrooms  made us feel like at home. Many thanks to George and Ivan from club lounge who were polite , smiling and welcomed us every time when we was taking our breakfast or delicious canapes in evenings. Thanks a lot Montcalm Royal London House for your hospitality.

111,Romantic weekend! Success!,"The staff are really friendly, they upgraded us and welcomed us with champagne. They were very attentive and explained all the benefits and how the spa facilities worked. The breakfast was great, the location was lovely and I hope to come back again soon! I would recommend adding on the club double as the afternoon treats and complimentary bits is well worth the money!",5,2019,02,18
111,Great place to saty while in Moorgate London,"This hotel has many plus point such as good location, friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms. I would say the breakfast selection is not great and something to improve on. On the plus side, every single staff there made sure my stay was pleasant.",5,2019,02,18
111,Perfect from start to finish!,"Just returned from a one night stay with my husband for our wedding anniversary after previously staying here the night we got engaged in 2016. From check in to check out the experience couldn’t have been better. 

On check in we were greeted with Prosecco and a lovely welcome from a very helpful member of staff called January. She told us that she was upgrading our room and including a complimentary breakfast in the club lounge. 

After entering our room we had a knock on the door and were greeted by two other members of staff with a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and a selection of cakes for our anniversary.

The room was fantastic and included all the the necessities and more. Hi-tech gadgets, under floor bathroom heating and coffee maker were all welcome touches.

We didn’t eat at the hotel but enjoyed drinks at The Aviary rooftop bar which was just perfect. It was February but we were still able to enjoy our drinks outside with the heaters and blankets provided in order to enjoy the London skyline. 

Location is good as it is very close to transport links. We parked at The Barbican as it was a weekend so only £9 a day which is a bonus and only a 5min walk. 

Overall we had the most amazing stay and I think the new team here could teach a lot of hotels how to do things! 

We look forward to coming back. 

",5,2019,02,17
111,Amazing stay,"Stayed here for a little weekend away. We have stay in a lot of Montcalms and they are all beautiful. But what really made this was the service and members of staff.

We will 100% be coming back here !

The roof terrace its great for a cocktail, their nibbles were good and I loved the touch that if we wanted we could use the club room downstairs for free drinks and nibbles, we had no time but we had a superb continental breakfast in the morning. The cleaner tried to get in at 8am even though I had the DO NOT DISTURB light on, she waked us up, that was annoying but apart from that the hotel is good .
I will go back .",5,2019,02,13
111,Perfect Stay,"This hotel is going to be my first choice when visiting London again.

We arrived to check in early and our rooms were not ready but we were able to fill in all the paperwork at reception and leave our luggage which we were told would be in our room when we came back.

We were offered welcome drinks of fizz which were just what we needed after our journey.

After venturing out for a short while we came back to our room which was a great room on the 8th Floor overlooking Finsbury Square with views of the City Skyline.

The room was perfect in every way, good size, great bathroom, massive TV, well stocked mini bar and beverages but best of all the bed, which must be one of the comfortable I’ve slept in. 

As a surprise, a lovely welcome message together with a plate of delicious cakes and treats for my birthday were left on the table which was very thoughtful.

We had dinner and drinks that evening in the hotels rooftop bar, The Aviary and both the food and cocktails were excellent. It’s a lively, buzzing place that some people may not like, as at times it could be difficult to hear conversation over the DJ set but we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.

I had breakfast and coffee next morning in Burdock, the hotels in-house little cafe/bar which was reasonably priced and a good range of dishes to choose from.

We didn’t get to use many more of the hotels facilities whilst we stayed but all people we encountered were friendly and happy and couldn’t do enough for us. I’d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone - great location, great service and my new No 1.",5,2019,02,12
111,Excellent hotel with amazing staff,"This had become my first choice of hotel to stay in, when in London on business. The facilities are top notch, the rooms are luxurious and always clean, and the staff are it's greatest asset. Unbelievably helpful and friendly staff, especially Camilia at the front desk, who checked me in, and ensured everything was to my satisfaction.

From check-in to check-out the service we received was outstanding and the room itself was modern and very comfortable (loved the heated floor in the bathroom). I have stayed in numerous 5 star hotels before and this hotel is by far the best I have experienced. The hotel has a few lively bars, including one on top with a great view over the City of London, very nice restaurant and is only a few minutes walk from the tube station. It ticked every box and we couldn't ask for more or fault it in any way. Highly recommend. Thanks for everything, Andrew.",5,2019,02,11
111,Fantastic Hotel!,"Such an amazing hotel in a quieter part of London. The staff were all really lovely and we were welcomed with drinks on arrival. When we arrived, we were told we had been lucky enough to have been upgraded to a larger room which was huge with a wet room bathroom. I was fairly disappointed however as there was no fruit in the room as promised and they didn't put our chosen scent in there either which you select when you book the room. The roof top bar is absolutely incredible with amazing views and the food was incredible, however the outside did shut at 10pm which was disappointing. We tried out the swimming pool and hot tub which was lovely and relaxing however there is only room for about 4 couples as it is fairly small but everything was included in our hotel stay at no extra cost which was great. The hotel itself is very easily accessible and just a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station. All in all, we had the best weekend, it's just a shame we had no fresh fruit as promised!",4,2019,02,11
111,Pure luxury,"I arrived at the hotel a little frazzled after quite a adventure on the London tube.  As soon as I arrived, one of the staff rushed out to grab my bag, escorted me to reception , where a cup of desperetly need tea was produced for me as I checked in, by the curteous, professional and freindly reception staff.  I was taken to my wonderful large room and welcomed buy my choosen scent of lavender.  I also had some fruit and some delicious , strawberries dipped in chocolate , plus a nice bottle of red wine.  The bath room was lovely, With a heated floor, a fantastic shower, and Ellmis bath products, with a fluffy bathrobe.  I had a great nights sleep on the big comfortable bed, with my chosen pillow.  I ate in the aviary resteraunt,  they managed to squeeze me in, even though they were fully booked and I had a table where I could take in the fantastic city view at night.  I could also use the club lounge, where I had a couple of drinks and a continental breakfast in the morning.  I would like to thank Simone in the club lounge , who was lovely and couldn’t do enough , Vito who was very friendly and I had a nice chat with, to Dada who checked me out and helped me with my case as I was leaving, who gave me her contact details for my next visit.",5,2019,02,11

They checked us in earlier because I was third trimester pregnant, and when we arrived they welcomed us with asking if we wanted anything to drink, so we took a juice and a cappuccino. In the room the had done a nice arrangement with a cake because of our anniversary. They just filled every wish we had and wanted and was so willing to help with everything. Very clean, and somebody that opens the door all the time in the entrance. Thank you very much! ",5,2019,02,10

111,This place is now our first choice when staying in London,"We've stayed at Royal London House a few times now and really feel the need to review it each time simply because it's such a great hotel. 

The rooms are spotless and beautiful, the bed is really comfortable. Staff are friendly, approachable and helpful. We honestly couldn't have asked for anymore from this hotel.

It's only a five minute walk from Moorgate Station and only a 10-15 minute walk to any part of Shoreditch. The spa area is beautiful too for a nice bit of relaxation.

We will absolutely be back again in April.

Well done to RLH for making this our hotel of choice in London!",5,2019,02,08
111,Wonderful Wonderful,"Wonderful facilities, comfy bed, brilliant service from hotel staff especially Stefan and Simona.  View from the Artillery cafe over London provide a great back drop for the taking photos.

111,Amazing!,"So my partner surprised me for my 25th birthday to this hotel and it was amazing! I think the only thing that made this hotel have high standards is because of the helpful staff. 
I would like to mention and thank ever so much to January - She was absolutely amazing and managed to make my birthday so special by meeting my partners requests on decorating the room and also upgrading us to the business room on our last night.
The rooftop bar, Aviary Bar, looked wonderful with the beautiful views.

Definitely worth a visit!",5,2019,02,06
111,Simply Sensational !,A hidden gem in the City. The apartments are comfortable and decorated in high specs. The service is impeccable and friendly. Luxurious SPA and delicious breakfast. I recommend Montcalm also as a venue for conferences and business meetings.,5,2019,02,05
111,Best experience ever,"I was looking to book a room for my girlfriend and I as an early Valentine’s Day and I noticed the Montcalm royal London house hotel. I called the reservation Team to enquire some information before booking the hotel. I spoke to Angela and she was Incrediably helpful, I told her it was an valentine’s stay for my girlfriend and I and she recommend a club room which included club lounge access ( free drinks and cannabis in the evening) she also informed us about the beautiful restaurant with the roof top bar. I then went ahead and made the reservation, she was so kind to then transfer my call to Dado, the guest experience. 

Once my reservation was booked dado was amazing she was so nice and helpful and tried to do as much as she could from her side. 
She upgraded us to a Montcalm club room, and said she would take care of our stay. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by January and Alex with processo glasses, very lovely and polite stuff. Extremely helpful and always on call if we neeed anything 
We went to our room and OMG it was breathtaking the view was extraordinary. They had added roses all over the floor and bed, a bottle of processo, a card and some cake and a balloon. Honestly I have no words to explain how much effort they put into our reservation and made our night so special. It’s nice knowing how far they went to make our stay special. 

We visited the club lounge in the afternoon, unlimited drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic. There are a variety of different choices to choose from so there is plenty of choices. 

We then went to the rooftop bar to have a drink and the view was absolutely beautiful, the building lights the atmosphere everything was perfect. 

So I want to thank the hotel staff, Angela who was extremely helpful and nice, Dado who went the extra length to make our room amazing with all the amenities and everything and January who was so polite and always on call for our needs. 

Will defiantly be visiting again.",5,2019,02,05
111,"Thank you Dado, January and the team at the Montcalm Royal London House for a life-long memory","This was my second stay at the Montcalm Royal London House. Upon checking out at my first visit last year, Dado, the Guest Experience Executive, handed me her email address and asked me to contact her ahead of my next visit just to let her know when I'll be returning. She said that she would arrange something special for me to welcome me back to the hotel.

Last month, I decided to take Dado up on this lovely gesture. I had decided to return to London for one evening, for a very special trip. I met my partner in London when she used to live here, and I was intending on proposing to her, on the spot where I first fell in love with her. This was to be a surprise trip for my partner and I decided to make it extra special by booking a room at her favourite hotel. After reserving a room through the Montcalm website, I emailed Dado to let her know the booking reference, the dates and the purpose of my trip to London. Within a few hours, Dado had emailed me back confirming the booking and offering to be my liaison at the hotel to arrange a very special surprise for my partner and I upon our arrival.

I don't want to go into detail here as to what Dado arranged for us, but I would like to say that from the moment we arrived for check in (after my now fiancee had accepted my proposal) we were greeted very warmly and treated to a number of surprise delights, both in the room and throughout the hotel's facilities. Dado, January and the team looked after us exceptionally and they took great pride and joy in helping to make this stay in London a truly memorable one. Honestly, I wouldn't be taking the time to write this recommendation if their attentiveness had not touched my heart so much. I want to say another big thank you to the Montcalm team and I can't wait to return to this hotel which really does feel like a home away from home now.",5,2019,02,05
111,One of the best hotels we've stayed in,"Myself and my husband have stayed in numerous hotels all over the world including, NY, Miami and San Francisco and we both agreed that this is one of the best (if not the best). The service from check in was excellent and they were very accommodating when I requested a room with a bath.  We chose this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary and are already making plans to stay at this hotel again.  The rooms are large, exceptionally clean & comfortable with lovely coffee machines.  We used the steam and sauna, both of which were lovely and not overly crowded.  We both highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely be staying here again.",5,2019,02,04
111,"Great place, greater service!","I rarely write reviews, but I just had to the take time to show my gratitude towards the staff of this fine hotel. During our stay, we were happy to be assisted by the wonderful staff (Stephania at reception and the concierge Dan just to name two!). We’ll definitely be coming back! Thanks!",5,2019,02,04
111,"A very clean, centrally-located yet reasonably quiet hotel","I have stayed in the Montcalm twice in recent weeks for business trips and can highly recommend it. It is very centrally located, 5-10 minutes walk from the financial district, very close to Liverpool St station or the Moorgate tube station, and yet is somehow tucked away in a quiet square so you don't feel like you're walking out of the place and plunged into the busy London streets outside. It like a private enclave away from the hustle and bustle. 

The staff are incredibly helpful and polite, helping with every possible need to ensure your stay is comfortable. I had a problem with one of my windows letting draft in, and the reception staff sent a handyman within literally 5 minutes to come and fix it. 

I stayed in a basic deluxe room - very comfortable beds, a huge Sky television and lots of smart storage. It was especially handy for a business trip as there is a laundry service, your own iron and ironing board and a sowing kit so you're never left stuck if you have a meeting and need to brush up your clothes. 
There were lots of nice touched and details - even an espresso machine and nice herbal teas which are free, and a discreet mini-bar tucked away.
There's tastefully picked furniture, including a comfortable chair, glass tables and a desk which has all the power outlets you might need to work from the room.

The rooms were cleaned daily whilst I was out and I always came back to a remarkably pristine conditions with nice touches like adding some fresh fruit, filtered water and chocolate mints on pillows. 

I would highly recommend this hotel for business or for pleasure. I didn't get to experience the Indian restaurant or the bars but I heard good things from other guests and always saw that they were lively and had a good atmosphere.",5,2019,02,04
111,Pleasant and relaxed stay,"Loved the hotel, the staff all round are very accommodating, friendly, helpful and genuinely kind. Fully enjoyed my stay there. Looking forward to the next stay at this hotel. The room had all one would desire for a comfortable stay, and a 5 star to me is underrated.",5,2019,02,03
111,Best experience of my life,"Me and my partner decided to spend our 2nd anniversary at the Montcalm Royal London house and without any doubt it was the best experience. I highly recommend this hotel. The staff are very welcoming and polite. I would like to thank January whom was very heart warming and polite showed our room and explained the facilities opening times. The food was amazing and I definitely recommend including breakfast as there are numerous to select from. Hotels spa is also great we used the pool, sauna and the steam room which was very relaxing. I would like to thank Dados, January and Angela Ducellari.",5,2019,02,03
111,Birthday Treat,"Thank you Simona and Stefan for the fabulous Guest Experience at the club lounge area. The new charcoal Argentinian prawns was very nice that's a keeper along with the chicken on the skewer.  

I must say thank you to all the management team for this hotel have done well to select each member of staff, front of house (the baby face  oriental lady) thank you for the meet and greet and starting my day with a smile and The housekeeping team. 
My room was  decorated beautifully, I am still smiling.  I don't have no complaints whatsoever.  

The ladies downstairs in the spa are were very attentive, I was very surprised on how busy it was  considering how cold it is outside.",5,2019,02,03
111,AMAZING,"When we first arrived at the hotel we were greated by the friendly team with a glass of bubbly. We were escorted up to our hotel room by the lovely January who was so helpful and cheerful. On entering the room we were met with a gorgeous room, with flowers and petals to celebrate our anniversary. Bubbly on ice as well as cake and strawberries were perched by the window with some lovely views overlooking some of Londons iconic buildings. The shower room was amazing, and had some underfloor heating and when being in London it is much needed. We opted to have a scent of pomegranate flowing throughout the room which honestly smells divine. We had the opportunity to use the hotels facilities, the pool was a brilliant size and my partner and I enjoyed the use of it.
I cannot fault the hotel in anyway, the staff are so welcoming and we really do not want to come home! Thank you so much to everyone here, especially Angela Ducellari, Dados and January for making our stay so perfect. We cannot wait to come back for another visit.",5,2019,02,02
111,Superb Room and Friendly Staff,"I stayed at Royal London House Hotel for 8  nights and I must say that this is one of the best hotel experiences I had. Room is elegant and clean. Hotel is near the underground stations and you’ll find both fancy and affordable restaurants everywhere. But what impresses me most is the accomodating and friendly hotel staff they have especially the manager, “January” who even granted my late check-out request so I can freshen up after a long day of work and before heading to the airport. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel for tourists and business people who will be visiting London!",5,2019,01,30
111,30th Birthday made extra special!,"From the moment we walked in the doors, we were greeted and made to feel welcome. The check in staff were all very pleasant and welcoming and they made me feel very welcome on my 30th birthday and we enjoyed a welcome drink
One of the team then escorted us to our room which was huge!!
They stocked the mini bar for us and showed us how to control the lights etc and the underfloor heating in the bathroom (obviously!)
They also recommended we check out the rooftop bar which we were not even aware of!!
Despite it being Jan we decided to brave it and it's gorgeous. The bar/restuarant inside is lovely and the outdoors is nice although we didn't last long! There are igloos you can book which looked warm but we only stayed for one drink!
We then headed out for dinner and a show and when we returned we enjoyed a few drinks and games in Long Arm another one of their bars. Great giant connect 4 and jenga and brews its own beers!
When we went up to our room our bed had been turned down and there was a plate of fresh fruit, a variety of mini desserts, a bucket of fruit juices and a birthday card!
This was a the sweetest thing ever and I really appreciated it.
Gutted we didn't have time to do the spa as the next day we headed out to Spitalfields Market and Brick Lane which is always nice although a tad cold!!
Would 100% stay again!!",5,2019,01,29
111,It is very good but....,"We stayed here as a group of 6 (3 rooms). We arrived at 2.30 and were given a glass of fizz while checking in (nice touch!). We were told there was a delay with one of our rooms so would we need to wait 10 mins. I don’t mind waiting and these things happen however the wait turned into an hour long wait. They were apologetic but when I commented on it after our stay I was told this was because they were trying to get us rooms on the same floor. This was not something that we had requested so not sure why this was an issue but it was the reason given. I would rather have been given a room on time or offered the option. We overheard other people being given upgrades as their rooms were delayed also however his was not offered to us (something that via email afterwards they say was given we just weren’t told). 

Now I wouldn’t let this put you off staying. It’s a great hotel in a great location. The rooms are good and on the whole the service was ok. Drinks are pricey but it is London! ",4,2019,01,29
111,Amazing Stay As Always By Montcalm,"As always the stay is always great! Swift check and any requests is granted. Just want to thank Comelia, she was amazing and a very helpful person! Thanks for making our stay comfortable! Will stay again soon!",5,2019,01,29
111,5 star experience ,"Stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House last weekend with a few friends. 5 star service from check in to check out. All the staff were very charming and attentive, in particular the Guest Experience Manager Dado was a pleasure to deal with, she went above and beyond to make sure myself and my friends had the best time possible! Dado is a great asset to your team. Without a doubt i will be returning to The Royal London House in the near future...",5,2019,01,29
111,Excellent hotel in central location with amazing staff,"This is a really great hotel in a central location and the service is fantastic.
Extra special thank you to Dado in the guest experience department for making my fiancée's birthday extra special.  We would definitely return!",5,2019,01,29
111,Simply Amazing Service (5 stars),I stayed at the Montcalm in January for 3 days to attend a work event. Hotel staff was very helpful and the location was perfect. Interior décor was exceptional and the rooms was very comfortable and unusually large for London. I would recommend this hotel to anyone intending to visit London.,5,2019,01,28
111,Amazing experience!!!,"Stayed at the Montcalm royal London house on Sunday to celebrate our anniversary. From the moment we arrived to our reluctant goodbye, the service at the montcalm is simply the best  and very professional!! 
At check in we met Dado who was the guest experience at the hotel, we done the check in and Dado took us to our room (804) which was an amazing room with an incredible view especially at night . we were thrilled to find out that she had upgraded us to the Montcalm club room  and decorated the room with nibbles and rose petals for our anniversary. The room was decorated so-beautiful with such precise details and it was so comfortable it became perfect for our occasion.This is without doubt the best service I have had in a London hotel. I just want to share how good and amazing our experience was and how much effort the team especially Dado put into our stay so that it could be the best experience and a memory to remember for our anniversary.
Had such a great and memorable time ever thanks to Dado who made it very special for us. Thank you so much. Will definitely return for another stay .",5,2019,01,28
111,The best hotel !,"Roof top bar is amazing, rooms are clean and big, staff are very professional. Been here on many occasions and I have the say is one of the best hotels and excellent value for money. 

Thank you for always being great Montcalm Royal. ",5,2019,01,28
111,Amazing weekend break away,"I booked this hotel as a treat for my husband's Birthday. We checked in early and was offered prosecco on arrival which is a lovely touch! Our room wasn't ready so they took our bags and put them in our room for when we returned later that afternoon. 
It was such a nice touch to receive a lovely Happy Birthday platter of sweet treats in our room for my husband. That was very much appreciated!
We stayed in a Montcalm Club Double. The room was very nice with big windows giving great views over the city.
We very much enjoyed use of the club lounge for some pre drinks and canapes before heading out for the evening. We also visited the roof top bar which was amazing! I had a very nice cocktail recommend by the bartender. 
We found everyone who works here very polite and helpful. We hope to return again soon.",5,2019,01,28
111,Excellent service my go to place in London.,"Just to say that I would recomend this hotel to anyone the service and attention to detail by staff are second to none. I've been here a few time now and it just gets better and better.

The rooftop bar is amazing with a veiw to die for across London. The crowd are a mix of City and Hip Urban and always relaxed. But what really makes this place so special is the decour and staff.

Can't wait to back there again.

Cheers
Phil",5,2019,01,28
111,Living up to high standards,"Very good service, great and nice room including small welcome gifts. The rooms are very modern and it’s located very centrally close to Liverpool street. Only improvement is the breakfast which could be a bit richer (e.g. add scrambled eggs or hash browns).",4,2019,01,27
111,Turned a review around to an outstanding one,"Stayed at the montcalm royal london Saturday 26th January we came back as a complimentary stay due to a disappointing one back in May. Well where do I start, you really did make up for the last time, I was happy from start to finish special thanks to Vikram and Vito who looked after is the whole stay, we started by seeing our beautiful suite with a separate living area, and two toilet and shower and bath areas, also we had fresh fruit, brownies, macaroons and champagne left for us to enjoy,we enjoyed the spa facilities, we then had a round of drinks and had a table reserved for us to sit at,also spent time in the club lounge for drinks and nibbles which we really enjoyed, and this morning our breakfast was really lovely, coffee was amazing and staff hugely attentive I was brought over a juice that was really lovely. Thank you so much as a couple it will be a highlight of our year and we will recommend to friends and family.",5,2019,01,27
111,Another great stay ,"Our 3rd visit here- 10/10 as usual.
 
Had a club room as usual which gave entry to the lounge for complimentary early evening drinks and canapés and cold meats, cheeses and pastries for breakfast.

Enjoyed a few afternoon drinks in the Sky bar which is a great addition to the hotel.",5,2019,01,27
111,Weekend break,"Lovely stay at the Montcalm hotel. All staff were attentive, polite and helpful. Extra touches like room upgrade and surprise birthday platters made it extra special. Impressive Aviary rooftop restaurant, I'm sure would be impressive during warmer weather.  Would definitely return, knowing the hospitality is very good and consistent. Great location, walking distance from Liverpool street and city venues.
Thank you Montcalm!",5,2019,01,27
111,Excellent service,"Dado, camelia and miguel, dorian made my stay very special really appreciate the help! The team setup a very nice room for our anniversary. The check in was quick and easy l, the room very spacious, huge tv, and the underfloor heating is lovely.",5,2019,01,27
111,Weekend break ,"Having stayed at this hotel many times since I discovered it last August I thought I should repay its kindness by posting a review. Overall this is an excellent hotel. Great rooms and suites, great restaurants and food and yet all this is surpassed by its staff. Collectively they make you feel very welcome and special, every time. Estefania on reception is fantastic. The real jewel in their team is Dado, top of her class. Many thanks for all your help on every visit I Make. Best. Andrew Grant",5,2019,01,27
111,1 night stay. ,"We stayed in room 425 - room & hotel lovely. Spa & pool nice. Our only disappointment was the roof top bar/ restaurant the staff that welcomed us to the restaurant we found rude, & sitting down to eat surrounded by drunken people that aren’t staying at the hotel was off putting along with all the loud music it felt like we was sat around a table at a music festival. We walked out as we couldn’t hear each other let alone the server who could not hear us either as we told her we didn’t want water but she poured us some anyway. The hotel should respect its own guests by not allowing the rest of London in to the hotel to use the facilities. ",5,2019,01,27
111,The best hotel in London,"We stayed here for 2 nights for an anniversary and we simply cannot fault this hotel. 

Stunning rooms and decor and the customer service exceeds anything we have experienced at any other hotel whilst travelling.

From the initial check in to the takeaway Americano that was given to us on checkout the whole experience was flawless.
 
This hotel is definitely worth visiting!",5,2019,01,27
111,Gorgeous hotel,"Myself and my Husband stayed here on a Saturday night.

The location is perfect for getting out and about! We arrived early to leave our bag so we could head out, check in was quick and professional. We left our bag and it was put in our room for us when we returned later in the day.

We opted for a Club Double room, which gave us access to The Club Lounge (opposite reception). Here you could help yourself to wine, Prosecco, beer, spirits and mixers. There were also some lovely canapés to enjoy. 

The room itself is very modern, a lovely coffee machine and mood lighting. Not to forget the mobile phone which is provided for you to use out and about! We particularly loved the bed, it was so incredibly comfortable and we both slept like babies! 

The Aviary on the 10th floor is one not to be missed! The views were absolutely fantastic.

Special mention to the lovely doorman (we didn’t get his name), he was so friendly and it was nice having him greet us when we came in and out of the hotel!

We will be back again soon! ",5,2019,01,27
111,Great Hotel,"Given the modest frtontage, I was pleasantly surprised with the interior and overall vibe of the hotel.

Without doubt, the jewel in the crown is the rooftop bar which provides a panoramic view of the city landscape. Music was loud and trendy and the outside terrace was awesome with heated pods in the Winter.",5,2019,01,26
111,Business ,Amazing stay. The reception staff were amazing. Special  thanks to club room- Stefan and Georgi for them professional service. I will recommend  this place and definitely  come back again. Thanks a lot Montcalm Royal London House,5,2019,01,25
111,Perfect!,"I really enjoyed staying at Montcalm Royal London House: the atmosphere, location, people, service, everything! Special thanks to Dodo who made me feel like I do not have to think about anything else and just enjoy my time! I really do recommend this place! Thank you all and I am looking forward to come back. xx",5,2019,01,24
111,Excellent! Can't wait to be back!,"Let me just start by saying that this hotel is one of the best ones I've ever stayed at. Everything from location (London central, lots of sights, shops, restaurants around) to hotel itself adds to unforgettable experience. Once you step into Moltcalm London Royal house you immediately feel the luxury around, interior is to die for. Rooms are beautiful, spotless and well oriented to every detail in them. Oh and the rooftop terrace... you just have to go up there, it literally offers the most exquisite view - it's breathtaking! Would like to also mention the wonderful staff - they make you feel well cared for. Especially Dado - she went above and beyond to help us and honestly made half of the amazing experience that we had! Overall, would highly recommend this hotel for everyone. Can't wait to be back!",5,2019,01,23
111,Great stay at the Montcalm,"Have just stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House for my wife's birthday in January and have to say it was lovely. We stayed on a Saturday night and having informed the hotel that we were celebrating a birthday we were happy to be told on check in that they'd upgraded our room which happened to have one of the most comfortable beds that I'd ever slept in at any hotel ...another nice touch was the underfloor heating in the bathroom which felt nice and toasty on the feet on a cold January night. We did the theatre and a meal up in the West End but finished the night off in the Aviary rooftop bar which was buzzing with a mixed crowd of younger singles and couples out on date nights and hotel guests , great for people watching. We ventured outside on the rooftop area for a short time to take in some great views across the City skyline but it was a little too cold out there to linger with drinks though they do have these trendy pods which I believe you can hire. The included buffet breakfast was good with a selection of hot and cold food on offer which was also taken up on the rooftop restaurant and we finished our stay off with an hour in the hotel spa which is small but was good for a short visit on a not too busy Sunday morning. All in all a really pleasant stay , not too expensive for the standard that you are getting , 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station and my wife has already noted  it in the diary again for her birthday night next January.",5,2019,01,23
111,My new favourite hotel,"The staff from the very first second are there to help you. There is always someone available to help and they are also all very attentive, to notice if you need anything before you even ask.

I went for my birthday, they made it super special by sending up a bottle of wine on the house. The beds are super comfy! Has an amazing rooftop with a great view.

I definitely will be returning again, very soon.

also, good things to note, very close to old street & moorgate station.",5,2019,01,22
111,EXTRAORDINARY!!! Amazing birthday weekend,"Our stay in this hotel was above and beyond our expectations. The room was very spacious, very modern, had super comfortable bed and in general very luxurious! The view from the rooftop terrace was incredible. Room service also amazing, we even had breakfast in our room.The list could go on and on.

The location is great: in the heart of London, just a few minutes walk to Moorgate, Old Street or Liverpool Street stations, also easy access to night buses. Very convenient!

The most amazing thing in this hotel is staff... They were so incredible, always very helpful, smiling and doing everything to make their guests feel like home! Especially I would like to thank Dado from guest experience, I have never met such an amazing and caring staff member at any other hotel that I stayed. She definitely made our stay in this hotel extraordinary. 

As it was my birthday weekend, in the room I found lots of balloons, shampagne, little sweet treats and a birthday card from staff. It was amazing!!!

I will definitely choose this hotel next time when I come to London. Only the highest ratings to this place!",5,2019,01,22
111,Birthday Treat,"Arrived around 0930 hrs, after requesting early check in when we booked, we didn’t think the room would be ready that early so the idea was we would drop our luggage off and check in later in the day.  However, luckily for us, the room was available and we were checked in immediately.  The lady on reception was lovely, asking why we were there and what our plans were. We explained it was one of our birthdays and we were having a shopping day before meeting up with friends.  As we had booked a Montcalm double room, we had access to the lounge.  We were given the timings for this (which we knew we probably wouldn’t use due to our plans for the day) however we were then invited to have some breakfast before heading into the city.  Our bag was taken to our room for us whilst we had some food.

When we arrived back in the evening a lovely card awaited us along with some chocolates/cake, a bottle of wine and some fresh fruit, wishing my husband a happy birthday.  A lovely touch and very much appreciated.

All in all great staff, great hotel and a great stay.  Highly recommend and we will be back.",5,2019,01,21
111,This hotel made our weekend in London just fabulous!,"Everything about this hotel is just perfect - comfort, the touch pad in the room that monitors heating, cooling, lights, the softest carpet in the corridor that makes you feel like you are walking on a cloud and the service... People working here are super nice, special thanks to Dado who made me want to come back to this hotel the next time visiting London!",5,2019,01,21
111,Love this hotel... Front desk staff are the BEST!,"I live in San Francisco and come to London pretty much every month.  The Montcalm Royal is my usual go-to hotel and today's experience validated why.  A minor modification in my plans created a MAJOR fiasco with Orbitz customer support today... Thankfully the front desk manager Alex and his staff came through big time for me.  

Great hotel, rooms, food and upstairs outdoor bar.... oh yea, and the staff!",5,2019,01,20
111,Good Night Stay Lovely Staff,"Good night sleep, comfy beds. Staff are kind and helpful, especially a colleague by the name of Camelia. Had issues with my initial room where the view was concerned, and was swiftly moved to a room with a better view. Defo recommend, perfect location for shopping addicts like me, short walk to oxford street. 👌🏽",5,2019,01,20
111,Great!,"The hotel was very clean and quiet. The rooms were very comfortable. The breakfest was not the big, but the quality of the food and the coffee was awesome, the wole staff of the hotel was very helpful, the concierge Andrei helped me a lot with all my requests. The receptionist Carmile was very friendly and gentle, when we arrived she even arranged a room before the time to check in. Very well located. The rooftop bar had such an awesome view and the people working there was very nice and gentle.",5,2019,01,20
111,"Great service, comfortable base","Service: attentive, friendly, fast checkin/out.

Rooms: well appointed and spacious, beds very comfortable, toiletries/extras supplied. Everything clean and in good working order. 
Quiet and dark for sleeping.
Good to have the tea and coffee facilities in the room. 

Location: good for city and plenty of bars/restaurants near by.

Price fair for location and quality.

Would happily stay again.",5,2019,01,20
111,A lovely hotel! just what you need,"Read lots of good reviews on this hotel so was excited to see what it was all about. Car parking is so easy NCP car park is directly opposite, make sure you ask Reception for a vochure on check out, absolutely great half price parking! Stayed in a family of 4 (13,11) had a lovely family suite which was interconnecting so kids loved it too as felt like they had their own room. We stayed in room 918 a lovely entrance to the room over looking the City. Service was marvellous, complimentary drinks and snacks from 5:30 we had a quick drink before dinner out. What I loved especially about this hotel is the staff do not forget about the kids they are treated just like that adults, a welcome glass of Processco when you check in and straight away they ask the children if they would like a juice or water and bring theirs up just the same way on the tray, I love little touches like this. The shuttleboard games were great, these kept the kids well entertained. Pool was great all had a quick swim in the afternoon. Breakfast was lovely, we loved the Club Lounge room for drinks and breakfast made a change from sitting in the main bar. We also went up to Archiary Bar wow what a hidden gem this place is loved it with such amazing views, the little pods look cool but they were occupied. Thank you Montcalm Royal was a truly lovely stay, everything was perfect! Oh and it was my birthday I disappeared up to the room to get myself ready in peace and quiet, then a knock on the door came and they presented me with my Happy Birthday platter which was very special so thank you! Loved how the Front of House lady approached me whilst having pre dinner drinks asking if everything was OK. Staff are young but know exactly what they are doing, Montcalm you have trained them very very well, you have professional, polite and very well mannered staff. Again, thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2019,01,20

111,Amazing 5 star hotel with excellent amenities,"This is by far the best hotel in the city, its luxurious with very attentive and helpful staff and concierge.
It has very spacious well equipped rooms with heated floors, large comfortable beds and large screen tvs with Sky. Hotel is located in walking distance from stations and many shops closeby for all amenities. I love this place for my weekly business trips and no request is too big fir the staff here who will make sure your stay is as smooth as possible. Its a very lively place with 3 good bars and a fully equipped lounge. This is the one of my favourite places and Alex on reception is most helpful and always greets me with a big smile which makes the checkin all the more enjoyable. 
This is definately a hotel where customer service is top of list of priorities for all staff.",5,2019,01,18

There was a card written by Alex ( the manager) wishing us a pleasant stay and wishing me happy birthday which was so lovely. He was very welcoming and kind and he made sure we had everything we needed. He also showed us up to the rooftop bar which was absolutely stunning!

111,Birthday Weekend,"I had an amazing stay over the weekend with my partner at the Montcalm. The staff were very polite and attentive and made the stay very comfortable.

The room had a beautiful view, both in the eveming and morning. Also beautiful views from the rooftop bar in the evening. Perfect to end the night with a few glasses of wine.

Thanks again to Alex and the team at Royal London House!",5,2019,01,15
111,Lovely,"This  was the second visit to london for me and my partener  and we are more then happy we chose this hotel.
I called the hotel with a day before our stay to make sure we will benefit of an early check and Camelia was really helpful and assured that this will defintely happen. She also gave us this beautfiul room, I have never met such a wonderful personel and also we received a great service from the entire team ! Keep up the good work !",5,2019,01,15
111,Fantastic trip with the family,"We brought our children on a trip from the States, and had a great experience.  A particular highlight was breakfast in the Aviary on the roof, where the service was excellent, and the food was fantastic.  We planned each day's outings over cappuccino and a Full English breakfast, which made a great start to each day.",5,2019,01,15
111,Awesome and thankfull,"My daughter asked the staff to do something special for my birthday. And thanks to Dado, I had a wonderfull surprise in my room. It made my day extra special.The room, staff were excellent. Nearby liverpoolstreet station if u have to travel to the airport.",5,2019,01,15
111,One night not enough,"What a lovely welcome we received from the concierge to the check in.  The member of staff looking after us on arrival was so friendly, interested in us on our plans whilst remaining professional.  The room was extremely well presented with complimentary water, fruit, coffee and tea making facilities.  The rooms benefit from state of the art  heating and lighting.  You really could not fault this hotel.  The facilities on offer are varied and something to suit most guests.  ",5,2019,01,15
111,Great stay,"Stayed for 2 nights for a birthday treat.  Very friendly reception staff who checked us in quickly and explained access to the lounge for breakfast  (smoked salmon, meats, croissants,  breads, cereals, juice) and snacks  throughout the day.     Our room was spacious and the bed really comfortable.   We ate in the Avairy on the second evening - lovely food and again service both in the restaurant and bar.   Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,01,14
111,Great experience at a wonderful hotel,Had a amazing stay and sleep at this wonderful hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff Camelia on the front desk made sure everything went very smooth and quickly. Will definetly be returning soon as everything was amazing.,5,2019,01,14
111,Amazing weekend at The Montcalm Royal London House,"My partner and I needed a night away from our London routine so we decided to check in at the Montcalm RLH. It was simply wonderful: the check-in process was smooth and efficient. When we got to our room Alexander came to show us the features of the room and it was very kind and useful. We enjoyed our stay so much that we actuallly stayed another night and the lady at the front desk made it very very easy, we didn’t even have to change room. I can not recommend this hotel and their staff enough.
The only downside would be the service at the Aviary, extremely disappointing.",5,2019,01,14
111,exquisit view and fabulous stay,"We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London on 10th January 2019 for my birthday, it was a treat from my partner who works and staying London, and wow; did it blow me away! 

Our stay was filled with luxury and surprises, the team excelled all our expectations.

The staff were outstanding, room and views amazing and the food and personal touches made our stay exceptional.

I would not hesitate to book and stay at this hotel again in the future.

I would like to take this opportunity to praise the staff, from the front of house to the waitresses in the Avery. We travel regular and stay around the country in various locations monthly with our work and my partner has been working in London since mid-December staying in hotels, your hotel has surpassed our expectations and more.

Congratulations to you all!! I am so glad we changed our reservations with a different hotel to yourselves for this occasion.

We stayed in the deluxe double which was spacious and the views amazing, we ate in the Avery on the night and the food was lovely, very well cooked and tasty and the cocktails great. The views from here and the glass pods were amazing!! 

We also used the Spa which was lovely although the pool was a little cool for some people this was just what you needed after getting out of the steam room.

I would not hesitate in booking this hotel again!",5,2019,01,14
111,Relaxing Saturday night stay,"The double club room that we stayed in was really nice, I liked that the bathroom had underfloor heating.  The room was also really well sound insulated and the elemis products that were provided were a lovely touch.  I thought it was really nice that the staff seemed to know who we were from the minute we arrived and looked after us very well, it had a very personal touch. Overall we had a wonderful Saturday night spent at the Montcalm, Royal London House, we felt very relaxed and were made to feel very welcome by the friendly staff. Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,01,14
111,Ms Thomas,"Stayed here for my husband 40th birthday and I was extremely blown away by the warmth greeting,standard of the hotel, the excellent and exceptional services from the staff. Complimentary decor of the room (many thanks to Camelia at the front desk) really apprecite.This was AMAZING! Not to mention the roof terrace with an amazing view.The buffet breakfast was lovely,I can go on and on but this is a must stay if you are in London. I will definitely be staying here again. Thanks a lot! (Mountcalm royal London)",5,2019,01,14
111,Excellent hotel and perfect for special occasion with great service,"I booked a Montcalm club double with the help of Dado (guest experience) to propose to my girlfriend (Now fiancée!). Dado, along with all the staff at the hotel, were extremely helpful and accomodating to make it a truly wonderful evening! The room was decorated perfectly and mood lighting allows you to personalise as you wish. Will certainly be returning! 
Impeccable room, perfect view, amazing staff!",5,2019,01,13
111,Another Fantastic experience at this beautiful hotel,"This is the second time visiting this hotel. After running into some trouble with our booking via Booking.com Camelia from reception greeted us with a great smile and said that she would try her best to get everything sorted. This was a special occasion for my GF birthday, Within the hour of getting there Camelia had personally rang me and resolved the issue. She was fantastic through out and went above and behind to make our stay a great one. Alexander helped us with our bags and kindly showed us to our room, he also explained about the services that was on offer, once again with a great smile. We also had a very nice card and complimentary dessert.  Our room was fantastic and the beds were so comfortable. We also visited the rooftop bar for a few drinks, Stephen working behind the bar was fantastic and helped made us some beautiful cocktails. The staff are amazing in this hotel and are always happy to help with a great smile, I'm defiantly going to be visiting again.",5,2019,01,13
111,Nice stay ,"We stayed in our annual girls London trip. We save up to stay somewhere exceptional.

Really nice atmosphere lively bars loads of London workers come here to drink after work.

Our room was lovely although we never got the promised pillow menu lol.

The spa at time of visit was nice and quiet and the spa area was lovely.

Staff polite and professional the 2am fire alarm drill which went off twice was unnerving not much of an apology at check out although it’s not their fault a lot of people complained.

I’d definitely stay again it was nice.",4,2019,01,13
111,Very enjoyable stay,"I booked a deluxe double room here for a night away with my girlfriend for her birthday. The room was beautiful as was the entire hotel. The rooftop bar was a highlight with exceptional views of London. The staff were incredibly helpful and assisted with a small Bluetooth issue. This was very quickly resolved. One thing to note, the room was quite warm which isn’t great when you’re getting ready. We put the air con on but felt it wasn’t working as it should. When I called downstairs for assistance I was told someone would come and have a look at the air on but no one showed. This might sound like a complaint but it’s not, just something to note. Other than this we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend. The service and standard of the hotel was remarkable and we’d definitely stay again :)",5,2019,01,13
111,5 star,"I’ve been to the Montcalm hotel in Shoreditch and it was brilliant so I had no doubt that the one in Finsbury Park would be just as good.  The service was 10/10. We had to wait one hour for the room to be ready but I’m not the one to fuss over things and create a big problem so I didn’t mind waiting. Whist waiting for our room to be done we explored the hotel and visited the rooftop bar Aviary which holds stunning views of London and we had two drinks there while the sun was setting. The room was great, I was on the 8th floor just below the rooftop bar so our room also had the good view of London. The whole stay there was great. Will definitely be visiting here again in the future! ",5,2019,01,13
111,Partners Birthday Surprise,Took my partner to the Montcalm including spa! Was absolutely brilliant. The hotel decorated the room with some complimentary desserts awaiting us with a happy birthday message. Bed was full of flower petals. They staff were so friendly and really made it a special stay! One of the best hotels i have been to! High class service!!,5,2019,01,12
111,Very friendly service,"One thing that stuck out about my stay was that the staff are so friendly! Nicoletta at the front desk went above and beyond just to make sure my stay was pleasant. She was incredibly helpful!!

I enjoyed my stay so much that I decided to extend it. Stefanie at the front desk gave me a great room! The rooms were clean and spacious.

I plan to stay again very soon!",5,2019,01,09
111,Fantastic!,"Extremely helpful staff that where happy to help with luggage, transport and much more. We where upgraded to a business sweet as soon as we arrived and the roombwas massive with night lights and mood lighting. We'll definitely stay with them again.",5,2019,01,07
111,Amazing!!!!,"Stayed here with a group of friends for my 21st birthday and it was so good! Staff were so so friendly helping us carry our bags and showing us to our rooms. Rooms were very clean and spacious, nice layout with a massive TV! The rooftop bar was also amazing, staff even brought out some brownies/fudge with candles on. Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in, can’t flaw it! 10/10 would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in London, right next to tube stations, night life, food places, has a secure car park right opposite. Very good value for money! ",5,2019,01,07
111,Amazing stay!,"Great stay and thanks to all the staff of the royal : Dado and the team. Amazing place to spend vacation. Service is perfect, sauna and tea and we really enjoyed the top floor Aviary bar. The bar manager is serviable and handsome. Many thanks and best for 2019. We will visit again . M",5,2019,01,06
111,Christmas Break in London,"Good hotel in London. Being able to choose your pillow and room fragrance before you arrive is a great idea.

Loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom.

Spa facilities were also really good. Do wish the pool was heated though.

Did not have breakfast or food here so cannot comment on that. Prices are typical for London.

Will stay here again when in London. 

p.s. I found that I got the best price booking direct.",5,2019,01,06
111,Fabulous!,"This was our 4th visit to a Montcalm hotel, but our first time visiting the Royal London. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the room was beautiful. We had access to the club lounge which was a real surprise and a great addition to our visit. The only things that I would change are the control screen in the room which shed a bright light all night which I would have liked to turn off and we were one of the inside rooms which was quite close to a large fan which you could hear in the background. We would definitely visit again but we would request and outside room. ",5,2019,01,06
111,Great stay!,"Nice hotel not too far from the main London’s attractions. The staff is very nice and the rooms are clean. I think this hotel has a very good quality at competitive prices.
Very appreciated the glass of champagne at the check in.",5,2019,01,04
111,Comfort and Convenience  ,"This hotel definitely provides the luxury and comfort especially for business travelers. Stayed at the Montcalm for 1 1/2 weeks and was pleased throughout the duration of my stay. I appreciated the small details the property provided such as a cell phone for local calls and internet while out and about. Being I’m from California heated bathrooms isn’t necessarily a standard, therefore the heated marble floors was a plus! There’s a rooftop bar with a beautiful 360 view and comfy lounges but not enough outlets to plug your laptop. A real downside for me was the food. I’m a true food snob so I was disappointed in the quality and options available at the restaurant and bar lounge, but the drinks were decent. ",4,2019,01,04
111,Thanks for this amazing journey,"Great bravo and thanks to all thé staff of the royal : Monika at thé reception, Chris, Karl, Olivier, thé burdok staff, thé room staff and thé spa team. Amazing place to spend vacation. Service is unique. Thanks thanks thanks and thé best for 2019. We will be back. Francois",5,2019,01,03
111,Top class luxury hotel in the City of London,"We've stayed in this hotel a couple of times already and this is our top choice of hotels I've ever stayed. From the rooms, through the SPA/pool to the restaurants/bars and lounge areas and service everything top class. Love it, love it, love it! Relaxing, quite and super comfy stay. Great job! We will definitely stay there again!",5,2019,01,02
111,Amazing!,"Thank you very much for a great service. The Restaurant on the top floor served an amazing breakfast. Best Cappuccino in town! Nice atmosphere, great skilled staff and amazing food! Highly recommended.",5,2019,01,01
111,Best stay ,"Hi - customer service always makes the difference on a stay. From the minute we arrived and offer prosecco to the time my husband was lent cufflinks as left his at home, nothing was too much. Spa was small, but perfect for the amount of guests. Only think I think could improve is a costs for buffet breakfast at the aviary, when you can order from a la cartels menu for cheaper. Eg an omelette is 9 quid rather than 25 for buffet style. Roof top bar has amazing views too. ",5,2018,12,30
111,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights in mid December at the weekend.  Being in the City this made it a very calm and peaceful break as there were no city workers around at the weekend.  Perfect; no hussle and bustle.   The concierge was very polite and helpful.  Check in was a little slow and they do take a deposit on your card which im yet to see refunded.  However, overall very professional. 

I requested to change room and was upgraded FOC.  The room was lovey, very well appointed with modern furnishings, Nespressos coffee machine, kettle, tea, coffee etc.  Glasses of all shapes and sizes, including flutes.  There was fresh water each day and fresh fruit too.  The mini bar is well stocked and not too expensive.   The Smart TV was gigantic.   The room has mood lighting, night lights, underfloor heating in the modern bathroom and a nice seating area.   Overall i was impressed with this room.  No view tho, just another building (5th floor)

The Aviary resturant has wonderful views and I ate here one evening and found the food to be of high standard.   The outside terrace is spectacluar day and night with ""Pods"" that you can hire (i think around the region of £280).

Very nice hotel, good location for a quiet London weekend but within good proximity to walk to Brick Lane(10 mins), Spitalfields (5 mins) and also the Barbican Botnical Gardens. (15 mins)

I will stay again",5,2018,12,30
111,"Good looking hotel, but let down a little by finishing touches and hot room","Stayed in September for two nights with friends. We paid extra for a Montcalm Club Double, but this seemed no different to our friends' room (which was a Club Double). On the plus side, the room had modern décor and it was clean, with good toiletries, TV and comfy bed. Downsides included issues with the air con (too hot) and touchpad technology which was slow to respond, and poor quality towels/robes - my towel didn't smell very fresh. The bathroom was a good size with a lovely walk in shower. But there were no hooks to hang your towels, which was a bit awkward. Our friends' room was also very hot - even hotter than ours. Reception staff were very welcoming, and when we reported the issues above with the air con and towels, they tried to resolve. Unfortunately the air con couldn't be sorted for either room. We used the club lounge for canapés and breakfast. Very good service and polite staff. Good range of food/drinks. Only disappointment was that the club lounge was fairly open next to the reception area, so didn't feel very private or exclusive. Overall, an enjoyable stay, but for the class of hotel we expected more.",3,2018,12,29
111,Excellent Hotel,"Well what can I say, the service I recieved from the staff at this hotel was exceptional, especially by Camelia. She went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable and really cared about the guests.
The hotel is very clean and well presented with a fabulous roof top bar.
The room was modern, clean and very comfortable to stay in. I bumped into the maid who checked we were happy and everything was ok. Again excellent service by the staff! 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit London and needs a friendly hotel in a great location.",5,2018,12,28
111,Wonderful Stay at Montcalm Royal London House,"We stayed there for one night, we went there for my birthday from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out everything was exceptional amazing staffs ( Michael and Javier ) they were so lovely, Friendly and helpful thank you guys so so much I had the best birthday ever room was clean and smelled really nice and fresh, beautiful Spa,  amazing breakfast and once again amazing staffs (Michael and Javier) I really can't recommend this place enough everything was 10 out of 10 from the food to staffs to room to the spa and all the services thank you so much Montcalm London (Finsbury Square) you guys are amazing thank you so so much for everything. xxx",5,2018,12,27
111,5 star stay in London,"Amazing stay at this hotel along with my partner for our anniversary. Staff were from friendly and accommodating from the moment we were greeted at the front door to when we checked in.

We had the club room which was very spacious (I believe 250sq ft) and we'll appointed with numerous amenities such as coffee machine, free water, fruit, iron and much more! The bed was extremely comfortable and very big so a decent night's sleep. Bathroom also very big and clean with plenty of towels and bathrobes for us both.

As it was our anniversary, the hotel very kindly left us some macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries as a congratulation and these were very warmly received.

Another reason for our stay was because we had booked The Book of Mormon at Prince of Wales Theatre, which was around 2 miles away by taxi. Therefore this hotel was perfectly located for us to be close enough but also not right in the hustle and bustle.

Our room number was 330 and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Not to forget the very advanced technology to operate the lights, underfloor heating in bathroom and do not disturb via smart touch pad was a great touch. As well as all sky channels so we could watch a movie or two whilst relaxing! 10/10 for Montcalm Royal London. ",5,2018,12,24
111,Wow. Loved it,What a lovely hotel. 5 star definitely. Greeted with friendly staff. Glass of prosecco. Lovely clean room. Bed turned down at night. Amazing rooftop bar. Lovely pool. Slippers and bathrobes. Would love to come back.,5,2018,12,22
111,Beautiful hotel in a great location with fantastic customer service!,"We really loved our stay at the Montcalm. It was a treat for my husband's birthday and he loved it. The room was beautiful, with lots of funky features. The staff were really helpful and took great care to help us out in any way they could. They even returned my kindle to me after I left it in the room by accident after we checked out. We would definitely return.",5,2018,12,20
111,Excellent place,"This hotel is from far one of the best, from the stunning view from Aviary bar to the Spa and the fantastic service overall. Long arm is a nice place too, loved their beer. We will definitely come back and recommend to our friends. ",5,2018,12,17
111,Big room,"My second stay at this property in recent months and it gets better. Lovely staff, nice size room, comfy bed, fancy toiletries. 

Concierge was mostly helpful although was a bit disappointed when I asked where to go for a late drink and the best they could suggest was the duck and waffle when there was a very nice cocktail bar we found just two doors down the road!

I needed somewhere to hang on and do some more work after check out time. Reception asked where I was off to next, i mentioned this and they immediately offered to buy me a coffee whilst I made use of the lobby. A small gesture, but it sets them apart. 

Look forward to returning soon.

",5,2018,12,16
111,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location in London,"This was one of the best hotel experiences I have had.  The staff, including the general manager, Dado, could not have been more accommodating.  The hotel has beautifully appointed rooms with all the amenities one could ask for, including a smart phone for one to use while travelling around London.  The bathroom floors are heated, there is a large screen TV in the room.  Access to a lounge with drinks and light snacks is a lovely touch every evening from 17:30.  There is a beautiful pool and hot tub on the basement floor with a sauna and steam room along with spa locker room facilities.  The staff could not be kinder.  Life abounds in this hotel with two bars on the first floor along with a cafe and a restaurant.  The roof has one of the top restaurants, Aviary, in London, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  Unfortunately, we could not get reservations over the weekend.  Make them in advance.  The hotel is 1 1/2 blocks from the Moorgate Tube stop and a short walk to Spitafields, Broadgate Circle, and Brick Lane and it is close to the Barbican Center.  Surrounding the hotel are many cool restaurants and drinking establishments.    Above all, service is top notch and an extension of the excellent leadership of the hotel staff.  Staying here is a great experience.",5,2018,12,15
111,Love this hotel ,Our 3rd stay at the Montcalm and excellent experience once again. All the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for visiting the London sites. We had lunch in the Aviary bar which was just right and reasonably priced. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and looked lovely. Will definitely be staying here again ,5,2018,12,13
111,"1 night, close to office","Comelia & Helina at the front desk were very helpful, friendly & professional. I’ve stayed at the M by Montcalm Tech City many times before but this hotel is now very close to my new office & I’ll be a frequent guest from now on! Clean, modern hotel with different bat choices if you want a drink or just good bar food/atmosphere. ",5,2018,12,11
111,Excellent,"Stayed at The Montcalm Royal London House for my birthday, from the moment we arrived the service was amazing could not fault the staff at all. Special mention to Dada she went over and above to make sure my experience and birthday were made special. would defiantly recommend and go back again.  Stayed  over the weekend for my birthday at The Mon",5,2018,12,11
111,AMAZING AS ALWAYS!!!,"This is our second visit for myself and my husband. From the amazing smooth check in to our homely stay we felt at home.
We checked in early around 11am which was no problem for the helpful staff. They kept our baggage so we could explore the city. 
On return to the hotel we went up to our room. We had previously upgraded to a club double which is worth every penny. The rooms are huge. We had room 803. It had an amazing view. 
Having a club room we are welcomed into the club lounge for free drinks and nibbles. The drinks are of a vast choice. Including wine, prosecco, lagers aswell as soft drinks and spirits. The nibbles were plentiful chicken, shrimps, dips and nachos. 
After a restful night sleep we tucked into the breakfast complementary with our club room. Smoked salmon, cheeses, hams and rolls. Aswell as cereals and fresh fruit. 
I would like to say a HUGE thank you to DADA (guest expereince) she was so warm and friendly. After realising it was our second stay she placed a gift of wine and macaroons in our room with a lovely card. Dada also had a drink with us aswell as saying goodbye when we left. She truly is the star of the hotel. 
Thank you to all the staff at the montcalm. We will be returning to see you all again in the new year.",5,2018,12,09
111,Mum and son time,"Really can’t recommend this hotel enough, beautiful building , furnished to a high quality 

Lovely rooms, really can’t find fault , and believe me I usually can !!!!

All staff we met were super friendly and nothing was too much trouble .

We would recommend this hotel 100%",5,2018,12,09
111,Only place I would stay in London! ,"This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and both times have been truly excellent. Nothing is too much trouble but they have got the right balance between helpful and not being intrusive. Every member staff is helpful and has a smile on their face. I would like to give a special mention to Dado who as guest experience manager really went the extra mile to make our stay special. 

The rooftop bar is a must and there's brilliant views of the city. It's got a great location near Moorgate and Liverpool Street tube stations. Also very close to box park food outlets near shoreditch. 

I could not recommend this hotel more highly and we will certainly be back again next year. ",5,2018,12,08
111,"Good location, newly refurbished, but let down by a few basics","The hotel is wonderfully located for the City, at the north end of Finsbury Square.  This is a blessing and a curse, for if you want fresh air in your room, you contend with the 24 x 7 hubbub of London, if your room faces onto the.square  At least the windows in the bedrooms open, which is far from a given nowadays.  It would have been unnecessary but the airconditioning was woeful: the electronic management system kept rebooting itself, but even then it failed to make a dent in the tropical heat.  At breakfast, I found out that my colleagues had experienced similar issues.
I had been housed in a room with an adjoining door to the room next door.  Again, the insulation was woeful.  The gentleman in the room next door decided to have a telephone conversation at 4am to which I was party, even to the extent of being able to eavesdrop on his confidential discussion: really not appropriate, and - assuming that the hotel was not full - should be a basic consideration when allotting rooms.
The room itself was of a good size, particularly for a London hotel and was well-appointed.  The bed was too soft for my back, but that is a matter of taste; I'm sure for many people it was comfortable.  The bathroom had a lovely shower, and again, was of a decent size.
The breakfast was plentiful and of a good quality, with eggs freshly prepared to order.  I would have preferred more fresh fruit options, but that is a niggle.  The coffee was good and strong.  We also held our meeting in the hotel, and the meeting room was of a good size, and although located in the basement, it was not overly pokey.  
The service throughout was attentive and efficient although when I was asked about my night's sleep, and related my annoyance at being woken at 4am, the receptionist floundered a bit, mumbling an apology and offering to correct that 'next time'...  
Against most standards this is a lovely hotel, but when you're paying £300+ a night, you should expect flawless execution of the basics: the guarantee of an uninterrupted night's sleep and decent temperature control in the room being amongst those.",4,2018,12,08
111,Wonderful place,"The hotel is lovely and is very well located. The rooms are very clean and beautiful and quite big compared to other London hotels.
The hotel has a great vibe and the staff is very professional. Dado took very good care of our needs and we really appreciate it.
I would also like to thank Mr. Vikram  for the hospitality.",5,2018,12,06

111,Overnight Stay,Stayed overnight at the very nice hotel. Dined at The Aviary Restaurant. A little pricey but the quality was excellent. All staff we had contact with were very helpful and polite particularly Camelie who ensured our stay was very comfortable.Would highly recommend as a place to see Camden and Spitalfields. ,5,2018,12,04
111,Amazing room,"My fiancee and I stayed here over the weekend and were given the an incredible room on the 9th floor. The stunning views and quality of the room itself made our stay very special indeed.

We will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,03

111,Amazing stay,We're very happy to have stayed at montcalm as our very last night together before separating thousands of miles away from each other. Its an amazing hotel with great service and being a fussy person I'm most satisfied with their bathroom. We also had a little courtesy from the hotel in which we celebrate our last night together although it's been mistaken for a birthday occasion we are very grateful for the gesture. We'll be revisiting for sure in the future and it might just be the special hotel for us.,5,2018,11,26
111,Weekend in London,Fantastic classy hotel. 5 mins from Liverpool Street station. Awesome views from rooftop bar on tenth floor to enjoy a drink. Would highy recommend to stay with ur partner. A basic room is also very high spec would definitely return.,5,2018,11,25
111,Weekend away to London,"This was the first time we stayed here, having stayed at The Brewery and Montcalm M previously. We absolutely loved it here, Brilliant bars and restaurants within the hotel, the rooftop was a personal favourite, we had Sunday lunch up there on the Sunday which was amazing, this was after we had been in the pool and jacuzzi in the morning which is lovely.
Really can’t say enough and can’t wait to return.",5,2018,11,25
111,Amazing experience,"We stayed at the hotel for one night only. It was my boyfriend's Birthday. They treated us so well. We found a Birthday cake and a bottle of wine in our room. The service was excellent. All the staff was very helpful. There is a few bars and restaurants in the hotel, so you have a choice. We had dinner at the roof top bar/restaurant and on the next day we had a spa day booked in at the same hotel. Just amazing. We had everything we needed. Highly recommended.",5,2018,11,21
111,Weekend Treatment - worth the money,"I have stayed in various hotels in the are before for business usually, and by far this is my number one. The staff was amazing, helpful, and rooms were pretty clean and comfortable. The location is also very convenient for the city and close to various public transportation, like Liverpool Street station is in a walking distance for 6-8 minutes.",5,2018,11,21
111,brilliant visit,third time of visiting this hotel and one of my best hotels in london. service is first class staff cant do enough for you. food is very good booked the avairy for lunch which didnt disappoint. views up there are amaxing especially on a sunny day. again food and service very good. As for the rooms they are also really lovely smart tv does loads with sky tv channels. if you book a club room also gives access to the club lounge again so worth it drinks &canapes in the evening and light breakfast in the morning in a relaxed area. staff continue to refill items finished. reception staff very efficent and upon arrival received a glass of prosecco. you must try this hotel. be silly not to. x ,5,2018,11,19
111,Amazing hotel & Facilities,The hotel is amazing with great facilities. The spa was a lovely experience and the hotel staff were very welcoming upon arrival. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. The rooftop bar was very nice. They do not offer car parking facilities however there is an NCP car park opposite the hotels where you get 50% off with Montcalm if you keep the car there for 24 hours.,5,2018,11,16
111,The Pointers,"We stayed at Montcalm on 3rd November. We had a great time at a fantastic hotel.It was a treat for a special birthday and was made all the more special by lovely Dado and the wonderful staff. Absolutely stunning view of London from rooftop bar. A lovely hotel, with very friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble. Can't wait to go back.",5,2018,11,15
111,Best service ever!!,"I went to Montcalm Royal for 3 nights and was one of the best experiences I ever had! The whole hotel looks modern and super clean but the staff made it at its best! I had a short trip in London with my sis for my birthday and it end up as big surprise from the whole service team!🌟 Stefan was always taking care that we don’t push the door, so we keep our energy for shopping, while Dorian, Alex, Elyor and the Bulgarian  amazing concierge provided us all the tickets and short ways to the touristic attractions ♥️ Stefan welcomed us to the business lounge, with best drinks and snacks, making every evening special after a busy day of visiting London... Iulian served us the best bear and so sweet e had a great experience in London which will be probably repeat it soon!
I wanna mention that I went to several 5* hotels where I paid at least 10 times more (M. O ny) but never had such an incredible service and comprehensive staff! Thank you all for everything and see you soon again!🙏🏻 #foodisabless in there too!!!

",5,2018,11,12
111,Wish I had more than 1 night there.,"Great, great hotel - shuffleboard in the lobby, a nice bar with good staff by the side of them. Rooftop bar, and a restaurant on site too. Room was great, spotless and clean. Gauchos restaurant 5 minutes walk away for a nice meal of an evening too.",5,2018,11,12
111,Weekend in London ,"The Montcalm London House is a smart hotel with excellent facilities. It would suit both business and leisure travellers. Staff all very smart and helpful. Rooms are very stylish with everything you could want / need for a short stay. The roof terrace bar restaurant (The Aviary) is super smart and well worth a visit. 
It's a little bit out for someone who wants to be on the door step of major attractions but mainline stations and tubes on the door step make getting around easy.",5,2018,11,12
111,Excellent Hotel! ,"Really enjoyed staying here this weekend! Thanks to Michael the duty manager he made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in.

We stayed in the Montcalm club room and it was a really nice room credit for recommending this Michael!

The spa was really nice too even was luckily enough to have the spa to ourselves! 

Definitely will be back and would highly recommend staying here you won’t be disappointed! 
",5,2018,11,11
111,Another amazing stay,"This will be our 6th visit to this hotel and it never ever disappoints, we are thoroughly spoilt by the lovely Olivier in the aviary restaurant, and always looked after amazingly well by the lovely Dado.. all the staff are so helpful and friendly, it was my brothers birthday weekend and it was made all the more special by the treatment received at The Montcalm, we have already booked our return visit in a few weeks, and because of the lovely people we have met we will never stay anywhere else when visiting London!",5,2018,11,11
111,Hotel doesn’t feel like 5*,"Lovely clean rooms-modern slighty on the small side,but ok if not spending a lot of time in the room. 
Loud fans outside the room which luckily can only be heard if you open the window,A/C fine.
All staff very friendly and accomdating however the check in process is very slow. Wasn’t informed there is a spa in the hotel.
Lifts take a very long time if room is close to the top.
Doesn’t feel like a 5* hotel because there is a bar either side of the restaurant which were equally very very loud. Great atmosphere if that’s what your looking for.",3,2018,11,11
111,Husbands birthday weekend ,"We have just stayed for two nights and had a fabulous time. This is our third visit to The Montcalm Royal and they never fail to impress. Staff are always friendly and attentive, from the doormen, receptionists, chambermaids, and especially Olivier and his team in The Aviary. See you again soon no doubt x x",5,2018,11,11
111,Mr & Mrs Dhesi,"Me and wife booked this hotel last minute on the day. We wanted to get away for our anniversary. The service we received was outstanding, we were offered complimentary drinks and snacks to our room. The manager even joined us for a cup of tea after we checked out. She was so professional and very very respectful. We go up to London quite a lot and from now on this will be the place we will always stay.",5,2018,11,11
111,Extremely happy,"Me and my partner came here for his 21st birthday, and it definitely did not disappoint! The room was decorated for us with complimentary drinks and a dessert and balloons etc when we arrived to the room. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the hygiene was 5* and in general superb. It came to checking out and we had two snacks from the in room mini bar, the manager said ‘don’t worry it’s on me as it’s your birthday’ how lovely of her! 
We are definitely coming back again soon. 
Thank you for a lovely experience!",5,2018,11,11
111,Perfect place to stay!,"Stayed here for 2 nights, everything was great! From the reservation team, concierge, front desk team! Was communicating with them via email, and they were prompt with their replies. Upon check in, the female service staff was fast and efficient, Alex from concierge took us to our room. Room was spacious and well equipped too(huge smart tv)! Breakfast at the club lounge was ok too, continental breakfast. Special shout out to Alex and Daniel for their exceptional service provided! Just 1 set back, on our 2nd night, the concierge staff dressed in white shirt and pants, was not that approachable when I asked for some details about the train to Gatwick.   ",5,2018,11,09
111,First visit to London,"It was my husband's 50th birthday trip and our first time in London.  We went on a European tour and spent the weekend in London following the tour.  Our 2-night stay at Montcalm was the icing on the cake.  The hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely helpful, polite and professional.  The room was very comfortable and everything was state of the art.  We were very impressed!",5,2018,11,08
111,A lovely stay indeed,"I just spent 4 nights at this wonderful London gem.  Though the location isn't all that close to a lot of the typical tourist attractions, the tube is easy enough to use and make your way around the city.  All of the staff on property are courteous, warm and helpful.  They genuinely want to make your stay a memorable one.   

In particular, there's a young gentleman, Daniel, who is at their concierge desk.   Daniel is inquisitive about your needs and goes out of his way to offer guidance that is tailored to your requests.  And though, I can't say this about many concierge staff in my many travels, he remembers your name and follows up to see if his suggestions met with your requirements.  Impressive.

The food at the Aviary restaurant is wonderful and comes with a view. In particular, the chicken dish on the menu is perfectly cooked and elegantly served.  My only criticism of the restaurant is that the chef won't prepare the burger any other temperature but well-done.   Well, well-NOT-done.  Either it should come off the menu or find a beef distributor that can be relied upon for quality beef.

All in all - a solid choice for any accommodation needs.",5,2018,11,07
111,Great hotel with not great with customer service,"I made a reservation through booking.com for a great price, and on the day of our stay the hotel rang me to say they couldn't honour the booking at that price and I had to pay 50% more, but they would throw in an upgrade, free brekky and lounge access. It was a birthday trip and we were on a tight budget and I felt I had to accept this as we were hours away from check in and I didn't want to let my Mum down. It was very sly of them and not what I would expect from this hotel group. We did however have a pleasant stay, my Mum loved it and that was the main thing.
It's very central, near the Barbican (Cinema and Arts venue), lovely rooftop restaurant, great breakfast and comfy beds. Downsides was no bath and room was too high tech with a low white noise that impaired my sleep. ",4,2018,11,07
111,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel - highly recommended. The team working here are lovely and it’s always a friendly and professional welcome. The rooms are very well equipped and the bed is super comfy. Great service a facilities in the spa too. This is a small and personable oasis in the heart of the city.,5,2018,11,06
111,Tremendous service. Great Hotel ,I loved this hotel. The service was fantastic and the staff second to none. They were totally efficient and so unobtrusive. We were offered tea/coffee during check in and from then on nothing was too much. The carpets are extremely luxurious and the rooms are great. Quite high tech. The TV was ultra high definition and was huge. We had a fab stay. Will definitely be back. Thanks a lot. ,5,2018,11,06
111,I will definitely go back,"From the moment we got to the front door the service was impressive and impeccable! 
The hotel is definitely a 5 star luxury, very clean, comfortable, very good amenities and lovely spacious rooms well appointed. The attention to details is obvious anywhere you go in the hotel and on every level. 
What make the difference with other luxury hotels is the level of service which a lot of them in london could only hope to get to one day and that includes palace hotels.
We were welcome by Dado who certainly masters the way to make customers feel like VIPs. Nothing was too much trouble and her smile and positive attitude were genuine (not a BA smile). 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough. 
I can't wait to go back. ",5,2018,11,06
111,Fantastic Anniversary Weekend!,"Me and my girlfriend arrived on Saturday Lunch time for our anniversary and had lovely greetings from all the staff all very happy to see us and extremely helpful. Very nice glass of Prosecco was given to us while we waited to check in. And when we checked in  we were treated to a free room upgrade!!  what was so generous and the room was amazing so spacious and clean and full sky TV! We had lunch on the rooftop such great views and lovely cocktails and great burgers! 

For everything we received I would say it is extremely good value money and have stayed stayed at more expensive hotels and they where no way near as good in every single way.

We would recommend it too anyone and will defiantly be back soon! 

Thank you to all the staff who made our weekend so great.

Ashlea + Alex",5,2018,11,05
111,Excellent hotel,"With a 2 week training course to attend I selected the hotel initially on its proximity to the London banking area.

It is a nice and easy 20 min walk to Canon Street station, there is a good bus route from close to the hotel should you want to ride.

The rooms were very opulent - comfortable bed, nice washing facilities, under floor heating - with zero noise from outside.

The hotels food was also great - with their signature restaurant The Aviary requiring booking in advance. 

The staff were excellent from the checkin to checkout, and as we were there for so long the hotel’s guest manager came and personally introduced herself to us - which was a very nice touch.

I would return.  ",5,2018,11,04
111,A long weekend in London,"From booking, arrival, room, bar, service, right through to checking our was a seamless and pleasurable experience. The staff went out their way to be helpful, polite and efficient, always with a genuine smile. This is how it should  be!",5,2018,11,01
111,Business Trip October 2018,"Stayed here three night in early October 2018.  Very nice location - everything is located within short walking distance.
Hotel staff is very helpful. Agreed to early checking on request. Bar area is lively and well stocked.
Rooms are very spacious and well appointed.  Housekeeping staff is outstanding.
Bathroom floors are heated",5,2018,10,31
111,"Lovrly hotel, fabulous service ","We were looked after so well by Dado, she is an asset to the hotel.  The room was lovely, we had a really nice view.  Nothing was ever too much trouble for any of the staff.  The rooftop bar was so nice and there is a nice chilled vibe about the place.  Make sure you book the spa in advance, it was fully booked which was a shame.  ",5,2018,10,28
111,Great location and great service,I was a guest for two nights earlier this week and really enjoyed my experience. The room was clean and comfortable and all the staff were excellent. Camelia on the front desk was especially great and really went the extra mile to ensure that my stay got off to the best start!,5,2018,10,28
111,Great stay,"Stayed first time at Royal London House and loved it every second of my stay. Very modern hotel, welcoming staff from the moment I entered the hotel till my check out. Room fantastic, very clean with a a comfortable bed. Lovely SPA and beautiful rooftop.
Will be back.",5,2018,10,25
111,Very welcoming,"
Room are very nice and good sized. Beds are comfortable. The staff was very skilful in everything. Also I enjoy the fantastic rooftop bar. I would definitely come back and I recommend with all confidence! ",5,2018,10,24
111,Wonderful hotel with the best rooftop terrace,"The hotel is stunning, both the rooms and restaurant. On the rooftop you can have a drink while having one of the best views you can get in London. The stuff was also great, very friendly and professional. I highly recommend it",5,2018,10,23
111,Great place! ,"This is a great, stylish hotel in a brilliant location. The room was fantastic, with features like Sky TV, mood lighting and a Nespresso coffee machine. The staff were attentive, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Thanks for a superb stay! ",5,2018,10,22
111,Amazing!,"Spectacular hotel, prosecco on arrival and staff to welcome you into the hotel, extremely clean and and very friendly and helpful staff, the spa and bar are amazing, they have a very fine attention to detail we will definitely return here soon!",5,2018,10,22
111,Definitely a quality experience,"My only regret is that I never made it to the hotel's gym or swimming pool during my stay! Excellent hotel, super comfortable and massive bed; for someone with sleeping issues like myself it was utterly blissful. The welcome and concierge service was professional, and their rooftop bar is really spectacular. I had a fantastic porn star martini cocktail (it's not that easy to perfect and they did!) and a lovely view of the city. The room was cleaned regularly with fresh towels every day. My only complaint is the room remote control light - again, i'm a light sleeper so it may not apply to most guests, but having a blue light on all night long was distracting and woke me up a few times, but I know my sleeping is exceptionally sensitive. I'm happy to come back here again and spend more time in their fun bar and pub on the ground floor. Highly recommended for couples and business travellers.",4,2018,10,22
111,A great place to stay,"Wonderful hotel! Every amenity is absolutely top-of-the-line! The location is also quite well connected.

The staff are superb and extremely helpful! Dorian is particular was very courteous and helpful! Loved my stay here. Thanks guys, cheers!",5,2018,10,22
111,Amazing luxurious stay,"We truly had the most wonderful stay. From start to finish everyone was so attentive and happy to see us, the welcome was lovely with a glass of prosecco. To be honest we didn't utilise all of the facilities but I am sure if we stay again, which I am positive that we will, we will stay for longer so we can use the spa facilities as well. The whole experience to us was absolute luxury.",5,2018,10,21
111,Royal London House,"We stayed here for our Anniversary! 
The hotel itself was really nice, location and look of the hotel was beautiful! They gave us Prosecco on arrival which was lovely however 
Although the staff tried to be attentive I felt they lacked a certain quality! I had requested a room with a bath and upper story which were both unavailable! The lights didn’t work in our room when we arrived and it took the hotel staff 1 hour to check us in even though they said 30 minutes, they then took 30 minutes to bring our luggage to our room even though we handed our luggage in as soon as we arrived at the hotel. 

Overall the rooms were really nice, big tv, spacious, clean bathroom! The rooftop bar is amazing with a nice view of London, the pool itself is really nice as well. However I feel if the staff were more helpful it would’ve made this trip to London a lot more special. 

I don’t think I would stay again, but I would recommend it to others because the location and rooms are lovely! ",3,2018,10,20
111,Wouldn’t recommend,"Stayed here last night with my fiancé for his birthday. After very high expectations of this being a 5 star hotel, I came to find that it definitely is not. 

We arrived for check in around 2pm, we were welcomed by a lady named January, although must say she was pleasant and provided a good service. However during the check in procedure, there was a power cut for about 2 seconds, due to this the system crashed and the lady had to leave the desk to resolve this for almost 5 mins. She did however apologise.

After being given our keys we made our way to our floor and found our room. After several attempts to tap the key on the door it finally opened. We entered our room and one thing I was really looking forward to was the view, how disappointing literally one of the worst room views I’ve seen. Nothing but old dreary cream buildings to see , no gardens or anything nice to see. 

After going out to eat (less than 2 hours of arriving) we came back to find that our room had been accessed and a laundry bag left on the chair?? Not sure why this was other than to be nosey and snoop inside our room! 

We were out for the evening, upon returning we found that again the room keys not working after several attempts, 2 phones inside the room both were not working and unable to contact reception so I had to call from my mobile to get the password for the WiFi, lights in the room did not work so in the morning we we in the darkness whilst trying to get ready. Also heated flooring in the bathroom did not work. Not what you expect from a so called 5 star. 

Upon check out (Amelia) I voiced my concerns however no matter of goodwill was offered. I was very shocked when being told that there would be a £20 additional charge to my bill, due to balloons and rose petals in the room which I was advised by guest relations before arriving that this would be complimentary. This was then challenged and removed by reception. To be honest this hotel is at best a 3 star (2 for overall satisfaction) and after the money paid to stay here I would not recommend and most certainly will not be returning.",2,2018,10,20
111,Wouldn’t go anywhere else!,"This was our first time visiting the hotel and the only bad thing about it was that we couldn’t stay longer. It was such a beautiful hotel with so much to offer and to top it off the staff were so wonderful. The room was exceptionally clean and the technology is great. 

We will definitely be returning as soon as possible and I wouldn’t go anywhere else now. Highly recommended!",5,2018,10,19
111,Bussines meeting,"Great location, great staff, great service and great food :)
The hotel is well located and has a wonderful view over the City from the 9th floor.
I strongly recommand a lunch or dinner between friends or bussines partners.",5,2018,10,17
111,"""Wedding anniversary weekend""","A weekend in London for our group of 6 to celebrate two wedding anniversaries was made  extra special by staff, inparticular Dado and her guest experience team. The hotel facilities including micro brewery,pool,restaurant were all excellant and enhanced our stay. We will definitely be planning a return visit to the Montcalm Royal London House.",5,2018,10,16
111,Wedding anniversary,"We have just got back from staying at the Montcalm royal, had a fantastic stay ,  staff are so friendly . We loved everything about this hotel . I’ve already booked to return  , the best hotel in London .",5,2018,10,16
111,Over & Above..,"We stayed here last Saturday evening (business & pleasure) and loved it.
The hotel is stylish and every need met from check in to departure.
Staff are wonderful. We must mention 'January' (she checked us out).
When we shared a couple of very minor issues with January, she could not have been more engaging and we were very surprised how seriously she took on board our comments and at the steps she took to compensate us. We travel extensively and January's attention to customer satisfaction and experience was second to none. She is a huge credit to the hotel and we have already booked another stay as a result.",5,2018,10,15
111,Excellent hotel in central London - Montcalm Royal,"This was my first time staying at the Montcalm and I have to say it is a very impressive hotel.  The hotel was extremely clean and tidy and very modern.  I thought the layout of the hotel was exceptional and the staff were excellent (very efficient but also warm and friendly).  Anyone looking for good central London hotel should consider the Montcalm, you wont be disappointed.

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2018,10,15
111,Great hotel for business trips,"A very warm welcome by Camelia, who checked me in and made sure I have all I need, inclusive a welcome drink. Great refurbished hotel with latest technology, several pubs onsite and walking distance to Liverpool Street Station, shops and restaurants. Looking forward staying there soon again.",5,2018,10,14
111,THE best hotel you will find in London. You must stay here!,"My sister and I stayed here for one night, and our one regret is that we didn't stay longer. Every member of staff was incredible from start to finish. We were very kindly looked after by Dado, who upgraded us and made sure we had everything we needed. I've never been treated that well, and I have stayed at many 5 star hotels. Little touches like prosecco on arrival, and the doorman walking us to the car with an umbrella to protect us from the rain, is what makes this hotel the best you'll find in London, especially for the price. We are thinking of a reason to come back just so we can stay! It is my birthday next month so I think we found our reason :)
Many thanks, especially to Dado who is such a darling!
Kate Lodge x",5,2018,10,14
111,Perfect weekend stay,"Just home from a weekend break at this classy hotel. Being offered a glass of Prosecco while checking in is certainly an impressive start! Every member of staff we met, desk staff, bar staff and door attendants were charming and very professional. Being welcomed back in after an evening out, like coming home! The room, well you know the feeling of being disappointed when you first enter your hotel room, forget it, our room exceeded expectations. Luxurious decor, really comfortable bed, lovely bathroom {nice toiletries} all impeccably clean. We checked out the view from the roof terrace, tad blowy this weekend but impressive bar and restaurant and again smiling courteous staff. Enjoyed the atmosphere while having a drink in the entrance bar, shuffleboard being played and generally people watching. An impressively comfortable hotel wonderfully enriched by charming and very professional staff. ",5,2018,10,14
111,"Gorgeous room, fabulous staff!","Stayed at the Montcalm Royal London this weekend for my birthday treat and what a fabulous weekend! Right from check-in Dado from the guest experience team was fantastic! From an upgraded room to birthday treats I can't tell you how delightful she was, and how special she made our stay! The room was fantastic - clean and luxurious and a pleasure to be in. Thoroughly recommended! Thank you Dado and colleagues!",5,2018,10,14
111,Fabulous,"Stayed recently for the first time at this hotel and can honestly say that everything was superb. From the first moment we've been warmly welcomed by the friendly Romanian frontdesk staff (Camelia, Raluca and their other colleagues) and felt really great during all our stay. The breakfast was very good, although not very diverse. The view from the roof terrace was amazing. I do highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,09
111,Luxury weekend break,"This was a two night stay celebrating a birthday. Wanted something a bit special and this hotel was perfect. We booked a Club room which gave us unlimited entry to the club lounge. Evening canapes and unlimited alcoholic drinks, tea, coffee and snacks all day and a great buffet breakfast all included. The room had a view over Finsbury Square. Great comfy king size bed, turndown service, exceptional room servicing, bottled water, mini bar, top quality toiletries, massive tv with premium channels. Nothing was too much trouble and all the staff we came into contact with were so friendly and polite. The spa was so clean and well kept and free to use, towels provided. A drink at the rooftop bar gave a wonderful view of the skyline and was a special touch. This has to be one of the best hotel stays we have experienced. Can't recommend it more highly!! Just one small word of warning, make sure you have the credit card you made your booking with as they must have it for security. Not quite sure why as we had payed in full. We offered other cards in the same name but they insisted on making a refund on the original card and paying again on a card we had with us. Just one small blip on what otherwise was a perfect weekend.",5,2018,10,08
111,Never fails,"5th time at this hotel now & every time i go i never get bored of it. It always opens up more and more amazement everytime i go! Friendly and helpful staff, great rooms & facilities. In the heart of the city with shops and bars in walking distance aswell as easy access to public transport and taxi service. The NCP car park is directly opposite the hotel entrance if your driving into the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2018,10,07
111,Best stay ever!,"So I decided for my girlfriends birthday as it was a pretty big one to go for a nice weekend in london. Called up origianlly to book another montcalm when I was recommended the royal london house. Hesitant I took time to look up pictures of the hotel, they just do not do it justice the hotel is stunning the staff are impeccable the facillities are amazing and just didn’t fail to impress. Super polite staff good mornings, afternoons and evenings even if they are just passing in the hall way. Raluca and her team went the extra mile to make this stay perfect for me and my girlfriend really cannot thank them enough or recommend this hotel enough. Lived a night of luxury with this stay and will be sure to return.",5,2018,10,07

We looking forward to see you again soon guys . 
Thank you",5,2018,10,06
111,Wonderful stay,"I can honestly say that I am truly impressed by the Montcalm Royal London House. The hotel is in a great location (few blocks from Moorgate station) and is beautifully decorated and maintained.  The rooms are nice and clean and are “smart” rooms in that everything can be controlled through a panel on the wall. 

The restaurant is beautiful with breathtaking views and a fantastic wait staff who treats you like a king or queen. The breakfast that is served in the restaurant has wonderful food and selection. 

The star of this incredible show is the most amazing concierge on earth, Daniel. Daniel goes out of his way to make sure you have everything you need. From printing bus tickets to getting ground transportation to the airport to making dinner suggestions and reservations, he truly cares that every guest has a wonderful stay and that anything you could need is taken care of quickly. Daniel is the type of employee that you can tell loves his job and making people happy.

I will definitely be back to stay at this lovely hotel and highly recommend it for your visit to London. ",5,2018,10,05

111,Made to feel special,"First stay at this hotel, which I hadn't really heard of this hotel before and it is only 10 minutes from the office!

But without exception, my stay was faultless. It started well when I was offered a drink while waiting for a check in desk. The front of house staff and reception staff really are great. The room was perfect, clean, modern, massive TV. I would recommend paying a little more for use of the bar & canapes before going out or to dinner.
 
Unfortunately, despite taking kit, I didn’t make the gym!
 
I have already recommended the hotel and will certainly be back myself.  
 
Keep up the excellent work and thanks to everyone :-)",5,2018,10,04

111,Poor AC and unhelpful staff,"3rd stay for business in under 6 weeks. Continued poor service and lack of assistance. No help to follow disability requirements. Staff are simply not honest and will say anything to avoid you leaving the hotel.

It also is expected for AC to take over an hour to reduce 2 degrees. Manager thinks this is acceptable for 5* hotel.",1,2018,10,02
111,A Masculine Hotel,The staff were polite and the food was good. My critique is to remove the male scented toiletries and rather replace with a neutral fragrance. Water temperature set to 40 degrees which I did not enjoy.,3,2018,10,02
111,Treated like VIPs,"I have stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel several times both for business and for pleasure. I love the fact that I can visit during the working week or with my husband for a romantic get away as well as with my family.

Whatever the day of the week I have always been given a superb welcome and mede to feel at home, nothing to much to ask.

The facilities are fabulous, the restaurants really good, especially the one on the rooftop and and the guest lounge are great spaces to relax. Also the spa! Cleanliness is exceptionally good.

The guest experience team are always there to assist in making your stay a 5 star experience! I couldn't recommend it more highly.

Thank you to all the staff at Montcalm Royal London House.",5,2018,10,01

111,Can’t fault a fabulous hotel and staff,"First thing I do when visiting London is look at the terrible reviews of a hotel. To be honest we got a great deal via hotels.com so didn’t pay the full price but it was still a lot of money as we don’t earn that much and it was a special birthday treat. We have stayed in London many times and experienced many areas so now we tend to go for the quieter areas away from the centre which are quite dirty. This hotel is absolutely fabulous from the second we arrived to the moment we left. The staff are so helpful and nice it’s almost painful! From Monica who booked us in to the terrace bar staff they could not be more accommodating. Our room was great, spotless and serviced on request, products, linen, superb, very comfortable mattress and nothing too much trouble from the housekeeping staff - dont get me wrong no view from the window but I assume that should be for the people that pay for it! We used the gym and sauna and pool each morning and it was great as we are not fitness freaks! We did not have breakfast as on our budget it’s not the most efficient way but there are plenty of places within wallking distance. WORD OF NOTE this is the city end of town so where it may be buzzing in the week places to eat and drink are closed at the weekend! We knew this so don’t despair trendy Shotditch is but an 8 minute walk away to pander to your needs. On a Sunday night we walked a short distance to Flat Iron steakhouse for the best steak ever had and very reasonable. The rooftop bar at the hotel although not the best view of London is nevertheless well worth a visit and very popular in the week ignore the terrible reviews this hotel is an absolute gem!!!
Any downsides - yes minor - there’s not enough information about the hotel or how to use the amenities in the room but hey just ask!",5,2018,09,30
111,Amazing 10/10! ,"Our stay was lovely and I cannot fault the hotel - I was very pleased with the room upgrade for my other half’s birthday and the balloons and ‘happy birthday’ desert was a lovely extra. 
Room was massive and quite honestly the best hotel room I’ve stayed in, all staff were welcoming and friendly. Very clean hotel and the aviary restaurant was lovely. We also used room service which was great and very convenient. 
I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting London and I hope to come back soon.
Keep up the great work! :)

111,18th birthday,"We stayed here for my daughters 18th. 
Faultless, the attention to detail was amazing. The staff top of their game and the location was superb. We ate at the Aviary during our stay and the food was amazing, service surpassed expectations. 
All in all a perfect stay. A very happy birthday girl and happier parents. Fabulous",5,2018,09,30
111,Excellent Service from Ms. Dado and an Amazing stay,"I reserved a two-bedroom room for my parents & siblings to stay for two days. I chose this hotel as it have very good reviews and a good location. Before my family arrival, I contacted Ms. Dado and she replied promptly to any requests or concerns. I let her know that I would like to surprise my parents to celebrate their 25th Anniversary. When my family arrive, they were very surprise to what Ms. Dado & her team prepared. She arranged a complimentary dessert, plate of fruits, and a bottle of prosecco. She also prepared rose petals and place them all over the room with several balloons. Thank you very much to Ms. Dado & her team for the arrangement. The hotel has absolutely the best services. The room itself was very nice and clean based on my parents. They provide Hermes toiletries in the bathroom.  The room also include breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food are delicious. The roof bar is amazing. I would recommend people to stay here. It was the best decision and absolutely will come back to this hotel.",5,2018,09,30
111,Absolutely fantastic hotel with outstanding staff!,"My friends and I stayed at The Montcalm Hotel - Royal London House in September for a 40th Birthday with friends. The hotel staff were amazingly attentive from the moment we arrived and spent the rest of our stay ensuring we had the best time. 

The rooms were beautifully decorated, extremely clean and spacious with a large bathroom (with wonderful underfloor heating). We were greeted with champagne and strawberries in our room for the birthday girl, which was a lovely touch.

We visited the spa which although small has a very nice pool and jacuzzi area plusthe usual sauna/steam. 

The Aviary (roof top bar and restaurant) is fabulous. The waitress made sure we had a lovely table, and the service again in the restaurant and bar was outstanding. Views over the city are gorgeous and it really is one of the best rooftop bars in all of London. 

The hotel is everything you could want from a 5 star hotel but the staff are what makes this hotel really stand out. Their attention to detail and impeccable service will ensure you have a perfect stay.",5,2018,09,29
111,"Cconvenient, quiet and comfortable","This hotel continues to be a convenient business base. For me it’s attractions are the large, quiet and comfortable rooms (excellent bed), air-conditioning  that is easy to use and the great shower. What else do I need? Well a decent breakfast and in this hotel it is served in a room which offers a more interesting view of London than many hotels.",4,2018,09,29
111,Just the best hotel in London for service,"This has to be our 4th or 5th stay and it just feels like returning home each time. The service is just amazing. We are always treated as though we are the only guests staying. A wonderful Lounge to sit in after all unpacked with complimentary drinks and snacks.  The  restaurant is one of the best in London and the view from the top floor restaurant is wonderful. 

My thanks as ever to the guest experience team for their kindness and understanding when we had a problem booking a car. They always treat us upon arrival and look after us every time. Thank you. 

Look forward to the next stay.

111,Excellent Hotel for Business Stay,"Excellent hotel, location very convenient for us. Staff very helpful, part of a large party, express check in arranged in advance. Only breakfast taken in the hotel which is in the lovely roof top room. Bedrooms spacious and well equipped.",5,2018,09,27
111,An Anniversary to remember,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend as it was our anniversary and I have to say we were blown away by the whole experience!Right from the very start The staff were very attentive and couldnt do any more for you, our room was perfect(managed to get a city facing room which was even better) and my boyfriend loved the little personal touch in the room that the hotel had made for us :) Thankyou so much for that!! We had dinner in the Avairy restaurant where you could enjoy your meal with a perfect view of london at night- once again the staff were very friendly and the food was faultless.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be going back in the near future!!

111,Excellent Hotel for Business Stay in London / City,"I have stayed now several times at the Royal Montcalm for my business trips to the City of London. The location is great to walk to all my business meetings - right by Liverpool Street Station/ Moorgate. It's also been brilliant to host business lunches and drinks on the roof-top hotel restaurant with views over the city. 

Next to the new -and for London- large rooms, the pool and gym facilities which are nice, I want to thank the reception for it's outstanding help and services. Definitely the hotel I can recommend best in the City and Shoreditch area, especially for business stays.",5,2018,09,25
111,Bit of a mixed bag!,"Booked the Montcalm Royal London House, during a 3-day business visit to London. I have my regular London hotel but wanted to stay close by to where I needed to be. First impressions were good however the check in process was a little slow. The Double Room was of a good size and well-equipped, however the ironing board in the room was broken and the fruit bowl looked a little worse for where. Some staff were very accommodating, as I did ask for additional pillows and cutlery to be bought up to my room, and these were all done so quickly. However, I tried to book a spa treatment only to be told the spa was fully booked. Now, after being a guest for 3-nights I would expect to be accommodated however it seemed like my request was not passed through with any urgency. 

I cannot comment on the hotel food offerings as I did not eat there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I would consider staying again, if I was in the area, but would probably try a different room and submit any requests ahead of my visit.",4,2018,09,24
111,10/10!,"Always enjoye my stay with great pleasure!
The staff is very attentive, service minded and friendly.
The standard of the hotel is high, meets all my needs and I really feel 'home away from home'!

They have an excellent restaurant at the rooftop which will also provide you with a stunning view of the surrounding area. The entrance bar also serves good food and staff again, very friendly and attantive. This was my sixth stay here and it will be many more!

Per Backlund",5,2018,09,24
111,Very smart hotel but shambolic management,"A mixed experience.  Undoubtedly a smart hotel in a decent location, and the room was fine....eventually.

A shambles at check in, booked us into the wrong room, service a shambles at dinner and the organisation of breakfast left us bewildered.  It was upstairs and located in the rooftop bar area, but only using half of it making it very crowded. A reasonable buffet where you can get everything except coffee, and inexplicably all coffee seemed to go through one person on an espresso machine meaning that we had about finished breakfast before it arrived.

It looks to me like some decent management could sort this stuff out without too much trouble. However this is the second time we have had similar issues at a Montcalm in London so it could be a systemic problem.  On that basis I would hesitate before going again as there are plenty of decent alternatives.",3,2018,09,24
111,Faith restored - excellent stay 2nd time around,"Had an excellent stay 2nd time around at this branch of the Montcalm group. My previous stay did not meet expectations, but this time the hotel and its staff did a great job of creating the luxurious, yet laid-back atmosphere that I look for on my travels.

Some specific items to call out for future guests:

- The rooftop bar with its views over London is a great place to enjoy your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Service was professional but laid back with just the right level of service. 
- The breakfast buffet was well stocked with quality ingredients, and the coffee was excellent.
- Full sky sports package if you're that way inclined, I appreciated this as the F1 was on during my stay.

Thanks to their team for making myself and my partner feel so welcome.",5,2018,09,23
111,Mr Pomeroy ,"Brilliant!!! 
The hotel is superb in every detail, the staff are amazing and go above and beyond. We stayed for our daughters 18th the care and attentiveness of the staff was outstanding we were thoroughly spoilt. Cannot commend the hotel or the Aviary highly enough. Will definitely return and recommend.  ",5,2018,09,23
111,Rooftop Bar,"Didn't stay in the hotel, went for works event on the aviary rooftop bar. 

Drinks were nice, decent selection they were free for me!! Which made it better. 

The views are fantastic, balconies to stand on and when it got a bit colder staff bought out heaters. 

Staff were great and friendly too",4,2018,09,20
111,Last minute stay,"We were delighted with our stay, it was a very last minute booking which we made whilst we were dining upstairs, and at a great price too. 

Reception were friendly and helpful, and check in was very smooth.
 
Our room was excellent, well proportioned, with an amazingly comfortable bed. Loved the touchpad / mood lighting. Great bathroom with fantastic toiletries.
 
Nespresso machine was very handy to wake up to in the morning, as was the iron/ironing board for refreshing our clothes. 
 
Overall we had a fantastic stay, and i look forward to staying again, and recommending to friends and colleagues",5,2018,09,20
111,Excellent but expensive,"Very nice hotel, spacious rooms. Location is convenient. Amazing root top bar. The business lounge is nice as well, great choice of wines.

As usual, they change towels every day even when they are not on the floor. In my eyes this is absolutely unnecessary and not what they pretend to do, according to the usual note in the bathroom. I do not understand this, but it is the same in almost all hotels everywhere...",4,2018,09,20
111,Spa morning ,"Amazing spa facility. Didn’t stay at the hotel but did the spa as part of a wowcher deal. Appointment was at 11.30 but could Turn up any time to make full use of the facilities. Sauna, steam room, Jacoosi, pool were all great! Had 3 treatments all were amazing. Staff nice and friendly, good changing facilities and shower rooms. 3 pounds for slippers and dressing gown. Towels were free. All in all a lovely relaxing morning. Would deffo go again! ",5,2018,09,19
111,Birthday surprise ,"My boyfriend brought me to this hotel as a surprise trip for my 26th birthday for two nights. We had Presseco on arrival and following a mix up with our room we were upgraded to one of the largest suites the hotel had to offer. The room was beautiful and well equipped. The mini bar was reasonably priced and it was close to the tube station. We had two great night sleeps with zero noise from neighbouring rooms or corridors. The only slight disappointment was the house keeping came by late and advised she would return but did not, meaning neither our towels or sheets were changed during our stay. We had a great weekend and would definitely return  ",4,2018,09,18
111,Such a memorable experience!,"I and my boyfriend visited the Montcalm for the first time in October ‘17, our experience was so wonderful that we insisted on returning again which we then did in March ‘18 for our anniversary. 

As expected we had the best time we could’ve asked for, completely looked after by Dado! Our room was absolutely lovely with the most perfect view, the whole experience was tremendous.

 Dado was absolutely lovely and made our stay an absolute dream, we felt incredibly attended to and we simply could not have asked for more! She made sure to ask us every time she saw us, if we were enjoying our stay or if there was anything more she could do for us (as if sorting us out with our favourite room and a lovely bottle wasn’t enough!), we felt so welcomed and valued as guests. Our stay simply could not have been better thanks to Dado.! 

The Montcalm is definitely our favourite place to stay in London, in the best location so close to everything with the best service and staff to top it all off.

 We will definitely be returning soon without a doubt and would 100% recommend the hotel to anyone and everyone.",5,2018,09,18
111,Wow,"I loved this hotel. My friend was staying here for a night... The service was great from the time we entered the hotel. The check in Staff was friendly. The whole place was buzzing with a nice vibe. They have a few bars, and it was quite busy. The rooftop bar has amazing views. The barmen were friendly and made me a great mocktail. Just to have drink there while watching the sunset and the views was simply breathtaking. The rooms are very spacious and clean. Luckily for my friend he got the room on the 9th floor and the views were spectacular. The staff in general were very helpful.As it is just a couple of minutes from Moorgate station, its convenient to get anywhere. I would definitely recommend this affordable 5 star hotel to any one.",5,2018,09,18
111,Quality Choice ,"I stayed here for 5 nights for work and came away pleasantly surprised.

I’m a twice yearly visitor to London for work and normally base myself at Hoxton in Shoreditch due to both its convenience and bar downstairs and ignoring the issue of small rooms.

So when walking into my room at the Montcalm it felt massive and being 6 foot 3 a bit of space goes a long way.

Outside of the rooms the hotel has a great bar upstairs which in my case served an included continental breakfast . 

Also some great areas to chill down on the foyer level not to mention the spa.

Only negative is my room being 816 didn’t have much on an outlook - preference would be the otherside of the corridor .

So for the money assuming you book it early - solid option and if you really want to party late the Hoxton is just down the road. ",4,2018,09,17
111,Above and Beyond Service!,"Dado and her team in guest experiences went above and beyond in helping me create a lovely Father’s Day present when my husband was staying at the Montcalm. 

We knew he’d be sad he wasn’t with his family for Father’s Day, so we thought having a present waiting for him when he arrived would be a good idea. 

Dado came up with the idea to have a photo and note from the kids saying why they loved their dad so much. I emailed Dado a photo and the kids words and she printed them out and placed them in a frame in his room, with a lovely bottle of red wine. Needless to say he absolutely loved the surprise and was so touched by the whole thing!

The effort by Dado and her team to create such a wonderful experience for him was just outstanding! So thank you to them for such an amazing level of service and attention to detail 😀. 

I will be recommending the Montcalm to everyone I know and will certainly be staying there next time I am in London!

111,Trendy Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for one night on a recent trip to London and whilst we didn't fully utilise the facilities we both really enjoyed our stay in this trendy hotel. 

Being our first visit we were someone confused when we walked through the doors as reception was nowhere to be seen, no signage and nobody to show us the way but I followed my nose and found the desk but once we got there they were very polite and helpful. 

Apparently there is a SPA however we didn't have time to use this so cant comment. 

Same with breakfast. This was more than we were comfortable to pay so we opted to go to a local restaurant for breakfast for half the price instead. 

The room was very well equipped and surprisingly a very good size for central London. The bed was comfortable so all was good here.

There are a few bars however we only tried the downstairs one as the one with 'the view' had a private function meaning it was closed to us. The one we did try was nice enough with a good atmosphere though. 

Overall value for money was very good and if we needed to stay in London again we would consider this hotel.",5,2018,09,15
111,"Fantastic Hotel, staff AMAZING","My wife and I have been without a home for 11 months & this is our weekend retreat. 

There’s a reason we come back again and again and that is the welcome we receive.

From the doorman to the booking desks, the duty managers Savia & Michael and the wonderful Dado & her guest experience team, they really make us feel special.

The rooftop bar & restaurant are great too & location superb. 

Don’t think, just book!",5,2018,09,15
111,Business Visit to The Montcalm,"Originally, when first opened this hotel was fabulous. Now it appears that the standards have slipped. 

The last 5 occasions I have stayed, despite me putting on the booking form that I have a feather allergy the bedding wasn't changed on any occasion. To try and discuss this with a member of the housekeeping staff, who could understand English, wasn't an experience I would want to experince again! 

Then, the air conditioning broke in my room! Despite them trying to fix it they couldn't and I had to be moved. 

To top all of this, I was woken in the middle of the night by housekeeping who thought I had ordered a toothbrush!! No apology - no nothing when it became abundantly clear i hadnt ordered anything! The duty manager who dealt with the air conditioning incident was rude and unhelpful too. I will not be booking again. 

Not a patch on the service and standards in the Grange St Paul's, The Apex Temple Court or Royal Horse Guards. Do yourself a favour and book one of these alternatives!",1,2018,09,14
111,"Poor value for money. Rooms ok, but no where near five star.","Sadly, this hotel doesn’t represent good value for money in a city with many better hotels for much less. 

The staff’s uncomfortable over-attentiveness lacked any real substance. 

The room, despite being reasonably comfortable felt outdated; with over complicated, outmoded electronics (what’s wrong with a normal light switch?). Certainly not five star. We came back to the room (after a long day) to find the bathroom lights had failed... by morning non of the lights in the room were working. Reporting this to reception was met by apathy followed by the most insincere apology... one that almost screamed ‘why are you bothering me with this’.  

My advice... in a city with so much choice you can do much better.",2,2018,09,12
111,Amazing place,"My husband and I visited this fab hotel on Friday to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. From entering the hotel we were greeted by friendly welcoming staff. We checked in to be told that our room had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise. As we arrived early our room wasn't ready so we left our bags and went to check out the roof top bar. It's fab & the food lovely. 
We arrived in our amazing room to rose petals on the bed, congratulations chocolates and a card. Such a special touch.
Alex at reception recommended a restaurant for us to eat that night & booked a table for us. A fab reccomondation, we loved it! 

We could not have asked for a better place to stay for our anniversary it was made so special by all at Montcalm. ",5,2018,09,09
111,Perfect,"So glad I chose this hotel. Rooms are lovely, large comfy beds and lots of modern touches throughout. Staff are exceptional, went out of their way to make our stay special. Spa is fab. Location is great a short walk from Liverpool Street tube. If you are considering which hotel to stay with, definitely choose this one it does not disappoint!",5,2018,09,08
111,great stay!!!,we were a family with 2 kids and we had an amazing stay at this hotel. the staff was super helpful and very pleasant. Dado was amazing.

111,Comfortable but NOT 5star ,"The rooms are bigger than the average London room, helpful staff, ambience is average, the BATHROOM was the best part of this hotel (large,  heated floors, vanity mirror). I was disappointed that we paid 5star price but honestly it is an average hotel. The spa is nice, beautiful pool. ",4,2018,09,07
111,Couldn’t fault a thing,"Just stayed here Sunday for my birthday weekend.

Hotel is clean with the most beautiful decor! A fun game section at the front. Beautiful spa and breathtaking rooftop bar

Check in was quick and given a complimentary upgrade from junior to business suite 

Room was huge, clean and again lovely decor and all modern electronics etc.  

The staff were amazing and Really went above and beyond during our stay 

We ate at the aviary and the food was so beautiful... The cocktails were perfect and the rooftop bar was a complete WOW

Cant recommend the hotel enough and we will definately return!!!",5,2018,09,04
111,*****,"I booked this hotel for me and my partner for her birthday, and as soon as we arrived at the hotel every single member of staff was friendly and very helpful. I had a bit of a mix up with what I asked for and what I actually got for the room I wanted, but this was swiftly solved by Alex, he was so helpful in fact he made our stay so much more extra special and I couldn’t thank the him enough, so Alex if you read this, thank you again, we will definitely be returning to this hotel in future.",5,2018,09,02
111,Amazing Experience and Amazing Staff,"This is the second year we have stayed here, and the service just keeps getting better. Upon arriving, there were many members of staff to assist us. They were all very friendly and welcoming. Our guest experience staff Dado, was extremely helpful and her smile put smiles on our face. We were greeted with a complimentary glass of bubbles, as our room was not ready and was even upgraded to a junior suite from a deluxe double. One member of staff took us up to our room and as we entered the bed was laced with flower petals, a bottle of prosecco in ice, a chocolate treat with fruits, which also said congratulations and the room smelt amazing. As it was a surprise for my girlfriend in our first year anniversary, she was definitely surprised.  Our entire experience at the hotel was so pleasant. We cannot stress enough how friendly Dado was and how she went the extra mile to ensure our experience was amazing.",5,2018,09,02
111,Superb welcome & great experience ,"Enjoyed a great stay at the Royal London House on Tuesday 28th August. 
Plenty of staff on hand to assist as soon as I walked  through the door!

Each member of staff passing reached  out & enquired if I need assistance! 

Lovely room, spotlessly clean with high end  technology and Nespresso machine, lovely biscuits. Fruit & Still  Water.

Great nights sleep!

Next morning on leaving the hotel I was faced with  torrential rain - on hailing a taxi the service from the staff on attendance by the door was  exceptional not only did they run  out  of the hotel to ensure the taxi drove further along Finsbury Square  they also held an umbrella for me ensuring I didn’t get wet!
 
My opinion overall is that this hotel strives to ensure that each guest has a great experience and the staff work as a team to make it happen. 

Thank you. ",5,2018,09,01

111,Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough!,"This hotel is the best that I have stayed in. I was planning a weekend visit for myself and my partner, and informed the hotel beforehand of my plans to propose to my girlfriend that weekend. Upon check in we were treated to a delicious glass of processco, and Dada personally greeted us and made us feel very welcome. 

Our room had been upgraded which was a fantastic surprise, and on return from the evening out after I had proposed, the staff had laid out a wonderful surprise - complimentary processco on ice, rose petals and congratulations balloons filled the room!

Needless to say my fiancé was more than impressed! But it didn’t end there. On meeting Dada again the following morning she greeted us again to talk about the proposal, sat with us and organised coffees for us whilst helpIng us take some photos around the beautiful lobby of the hotel. She then told us that our breakfast the following morning up in the amazing aviary restaurant was also complimentary - and also one of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had! Amazing eggs, bacon and sausages, plenty of sweet treats and lovely juices. Do try the breakfast, it’s worth it! 

Once again a huge huge thank you to Dada for being so welcoming and accommodating, she is an incredible asset to your team and one of the reasons we are already looking forward to our next stay here! It felt like home and we didn’t want to leave. 

The luxurious spa was absolutely fantastic and left us feeling relaxed and pampered, but also made it even harder to leave on the day of our check out. 

The beds were so huge and so comfortable, lovely towelling robes, slippers and toilettries, mood lighting for the room, and incredible attention to detail. There is not a single thing I could recommend them to improve on!

Thank you all so so much for making this an incredible experience and for starting our life together as fiancés absolutely perfect. This place now means so much to us, and can’t wait to visit again! 

Thank you Dada and your team, we already miss you!",5,2018,08,27

111,Lovely hotel ,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights in hotel as we were attending a wedding nearby, We checked in to a lovely glass of bubbly at reception, Our room was very comfortable, loved the underfloor heating in bathroom and great shower. The bed and bedding was super comfortable, We had lovely early evening  cocktails in the rooftop bar , The staff were all very nice and helpful.
I would definitely recommend this hotel . There is also an underground car park opposite hotel ,which does a deal for guests of hotel ,it was a real bonus ",5,2018,08,24
111,"Trendy hotel, but improvements can be made concerning services","The check-in went smoothly with Larry. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we left our bags next to the front desk and they promised that the bags would be in our room as soon the room was ready. When we came to our room the bags were not there. I telephoned the front desk and they would arrange so the bags came up immediately. When they still didn’t come, I went down to the front desk and picked them up myself. The staff apologized a lot and said it was a misunderstanding. We had plans for the evening, so we were eager to get ready.
The room was big and modern. Comfortable beds, air conditioning, mini bar, big TV. Complementary waterbottles and fruit in the room. Great shower. Wall-to-wall-carpet, that I'm not so fond of, but slippers were included so it was okay. However, there were some small details missing as this is a fivestar hotel. First of all, the missing bags, then the last guest's notes was left in the notepad on the desk, which felt really strange. Tissues and cotton swabs wasn’t filled up during cleaning and when we asked for it nothing happened, even though they said they would fix it immediately. As we had to mention it several times I was dissatisfied and therefor complained during the stay. The complaint was treated nicely and we received compensation with chocolate and breakfast in the lounge. It was beyond our expectation!
The hotel itself was very nice with a bar at the entrance with shuffleboards. The hotel also has a spa with a small pool, sauna and treatments. Restaurant and rooftop bar. 
One of the reasons we booked this hotel was the rooftop bar. Unfortunately, it felt like its use primarily was for external fancy guests visiting and not for the hotel guests. For example, throughout our stay, it was impossibility to get a seat. Also, in the late afternoon, all chairs were taken away to fit in even more guests during the evening.",4,2018,08,24
111,Another Great Stay!,"We have recently just returned from a 4 night stay at the hotel. Although a little confusion at first on check-in when they couldn't find our booking, we were able to enter our room which had a great view overlooking Finsbury Square. The room itself was spacious comfortable and very clean with complimentary Prosecco, Chocolates and Fruit which was a lovely touch. We made use of the Spa Facilities which were very relaxing and also ate in all areas of the hotel, Aviary for breakfast and Burdock and the Long Arm Pub for Lunch and Dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience in all 3. Having stayed in various hotels in London over the years, we feel we have found our perfect hotel. Being only a few minutes walk to Moorgate Station really helps us to get around London easily.",5,2018,08,22
111,Not Even Close to 5 Stars,"The room was good, spacious, good bed and shower but the soundproofing was poor.  However, the overall standard of service was well below average.  We booked a City Smoother package which should have included a 20 minute head/foot massage, but after many attempts to book this with the Spa and the hotel we eventually gave up.  When we arrived in our bedroom, the bathroom light didn't work and so we had to return to reception.  Reception staff were quite pushy in their approach.  Lastly, the two bars at each end of the building were noisy until late.  Overall, not above a 2 star standard, and we would certainly not recommend.",2,2018,08,22
111,"nice place, nice rooftop restaurant, service so so","I stayed there for 3 nights, nice room but no view however the rooftop restaurant where you also have breakfast, has an excellent 360 deg view of London. Rather slow check-in but due to some mix up of them and my travel agent. The member lounge is nice to have a complimentary after work drink and some snacks. It was very annoying that on day two, the lady in a rather rude way, told me that i have no access to the member lounge. Only after insisting that I do have access, she was stamping off towards the reception to check. That was very unprofessional since it also took place in front of other guests and she didnt even come back to excuse herself. If you claim that breakfast is ready at a certain time, it should be ready. I wasnt ready on any day during my stay. That could be improved easily since there is tons of staff running around at breakfast. The Breakfast manager had a certain french arrogance which i cant stand. Sorry...  however i might go back there, if my favorite hotels are not available. It is always an option.",3,2018,08,21
111,Good stay,"Arrived for a party at the rooftop bar and were met by friendly staff who escorted us to a large and very modern room. AC and underfloor heating are controlled off an iPad type device which was pretty smart.
We were put in an accessible room for some reason which meant a large bathroom/wetroom with walk in shower which was good quality. All the mod cons in the room (nespresso machine, robe, slippers, ironing board etc etc)
Stand out part of the stay was the huge and amazingly comfortable bed which is just what we needed after a few drinks!!!
Bar prices were extortionate , but that’s central London for you!!
Half price parking at the NCP opposite was a welcome bonus so make sure you get a ticket when checking out.

Would definitely stay again",5,2018,08,20
111,Great modern Hotel,"Was once the Royal Mail Head Office and has been spectacularly modified to a very modern Hotel. A proper bar downstairs and a lovely roof top terrace bar. We were greeted at reception and shortly afterwards the duty manager popped over to re-assure me that we had a quiet room away from lifts etc. I'm a poor sleeper so I'd asked for this when booking. Room was large very modern quite minimalist we room mood lighting and a superb bathroom. We booked as ""Club"" members and had endless soft drinks and our continental breakfast down in a members lounge, opposite reception. good value for money (esp. for London) 10min walk to Liverpool St Station. 
if I had any negative comment is that the Hotel is slightly lacking in character but that's against it being quiet and everything working as it should !",5,2018,08,20
111,Good location,"Had a lovely few days. Hotel is in a good location for business and tourists alike. Well equipped rooms. Club room lounge good service at breakfast and throughout the day. Both  ground floor bars were very good we never made it to the roof top bar. Rooms are super dark and quiet.  Staff helpful.
My one issue :(
Spa and gym nice but small ,the gym though is well equipped for a hotel. Change area very  small and lockers misplaced making it difficult to access. Down side no shower at poolside results in many guests not showering before entering the pool as showers are located in charging rooms meant I didn’t use the pool as I lost count of number of guests not showering.",5,2018,08,19
111,Weekend break,"Fantastic hotel. Very modern inside with up to date amenities. Comfortable large beds, mood lighting system so easy to get up in the night without having to turn all lights on. Friendly staff and very clean all around. Also very quiet in the hotel, without hearing other guests so not sure is rooms and doors have extra insulation but didn’t hear an ounce of noise which made our stay very restful and peaceful when retiring to bed or just chilling in the room. Didn’t eat at the hotel as wanted to experience London’s dining, so can’t comment on breakfast or food. Will definitely be coming back to this hotel. ",5,2018,08,19
111,Another Wonderful Stay,"My boyfriend and I had another wonderful weekend at the Montcalm Royal London House celebrating his birthday. 
We would like to thank Dado and Team for the all extra care and attention to detail they give which really makes the Montcalm a top class hotel.",5,2018,08,18
111,Birthday spa treat,"Had a lovely afternoon at Hotel spa, staff very friendly and helpful, 
My sister works nearby, by I hadn’t been before.
Beautiful pool and spa area. With the addition of steam room and sauna.
Pool not very big, busy when first arrived but was always somewhere to sit.
Had a joint treatment with my sister, facial and massage, was excellent!  
Finished off with a glass of bubbly.
Highly recommended 
Would definitely do again ",5,2018,08,17
111,One of the best hotels I’ve ever been to,"Stayed here for a few days for a special anniversary.  Without doubt one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed at! 
Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful.
Hotel was fantastic, clean and tidy.
Roof top bar was a real treat.
Location was perfect - everything nice and close.
Would stay here again any time.
Thank you guys!",5,2018,08,16
111,BEST HOTEL EVER,"I visited Montcalm on 11th August 2018. My partner had arranged a night away here for my anniversary. Little did I know, that our anniversary would become the night we got engaged!! He had spent months talking with the hotel, and a lady called Dado. The hotel ordered anything he wanted, organised the room exactly how he wanted. Nothing was too much trouble. They made the perfect proposal happen. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Dado, you make this hotel extra special. We can’t thank you enough.
I urge everyone to visit this hotel 
Kelly & Danny ",5,2018,08,15
111,Outstanding ,"Have no words to describe how great was my stay in the hotel. Welcoming was really nice after being traveling for a day and a half. Staff very polite, room very clean. We had the breakfast included and it was ok to start the day.
Location is good but note that is on the business area so weekends a few restaurants around are closed.
Restaurant in the top floor was good. Totally recommended 
",5,2018,08,14
111,Engagement weekend!,"I was planning to proposed to my girlfriend in our hotel room, Dado from guest experience were able to customize it to make it perfect for the occasion. She really put a lot of time & effort into making it a special moment for me and my fiancee. It really was an amazing weekend, thanks to the great staff and excellent quality of our room and restaurant. If you needed anything to your room, or had a request they were always very quick & more than happy to assist us with it. Will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel for a great and memorable time.",5,2018,08,13
111,Great for business or leisure travel.,"I've stayed at several hotels in the Montcalm group and the Royal London House is by far the best. Its central location means that it's ideal if you're a business traveler with meetings in the nearby Financial district or ""Silicon Roundabout""; and it's proximity to various London Underground lines (at Liverpool Street, Bank, Old Street, and Moorgate) make it an ideal place-to-stay for leisure travelers. The on-site restaurants are great, particularly the Long Arm brewery, which feels like a local pub as opposed to your typical ""hotel bar"". The rooms are big, the breakfast options (continental or otherwise) are awesome, and the staff are always willing to go above and beyond to make your stay a little brighter. I'm a big fan of the Montcalm company, but the Royal London House is their best by far.",5,2018,08,13
111,One night awsi,"Jolly good hotel. Excellent service. Rocking rooftop bar - even on a school night.. Great breakfast. We had two joint rooms so essentially a suite. Really comfortable bed, good view, TV service good. Bathrooms spotless. I'm defo going back (it's my third visit anyway). ",5,2018,08,10
111,A Very Nice Stay,"My friend and I stayed for one night for her birthday celebration. 

I had notified the hotel in advance that it was her birthday and upon check in we got an upgrade to a Montcalm club double. I’m not sure what the difference was between this and the club double we booked. But they had put a plate with brownies and happy birthday in the room which was nice. The room was fairly well appointed. A few cracks in the bathroom tiling, no bath mat and a disappointing view were the only gripes.

We visited the spa which was nice but fairly busy. The chair cushions looked a bit dirty but sitting on a towel was fine. The staff came in to tell off a group using mobiles which was nice.

We used the club lounge which didn’t have a great lounge feel. Not in comparison to the Marble Arch branch but it was a nice place to spend a couple of hours.

Dinner was good but unfortunately we couldn’t go out on the terrace which was disappointing. 

Turndown service was nice with mood lighting. We enjoyed the in room smell but unfortunately it stopped working. When the man came to look he said the aroma machine was speakers, it wasn’t, and left a general air freshener unit which wasn’t the same.

A slight hiccup with the room service menu prices and bill charges not tallying up. Beware if ordering one croissant or pastry this will cost you £10. Slightly ridiculous for any 5star hotel. But the issue was quickly resolved. This would otherwise have marred our trip.

We will return.",5,2018,08,08
111,Fantastic Service Let Down By Product,"Second time staying. Could be a great city hotel, unfortunately let down by some product and small service issues. Check-In was a little bumpy as a trainee was supporting, she was very sweet but still learning and could not necessarily answer all questions - fully appreciate everyone has to learn, I would just suggest not at a peak time. 

Unfortunately when entering into my room it was apparent there was a heating issue as the AC was venting hot air despite being on the lowest setting. Front desk team were very quick and responsive to have this checked while I went out for the day. On return I was changed to another room (including an upgrade), Disappointingly this room was not clean (spillage on the floor) and was next to an external generator until making a lot of noise (even through double glazing) - apparently due to the heat in London. Frustrating as this should have been checked. Again, the front desk team were super responsive and moved me again to a 3rd room which was fine (great view of the square and the city). Room was in the end very comfortable and very well appointed including walk in rain shower. Hotel facilities (Gym, Spa) and location to Moorgate excellent. Breakfast also good for a buffet style set up.

Some miscommunication about timings of the rooftop Aviary bar (Front Desk said open until 12 midnight - unfortunately rather rude and dismissive guy on the door said they were closed earlier on Sundays - no problem with this, just the attitude of the guy on the door to a basic enquiry). 

In the end, most of the staff could not be more helpful, polite and accommodating - duty manager included - on check out the bill was automatically adjusted to reflect the previous issues which many hotels would not do so grateful for this - just unfortunate that they were there in the first place.",4,2018,08,08
111,Fantastic,"Staff were excellent. On arrival they asked if we were celebrating anything in particular. After explaining it was my partners birthday we later received complimentary wine, chocolate strawberries and cake to the room. Rooms were lovely and having a smart Tv with sky was great. I would highly recommend this hotel.

Also a Great location as walking distance to Moorgate tube station.",5,2018,08,07
111,Really good hotel,"Reception staff lovely, got a nice glass of bubbly on arrival. We were allocated to 7th floor, room was spacious with a fluffy carpet. Bed was very big and comfortable. Air-con worked wonderfully, we really needed it on the hottest day of the year! Couldn't hear other people walking in the corridor, sound-proofing was very good.

Tube station 5-7 minute walk, lots of places to eat in the area, a very nice bar with craft beers attached to the hotel. Definitely would stay there again!",5,2018,08,06
111,Fantastic hotel with wonderful service. Would definitely recommend!,"Pros:
Stayed for 2 nights and was treated with excellent service throughout. 
Staff were attentive, friendly, polite.
Hotel is beautiful
Rooftop bar is stunning
Rooms are spacious
Shower facilities were amazing, definitely the highlight for me.
Fantastic location, close to tube, bars, shops.

Cons
I wasn't happy with the room I was initially given as it didn't reflect what I booked, however hotel rectified this by providing a room on the 7th floor with a stunning view of Finsbury Sq. 
The Spa and Fitness facilities were closed due to maintenance, I wish I knew this in advance as it's the primary reason I booked, but the staff offered a free taxi and use of their sister site - Montcalm Shoreditch.

Summary - Excellent stay, some minor flaws but the hotel did their best to rectify these.",5,2018,08,06
111,My husbands birthday weekend in London,"Last weekend we stayed 3 nights at The Montcalm Hotel and we’re treated like Royalty from start to finish. Amazing!

We arrived and met by Michael,at Reception, to be told we had an upgraded room. Great! 
The staff were all so kind, friendly and helpful ... nothing was too much trouble. 

On entering our room there was a bottle of bubbly on ice, birthday cake and fresh fruit awaiting. Such a welcoming surprise. 
The room was comfortable and peaceful with great bed and top brand toiletries in the bathroom. 

The breakfasts were in the Aviaty, top floor leafing into the roof top lounge with panoramic views ....  where again the staff were pleasant and welcoming. The food offered everything from buffet style to hot cooked breakfast. Deliciious. 

Because The Spa was out of order we were taken to a sister Hotel... minutes away... by taxi and did not miss out on this relaxing and luxurious facility. 

We had a fantastic birthday weekend .....as a treat for my husbands 70th birthday ......and it was the ideal setting in a great locality for us to experience London and all it has to offer. 

A special mention of Michael who, on the last day, helped me, very efficiently and without fuss, when I needed some medical attention. I was very impressed and thankful for his mature attitude. 

We will certainly recommend this well run Hotel with its excellent staff and we will return. Thankyou Roysl Montcalm London Hotel.",5,2018,08,05
111,Hubby’s Birthday  Stay,"I have twice now booked  surprise stays for my husband at the RLH (Yea he knows he is lucky).  The reason for the second stay was based on the exceptional service received on the first stay...and it certainly did not fail to deliver again.

In regard to the decor, finish, and standard at the hotel the pictures on the website reflects the reality...a very high standard, and very warm, welcoming and cosy.  However many hotels in London  are equally as good, so why the RLH?.

It is actually quite simple but something that many places cant seem to achieve...and that is having passionate, experienced team members that understand what excellent service looks like.  

The wonderful Dado, Guest Experience team member, went over and above (and not for the first time) to ensure this was a stay for my husbands 50th that he would never forget.  From helping me decorate the room, ensuring that our every need was met, and even down to keeping me calm before the big surprise, absolutely nothing is too much trouble.

If you book a stay at the RLH you will me in safe hands and you will be in for awesome time, and if you need a surprise arranged Dado is your girl. :) ",5,2018,08,04
111,"Trendy, upscale and hip hotel","The hotel has very clean and modern, but smallish rooms with iPad controls and such.  The Aviary bar on the top floor is full of young hip people with good music and efficient bartenders.  There was a hiccup with the front desk regarding breakfast, and sadly they were unwilling to remedy the situation. But other than that it was a pleasant visit.",4,2018,08,02
111,Amazing service ,Stayed at this hotel with family and friends. Not typical small European rooms. Fairly large rooms with very modern amenities. Our stay included breakfast. Staff was very friendly and accommodating and offered us excellent service from check in to checkout. Michael at checkin was exceptionally helpful. Hotel also close to the tube and market. Only con I can think of is that you have to pay for hotel in advance and no refunds which can be risky in case your plans change. ,5,2018,07,31
111,Really nice! ,"We stayed here for 2 nights this weekend and were very pleased with the hotel. The check in was quick and they took at all the luggage up without me asking. 
The room was very nice with great decor and some very nice touches such as underfloor heating and an electronic panel to control the lights. 
The bathroom was lovely with a brilliant mirror which was great for natural light to put make up on. 
The bed was very comfortable, we both slept like logs! 
Would definitely re-visit when in the big smoke.",5,2018,07,29
111,Welcoming and friendly,"I booked this hotel for a friends hen party stay,taking a chance from the normal chain like hotels. It exceeded my expectations in so many ways.Welcoming and very accommodating.Ugraded our room and knowing it was a special occasion the guest experience lady Dada was so wonderful in enhancing that special occasion with small touches she suggested .I would most certainty be back here for my future visits to London.The room was cooled down as it was heatwave weather prior to my arrival so felt cool and lovely on entering the room, most hotels don't always take such care.Thank you Montcalm Royal London for a truly wonderful stay and see you soon.P.s.Breakfast was special too on the roof top terrace restaurant. Even though spa was closed due to work they arranged a taxi to sister hotel 5 min. away to use the spa there.",5,2018,07,29
111,A lovely hotel,"what a welcoming clean professionally run hotel - the staff were excellent - great rooms - comfy beds - slept like a baby!!  - would def return soon.

The rooftop bar was just excellent.

Watched the rugby in the main bar with friends - loved the shuffleboard tables later.

The wine for my sons birthday was a lovely touch - thank you",5,2018,07,29
111,"Wonderful service, great location","Stayed here last week. The room was lovely and clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Unfortunately on Tuesday evening there was a fire at the hotel and we were evacuated and then escorted to our room to collect our belongings and relocated later in the evening after the fire brigade had left. Everyone was evacuated safely thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the staff. The staff were extremely helpful in a pressured situation, they remained calm throughout and were focussed on helping everyone. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,28
111,Extremely professional and responsive,"I have stayed there a few times and last week I was there for a week on business . There was a small fire at the hotel ( the guests actually never saw either fire or smoke ) but the Fire Marshall ordered evacuation for safety . The hotel staff was formidable in taking care of the clients , I was relocated to another Montcalm Hotel and was looked after in a professional way .Obviously the staff was under tremendous pressure  but everybody was looked after promptly and calmly , I guess it is under ""special circumstances "" that you judge the quality of the staff of an hotel , not when everything goes easy !  And yes , of course I will go back  , nice rooms and no other hotel as such a nice roof top restaurant and bar in London . ",5,2018,07,28
111,Love this hotel,"Fantastic hotel. We only stayed for one night but I wouldn’t hesitate to book here again. They upgraded our room which was an added bonus. Very modern, clean and highly recommended. The rooftop bar is worth visiting, expensive but hey ho. 👍",5,2018,07,24
111,"A good hotel to relax in who,st visiting London","Close to tube stations, on a bus route or just a half an hour walk towards the Thames makes this hotel ideal. Once in the hotel you have the pool or the roof top bar. As long as you get there before 10pm it’s perfect to look down upon the sights of London. The rooms are comfortable. We didn’t eat breakfast so can’t comment but the snacks on the roof were adequate as snacks. Can’t fault this hotel.",5,2018,07,24
111,Most beautiful hotel in London ,"This hotel is so beautiful inside and out, from the lights through to the wallpaper to the carpets. Attention to detail is spectacular. We visited here for food and the spa everything her was spotless. The staff were friendly and welcoming (not usually the case in a high end hotel) hopefully my husband will take me back for our second wedding anniversary and we can stay. Thank you so much for a lovely experience as passing visitors ",5,2018,07,23
111,Fiancé’s birthday,"Visited this hotel for my fiancé’s birtbday, we stayed at the shoreditch Montcalm the night before and thought we would try the royal London house one out the next day for one night. I have to say, the experience was fantastic, staff were super friendly too and they upgraded our room to a business suite too! Would definitely stay there again and was close by to other places we wanted to visit!",5,2018,07,22
111,Superb basecamp for our wedding,"We got married in early June in London and based ourselves along with some  family and friends at this fab hotel. The staff could not have been more helpful to ensure we got the wedding day off to a perfect start and our 2 night stay could not have been better. 
In particular Dorina (guest experience supervisor) was so helpful and such a pleasure to deal. Her bosses should do everything they can to keep hold of her (I suggest a hefty payrise!) 
Many thanks and we will be back!
Matt O'Leary",5,2018,07,22
111,Delightful charming staff and beautiful room,"Great welcome from charming reception staff on arrival and delightful breakfast staff in the morning.
Large bedroom at front of hotel with huge windows (that you could slightly open which I love) and nice view onto the square.
Only downside was noisy bar downstairs (so need to close those lovely windows!) and the flash electronic wall unit which controls all the lighting and air con as it gives out a gentle glow all night - not ideal if you like to sleep in complete darkness. I am being very picky but then this is a Mountclam and you get to expect the best!",4,2018,07,22
111,Great overnight stsy,"We had a great overnight stay here and the hotel has really good facilities.

The only thing that let our stay down was that we were put in an accessible room which meant that the sink was at knee level. So if you are staying here and do not need an accessible room ask when you check in.",4,2018,07,19
111,Oustanding service,"A little late reviewing this, I stayed with my partner for one evening a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived and was greeted by Alex who could not do enough for us.  The free snacks were to die for and the inlimited free prosecco and bombay sapphire was an absolute delight.  I have already booked to go on the 28th July, but we may just have another evening in between this, just to be greeted by the lovely Alex again, he was by far the best we have ever experienced in any hotel, even better than the Hard Rock Hotel in Tenerife!  I would also like to say the same for Lucy at the Shoreditch Montcalm as we stayed there the previous week too and she was most accommodaing and extremely attentive to our every need.  Most amazing stay at both hotels by far",5,2018,07,17
111,Nice but overpriced.,"Facilities good, location (with hindsight) not ideal), service good.  Definitely a venue for noisy boozy lunchtimes and evenings for city folk and for discounted deals at weekends.  So if you want a quieter and more central location for London shows, museums etc, especially mid-week, maybe not for you.",3,2018,07,17
111,Amazing,"This hotel was just perfection! From the service to the quality of the rooms to the food. We where greeted with champagne on arrival and escorted to our room . The rooms are spotless, large and extremely comfortable. The hotel is a little away from the centre and they made it easy to get around, they would order a taxi and it would arrive within minutes . On our last night we went to the aviary for food and it was too quality. We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend away and if we are to go again we would 100% stay here.",5,2018,07,17
111,Great hotel still needs a few items of attention ,"We stayed here on our way back from Italy for 4 nights to enjoy London before heading home. The hotel Amenities are excellent as well as service. Roof top deck is phenomenal. A lot to offer and location is near the business district, but still accessible to all the tourist areas as well. ",4,2018,07,15
111,Excellent ,"Stayed prior to flying from Gatwick. Hotel,staff & rooms top draw.. Will definitely be coming back.. Roof terrace “Aviary “ magnificent..views right across London. Thank you Montcalm Royal London 1st Class enjoyed our stay😃👍
",5,2018,07,15
111,Highly recommend ,"Stayed here last weekend and couldn’t recommend it more. We paid a bit more to stay in a club room which gave us extra access to the club lounge with free drinks, as well as breakfast in the rooftop bar. It was worth every penny. The room was huge, the bed was comfortable and the shower heavenly!
The breakfast was great quality and the rooftop views are a must see! Can’t wait to visit again",5,2018,07,13
111,Wonderful,"We stayed for 1 night with family to celebrate our anniversary and had a fantastic break. On arrival, our room had been decorated with balloons and rose petals and champagne and cakes had been left for us. We made good use of the spa which was lovely. The Club Lounge was a great addition and we enjoyed drinks and canapes there before sampling cocktails at the bar! Breakfast in Aviary was fabulous. A special mention and thanks to Ruluca on Reception, Dragoslava and Sinnita(Guest Experience) and Olivier (Breakfast Manager) for making our stay extra special.",5,2018,07,13
111,Great for business location but still tourist convenient,"Off the beaten path of touristy locations but a great central location for launching on adventures.  It's several blocks to the nearest tube stops so you can connect to anywhere.  Always taxi's available out the front door as well.  It rained everyday I was there so a taxi was my fall back when I didn't want the soggy walk to the tube.

The hotel is classic and understated in elegance.  The breakfast is excellent and the rooftop restaurant is not to be missed, even if you just go up for a drink and the view.  
The main entrance opens into the bar so it can be a bit loud and crowded with after work gatherings.   

Would definately stay there again!",5,2018,07,09
111,Beautiful Roof Terrace,"We visited the roof terrace on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon.  Stunning views across London but was rather spoiled buy the fact the we couldn't get a seat on the terrace due to a large number of private functions taking place, it was standing room only.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this but as I had specifically called ahead to check that we could get access and that there were no private functions and was assured by the reception staff that there were no functions booked only to get there and find that the information I was given was false.  This was however dealt with quite professionally by the duty manager who apologised and provided us with a couple of glasses of complimentary champagne.  'We didn't eat or stay at the hotel but the general look and feel of the hotel was of a very high standard and I would certainly return.",4,2018,07,09
111,Wonderful and enjoyable experience,"My family of 4 persons stayed there for 4 nights. The family suite was so spacious and was perfect for family with young kids.  We felt a very warm welcome because the hotel had prepared fruits, juice, yogurt and chocolate greeting us when we arrived our room. There was a snack bar providing drinks and snacks until 9 30pm though we didn’t have chance to try. Breakfast was good. If it could offer eggs then it will be perfect. The location was good, it was around 5 minutes walk from Old street and Liverpool station. My kids and I had a wonderful experience in general.",5,2018,07,08
111,Classy hotel and good value for central London,"We booked at the last minute - literally half an hour before arrival, which actually turned out to be a good move as the price had dropped, plus a price match was applied on checkout reducing the room cost further.
On arrival, as we had a deluxe room, we were informed by reception that we had entry to the Club Lounge where complimentary beverages (including alcohol) and canapes are served between 5.30pm and 9.30pm - bonus, which regrettably the next morning, we rather took advantage of!
The decor and fittings of the hotel are very luxurious and modern. The room itself was lovely as was the bathroom. They have a control panel on the wall for everything from lighting to air con and a 'travel buddy' PDA type device which you are encouraged to take with you on your travels around the city. We didn't need this, but for visitors who are unfamiliar with London, this would be invaluable containing info on restaurants, things to do and not least of which, it can get you back to the hotel if you get lost! Ingenious.
There are are a number of bars and the jewel in the crown is the roof top terrace bar which gives you pretty good views across the city. However, the outside area (where you want to be) is out of bounds from about 9.30pm - absolutely crazy - why have this great addition for it not to be utilised? I was informed it was for insurance purposes - whatever....
Bar prices are extortionate to say the least, but the Club Lounge relieved this problem.
All in all, a stunning hotel. which is comparatively good value for London.
We will definitely stay again.",4,2018,07,08
111,Excellent value for money and service so much so we've already booked to return,"The hotel is beautiful, even the toilets with the beautiful smell when you walk in and the corridors which are scented lovely that makes a refreshing change.  

The rooftop terrace bar was fantastic. It was scorching and beautiful views. 

The staff were extremely helpful.  We had a couple of issues with things not working and staff were on hand immediately to rectify and resolve problems. 

We were so happy with the booking we are going to return and stay again in October. 

The location is great and very easy to get to and from.",5,2018,07,08
111,Most amazing stay ever!,"We stayed here for two nights to celebrate my husband's birthday. Had the most incredible time with Dada from Guest Relations ensuring we were looked after like VIPs! She is an excellent ambassador for the hotel. We ate in the Aviary restaurant and the food was beautiful. Can highly recommend and we will be back. Five stars for cleanliness, service and quality!",5,2018,07,08
111,"Beautiful rooms, Rooftop Bar & Breakfast","This was a surprise gifted stay and i enjoyed every bit ... from the bed , light changing headboard, heated floors , smart tv and complimentary champange at the inside ground floor bar . The next morning breakfast spread was enormous and the staff were very warm and friendly . Highly recommend for a getaway",5,2018,07,07
111,Good Value,"Stayed here for 5 nights with my family. Rooms are fair size and bathrooms are decent although the very white bathrooms can sometimes make you feel like you in a hospital bathroom.
Cleaning of rooms was not up to standard. 
The Continental breakfast was ok. A bread toaster would be a nice touch and some eggs boiled or scrambled would make a world of difference as a source of protein other than cold meats and salmon.
The ""Club Room"" has no proper times and staff close the Club Room way before the 10pm closing time. Selection of foods are limited and no warm drinks. My advice is either manage the Club Room in a professional manner as is expected of a Club Room or do not offer the service.

The hotel is not recommended for children as the bars downstairs can get quite rowdy and some really unsavoury behaviour from patrons is very visible to all. There is no way to avoid this as bars are at the main entrance and next to lifts.

Check in and check out was very pleasant. 

",4,2018,07,03
111,Warm welcome and friendly staff,"Myself and my wife have stayed at this hotel regularly since it opened and it has become our hotel of choice when visiting London either on business or for a leisure trip.
The location is 5 mins walk from both Liverpool Street and Moorgate underground stations and only 3 underground stops from Kings Cross. It's a 15 min walk to St Pauls cathedral and the river.
The hotel rooms are well appointed and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would advise paying that little bit more for a club room with lounge access.
We have also found that value-for-money wise in London it's a good choice.
The only downside for our last trip was that we were above the bar area where barrels were loaded - hence, it was noisy at times.",5,2018,07,03
111,Birthday celebration,"Myself and my partner have stayed here quite a few times over the last couple of years. Pleasant staff who have been helpful, amazing food in both the burdock restaurant and the aviary rooftop restaurant. The rooms are modern and stylish throughout. Beautiful spa that is kept clean and well maintained. 
Our only upset on our last stay is how busy the rooftop balcony was. We had a beautiful meal and wanted to end our birthday celebrations with a drink looking over London as the sky set. Instead we were pushed and told to move for photographs to be taken. It’s a beautiful spot which is why I’m sure it’s very busy but we were unable to enjoy it which was a let down as we were paying guests at the hotel. 
Otherwise another lovely stay xx",4,2018,07,01
111,Amazing experience,"I recently booked a long weekend in London at the Montcalm royal London house because I wanted somewhere special to propose to my girlfriend. I contacted the team there and they were super helpful in making the whole thing very special including giving us an upgrade to a very nice suite. They added flower petals, candles and champagne to the room so it would be romantic for when we arrived. I proposed as soon as we got to the room, and luckily she said yes! We followed it up with a nice meal in the aviary restaurant and cocktails on their rooftop terrace. It was the perfect start to our weekend and will be remembered fondly. I can’t thank the staff enough for helping put it all together and we will certainly be staying again in the future.",5,2018,06,29
111,A refreshing change,"How lovely to find a genuinely friendly and welcoming luxury hotel in London - one in which staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. We only stayed a night, but Michael (the duty manager) and his team looked after us very well, making sure our request for a quiet room was met. In fact I can’t recall ever sleeping so well in a London hotel, as so often there is traffic noise and inefficient air conditioning. Everything here was new and shiny and worked!, with a very calm, relaxing and sophisticated atmosphere. Our Club room was very pleasant - We loved the room’s mood lighting, huge Sky tv, speciality teas, Nespresso machine, and fresh fruit.... and then there were complimentary evening drinks and snacks downstairs too. Breakfast at the roof terrace Aviary restaurant (which sadly we couldn’t try for dinner as there was a private party) was a very fresh and well stocked buffet, with delicious coffee.  All in all, an excellent stay and everything was just as we like it. We will definitely stay again when in London. Well done!",5,2018,06,27
111,Amazing!,"Came here for my birthday. Many thanks for Catalin & Dabo for arranging a spectacular experience at The Avairy. (10th floor) 

Would definitely recommend this for anyone who is looking for a chill environment for some drinks when it’s great weather and London looks prettiest.

Drinks were definitely responsibly prices considering it is in the middle of London. 

Thanks again! ",5,2018,06,27
111,Mosquitos,"Hotel was lovely and the facilities were great however, 2 weeks after staying here for one night I am just recovering from the mosquito bites. 
I emailed the hotel to let them know we had several mosquitoes that kept us awake at night however I have not had an adequate response back. We were not told upon check-in that mosquitoes could be an issue. Our window looked out over to another building with vents below. I have honestly never even had that many bites from a hotel in hotter climes.",3,2018,06,27
111,Lovely 2 Night Stay,"My boyfriend & I stopped at the Montcalm for a 2 night stay in June. The hotel was easy enough to find, and was in a great location. 

We arrived to check in 15 minutes early, but this wasn't a problem, and we even got a complimentary welcome glass of prosecco, which was a fantastic touch to my very first weekend visiting the city! We got asked if we needed help with our luggage, which we didn't as we were only on the 1st floor, this was a slight shame as  we didn't get any natural sunlight, but the rooftop bar made up for this! We love the rooftop bar so much and spent more time up there than what we did our hotel room! 

The room itself was absolutely perfect and you can tell that housekeeping go to great effort to restore the room back to a tidy state. The bed & pillows were so comfy, probably the best from any hotel I've ever stopped in! Great coffee machine, and they made sure we always had a bottle of water in our room which was great as it was a very warm weekend! The bathroom was absolutely spotless and plenty of towels were provided.

I can't wait to come back to this hotel next time I am in London, thank you Montcalm!",5,2018,06,26
111,Just phenomenal,"Professional hospitality and kindness. Great location if you have business in City of London. Near to the tube station, while bus station is just in front of the hotel. Very comfortable room and room service. I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2018,06,25
111,40th birthday celebration,"I celebrated my 40th birthday at Montcalm with my family, and Dorina and the rest of the staff was super friendly and helped make this day to a very memorable moment! The hotel has a nice location, and nice rooftop breakfast/dinner/bar and downstairs is also a nice casual bar where we played shuffleboard.
We were very happy with our stay!",5,2018,06,25
111,"Staff are amazing, Hotel is lovely","This is a lovely hotel if you want to be close to Shoreditch / Liverpool Street / Old Street. 

The staff are incredible, they absolutely go above and beyond to make your experience memorable and special. 

The room was lovely too, especially the bathroom and shower (which was heaven). The bed is one of the comfiest I've slept in. 

My only critisism was that our room was on the 9th floor below the rooftop bar. Around 11.30pm each night it got very noisy as people got up to leave and also the cleaners came in to clean. Luckily we were awake anyway - but if we had been wanting to sleep, it would've been really annoying as it was very loud. 

I wouldn't want a room on the 9th floor again, but I definitely would stop again in a different room, as it was a fantastic hotel.",5,2018,06,25
111,Just lovely,"This 5* Hotel is only 4 tube stops from Euston and is absolutely lovely.  Great bar and fab little coffee shop in the entrance. Efficient check in at reception and beautiful rooms.  Tea making facilities in your room and an Nespresso machine were most welcome for that early morning cuppa. Well stocked mini bar - expensive but that’s no different from any other hotel.  Breakfast is also expensive so we didn’t indulge - although with all the fabulous places to eat out in London I rarely take an hotel breakfast.  A great hotel, well appointed - I’ve booked to go back again in a few weeks",5,2018,06,25
111,Fabulous!,"Beautiful room, spotlessly clean, huge comfortable bed.
State of the art electronics with great lighting options.
The staff were all really friendly and efficient, absolutely no complaints and would love to stay here again.",5,2018,06,24
111,Adequate,"I booked and paid for a room for two nights in April for a June stay. On a credit card as I always do for travel arrangements. Unfortunately I neglected to take the card with me so, even though the room was paid for and had been for weeks, it wasn’t good enough. They needed to see the “physical card”. What century are we in???  I produced an electronic Barclaycard statement but was told repeatedly that they needed the physical card. In the event there was apparently no alternative but to accept a refund onto my credit card and pay with my debit card. For a room I had already paid for? It makes absolutely no sense to me.

We then made our way up to the room. Tiny. Almost adequate. State of the art electronics. Such a pity the same attention had not been afforded to the electrical sockets, every one of which was faulty. We had to play around with the plugs, pulling them out slightly etc to make them work. Pretty much as you frequently need to do in Eastern European hotels. We were unable to use the speaker for the whole of our stay because no matter what we did, it did not receive a constant power supply. Quite entertaining really. However, the hairdryer was similarly affected, which I did not find entertaining. 

The curtains looked to have holes in them but on closer inspection it was apparent that part of the “luxe” fabric had either been damaged or worn away. 

Bathroom. The shower was fabulous. No complaints there. The floor, in the other hand was badly scratched (or cracked) and had dull areas of what appeared to be stains. 

There was a Nespresso machine which was a welcome touch, and an adequately stocked mini bar. Slippers and robes were provided along with an iron, ironing board and kettle.

The room was, however, very well soundproofed and we found the bed to be  comfortable. 

Bathroom. The shower was fabulous. No complaints there. The floor, on the other hand, was badly scratched (or cracked) and had dull areas of what appeared to be stains. 

We thought the entrance to the hotel was slightly random as it necessitates walking through a public bar with shuttle board tables. 

We ate in the rooftop restaurant one evening. It was incredibly busy and unbelievably loud owing to a combination of high decibel music and enormous numbers of people drinking outside on the terrace. The food and menu choices were adequate. 

We could not find anywhere in the hotel to sit and have a quiet drink at any time of the day. I was amused for the whole of our stay that the group is called MontCALM. Calm it isn’t. Except in your room with the dodgy sockets. 

For a five star hotel it was incredibly inexpensive. Having stayed there I can see why! In short, it was supremely average and adequate for our needs. Would I return? Absolutely not!",3,2018,06,24
111,Above and beyond service and an amazing room,"I travel quite a bit and I have very rarely come across the combination of such exceptional service, a wonderful room, and a great value. At our arrival we were greeted very well and immediately given a warm welcome. The biggest highlight during my stay was the above and beyond assistance provided by the manager. More on that later. 

When booking they asked the occasion for the visit and without prompting they had a welcome treat waiting for my daughter for her birthday. We then saw the room features and were very impressed. It's very high tech and has great touches like a heated mirror that doesn't fog up and a TV that allows mirroring with your device.  My teenage daughter loved all the different lighting effects. 

The most important service I received came when I had a disagreement with an on-premises business that is not owned by the hotel. I asked the hotel manager to intervene on my behalf, which certainly wasn't her responsibility. However, she advocated for me as their guest and helped bring the issue to a resolution. 

Also, the internet is blazing fast. How often can you say that about a hotel?

With London traffic we could get just about anywhere by cab in 20-30 minutes. 

I travel quite a bit but rarely feel compelled to write a review. I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling as a couple, with friends, or with their family. It hits all the marks.",5,2018,06,23
111,Great hotel in a great location,"Friendly staff, lovely room, great rooftop bar and restaurant with panoramic views in a central location.  The room was excellently set out with all the latest gadgets and a huge large screen tv. Couldn't fault it.",5,2018,06,21
111,Now my favourite London Hotel,"Well we have just found our favourite hotel in London. Having stayed all over London regularly. This was an area that we had not visited or stayed in before.
The hotel is ideally situated next to Finsbury place. A vibrant little park in the square with a cracking little bar and crowne green bowls. The hotel is 5 minute walk from Moorgate tube 4 stops from Euston. Situated in the city. 15 mins to St. Paul's, the shard, the Thames, Tower Bridge, Bank of England, lots of bars, shops etc. Ideal location.
Now to the hotel. Smart and proud on the square. Fantastic and quick check in. We paid a little extra for a level room. But still cheaper than a lot of other hotels that we had. The room was excellently set out with all the latest gadgets and a huge large screen tv. Beautifully decorated, great view of the square, air conditioned and well laid out bathroom alongside luxury bed. Very comfortable. The hotel has a main ground floor bar and a connecting sports bar. There is a swimming pool and spa which looks great. The level room was brilliant with a good selection of drinks plus mini snacks. As a bonus the hotel had a fantastic rooftop bar with panoramic views of the city. Lovely on a hot day with a cold beer or a glass of fizz. As a bonus the staff are friendly professional and approachable. They can't do more than enough for you. All credit to the hotel mentors and trainers. In conclusion this is a wonderful hotel, not the most economical but you certainly get what you pay for. Already can't wait until my next visit. Thanks to all who made our stay enjoyable.   ",5,2018,06,20
111,Amazing Place,"We had an incredible stay at the Montcalm Royal London House.  Michael assisted us with our checkin, and he was very kind and helpful, not only with check in, but with every request we had for assistance.  The rooms are very nicely done, with everything you need, including a complementary phone to use while out and about, which we used daily to help navigate our way around. Our room was very quiet, and quite comfortable.  Our room included the complimentary appetizers and drinks in the evening and breakfast in the morning, which was fantastic.  It was a great location for us, easy to get to everything we wanted to see and do.  Very easy walk to the Liverpool and Moorgate stations.  I highly recommend this hotel!
",5,2018,06,18
111,Ed Sheeran weekend!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay for a joint 40th Birthday & Ed Sheeran weekend. 

Must say that special mention MUST go to Dorina Galatanu this beautiful lady is an absolute credit to this company. From start to finish she was extremely welcoming, friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. So refreshing to have a member of staff being genuinely friendly rather than it being forced because that’s what is expected of them.

Great location and would stay again, highly recommend.",5,2018,06,18
111,Excellent hotel ,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic. We arrived and were greeted by a friendly doorman and a glass of prosecco whilst we checked in. 

Check in was simple and easy and the man was very helpful in directing us around the hotel. The room was very technological with controls for lights, underfloor heating and air con on a tablet by the desk. We loved the mood lighting that you could change the colour. The bathroom was lovely with everything you need. Massive TV with full sky package and the comfiest bed I’ve slept in for a long time. 

They allowed us a late check out until 3pm as we said we were going to a concert. The hotel’s pool and spa looked great and the roof terrace ‘aviary’ was lovely with some nice views especially of the shard. 

You can get around easily with 5 minute walks to various tube stations and Liverpool Street. 

I would definitely stay here again next time I came to London and recommend it. ",5,2018,06,17
111,Truly an amazing hotel,"Me and my friend had an amazing time at the hotel. She felt so special on her birthday. We enjoyed relaxing in the spa and had a fabulous meal at the rooftop bar and restaurant, would definitely recommend having a cocktail on the terrace. It was truly a 5 star experience.",5,2018,06,17
111,Very good hotel and very welcoming,"We had a really lovely stay at Montcalm Royal London House. The staff were very helpful, polite and made us feel so welcome. Our rooms were very clean and comfortable. The restaurant is very stylish and the food was really good. Very cool rooftop restaurant. We will definitely stay again.",5,2018,06,17
111,Ed Sheeran,"It was our first visit and wow what a great place. The location; is really good. Close to Shordich which is great evening out. The hotel had everything you need. The service from everyone is excellent. I normally think that paying for upgrades to rooms is a bit of a scam BUT the bit extra you pay for a club room is definitely worth it. 
The gym is small but adequate and the pool /spa is very nice.
Oh finally Ed Sheeran was brilliant.
Definite recommend!",5,2018,06,17
111,Royal in its name actually mean it.,stayed here during the business trip for 3 nights. Room is very big and spacious. they have multiple resturants with great choice. Tube station is in proximity and makes very easy to commute. Hotel staff were very kind and helpful.,5,2018,06,13
111,Great hotel,"I have stayed at some hotels in London but this one was the best! The room was spacious, clean with a excellent view. The best part was the rooftop terrass, breathtaking view over London! The staff was so helpfull and so nice. The location was excellent, less than 5min walk to Liverpool street station (tube) which is less than 10min from Oxfordstreet. 
I will definetaly come back to this hotel! Already recommended to friends.",5,2018,06,12
111,Superb!!,Service that exceeded our expectations. Friendly staff. The complementary snacks and drinks! Beds to die for! Breakfast great with fresh orange juice but missed boiled and fried eggs and vegetables. Lovely view from the roof terrace. Just a short walk to Shoreditch. Would stay here again and recommend it. ,4,2018,06,12
111,Just Good,"The Hotel is just good for business, it is far from the main attractions, the service is ok, the breakfast is not the best I have seeing but is OK. The rooms are good but the beds are to small for two persons.",3,2018,06,11
111,True 5 star experience,"As a regular guest at Montcalm, I am more than happy to advise that this hotel repeatedly offers an exceptional level of customer service. Having travelled to London regularly, I became acquainted with some of the staff and have built up a great relationship with them. Special thanks to Daisy, who always goes above and beyond to cater for the needs of myself and all my family members who also often stay there. 

We very rarely ever choose a different hotel, given the location is great and there is a huge selection of restaurants and bars close by. A short distance from Euston station via taxi makes it even easier for us. The hotel itself is always kept clean to a high standard, which is always a great thing to have in mind. We stayed recently for an engagement party in London so we had 4 rooms booked. All 4 rooms had zero issues, were extremely clean and great sizes. We had 1 family room also, which had enough to accommodate my brothers and even some pre-engagement drinks. Once again, the Royal London House hotel has exceeded our expectations. A perfect hotel for leisure, business and even families. 

Key features: The rooftop bar views and atmosphere, clean rooms, friendly staff, multiple bars to drink from, great location and well decorated.",5,2018,06,11
111,Such an amazing hotel,"Wow this place is amazing, the location is excellent, the staff really nice, lovely roof terrace, this was our first stay here, my boyfriend book us for a weekend as a birthday surprise , what a treat, huge thanks to lovely and brilliant  Dorina from Guest experience, she looked after us from the day we got there until we left, very professional and spot on, we would definitely come back and recommend  this hotel to our friends.",5,2018,06,11
111,"Amazing hotel, highly recommend a stay here.","Fantastic stay at an amazing hotel. First visit and could not fault it. Lovely staff, excellent location not far from Liverpool Street station.

Good sized room with excellent facilities, good quality linen, towels etc.

Roof top bar fantastic and was lively with good atmosphere considering it was a weekend in The City.

Cannot recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be visiting again.",5,2018,06,11
111,Great Hotel,"Staff were superb, especially Dorina who was absolutely first class in looking after our son who was getting Married and his now wife and all our family. We would certainly stay there again and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London including couples who are thinking of getting married. Thank you Dorina you were brilliant.",5,2018,06,11
111,EXCEPTIONAL!,"From the second my partner and I entered the hotel we were greeted with excellent service and smiles. 

We booked the ‘Montcalm Club Double’  and it didn’t disappoint. The view was sensational and the room was brilliant! 

Being a young couple early/mid 20’s we enjoyed the hotels liveliness of an evening and considering how close our room was to the rooftop terrace (8th floor) it was completely soundproof! 

The breakfast on the rooftop terrace was incredible... the service was second to none with our drinks being topped up before we could even finish it. Loved that little touch. 

Dacio the receptionist who checked us in was fantastic and went above and beyond. The staff throughout the stay were accomdating and polite. Dado who checked us out was brilliant also, kind, caring and extremely professional with a personal touch. 

Even after checkout we were made to feel welcome with full use of the aminimaties. 

Highly recommend this hotel, and we WILL defiantly be coming back in the future!",5,2018,06,10
111,Amazing hotel with superb customer service ,"We stayed here for one night and everyone was lovely from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble and the room was big airy and the bed so comfortable. We had cocktails in the aviary and had a great view of London. 
Would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,06,10
111,"Comfortable rooms, excellent service, spa and fitness to relax, excellent restaurant","Firstly, let me thank the hotel staff for very professional and kind approach. We really enjoyed the typical English breakfast, nice spa and sauna. Probably most memorable experience was the dinner in the restaurant on the rooftop. There is a bar, too. Don't miss it - have a drink and enjoy the view of London. It is breathtaking!",5,2018,06,10
111,The way it should be,"Amazing interiors, great urban vibes on the Aviary rooftop (fine DJ and music selection this Tuesday), excellent breakfast. Staff is friendly. To me it was a really nice, remarkable experience: the way a 5-star hotel should be.",5,2018,06,09
111,Excellent hotel!,"We were very impressed by the excellent service and luxury of this hotel. We were offered a room upgrade and everything in the room was very modern and impeccable. The hotel is located a short 5 minutes walk from one of London’s major train stations, Liverpool Station. I’d highly recommend this hotel to leisure and business travelers.",5,2018,06,07
111,Hey fellow Americans....time to try a new brand!,"I am a loyal hotel brand visitor and reluctantly shifted to this hotel because of a business meeting held at the location.  My first time was very good, and this time I had to admit that the experience at this hotel meets and beats my experience at the other more well known US brands in the city area of London.  Staff were welcoming - starting with an advance email and a follow-up email.   The room is a good size, the bed comfortable, wifi solid, and the AC worked great.  I will say some of my colleagues this time around had trouble with the heating in their rooms, so I may just have gotten lucky.  There is a rooftop bar with a great view.  Like many hotels in the city, they are not ideal for weekends when the area is quiet.  But it is a short walk to Spitafields and Shoreditch where you can find great restaurants.",5,2018,06,07
111,Wonderful rooftop area,"A fantastic rooftop bar that serves breakfast in the morning and turns into a bar in the evening. Wonderful place to have a drink in summer.

Although choices are limited at breakfast, everything served was delicious and staff are very attentive and friendly. 

Staff at the front desk are not all that friendly and quite off putting - did not feel welcome at all.

Rooms are a good size and everything is clean and comfortable. 

The elevators are always really busy in the evening with people going up to the bar. Would have been good to have separate elevators for people staying.",3,2018,06,06
111,Classy way to do London right!,"My partner and I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House June 1 to 3.  The only let down was that we only had 2 nights before returning home!  From the moment we walked up the stairs to the moment we left we experienced the BEST customer service in England.  The hotel is beautiful and modern, the rooms are exactly as presented on the website.  The amenities are far too many to list so I will highlight only.
Pool:  What a wonderful treat in the middle of London.  A hot tub and pool on the lower level.  Like visiting a sanctuary for a little while.  We were travel weary and that was a great boost for our energy.
Room: Soft pillows, wonderful duvet, real King Size bed, tasteful furnishings, ample hangers, room safe, mini bar (we didn't use it but it was great to have somewhere to keep our own purchases cool) (oh, prices were very reasonable), Coffee Machine and kettle (ask for hot milk in the breakfast room and you get a large cup!), water and fruit in the room.  Huge bathrobes (I am short but my partner is very tall and the robe fit him well), bathroom is roomy and the shower is great.  We were on the 7th floor overlooking the square with beautiful windows.  Just lovely.
The Aviary: This is the restaurant and bar upstairs.  The view is AMAZING from the patio.  It is clearly where the young financial district and hipsters come to play before 10pm.  Dress nice please - you will feel out of place in a tee shirt and jeans and sneakers.  Service was wonderful.  Lots of places to sit (if you get up there early enough) and people don't seem to mind sharing space.  The restaurant was very very good.  Prices were surprisingly reasonable.  In Toronto we would have paid a lot more in a similar place.  Food was incredible.  There were 4 of us for dinner and we couldn't stop eating off each others plates!  everything was delicious.  And again, the service was perfect.
Club Level:  Highly recommend booking a club level room.  You have breakfast included, snacks in the afternoon and evening, and self service beverages.  I won't spoil all the surprises that come with this level!  Try it.
Check in and Out and concierge: All I can say is THANK YOU!  That was real customer service.  Some hotels treat you like you just checked into a highway motel and paid through a glass window...not Montcalm.  They served us a refreshing drink while we checked in.  Calm and cool front desk staff (that is helpful when you have been traveling all day and went to the wrong hotel by accident!).  A Customer Experience staff (Dorina) welcomed us and gave us an orientation.  Our bags were whisked away to our room before we even finished checking in, and then Dorina accompanied us to the room and explained the lights and services.  On our first full day there we forgot to turn off the Do Not Disturb notice and they emailed me to say they couldn't make up the room without me notifying them that it was fine to go in!  We ended up requesting that service in the early evening - got back and the room was spotless! When we were leaving Dorina was most helpful and made sure we knew what station to go to the navigate the tube back to the airport.  She was friendly and warm and so very professional.  Classy!  That is the best way to sum it all up.  Classy!.
I am most definitely staying there next time I am in London.",5,2018,06,05
111,Excellent hotel ,"We stayed in a parental suit for a little staycation with our 1 year old child and had a great time. The connecting rooms were nicely decorated and the General Manager made sure our little one felt at home with many toys. 

The roof terrace we had access to was amazing and offered great views on the City skyline.

The rooftop bar (and breakfast area) offers a similar beautiful view.

The spa area in the basement looked great but our little one was too young to access it.

We had a great time and we will go again",5,2018,06,05
111,Excellent ,"Excellent position for City requirements. We were there to visit our son who works in the City. Moorgate station nearby which is on the northern line. Area tends to be quiet on weekends which was not a problem for us. The hotel staff were super friendly and very accommodating. The rooms spacious. The shower, the best I’ve ever experienced in a hotel. Could have spent hours in it, considering I’m from Cape Town where we’re experiencing a drought. Rooms quiet. Wifi very good. The roof top bar seems very popular with the ‘city slickers ‘",5,2018,06,04

I had the most wonderful time at the Montcalm , your staff were so attentive , room was luxurious and the roof top terrace amazing thank you for a wonderful stay, will definitely be returning .

111,An incredible night in an incredible hotel :-),"I speak on behalf of the group (4 of us) when I say that we could not recommend the Montcalm Royal London House enough.  We had a truly incredible stay and will definitely be returning.

Here are some key points:

-	Every single member of staff was friendly, wore a smile and were helpful (concierge, bar staff, restaurant, security…EVERYONE!)
-	The rooms were excellent with great facilities
-	We weren’t charged for a couple of drinks from the mini bar as a gesture of good will which was really kind and genuinely appreciated
-	The terrace was quite simply stunning, breakfast in the sun with a view 
-	Check in and check out was simple and stress free
-	The terrace bar at night was amazing with a great buzz
-	The downstairs bar was also good and they let us stay there longer than usual as we were guests

There is probably more to list but this is what came to mind.  Thank you all for an incredible stay and a weekend we will never forget 

We look forward to staying again!",5,2018,06,04
111,London,"Having lived in London and worked in the area I know it well, and could not have anticipated such a stunning and beautiful gem in the heart of the city. The food, drinks, service, cleanliness, location, style, art, views.. everything were absolutely perfect. I will definitely come agian next time I’m in London",5,2018,06,03
111,Excellent ,"Break for wife and I without our children. Staff all polite and attentive, rooms spotless, well provisioned and laid out. Great use of IT in the rooms. The rooftop bar is fantastic. Will definitely stay again.",5,2018,06,01
111,amazing,"Thank you very much for the amazing hospitality, it was a perfect holiday thanks to you. Special thanks to Sinnitta Kinlan who helped me organize the flowers, and also a general thanks to the cleaning staff, room service and the door men. Again, it was amazing, 
hope to return soon!

111,"Great rooms, great staff, nice pool, nice rooftop","Great modern and comfy room, nice pool, great staff, wonderful welcome, helpful when trying to find a restaurant at night, good location in the City, great rooftop with nice view. I will come back next time.",5,2018,05,31
111,Slightly underwhelmed ,"First time here for one night on business.  I am a regular at the sibling hotels of this place at The Brewery and the M up in Shoreditch. This place is a price point above so I was keen to try it.  

Location excellent.  The entry is via a bar into quite a narrow corridor which I didn’t really like.  Room fine, spacious and comfortable bed with the bonus of a window which opens.   But not better than the cheaper related hotels above.  

Rooftop bar and restaurant nice at night with view.  Also location for breakfast which was actually poor at this price kind of Premier Inn standard which is fine if you’ve paid a Premier Inn price......

Fine to stay in but rated only average because doesn’t justify price point.  ",3,2018,05,30
111,Royal Wedding Day,"We came into our stay the day of the Royal Wedding. We were greeted at the door of the hotel, where they gathered our 6 bags of luggage to take to our rooms. We were offered champagne and snacks in their breakfast nook(which was probably because of the wedding). The room was amazing, super clean and smelled relaxing. Everything was fantastic from the service, heated bathroom floors, bedroom mood lighting, and the most comfortable bed anyone could sleep on. 

I would recommend to anyone.",5,2018,05,29
111,Excellent hotel with exceptional staff,"
Excellent stay. staff are exceptional in their helpfulness, friendliness and professionalism. The room was immaculate and the food was perfect. I will definitely be  booking this Hotel again when visiting London For Work or leisure. Would recommend visiting the rooftop bar for the fabulous views of the city.

111,Mixed review of stay,"Stayed here as a birthday treat for my husbands birthday 

Upon arrival we were welcomed & treated so well- customer service wise this is the place to stay, we got told what room we can check in at. 

We got into our room it was so beautiful the lighting and the floor to ceiling windows are just so nice for the view, however I found the bathroom floor was marked and it looked really terrible this wasn't very 5 star I did complain and got a bottle of prosecco to say sorry, if you contact me by email I will forward you pictures. 

The spa with swimming pool, sauna and steam room I thought was beautiful however there were tiles missing out of the steam room and I feel again not very 5 star, plus the size of the pool, sauna and steam room are not the correct size for the amount of people staying in the hotel, and it can become very cramped. 

We went to the club lounge for nibbles and drinks however I found you weren't really told to hep yourself so you sit and wait to be served not realising you just have whatever you want, and help yourself, which in the end we saw through others & that's what we did. 

The final disappointment was the breakfast I paid £25 each for this and to be fair I think all you pay for is the location of it, the cooked breakfast was cold which really isn't acceptable, and again I did this as a treat for my husbands birthday, but I would say to anybody staying here don't waste money and just have the complimentary stuff in the club lounge.",3,2018,05,28
111,Amazing place,"The hotel was amazing and the stay was superb.
I had never been in one of your hotels but I am sure they are an extra in the London experience.
Not only every detail was taken care of since arrival but the combination of modern spaces with nice restaurants including the Aviary that is a great spot with good weather.
",5,2018,05,28
111,Second visit this year - there's likely to be a third!,"This is the second time we've stayed at this hotel in 2018 (see Feb review) and have to say once again how fantastic this hotel is. It is, without a doubt, our go-to stay in London now. Visited the spa/pool facilities and rooftop bar once again. Staff were absolutely fantastic and sorted out anything we needed. Special thanks to Dragoslava for her help and wonderful welcome. Five stars, because there's no option for more!",5,2018,05,27
111,Fantastic ! Wouldn’t waste time looking elsewhere,"I had to stay in town for work, and looked around usual hotel booking sites for something close by .  Assumed that Montcalm would be way over budget, but lucky for me it wasn’t.  Booked direct via their app (which guarantees best rate).  

Doormen opened doors with a flourish and smile, desk staff offered me a welcome drink as I checked in. 

The regular room was beyond my expectations. Large, Spotless, Big TV and THE most comfortable bed. 

Top floor roof terrace overlooking City is in maybe top 5 in London I have been on.  The French barman with fancy braids (forgot his name !) was a funny guy who looked after me.
100% recommendation,I’m staying again tonight.",5,2018,05,25
111,"Everything great... but the gym, which is an embarrassment","This is a 5 star hotel in every way... nice rooms, great service, the food and bars are fun, etc.  HOWEVER the gym is a joke and is more akin to what is appropriate for a Hilton Garden Inn than for a 5 star property.  It has 2 treadmills (both broken when I was here), 1 bike (also broken), 2 stair steppers and a rower.  For a large 5 star property in the US this earns it an average review.  This is a place for reinvestment by the owners.",3,2018,05,24
111,Spectacular rooftop terrace.,"Wonderful hotel! Strategically placed for strolls in the Shoreditch and Spittlefield area, yet not to far from the shopping areas. 
Put what makes the hotel spectacular, is the rooftop terrace overlooking the city of London. This is just the perfect place to spend a an afternoon/evening or better yet a a lazy Sunday in the sun!",5,2018,05,22
111,Top Class hotel,Myself and three of my friends booked this hotel for our recent trip to London. We were blown away by the hotel as soon as we arrived. The staff were so friendly and helpful that I just set the tone for the whole weekend. The rooftop bar was out of this world as the weather was beautiful. I don’t think I’ll stay in another hotel in London after this trip. If you are thinking about it take my advice and book it right now! 😃,5,2018,05,22
111,Not a 5 star experience,"A good location and facilities although service was mixed.
Upon arrival at 3pm the room was not ready.  The room finally allocated to me had no functioning air con and was uncomfortably hot.  I was offered another room which was bigger but had nearly no daylight but I was happy to settle after being inconvenienced by the hotel for 3 hours.
Nice bars and great food although the bar snacks our group ordered were forgotten and left to go cold.  The a la carte menu was excellent though and the waiting staff provided great service for that aspect.

In summary the hotel offered a good nights sleep, a nice rooftop bar and spa.  Unsure if I would recommend or stay again due to the hassle of room allocation, something a 5 star hotel should have organised.",3,2018,05,21
111,"Excellent stay, highly recommended","Stayed here this month for my birthday and I was not disappointed. Brilliant staff with a smooth quick check in and out service.
I was impressed with all the extras provided in the room and the bed was amazingly comfortable. Had the best night sleep. Highly recommend",5,2018,05,20
111,Let's get it poppin'!! 😍,"Where the hell am I meant to start with Royal London House...

How about with ""this place is the dog's b*****s!"".

I'll keep this review short and to the point, know everyone typically knows that I write essays when it comes to reviews, but it's really easy to big this place up with some choice points.

Booking, an absolute treat! We were visiting for a joint anniversary/valentines/birthdays...when I booked, everyone I spoke to were so lovely. Made everything really easy and helped get us a little discount which is always a good thing!

The staff at the hotel are even better. We've got to mention the chap on the door, what a  guy. Always friendly, always wanting to help...wouldn't let him carry a bag mind you, always think it's a bit harsh! 

The room. WOWZER. The uplighting, the sexy shower, the massive tv, the fact they'd left us a plate of pudding on the side and a card saying happy everything! 😂
The bed...oh...OH...

The SMELL!!! The whole hotel smells of something you wish you could bottle and wave around your head constantly. I can't even tell you how gorgeous it was.

If you can, join the montcalm club...you get access to the lounge. Oh the lounge.
So, if you spend a couple of quid more on a bigger room, you can use the lounge. 
That's free canapes, chicken on sticks, nachos, salt and pepper fish. I was in heaven...this is the heaven before I saw the drinks. 
Now we're not talking no label beer and white label whisky. 
We're talking premium drinks. Bulliet Bourbon, champers, grey goose, real coke...all free. Kinda, obviously you've paid 20 quid more for the room but I can safely say, especially in London, I easily earned that 20 pound back.

Everything about the place is wonderful, we didn't try the rooftop restaurant as we popped out on the Friday...next time though it's a deffo. The bars there look good and in a weird way, when you stay there it feels like you're abroad?! 

Can't rave about the place enough, we loved it, easily the best place we've ever stayed whilst in town. 

Trust me, if you can save a couple of extra pound and splash a bit more cash...this is the place to stay.

What a surprise, still not a short one 😉",5,2018,05,20
111,Mr j Johnston ,"Just got home from another wonderful weekend stay at the montcalm royal London totally enjoyed the spa facilities,
Also enjoy the efforts the staff put on in the club lounge for the royal wedding 
The staff are a credit to this fine hotel always smiling, ready to chat and full of pleasantries 
And a very big mention to Raluca on reception, sinnitta in guest experience and vasilka for such amazing hospitality and warmth in their efforts to make our stay as incredible as it was 
Thank you all at he montcalm 
From Mr and Mrs Johnston ",5,2018,05,20
111,The best night's sleep,"Stay here!  The room was excellent, quiet and comfortable.  It was ideal both to work and relax in front of the tv.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was luxurious with great shower.  The staff are welcoming, helpful and friendly.  I had the best night's sleep I've had in weeks!",5,2018,05,18
111,nice stay at Montcalm Royal,"We wonderful stay in this hotel, warm welcome very nice clean and well equiped room..really nice place to go. very good breakfast. The roof bar is very nice, calm place, well located for me, nice park just in front.",4,2018,05,15
111,An absolutely FANTASTIC hotel!,"An absolutely FANTASTIC hotel! (and I have visited many )
Brand new, lively, with warm personnel and great facilities: from the joyful bar at the entrance, till the elegant bar/restaurant at the top floor with the amazing view.
The 2 connected rooms we used were spacious, digital, clean and bright. They had the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! I even appreciated walking bare foot to enjoy the thick carpet!
Location wise, it is not at the central, touristic area. But I found this not to be a problem, for two reasons; first because I felt safe to be in a less touristic area, full with local young business people that were enjoying life after work in the many bars around Liverpool underground station. Second, because visiting London, one will anyway need to take underground metro to see places and the hotel was close to two stops.
An undeniably amazing stay that I suggest to fellow travelers!",5,2018,05,14
111,Our number one choice hotel in London ,"We love this place so much so we have been 5 times since it has opened and we plan to come again soon! It’s always our first place choice to go when we are lucky enough to spend a night away! The club lounge is brilliant , the colleagues working in here are always polite and helpful! Selection of drinks and food is good. Our room was massive with two bathrooms and two TVs ! After spending the day out in London we decided to make use of the room service and use the extra room! The food we had was lovely. It was also my husbands birthday and there was a bottle of prosecco  and some cake waiting for us ! Very nice touch!! 100% recommend this amazing hotel is simply is the best ",5,2018,05,13
111,Nice... but not 'Brilliant',"There are some some excellent things about this hotel. The customer service is excellent, the beds are so very comfy and ""mod cons"" is taken to a new level with Nespresso machine, mood lighting, touch screen controls for temperature and lighting as well as a free to use mobile phone. All very impressive!

Unfortunately, there are some downsides. The swimming pool is not very big, (but Spa treatment was wonderful!) There are no means of drying any wet clothes and the food isn't great. A slight miscommunication led us to the ground floor for breakfast - only to be told to go to the tenth floor. ",3,2018,05,13
111,Why did it have to end?,"I had a very enjoyable stay here at the end of April. The facilities are modern and well maintained. The location is exceedingly convenient. The services are first-class.

The staff is friendly, capable, and competent and always seemed genuinely interested in my comfort and satisfaction.

My sleep was heavenly. It took some effort to force myself out of that divinely comfortable bed. 

I can't wait to return.",5,2018,05,12
111,Amazing London stay,"After spending hours looking at London hotels we decided to stay at the Montcalm Royal London house and we are so happy we chose this hotel! Once we arrived and checked in we were met with a complementary glass each of prosecco. Great start!! After going to our room we realised we had underestimated the quality of the room. It was spotless and styled beautifully. We made the most of the leisure facilities which I must add are fantastic. We were gutted we were unable to make a reservation in the Aviary on the top floor for dinner, FYI book a few days in advance, but there is plenty of quality near by restaurant's to choose from. The staff are very polite and helpful and do their best to help you if you have any queries. Its also in a great location being only a 4 minute walk away from the tube station. Overall we had an amazing stay and plan on returning in December.",5,2018,05,12
111,Lovely hotel,"First stay at Montcalm and was an impressive lobby area, welcome bubbly whilst checking in was nice touch.

Service was excellent and the concierge was really helpful. Roof bar has great views over London skyline too!

Unfortunately no room with a view as we were downstairs so a little disappointed, rooms well appointed and modern.

Would stay again.",4,2018,05,11
111,Fabulous hotel,I stay here every time I'm down in London for work purposes as this is a lovely hotel. The bedrooms are very clean with lots of mod cons. The food and drink is a bit expensive but to be expected given that it's in the heart of London. The staff are very friendly and helpful too. Full marks!,5,2018,05,10
111,Mrs king,"Very busy hotel great roof top at which was busy both day and night

Bedrooms are a great size and the beds are very comfortable

Staff very helpful and pleasant 
It is right on a bus route so easy to get around",5,2018,05,09
111,Excellent hotel to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary!,"What a fantastic hotel. We’ve stayed in a few different Montcalm hotels and can certainly say this is our favourite now. 
We arrived for a weekend break as a surprise for my wife to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. 
We were shown to our room and wow, as a little treat they had placed us in a lovely room with large floor to ceiling windows on the 8th floor overlooking Finsbury square with great views. Also there was a hand written card and dessert in the room waiting. A nice touch. 
The staff were so pleasant and couldn’t do enough for us from, always had a smile and spoke to us.
There are tube stations within walking distance which gives easy access into central London. 
Be sure to visit The Aviary bar on the top floor of the hotel, it has a great atmosphere and views over London. 

We look forward to visiting again in the future. ",5,2018,05,09
111,A long painful reservation procedure !,"I reserved a suite in this hotel last month for my brother and sister-in-law as a birthday present for my brother (a weekend in a hotel in London). I live in Paris so I booked online, they asked for the full payment in advance by credit card and I gave my credit card which was promptly debited for the full amout without asking for any security or verification. The day before the check-in, my brother called to confim and was told that he must present the credit card that paid for the room. I happened to be in London that weekend with my husband who called the hotel and proposed to go and show my credit card. At that moment, they decided that they did not only need to see the cfredit card but also the card holder (earlier my brother was asked to show the credit card without me). I had to cancel a work appointment and missed my train back to Paris just to go to the hotel and show them my credit card and my ID card. Our train tickets were non refundable so we had to buy new tickets on the next train ! 
The personnel told me all this was for security reasons but in that case, they should verify the card holder and his/her ID BEFORE debiting the full amount that was done weeks before the arrival. 
We won't be going there ever again.",1,2018,05,09
111,Lovely Hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised by the Hotel. Rooms very clean and tidy, service very attentive. Roof bar and Lobby Bars very pleasant.

All in all a great stay, great location in the City. They even sorted out my post!",5,2018,05,09
111,Perfect,Had an amazing 21st birthday! Complimentary dessert brought to my room was delicious! Only problem is I didn’t have enough time with the busy schedule to hit the gym or pool! But I definitely found time to go to the Aviary (roof terrace). Simply stunning from the start till the end! We will be back,5,2018,05,08
111,Lovely Stay,"HOTEL & ROOM: Lovely hotel, Well lit, good location. reception service was outstanding upon check-in and check out.  As you walk into the hotel there is a Bar on the right and Burdock brunch restaurant on the left.  you proceed forward to the middle of the building to the reception area. The hotel is well presented and welcoming. The room was clean, fresh smelling, linen was crisp and light. Pillows were not as firm as we would have liked but nothing that couldn't be resolved with stacking a few together. There was a non existant view out of our room. The bathroom was clean, modern and very functional.  I personally loved the monochrome look. The shower was very good with a good amount of pressure with the water. We didn't have a bath tub in our room but we didn't really mind this too much. The room had everything in that we required except bathrobes. I like to wear a robe after my shower to get ready, do my make up etc. This was a downer for me. I hadn't packed something to wear in the room whilst i got ready. The temperature control in the room is easy to use and also very functional.  overall a lovely room and stay. 

RESTAURANTS & BAR: The Aviary restaurant & Bar is lovely. We dined up there for dinner and had a few drinks. The rooftop terrace closes by 11pm which was a little early. Many people seemed put out by that including us. We didn't really want to head out of the hotel to enjoy the evening. With the weather reasonable it would have been nice to sit out there longer. The service at the restaurant wasn't very good. However; our waitress was excellent. The kitchen processed our order wrong and we got left with my husband being served his dinner first and me sitting watching him eat while I waited for mine. By the time my dinner arrived, he had finished his dinner.  Not much of a birthday dinner celebration when one has to dine alone.   The food itself was tasty, nothing exceptional. If you are eating in there you are literally going for the convenience and service from their very well trained waiting staff. The menu is reasonably priced and relative to the hotel.  The cocktails were good. The waitress did not charge us for my meal without being asked. She was very attentive and her customer service was impeccable.  Brunch at the Burdock restaurant the next day was also good but a little pricey for what they serve. The fries are nicer than the chips. The eggs benedict had a little too much sauce but the burger was very good. 

SPA: The Spa facilities were very good and adequate for the size of the hotel. There is a steam room, a juice bar, a jacuzzi and small pool as well as a gym. We found there was a shortage of bathrobes at the spa too which was annoying when you are in your bathing suit, most guests would not want to walk around in a towel. I most definitely did not want to be walking around the spa with no robe. The reception staff at the spa were distracted and not as attentive as the reception staff in the main part of the hotel. They seemed stretched between having to run in and out of the cupboard for towels for spa users and answering the telephone. Overall we enjoyed using the Spa. Only one shower in use in the ladies changing room. There were no added items like cotton buds, cotton pads for the spa users. There was nowhere you can dry your bathing suit or plastic bags to put wet swimsuits in. My husband also found the same problem in the male changing rooms. It's a small touch that makes all the difference. Having to shove wet clothing into your weekend bag is not ideal.  Luckily I had a spare carrier bag I was able to use. The Spa facilities were over-crowded. There were several walk-in users at the spa who were not staying at the hotel. Several people standing around not using the facilities which were a little off-putting. A group of ladies sat in the jacuzzi for almost an hour leaving the rest of the spa users waiting whilst they chatted away.  The loungers around the pool are strangely organised. No hooks for people to hang up towels and robes either which meant people were dumping their robes on longers and people wanting to use the longers couldn't.",3,2018,05,08
111,Family wedding,"Dear team, 

We were attending a wedding yesterday and requested an early check-in. We arrived at 11.00 and were told that due to the hotel being fully booked that an early check in wouldn’t be possible. Just as we were about to go down to the spa, Savia and her colleague found a room for us and we were delighted. They knew it was important to us that we could relax and change for the wedding. We can’t thank you enough for making this happen and the rest of our stay including breakfast which was an experience in such beautiful weather. I know the rest of the wedding party were also impressed and we will definitely be making a return visit. 

Many thanks again

Kind regards

Mrs Andrea Hartley",5,2018,05,06
111,good base for a business trip,"all the boxes are ticked with the exception of a reception / lobby. Bar a bit noisy downstairs but could not be heard from the rooms. The area around it is not glamouruos and under building works across the square.
Overall good, would return",4,2018,05,06
111,"Great location and spacious rooms, watch out for the inflated drinks and food prices! ","We managed to get a pretty good room rate for an overnight weekend stay via booking.com. The location is perfect for trips into Spitalfields, Shoreditch, Columbia road, St Paul’s and other London city area sights. 

Lots of people checked in at the same time so there was a delay here, however we were offered a drink (prosecco rose mix) whilst we waited which was a nice touch. 

The check in process was a little long winded and included leaving a £50 pre- authorisation for any room damages which was a bit strange. 

Decor wise it’s very clean, modern and the rooms are well appointed. Our room 108 was spacious and overlooked Finsbury circus. The Hermes toiletries had a lovely fragrance and the digital room control panel was handy to control things like underfloor heating, lighting etc. The wall mounted tv screen was huge and offered the full array of sky channels. I would suggest staying on the lower floors to avoid noise from the popular rooftop bar. 

We used the gym facilities which were pretty good albeit small. We didn’t have time to use the swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam and sauna but they all seemed fine. 

We headed with friends to the rooftop bar which had superb views and ample indoor seating areas. It was really busy outside so we sat inside where we had table service. The waiter wisely suggested a cocktail with burnt egg white foam and rhubarb - it was divine! Drinks were lovely but very PRICEY £24 excluding service for a double tequila....

We ordered room service for breakfast which was disappointing. For a full English breakfast, one croissant and two orange juices the cost came in at £45. They forgot to include tea or coffee in the breakfast, the toast was white sliced bread, there was no butter and the eggs were a touch anaemic looking. The croissant was nothing special either. Included in the cost was £5 for a tray service and a tip of £4. 

 Check out was fine, but I have to say the surprisingly large bill for drinks and food left a bitter taste in my mouth. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel for its excellent location, lovely rooms and rooftop bar but be careful with costs creeping up on food and drink. ",4,2018,05,06
111,Wonderful time,"Recently visited to celebrate my friends 21st birthday. Beautiful hotel, pristine rooms and wonderful staff who go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Ticks all the boxes - and the rooftop bar is truly amazing. ",5,2018,05,06
111,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend with friends. Welcomed on arrival with a glass of prosecco and check in was easy. Wanted to order a morning newspaper which you would expect to be able to do in a 5* hotel but unfortunately there was a choice of one so take it or leave it! This was the only glitch however. The room was fantastic with fresh fruit and water. The bed was comfy with toiletries, slippers and dressing gowns provided. Everything lovely and clean. We didn’t eat in the hotel but made good use of the rooftop bar. One word of warning, if you are expecting to find breakfast anywhere nearby on a Sunday think again. We couldn’t find anything open.",5,2018,05,05
111,Very good place to be while I am on business trip!,"Very nice hotel with friendly people, looking for your well-being. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. You can also enjoy the different places within the hotel to have a drink or a nice dinner.",5,2018,05,03
111,Night out in the city,"My wife and I booked this hotel and it exceeded our expectations, the staff were nice and friendly, the food was great too... plus the restaurant on the roof was fairly priced.

Will defo be back again.

Easy access to tubes and buses",5,2018,05,02
111,"Good stay, would try a different room next time!","I chose this hotel having read the reviews, and for the location. Moorgate and Old City tubes are about a 5 minute walk away, so very easy access to the rest of the city. Prior to our arrival we got an email asking what time we would arrive and if we wanted breakfast at £25pp. I replied saying no to breakfast and that we had a lunch reservation at 1pm, so could we leave our luggage to check in later on. I got a cheeky email back saying we could not have an early check in, so I responded saying that wasn't what I had actually requested! Not the best start. 
We arrived around midday a little confused by the entrance and no sign of a check in desk - the desk is down the hallway! Luckily a member of staff rescued us and took us to the desk to drop our luggage off, sadly we didn't get a 'Prosecco welcome' as other reviewers noted. When we arrived back in the early evening we were handed our room keys and told that we had been upgraded to a club room and that we could now book breakfast for £17.50pp, which we refused on principle! Initial excitement about an upgrade faded, the room was spacious as it is a disabled access room which was fine but the bathroom layout was odd. The toilet was far too close to the sink that your left knee touched it, and in the morning the water from the shower ran everywhere and wasn't hot enough. As our room was a little chilly in the evening, we tried the temperature controller but it didn't seem to be very responsive, however, once under the quilt we were very warm and the mattress and pillows were comfy, so we slept well. Also, the mood lighting is a bit gimmicky, but you don't have to use it. There is also a nice coffee maker and mini bar. The only mirrors were in the bathroom and a full length one by the door, so I had to dry my hair sat on the floor by the door. I don't know if this was the same in every room or not. 
We visited the sky bar in the evening for a lovely cocktail at £15 each plus service charge! We then went to the Singer bar just around the corner which was a great find, cocktails at a slightly more wallet friendly price and a better atmosphere. 
In the morning, we decided to have lie in, and just as we were getting showered and dressed, the cleaner banged at the door. Half dressed I opened the door, and she just looked at me and said 'sorry'. I can only assume that as it was 10.50am she thought we might have checked out, but check out was 12.00. We have never had that issue before, not even at a Premier Inn! Check out was easy and we stored our cases again for another day out in the city.
We would possibly return because we liked the ambience, a bar at the front of hotel is quirky, and a bar through the back of the hotel, although a little more rowdy, and a quiet bar on the rooftop. The staff were also very polite and attentive. We didn't try the pool or gym, or any of the food so we can't comment on those things. I would ask for a room with a proper bathroom though!",4,2018,05,02
111,London with Oz visitors,"Wow we loved it 
It was my sons girlfriends birthday and they had provided a dessert treat for them which we thought was very nice. When we checked we had to tell them the dessert would be wasted as they had decided to return late so they could keep exploring. They were so nice they not only upgraded their room to one with a private terrace, they also gave them more dessert and. Bottle of Prosecco , (we ate the earlier one 😀) 
they were delighted.
We will be back or try another hotel in this chain
Highly recommended ",5,2018,05,01
111,The most beautiful and well run hotel ,"I booked out 8 rooms here for a party of 16 of us celebrating my mother’s hen do and birthday. The hotel is beautiful and clean and the staff were lovely. Concierge took all of our baggage up to our rooms and we even had a complimentary dessert and birthday card for my mother as well as a free upgrade. 

The rooftop bar is buzzing and a really good atmosphere and place to drink in the evenings. 

Rooms were huge, very clean and had all the amenities you would need. I will 100% come back and stay here ",5,2018,04,30
111,Top Class Hotel,We both agree that our stay at The Montcalm was one of the best experiences we have had in any hotel in London. And we have stayed in quite a few including some of the top hotels.  From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were met with the most pleasant people. We were offered a glass of Prosecco and there was fresh fruit available whilst we were booking in.  I believe you can stay in a beautiful hotel but if the staff are not pleasant then I would not go back.  The Montcalm certainly filled both criteria. The roof top garden is amazing and as soon as the weather gets better we will certainly be booking a weekend in London with The Montcalm being our hotel of choice.,5,2018,04,30
111,1 night at Montcalm,"A great pleasure for me, my wife and our 2 friends. Unfortunately we stayed just 1 day but we really appreciated all the services we used. All personnel were very professional and very courteous. Just one comment related to bed: the blanket was too warm and heavy for me and I felt too warm during the night. For sure I will consider Montcalm again for my next staying in London",4,2018,04,30
111,Fabulous hotel,"Stunning hotel with friendly and attentive staff. Left luggage with reception in the morning so we could enjoy a day out and it was in our room when we arrived back. Simple things make a big difference. 

The room was so comfortable with the most amazing bed and a Nespresso machine for Morn ing coffee. Really enjoyable stay and will definitely return! Thank you",5,2018,04,29
111,Comfortable stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Royal London Montcalm. 
The room is lovely and comfortable and I love the breakfast experience on the 10th floor. Service also very pleasant, attentive and genuine. No grumbles. ",5,2018,04,26
111,A different take on the Montcalm experience ,"Having stayed in many of the Montcalm hotels, we were expecting something extra special. The location and staff are excellent, and the hotel is super comfortable. 

However, some of the fixtures and fitting were broken and the noise from the lobby not something that you would expect from a five star hotel. ",4,2018,04,25
111,A Friday Night in London,"Had to spend a night at short notice in London recently so decided to stay here for the second time. Glad we did. Lovely room and lovely hotel which was exceptional value for a Friday night.
 The facilities of the hotel are very good, with a wonderful top floor restaurant and bar which serves a good breakfast.
Staff are kind and efficient, we had a small problem with the air conditioning when we was checked in which was fixed quickly. Location at weekends is quiet but veryeasy to get into central London. Would recommend this hotel to all.",4,2018,04,25
111,Fantastic,"Absolutely great stay at the montcalm, just a short walk from Liverpool street station, arrived alittle early but no problem, were offered the use of all facilities until room ready . We opted to leave our luggage and go and enjoy our day . On our return the staff were fantastic , especially our host Dada who was so friendly and nothing was two much trouble for her .
Room was superb and bed was comfortable... although we didn't opt for breakfast we still went up to the aviary and chose something different ...
As we left Dada was there with a drink and alittle snack for our journey home . When we visit London again I won't hesitate to book the montcalm again .
",5,2018,04,24
111,Third Visit,"This was our third visit as a couple and it continues to get better each time, keeping in mind our first time was amazing! All front of house staff are fantastic from the team on concierge to the reception and guest services teams. They made us feel very welcome on our return. My partner works close by in the city while I traveled in on this occasion from Warwickshire. It was an easy drive in from the North and good safe parking directly opposite the hotel. A very convenient place to meet up in London. Hotel was immaculately presented as always and the roof top terrace a delightful spot to enjoy an early evening cocktail. We will be returning to our London home from home very soon!",5,2018,04,24
111,Nice Hotel ,"Very Nice Hotel, clean and fine rooms, The bed was very comfi. Very Nice roofterrasse, with a great wiev. Bars Also in The ground floor. Close to Moorgate tube station, bars,resturangs. I will recomend this Hotel. ",5,2018,04,24
111,A litany of problems; definitely not 5*,"Checking in on a Friday night and your welcome to this hotel will begin with a bouncer asking where you're going. You can't see the check-in desk from the entrance (it's down the hall on the left).

A family member, whose name the booking was under, had arrived earlier to check-in. They had great difficulty finding the booking. Then, despite me giving my card details over the phone, she was made to pay the full amount of the room plus £50 - highly embarrassing for me as it was a birthday surprise. I've only ever had to pay up front at mid or low-end hotels. This was not mentioned on the phone.

The bedroom had a broken chair, a shower that did not drain properly, a missing window handle and a noisy air conditioning system.

Breakfast equally missed the mark. I do not like how they insist on seating you next to the previous people - why not spread us around a little bit? This is meant to be a 5 star hotel after all. Despite a good start with the coffee, the fresh bread was at least a day old, 
 the continental breakfast lacked any flavour: the pastries, the cheese, the meat - it all tasted of nothing. 

On check-out I mentioned the issue and the person (having corrected my email address) said he would email? I didn't hold my breath. No email arrived.

It was a cheap rate, but if it had been any more expensive, I would have asked for my money back.",1,2018,04,23
111,"Love, love , love this hotel!",This was the second time that we had stayed at the hotel.  We stayed in a montcalme club room which was fantastic.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the facilities at the hotel are superb.  The bed was so comfy my partner wanted to take it home with her.  The hotel is ideally located for the areas that we visit in London.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough and cannot wait to stay there again soon. Thank you to everybody who looked after us. ,5,2018,04,23
111,Excellent Staff,"Fantastic hotel, location was perfect for getting into London easily, we walked mostly it took us about 20 minutes to get to Tower Bridge. Very clean, nice sized bedroom and bathroom with a large shower. Facilities are fantastic and all the staff are very friendly and go out of there way to help. It was such a nice change to see people actually enjoying their job. I will defiantly be booking this hotel again.",5,2018,04,23
111,Fantastic!,"A superb experience. First time we have been to this hotel but we will be coming back. Great location on Finsbury Square, in between Moorgate and Old Street tube and Shoreditch is only a short walk. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Check in was straightforward and, although the room wasn't available at 11am, we were able to make good use of the rooftop bar! Amazing view and great atmosphere. Not cheap. Not cheap at all! But good drinks, atmosphere and view. 
Hotel room was spotless. Plenty of room and same in bathroom. Huge tv screen with plenty to watch and the ability to set the room mood lighting however you want! Great facilities in the hotel and we need to come back again to make sure we have used them all. My only negative was £25 pp for breakfast but other than that, it is a superb hotel and well worth a visit. ",5,2018,04,22
111,Wow!,"I had the pleasure of hosting my daughter's surprise 21st birthday there last weekend (from the 15-16th April 2018). I must say I did not regret my decision one bit. Dado and Sinitta were absolutely amazing, from the way they decorated my daughters room to making sure our surprise guests were comfortable in their room. Their attention to detail was absolutely magnificent and second to none. The customer service from when we entered the hotel, the spa, the club lounge right up to the roof terrace was exceptional. Even though it was my daughters birthday, I must say we all left Montcalm feeling like Queens. Thank you  so much and ... WE WILL MOST DEFINITELY BE BACK!",5,2018,04,19
111,Average,"Very disappointed by my first (and probably last) stay at this hotel.

It needs to decide if it is a hotel or a bar/club. There are hoards of people on the ground floor in a bar as you walk in, and outside the front door as well as riding up and down in the lifts all evening to and from the roof bar.

The room is loaded with gadgets but like a shoebox in size. 

Oddly there were also several mosquitoes in the room despite no windows being opened.

Check in wasn’t a great experience at all. I asked for a bigger room and was shown another room which was exactly the same.

Shame, as I thought it would be a better experience.",2,2018,04,18
111,Nice hotel,"Hotel is lovely, rooms are high tech and clear, nice Elimis toiletries, bath robes and slippers, nespressco machine mini bar. 

Two bars with shuttle boards, we went in the one furtherest away from
Guns bury Square the long arm, nice gin cocktail and beer from the on-site brewery

We stayed two nights Friday and a Saturday, the noise was bad, door slamming shut/or slow release shut but loud.

Bottle collection lorry outside at 3am Sat am down side of hotel!

This noise  is the only thing stopping me giving a 5*!

Photo is gin cocktail!",4,2018,04,18
111,Simply Great!,"What a great experience.  From check in to out, one of the best experiences of our trip to London. Dada was an amazing hostand made us feel great and welcome. The room was terrific, the pub downstairs is fun and the roof top lounge has an amazing view with creative bartenders.  I would stay there anytime!!!!!",5,2018,04,17
111,"Loved, loved, loved this place!","I loved this hotel!  Deliciously soft and plush beds and linens, wonderful staff, great restaurant and juice bar, excellent servers and services, super people at registration, perfect check in experience, loved location... everything perfect!  This 2 night stay was part of a 16 day business trip through Europe, and this was the best hotel experience.  Will look forward to staying here again.",5,2018,04,17
111,Fabulous Hotel and amazing staff!,"This is a beautiful hotel set in Finsbury Square, with a lovely view of The Shard. Its opulent interior is elegant yet classy, and the friendly staff make this beautiful hotel even nicer.

We had a Club Room with a view of Finsbury Square and The Shard. The room isn't super large but big enough to be comfortable. We had a king size bed which was super cosy and a pleasure to sink in between crisp sheets after long days of meetings and being out and about in London. 

The bathroom has elegant fittings and a rain shower and is kitted out with Hermes amenities which smell divine! The floor is heated which gives this hotel an additional thumbs up for what is an already beautiful property. 

Perhaps the one thing that this hotel does which I haven't seen anywhere else is give you a complimentary handy smartphone to use FREE during your stay! This gadget gives you unlimited local and international calls, free internet access and much more and was probably the one thing that elevated the already high status of this beautiful hotel in my books!

The Club Lounge is actually set on the ground floor opposite the Reception and serves complimentary breakfast (Continental) as well as drinks and bites in the evenings. Being a mostly business hotel, this lounge is set up more like a restaurant than a lounge with couches and areas for relaxing. There are a couple of tube stations within walking distance from the hotel, and a  bus stop right outside, which makes the hotel accessible from pretty much anywhere however it is a business hotel, and so perfect if you are on business and have meetings with companies that have offices in this area.",5,2018,04,17
111,Nice hotel! ,"Stayed here over Easter weekend, straight after our wedding. Upon entrance we were a little bit concerned because there was a pool table and a bar that looked quite casual but then as we went further in, we saw the beautiful reception area. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and offered to help us up with our stuff. We were on the fourth floor. The room was smaller than expected and there was dust around the minibar area. However, the bed was comfortable, the underfloor heating was lovely and the touchscreen and mood lighting was a treat! There was also a good range of food for breakfast and the views of London are outstanding. ",4,2018,04,16
111,OK but Not 5-Star,"This is the first time I was staying in a hotel in London as I generally stay with friends and family so I have no other London hotels with which to compare this hotel. That being said, I can't imagine this hotel could be possibly rated 5-star by stretch of any western standards. I generally like to stay in 5-stars when traveling with kids and have stayed in many 5-stars and so I think I know what I'm talking about. This hotel is mainly a night club/bar with rooms attached; therefore the bulk of their business is to provide fun party atmosphere and not so much of the hospitality you expect from a real hotel. I would rate the hotel as a clean 3-4 star where you’d stay for couple nights on business or when you’ve had too many drinks and can’t get home. To begin with, this “5-star” hotel does not have a marked concierge desk. Staff with exception of couple people were strange and off-putting. Even when asked simple questions such as where is the closes post office or where can I find a particular type of store I was given either the wrong information or a simple “Sorry I don’t know” without any elaboration or offer of further assistance. For a 5-star hotel, when I approach the staff and ask where I can purchase a buggy for my child I expect the staff to provide accurate information right away. Alternatively, if they do not know the answer, I expect them to offer to get back to me with correct answer in a timely manner. In addition, for a 5-star hotel, it is expected that they even offer to arrange for transportation to the said place if needed. Hotel does not have a business center, so bring your own computer if you need to check into your flights. Hotel does provide a fast wifi and good choice of TV channels.
I stayed with my kids at this hotel twice and both times we stayed in one of their so called ""family suite"" which is basically two rooms with the doors between them opened to allow access. At first as we tried to reach our rooms we noticed their lifts’ system was not synced so you had to push buttons for all lifts and see which one decides to come to get you faster. Interestingly, we noticed the marble stones in the lifts were cracked broken and staff decide to mend the cracks with clear packing tapes. 
Moving on to the rooms, each room had its own bathroom, safe, desk, and minibar. The “family suite"" had no sitting area to sit together and eat; just a short unstable glass table a white padded chair and an office chair in each room, so kids had to sit on their beds to eat sandwiches or take outs. “family suite"" does not have a mini fridge and hotel does not provide one if you ask. When I asked where I should store milk for my child's baby bottles I was told to put it in the minibar coolers which were too warm and turned the milk sour and then into cottage cheese. Throughout our total nine days of stay my son could not have his daily bottles and it made it very stressful for him. I have stayed in some questionable hotels in third world countries and even those hotels provided in-room mini fridges. 
Bathrooms were mostly clean except in our second stay one of bathrooms had grimy toilet and mildewed shower so we ended up using only one of the bathrooms. Carpets were worn and frayed and stained in some areas. Some towels had brown staining and curtains were stained as well (check photos). Beds were a bit soft, but comfortable, sheets were clean, though one of the bedsheets had pilled fabric and felt like sand all over; sheets were never changed even during a week long stay. Out of the 4 rooms we stayed in, 3 of them had non functioning AC/heating. During our second stay when both rooms’ heating didn’t work we called downstairs and they basically offered to adjust the temperature from their main control so every time we got hot or cold we had to call the front desk to make adjustments; very annoying. Rooms were quiet except when we stayed on the 9th floor where we could hear the thumping and shouting of drunks and their constant sounds of flushing toilets into the early hours of morning from upstairs bar/club … when I called downstairs to complain they just decided to ignore me … this particular room also had a running toilet so we had to sleep to the unpleasant sound of continuous running water from the toilet. The lounge had pretty nice continental breakfast in mornings and snacks in the evenings with drinks included. What was really annoying was the constant harassment of the staff whilst in the lounge asking for room numbers … if hotel is so concerned that guests without lounge access might steal their cheap corn chips and popcorn they should allow access to the lounge only with room keys instead. Hotel is well located near three tube stations, I liked Moorgate and Old street stations better as they were easier to find, but one could also use Liverpool station. Just as a final noted I have given this hotel 2 stars compared to other 5-star hotels and to what I expect from a 5-star hotel. I say this hotel is very unimpressive and not a good value for the money spent.",2,2018,04,16
111,Good service,"Stayed in a junior suite with access to the club room: very nice and friendly service there (thank you, Vasilka).  The room was a bit dark (looking on an internal courtyard), but suited our needs well.",5,2018,04,16
111,Kg And Sg,"We had a fantastic time at the Hotel and thought the attention to detail and general atmosphere and attitude of the staff was welcoming and very relaxing .
 
Room was extremely comfortable and facilities were super .
 
Aviary / Terrace is spectacular as I work in the city and love that Skyline .
 
We will return in the near future .",5,2018,04,16
111,Just exactly what I needed,"I was over in London on a business trip and needed accommodation for 4 nights - Monday to Friday.  This place popped up and ticked the boxes on paper.  

It has a fun young feel with a heavy touch of class.  The pub and lounge bars on the ground floor were popular, giving it a great lively feel.  The restaurant on the roof has decent views (it's nice to get out from under the buildings now and then!) and the service was friendly and efficient.  I only ate breakfast upstairs, but the buffet was as you'd expect (the Cumberland sausages are particularly good!).  

Basement gym and smallish pool were clean and fairly well equipped for a hotel.  It certainly gave me enough for a general workout.  The spa staff also seemed friendly, though I didn't indulge.",5,2018,04,16
111,Highly recommended,Booked a Club Room which had great facilities. Everything feels very luxurious but not a all stuffy - really relaxed feel throughout. All the staff in the bar and reception area were really attentive and friendly. Lunch on the roof-top restaurant - the Aviary - was a particular highlight.,5,2018,04,15
111,Great place to stay!," It’s the second time I stay at the hotel. It is beautifully done, run by a friendly team; the rooms are of decent size, and kept very well maintained throughout the stay.
The hotel’s location is very practical for business trips.",5,2018,04,15
111,4 Nights - Business Trip,"Small and average room near the CBD. A Compact feel.

Offers good service, heated rooms/floors, all the normal amenities expected.

Price point higher than expected. But then again, it is in the middle of London.",3,2018,04,14
111,Fantastic weekend away,"My husband and I booked this hotel for the weekend for our anniversary not really knowing what we were expecting. 
On arriving we were warmly welcomed by the lobby staff and shown to the reception where we were offered a glass of prosecco while we checked in. 
The room was beautiful and had everything you would need and more. A very well stocked mini bar and assortment of snacks. Ironing board and iron in the room so you don’t need to ask for one (something I usually get caught out with) the bed was extremely comfy.
Our favourite part of the hotel had to be the Avery bar situated on the top floor of the restaurant. It over looks London with great views of the Shard and you can also see the Olympic Park. The bar staff Stephan, Albert and Robert were all very talented cocktail makers offering suggestions to cater for what we liked.
The hotel breakfast is also served in The Avery and offers a full English or Continental breakfast, both of which had plenty of choice and good quality food. 
The hotel is conveniently situated close to the centre and only a short tube ride or walk to see the main attractions of London.  We ate at Covent Garden both nights and the taxi cost £14. The tube station was a little too far to walk in heals but is only a £4 taxi ride away. 
Over all the hotel was stunning and I will definitely be going back!",5,2018,04,11
111,Beautiful Hotel and Amazing Staff,Our stay at this beautiful hotel was absolutely amazing from the start to finish. We had the best experience and I really enjoyed celebrating my birthday. Our room was fantastic and it was a great touch having the Delicious desert with the card. The staff were amazing and nothing was too much to ask. The rooms were very modern with an amazing bed and great entertainment via the big TV. The hotel has amazing facilities e.g spa and great location.,5,2018,04,11
111,super super super,"from the moment we arrived the staff at the Montcalm could not do enough for us. The reception and door staff were very efficient and we were welcomed with a glass of fiz and our bags taken directly to our rooms.  The value for money was unparalleled and I would definitely stay at the Montcalm again.  The rooms were very modern, beds super comfy and even lovely touches to make our stay a little more special like the turn down service, robes in the bathroom and complimentary fruit bowl. I especially liked the discrete scent of fresh linen that was released around the room via a small unit. Air con was easy and effective and TV was impressive quality (not that we watched much of the tv) Both down stairs (more relaxed bar) and upstairs roof top bar were welcoming and well staffed. Can't wait to return.",5,2018,04,11
111,Perfect,"This Hotel exceed our expectations in every way , upon arrival the service was excellent speedy quick check in, Room very modern and stylish clean and comfortable. The staff were all very friendly, room service and food fabulous! Would recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again. ",5,2018,04,10
111,Tick tock,"Stayed there for my hubby’s birthday treat. There was a constant “tick tick” sound in the room, which made it difficult for my light sleeping husband to sleep. When I asked about the sound in reception, they mentioned it was from the restaurant that was right above us. The staff didn’t really seem to be bothered about the problem and just mentioned about giving us a quieter room next time etc. (Not sure if we will go back though). 

Lovely rooms and location is very good but have this feeling of slight disappointment. ",4,2018,04,10
111,Definitely a 5*!! ,"I stayed at The Montcalm Royal with my boyfriend for a long weekend to celebrate our anniversary. 
When we arrived at the front of the hotel we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who took our luggage in up to the check in desk for us. The women on the check in desk was extremely polite and welcoming, we were delighted to have been given a room upgrade as we were celebrating a special occasion.

The room was amazing!! My partner was extremely happy we had Sky Sports in the room. Massive bed which was super comfy. 

Overall this hotel contributed to a fabulous weekend in London. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends/family. ",5,2018,04,09
111,"Luxurious, welcoming and state-of-the-art",While you may see the great view from the rooftop in pictures you can't quite grasp the decadence of the experience without going there for yourself. The staff are attentive and great at pre-empting your wants and the facilities surpass any that I've enjoyed in the past. Set aside some time to enjoy the spa area after a day walking about town,5,2018,04,09
111,Great weekend away,"Stayed at the Montcalm for the first time and had a lovely time. Excellent customer service and a lovely rooftop bar. We had booked a club room which meant there were complimentary nibbles and drinks in the early evening and also a light breakfast in the morning.
The location is great for Liverpool Street station and the restaurants in shoreditch.",5,2018,04,08
111,Birthday treat,"Stayed here. Fabulous hotel. The staff were fantastic and couldn’t be more attentive. They upgraded our room and gave us complimentary access to the club lounge. 

The facilities were first class and the location is excellent. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you Montcalm. ",5,2018,04,08
111,Weekend stay,"Stayed at Montcalm royal London this weekend this is the second time we have stayed with the Montcalm chain and again really enjoyed the stay from start to finish staff were attentive could not do enough. Rooms were exceptional, facilities second to none will be visiting again",5,2018,04,08
111,Hip Luxury Hotel with Unparalleled Customer Service,"Our family of 4 visited London over Spring Break.

We stayed in the family suite which included club room access for free breakfast and drinks/canapes.  Shuffleboard and food at the Burdock bar was fun and tasty. The Aviary outdoor deck is wonderful for a drink if the weather is nice.  Food at the Aviary was good and well prepared (and expensive), although we did not like all of our menu selections. 

Rooms were large, clean and quiet. Most importantly the MRLH provided exceptional customer service. Everyone greeted us with a smile and a welcome, and our requests were always responded to straight away which made us feel valued as guests.

I can't say enough good things - the only (relatively minor) thing was that they did not provide fresh washcloths each day of our stay.

When we come back to London, we look forward to staying at the MRLH again.",5,2018,04,08
111,Best service by the most helpful and friendly staff,"The staff really go above and beyond here. The hotel is stunning and the rooms are beautiful, good size too. 

We were greeted at the hotel with a glass of wine whilst we waited to check in. Staff helped with any questions or requests, even gave us complimentary late checkout. 

The bar upstairs is also lovely, boasting beautiful views of London. Cannot ask for more!",5,2018,04,08
111,Can’t wait to come back!!! ,"Absolutely unbelievable hotel! I’ve never felt more catered for and looked after. The whole hotel is amazing and the rooms were stunning! The staff were absolutely incredible from the minute I walked up the steps into the hotel. 
A big thank you to Dada for being so friendly and welcoming!! I’ll be highly recommending this hotel to friends and family travelling to London in the future. ",5,2018,04,08
111,Trip of a lifetime!   Best stay!!!!,"Hotel is beautiful and staff is superb!!!!   My husband and I with our two teenage daughters just spent a week there traveling from the US for our first overseas trip.    We reserved a family room (two joined rooms) which put us in club level (not something we usually do) and we were blown away.  The price point was still well within budget but incredible return.  A doorman greeted us and the reception was friendly and helpful.  My mother in law also went and had booked a separate room.  Upon checking asked if we could be close together.  They immediately upgraded her to club level on our same floor at no additional charge. Breakfast was included at Club Level and was very tasty and we were greeted each morning by a sweet and helpful young lady.  In the evenings, light snacks, beverages and alcohol was offered as well.   The pool was lovely too.  But my favorite part was Daniel at concierge. Daniel knew us by name and took care of anything I asked. He arranged our tours, transportation and anything else.  He was a delight!!!  

The rooms were incredible.  Totally updated with high tech lighting features, heated bathroom floors, comfortable beds and large rooms.  They even provide cell phones in each room for you to take to help with directions and to make local and international calls free.   The rooms were very very clean too.  The location is in the banking district and very close to the tube and about 1 mile from St. Paul's Cathedral.  We thought the location was great.",5,2018,04,07
111,Fantastic Hotel with amazing staff!,"I booked this hotel for a birthday treat for my sister, it did not disappoint! We was greeted with champagne on arrival and the gentlemen took our luggage. We was pleasantly surprised to be told we had been upgraded to a junior suite! Dada who checked us in & took care of us for the remainder of the stay was just amazing!! One of the nicest people I have had the pleasure of meeting! Nothing was too much trouble! Our room was stunning with complimentary treats added. The sky bar was fab!! This hotel goes above & beyond myself & my sister will 100% be returning again this year. I would like to stay a massive thank you to Dada! For the best customer service experience I have ever had!! I hope to see all the friendly welcoming staff again on my next visit!",5,2018,04,07
111,Fantatsic Hotel...Even better staff.,"I took my girlfriend here for her 21st birthday celebrations and the staff here could not have been more helpful, I rang Sinnitta in the customer support team within the hotel and she took care of everything for me, she and the team went the extra mile to make the celebrations extra special and I am extremely grateful for the work they put in for me and a very reasonable price, we were greeted with complimentary prosecco and  friendly faces who helped us locate our room and walked through all the amazing perks and gadgets that are inside. 

all in all a fantastic hotel and I will be returning as soon as possible.",5,2018,04,06
111,Incredible! ,All I can say is this hotel and the staff made our weekend perfect! I can’t thank the staff enough for how they treated us and made us feel so welcome and relaxed I really can’t praise the staff enough and just want to say a massive thank you. As for the hotel everything was immaculate from the reception to the roof top bar and we were truly blown away by how amazing our room was and I can truly say that the bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in. We will definitely be coming back soon and really can’t wait! I seriously can’t rate this hotel high enough a perfect hotel with perfect staff that made weekend perfect! ,5,2018,04,06
111,"Great hotel, amazing service and wonderful food","Stayed here for one night on  1 April. 
Check in was very smooth and we felt welcomed by the lady on the desk. 
The room  was perfect with added touches to make it that bit extra special. 
We had lunch in Burdock on the ground floor which was freshly made and tasty. The service there was friendly and efficient. 
In the evening we dined at  the Aviary and couldn't fault the food, the ambience or the service. Natasha, in particular impressed with her knowledge of the menu and her pleasant manner. After dinner we retired to the downstairs bar where again the service was impeccable. My partner was impressed by the wide range of single malts available...
Breakfast was buffet style in the Aviary. There was a good choice of both hot and cold items which were well presented and fresh. 
We did not use the spa, but having viewed it would definitely do so if we went again.
Overall we could not find any negative points about the hotel.
Dorina  and the other guest services staff made it a stay that will remain with us as a very happy memory.",5,2018,04,05
111,"Fantastic Hotel, Excellent Customer Service","We have stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House on several occasions before and on this occasion we were getting married in London and stayed at the Montcalm with many guests for the whole weekend. The Hotel is wonderfully modern, our guests loved it, touch screen lights and air con etc, Elemis toiletries. The staff are always so helpful and this stay was no exception. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff are always so friendly. We can't wait to return. Also the Aviary roof top bar and restaurant is excellent too, reservations are required for evening meals though as it gets busy.",5,2018,04,05
111,Amazing stay,"We were blown away by our room. Specifically the huge comfortable bed, the huge TV and the mood lighting. The selection of alcohol and snacks available in the mini bar was brill. The ensuite was amazing, huge shower, underfloor heating, huge mirror and extendable magnified mirror for doing makeup. There was also underfloor heating. We had complimentary breakfast and the option for complimentary drinks and canapes, as well as full use of the spa. All this for not a bad price. The staff were lovely. There was also a rooftop bar which was amazing and offered great cocktails. Will definitely be returning.  ",5,2018,04,04
111,It was a fantastic stay!,It was just perfect! The room was big and beautiful and had everything (and more) that you needed. The staff was so nice and helpful. There was nothing to put a finger on. Everything was just perfect!,5,2018,04,04
111,Amazing hotel,"Myself and my mum booked to stay in the Montcalm as a belated 30th birthday trip for myself. We were so impressed with the hotel. The staff were so helpful and friendly, the rooms were lovely and the beds so comfortable. They proved a complementary birthday treat in the room on arrival which was a lovely touch. We also had a lovely meal in the Burdock. We can’t wait for our next visit. ",5,2018,04,03
111,"Lovely hotel, wonderful service!","Second stay in a Montcalm and again a top class stay. The staff are the mark of a good hotel for me, that’s the differentiation and at the Montcalm you’re guaranteed a warm welcome and super friendly service. Nothing is too much trouble. I will stay in a Montcalm again without question. The standard is clean, modern and cosy, a tough combination to pull off but Montcalm does it very well. Without naming names, other hotels chains in the same price bracket don’t compare, Montcalm has the edge.",5,2018,04,02
111,"Amazing hotel, friendly staff, reasonably priced - highly recommend!","I have just arrived home after a 2 night stay at this lovely hotel. I was celebrating my birthday weekend with my partner. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The staff were super attentive and they even left a surprise birthday cake and message in the room. The room has everything you needed and more and the coloured lighting and 55 inch with Sky Sports were great additions. The tube is a 5 minute walk away (Moorgate) and the area has a few coffee shops, bars and there's a Tesco Express 2 minutes up the road. The bed was incredibly comfy!

The hotel has a rooftop bar which is amazing for an evening cocktail overlooking the city.

I would 100% recommend this hotel and will be back! Thanks again for making our stay special! The little touches really do make a difference.",5,2018,04,01
111,Beyond amazing,"We arrived at the Montcalm and were greeted by a lovely man (I wish I knew his name to say thank you), where he opened the door and took our suitcases to reception where we received a glass of complimentary champagne. The hotel rooms are fabulous, clean, very large TV and everything is controlled by a panel on the wall. You are also supplied with fresh fruit every day. 

The location is pretty good, it’s about the same distance from Moorgate and Liverpool Street station - a 8-10 minute walk. 

I would defiantly stay here again! 5 star experience",5,2018,04,01
111,Gorgeous,"Stayed here a couple of months ago with my boyfriend and had the most relaxing stay. It started off perfect by us being greeted with a glass of bubbly and a speedy check in.
The tablet on the wall which allowed us to turn all different lights on and music was incredible. 
Although we didn't use it,the mini bar was out of this world! The bathroom was beautiful and the bed was the comfiest I've ever slept in! 
The rooftop bar was beautiful with a fab view of London, we could even see The Shard! 
All in all our stay was 10000/10, it was of the nicest hotel stays we have every had. We will definitely be returning!",5,2018,04,01
111,Birthday weekend ,"We stayed here on Friday night for my birthday and was completely blown away. We were greeted so warmly, was given a room upgrade on the first floor and was given a cake with a happy birthday message, room was outstanding! The staff were so warm, friendly and helpful. Absolutely exceptional. Would highly recommend and would definitely return. Thank you all for making my birthday weekend so amazing! ",5,2018,04,01
111,A lovely stay!,My husband and I stayed for 2 nights last weekend. Overall we had a lovely time. We were greeted warmly and given a glass of prosecco on check in- which was a nice touch. We went to our room 114- on the first floor- the room itself was small but that was fine. The view was a wall of the building next door and there where large fans that were quite loud although we didn't have trouble sleeping. The facilities were good but not 5* the tea was awful and milk was sachet. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was nice- the toiletries were a bit lacking and not luxurious when compared to other 5* hotels we have stayed at. The roof bar was amazing! We enjoyed an afternoon of drinks and it was just lovely up there - great views and a fabulous vibe. The downstairs bar was good too with a lively feel and the shuffleboard was very entertaining! We swam in the pool although it was very cold so we spent most time in the Jacuzzi warming up! The hotel is well positioned with Moorgate station being the closest- there is so much to do in the area we barely needed to use the tube! We would return to a different room and would recommend! ,4,2018,03,30
111,Fabulous hotel!,"This was my first visit to the Montcalm, recommended by a colleague who suggested we go as a ‘treat’. What a treat! The most comfortable bed I’ve slept in at a hotel. Large room. Sky TV that was easy to operate. Outstanding shower. The only downside was that I was on the floor underneath the top floor restaurant so could hear people walking around from 06:30 but I was up early anyway.  Customer service has been excellent and I have booked to stay again but with my husband for a treat!",4,2018,03,30
111,Pleasant ,"From start to finish of our short stay there was nothing to be faulted but for all that there was something missing - warmth!
Warmth of personal service. 
The room was well fitted and very clean. The bed form and comfortable. 
It all goes wrong from door to bedroom with a poorly designed and unwelcoming layout. 
Even down to the smoking terrace outside closing at eleven and being put out on the street! They need to review interaction with customers in the general areas, reception and bars. 
Cannot pin why but no desire to go back",4,2018,03,29
111,Exceptional Hotel and Service,"I have recently stayed at the Montcalm Royal with my family, after 2 prior stays, which were business related.  Every time the experience has been impeccable, from the beautiful rooms with heated bathroom floors to the amazing location, logistically favorable to both business meetings and great sightseeing. Our last visit, however is the reason why I am now writing my first hotel review ever. The hotel personnel went out of their way to make us feel like true royalty.  In particular Dado (Dragoslava) and Dorina from the guest experience services, Ionut from concierge and Catalin from the Aviary roof top restaurant were absolutely phenomenal in their level of service. Rarely does one feel that level of personalized attention, from the bottle of Prosecco upon arrival to small sweet surprises for our daughter, attentively placed in the room while we were exploring the city. Truly well done.

We would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to our next visit.",5,2018,03,29
111,Amazing Hotel,Stayed in London for my partners birthday and I’m so glad we picked the Montcalm royal London. The hotel was fantastic as were the views from the roof top bar. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and the attention to detail was superb. The offer special occasion packages. I chose the prosecco and Balloons one  and they were in the room on arrival to surprise my partner. They use whats app making communication so easy!  The club room was amazing with everything you possibly need. Even a sewing kit!! Well stocked mini bar and snacks. All the latest tech including a travel buddy. We didn’t use it but it’s a android device that’s free to take out and use around London with calls and internet included! On the ground floor we found a lovely bar that served beers and lagers brewed In house. We had diner at the Avery on the top floor. What a meal! Fit for royalty. All in all a fantastic stay and will defo be going back! Thank you Montcalm team!  10/10,5,2018,03,28
111,Great Hotel with superb facilities ,"My partner and I stayed on 24th March 2018 for our 5 year anniversary. From the moment we walked in we where made to feel right at home, the staff where very friendly and attentive. Our room was lovely and they even put rose petals on our bed in the shape of a 5 which was such a nice touch! In the evening we ate in Aviary, (before going to see a west-end show) the cocktails in Aviary where so good! And the food even more delicious. The view from the terraced area was pretty cool too.
Overall I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone, the bed was super comfortable and the shower was a dream! Another plus for the hotel was the swimming pool, jacuzzi, and fitness center.",5,2018,03,27
111,High Tech Comfort,"We stayed here as part of my daughter’s hen weekend celebrations, having booked a spa session via Groupon. Our room was upgraded to Club on arrival and the service was attentive, if patchy (housekeeping). Great room with a tv bigger than we have at home and a large wet room as a bathroom. The controls for everything were high tech but frustrating as they needed some persuasion to get what you wanted them to do. Room service was speedy and reasonable for the grade of hotel, but drinks in the Aviary on the top floor, were stupidly expensive. Our spa session was excellent and on the whole, we had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay.",4,2018,03,25
111,Good for business ,"Stayed there for work, it's good for business people who works in that area as everything is approximate.
Clean and almost clinic like rooms and the reception were friendly. The rooftop bar/ breakfast spot had amazing views but the breakfast buffet can be better as food wasn't memorable.
 ",4,2018,03,24
111,Excellent service as usual,"I have been visiting the hotel 5 times in the last months for business and I really liked the experience. The rooms are spacious and clean, the location is perfect and the service is phenomenal. The hotel personnel really makes you feel at home. I would definitely recommend it and surely will visit again!",5,2018,03,23
111,Luxerious experience but with a personal touch,"I have stayed now a few times at the Montcalm Royal London House, and it is always a wonderful experience.

The reception staff really gives you the feeling of being welcome and the handwritten card and present in my room this time was such a lovely and personal touch.

The rooms at the hotel are luxerious and relaxing: comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. 

I have also stayed at the Montcalm at Brewery but I personally prefer the Royal London House. The restaurant and the great roofterrace are highly recommended.",5,2018,03,23
111,"Beautiful, chic, FUN! We didn’t want to leave....","Stayed here valentines week with my partner and was blown away. 

My experience at the Royal London was amazing.  As a huge fan of the Montcalm Shoreditch Tech, where I’ve stayed around five times, this branch has now become my favourite.

The ambiance, the little extra things that make it stand out; such as drinks and d’orderves in the evening, the beautiful decor, the speedy response to our need for technical support in the room, the delicious chocolate cake because we we celebrating - all very lovely.

We were also upgraded before we even checked in which we greatly appreciated.

Also, special thanks to Ricardo for being so personable, entertaining and making our first experience at the Aviary bar so fun.
 
All in all the M royal London made our couples trip perfect. I have also recommended several family members and friends to the M hoteI because you can’t keep somewhere like this a secret!

Thank you!

111,I'm sorry M by Montcalm (Shoreditch) but I think there's a new champ into town!,"I do love the Montcalm brand but I must say my most recent stay to Montcalm Royal, exceeded all my expectations.

The tone was set by the doorman on arrival who was more than helpful, which was followed by my checking in experience. As per the Montcalm experience we were met with a glass of Preseco which was topped off by two members of staff Dido and Lily who went above and beyond to ensure my groups experience was stella! 

The rooms as always were beautiful which is standard for Montcalm.

The interior is beautiful but what tops it off are the roof top views.

We were able to use the facilities at our leisure without a crowd of people which was great, it was well kept and clean.

The only thing that lets this hotel down is the Aviary restaurant which I came to learn is not part of the hotel which I think is to the detriment of the hotel. The staff in the restaurant would definitely benefit from some unconscious bias training which also seems to be reflected in the make up of its workforce.

Breakfast...I would have preferred to travel back to M by Montcalm for breakfast as the hot breakfast here is definitely not worth £22, especially when you have to wait 15 minutes for a well done fried egg! The staff had disputes in front of us, about us which was a whole new experience. I was shocked and some what disgusted!

All that being said we had an absolutely great weekend and we owe that to the two ladies that cared for us. So if your planning on visiting ask for Dido or Lily, as your won't be disappointed.

Until we meet again...hopefully soon!",4,2018,03,20
111,Take my money please..... Fabulous and exceptional experience !!!must read!!!,"I recently stayed at the Montcalm hotel with family and friends for a surprise get together 16/03/2018. I must say the hotel facilities were fabulous, everything was electronically controlled from the mood lighting in the room to the heated floors. This hotel definitely has the WOW factor in appearance, as the interior and facilities were stylish and absolutely spotless and clean. The bars were very vibrant, and the rooftop breakfast was pricey but fabulous in taste, so it was worth every penny. The spa was also well kept, a bit small I could imagine if everyone was using it at once, but when we arrived it was empty so we had a lovely time.

But above all, the hospitality that we received from the staff that looked after us was absolutely exceptional, as we were made to feel at home, and everything from the moment we walked in till we left the premises was looked after with precision and love.

With all of this being said, I will like to say a BIG special thank you to Dada and Lili, whom  looked after us on our visit and ensured everything went as smoothly and effortless as possible, and I would also like to thank Valentin and Vasilka as they too also went out of their way to make sure we were treated like royalty.

In conclusion, I highly recommend any and everyone thinking of staying at this hotel.

In addition, if you can request Dada and her team to look after you on your stay, I can guarantee you will return and probably even write a much better review than I managed to :)

Absolutley Fabulous.

In all honesty,

Gerd Attah",5,2018,03,20
111,amazing place where we will definitely go back to,"The hotel is amazing. The reception staff so helpful and welcoming. It is an absolute pleasure to be welcomed so nicely. This was our first time at the hotel and we will definitely be back. The roof bar just so great.
Thank you for a nice stay even that the weather was just so awful we had a great time.
Have a game of shuffleboard, such fun!
Thank you Chantal Switzerland",5,2018,03,20
111,Amazing 5 star experience in one of londons best hotels,I have stayed here a dozen times now and each experience is better than the one before. The thing that makes the this hotel is the friendly professionalism of the staff and the exceptional customer service in this hotel.  The rooms and facilities are all what you would expect in a 5 star hotel with an array of quirky gadgets in the room. My best experience is the checkin experience where on most occasions i am greeted by the lovely Deso who is always a delight to meet.  a fantastic hotel and one of my favourites. Anyone privileged enough to get club lounge access will love the experience and enjoy the fine drinks and canapés.  The lovely Vasilka has become a friendly face in there now and I'm always greeted with a smile and my favourite beverage without asking for it.  Great service overall and a must to visit.,5,2018,03,19
111,Great Night,"This hotel was absolutely amazing. I had the best experience and would recommend it to anyone. The views are so stunning.  Thank you Dado,Lily & the club lounge team. Excellent service. I look forward to returning.",5,2018,03,19
111,Montcalm Royal london dissatisfied customer,"So we booked two rooms well in advance as we were driving up on the sat morning for a wedding and made contact with the montcalm asking that the rooms be ready for midday of course when we arrived the inlaws room was & ours wasnt so due to time constraints we alternated & got ready in the one room as they couldnt advise us when ours would be ready 
On arriving back to the hotel 10:30 on the sat night check in was made very uncomfortable as they orig couldnt agree that we had booked and after a long & prolonged discussion we got a very nice room on the 9th floor which i have to say the views were amazing from the terraced area 
On checking out on the sunday i was given a voucher that would discount the NCP car park by 50% & given clear instructions how to use it & obviously it didnt work so as the machine wouldnt give me my own ticket back i paid the £55 24 hr charge parked back outside the montcalm and tried to explain what had happened which i actualy felt like they did not believe me and have to send a copy of the bank card statement back to  the manageress for further investigation whilst this was being discussed i got a car park ticket when  i quizzed the doorman as to why he did not get me from 15 feet away in reception a shrug of shoulders and arms in the air not a very happy experience from this stay in london & will doubt that i ever stay in this montcalm again nothing like the same experience of the marble arch hotel where we have stayed on a couple of occasions 
Obviously dont share a computer data base as my wife stays in london many times on business a year and we had to give all the info once again even though she used this group a month or so ago loyalty returning guests program???
Prices fir coffee pastries room service breakfast seemed higher than other hotels we have stated in as well 
So not a good experience this time montcalm Royal London house very very disappointed to say the least & i feel you have let the brand down  !!!

111,Excellent hotel stay but bar was just ok,"We stayed here for two nights. When we checked in, a manager noticed that I was pregnant and immediately offered me a seat and a bottle of water. We were also upgraded to a slightly larger room, so all in all a fabulous start! The room was excellent, with fresh fruit available, Sky, robes and luxury toiletries. It was immaculate. I was also offered an umbrella for the impromptu snow blizzard that arrived on Saturday. This hotel gets a 5/5 from us. 

The only slightly negative bit for us was the bar. While the decor and the views are really lovely for drinks, we were told that it is a frequent haunt of local strippers coming into round up business. I think to the person who told us this, this as a plus, but there were families in there eating. While it wasn't immediately obvious (and admittedly we were looking for it) and I'm well aware that this is a common occurrence in all top London hotels, it was a bit strange taking into account the children eating late at night.  A way to counteract a more adult scene would be to refuse children after a certain time. Problem solved. We also unfortunately were served an uncooked chicken breast on top of what should have been a vegetarian salad with runny eggs - I am visibly pregnant and all staff were aware of this when we dined. My husband's rib-eye was the thinnest steak I've ever seen in my life, and my husband eats a lot of steak. We ended up sending our main courses back untouched. Luckily the starters had been delicious so it wasn't all bad and we weren't starving. Popping back to the bar for a drink the following night, we saw that the steaks being served looked really good and justified their £40 price tag. I think we just were unlucky. The bar manager was very apologetic and kind about the whole thing, so we weren't mad, merely inconvenienced a little. 

All in all we would most definitely stay here again and will most likely book it for our next trip in a few weeks. We will just eat elsewhere. We only removed a star to a four star based on our food experience.",4,2018,03,19
111,Montcalm royal hotel,"Stayed at the montcalm royal on the 17th March for one night for my wifes 60th birthday.  From the minute we entered the hotel till when we left I couldn't fault the staff and service we received.  Room was excellent modern and spotless, nothing was to much trouble . Well done to all the staff at the montcalm you should be very proud off yourselves. ",5,2018,03,19
111,Birthday Weekend,From the start of the stay to the end it was amazing. This service was outstanding from the minute we came through the front door. Prosecco on arrival while checking in which was a great bonus. Room facilities were fantastic with a birthday treat in the room of brownies and more Prosecco. Clean and Tidy and very modern. Would recommend to anyone looking at going.,5,2018,03,19
111,Amended review. First cladd,"I have contacted Tripadvisor to remove a negative review because we were contacted by Dorina, the guest experience supervisor - in direct response to the review. We mistakenly double booked a room at non refundable rate - a mistake at our end- but were disappointed with the inflexible hotel policy. We asked could we spend the £285 in the restaurant but this was declined. I have to say that we were then offered a full refund, offer of upgrade and some extras on arrival. An immediate follow up email and I’m now really looking forward to our stay. This is beyond what I expected and I intend to write another positive review after my stay. Thank you very much. I will be recommending this hotel",5,2018,03,18

Huge thank you to Dada who makes my stays that much better every time. She is an absolute asset to The Royal London House and Montcalm as a whole. 

I extremely recommended this hotel to all. 

Thank you Dada and Montcalm",5,2018,03,17
111,WOW - TOP NOTCH - BUT.....,".

the very best thing about the THE MONTCALM  ROYAL LONDON HOUSE is the PEOPLE !!.

My best-friend surprised me with a weekend here at The Montcalm Royal London House whilst visiting London.

The whole experience was amazing. The hotel takes luxury to another level; no detail is too small and no request is too trivial. No need to venture outside as all your catering and leisure needs are met, from the numerous restaurants and bars ( The Aviary on the top floor with excellent views of the City) within the hotel with the fabulous spa located downstairs . 

The Montcalm Club room with a King size bed was large and spacious, with a 55 inch TV that had a whole range of channels, catering for all the sports and movie enthusiasts. The comfort of the room was fabulous. Don’t hesitate ...just book it... you will not be disappointed. 

 A special mention to 4 members of staff who went above and beyond on many occasions whilst dealing with our requests . Daniel the Night  Concierge who   managed to ensure my friend secured a Spa appointment even when they were full. His knowledge, unflappable personality and experience shines through . ‘Vasilka ‘ who works in the Club Lounge , was quiet simply outstanding !! . She could not do enough for us whether providing food (chocolate cake was divine) or drinks or going out of her way to make us feel special a huge thanks to both.  Service delivery is a skill that ‘Daniel’ and  ‘Vasilka’ make it a pleasure to experience with genuine effortless hospitality at the core of everything they do.

The wonderful healing hands of ‘Tea’ in the Spa and ‘Maria’ the Spa Co-Ordinator who ensured the whole spa experience was thoroughly enjoyed. A note of thanks to you both.

The Montcalm staff are very special and their attention to detail and smiles go a long way. Well done to the Montcalm Royal London House Management. 

We cannot wait to visit again and enjoy the many 5 star facilities that places The Montcalm RLH ahead of their competitors in the City of London.

Thank you all once again. 

Paul & E",5,2018,03,17
111,"Great service, location and breakfast with a view",Stayed at a number of Montcalm’s and always a pleasure. Service in particular is great. Stayed at this one last week and excluding service throughout. If you stay have a drink or breakfast in the aviary for great views ,5,2018,03,17
111,Excellent hotel,"Visited with my mom for her retirement, it was my 2nd time to the hotel and it was absolutely fabulous. 
The staff, room, bars, food, jacuzzi and pool all lived up to expectation and more. 
All staff from check in, door, concierge, bar were lovely. 
We got an upgrade to the club room which really was worth it and also allowed us to meet others. 
Overall a fabulous hotel and convenience to Liverpool Street and Moorgate station was great. 
Would highly recommend and will stay again!! ",5,2018,03,16
111,Amazing hotel!!!,"if you want a touch of class then this hotel will certainly meet your expectations. We booked this hotel for our 10th anniversary. It has a lovely roof top bar, two bars on the ground floor and is very central to London. We also had a continental breakfast which i must say was very well laid out with great selections of foods. We planned to go out in the evening but we enjoyed the bars so much that we decided to stay in the hotel bars. 
The room was very modern, stylish with amazing lighting plus a mini bar and wide screen tv. The duty manager Daniel was very welcoming and extremely accommodating to our needs. From start to finish the staff were polite, friendly and above all helpful. A huge thank you once again to everyone at Montcalm Royal London hotel for making our visit so special.",5,2018,03,15

111,Excellent stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks on business and having nothing but great things to say. It’s clean, in a good location, and has a great wait staff, especially Valentin in the Club Room. He went above and beyond for us every night that we visited. ",5,2018,03,12
111,Loved the extra touches ,"Stayed here on a night out with friends... super efficient and friendly service... 
checking was smooth... a complimentary upgrade made for a perfect start... 
on entering my room... The hotel staff had left an extra special sweet treat of macaroons and chocolates... After a 3hr journey in... I woofed these down with a fabulous cup of tea...   Divine. 
The room was amazing, spacious with all the amenities for a 5 star establishment... 
After a great night out it was fabulous to return to spend the night in a super comfy bed... I slept the whole night and woke refreshed.  We didn’t have breakfast in house so can’t comment. 
Would definitely stay again... thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay - including the doorman whose smile made a huge difference to the welcome and goodbye... ",5,2018,03,12
111,A great hotel in modern design with excellent staff,"The Montcalm Royal London House is something to behold.  It blends 5* Luxury and  impeccable design, with some more bohemian elements and traditional working class pubs and games.  It was as if designed perfectly for me and the Mrs.

Our room was lovely and overlooked the square which at night look wonderful surrounded by the city skyline.  The beds are large and comfortable, and the choices of Pillow, room scent and lighting was really great.  It has a large TV and a great bathroom, although we didn't have a bathtub which is something I always like. Spotlessly clean and everything was provided for.  The minibar was useful when we wanted a quick, convenient drink or snack without leaving the room. 

The members club lounge provided a good selection of complimentary food and drinks (including some premium brands) in a very comfortable atmosphere.  You can sit back, have a beautiful pot of tea and slice of cake, or a scotch and really appreciate the Art Deco design. This lounge also offers a complimentary continental breakfast.

The roof top Aviary bar is the perfect setting for a late night drink, the terrace views are beautiful. At breakfast you feel on top of the world looking out at London whilst filling up on an excellent selection form the hot and cold food buffet.  

Finally, the Service:  It was second to none.  I have stayed at differing levels of hotel around the world and only this one has blended the right level of 5 star professionalism and competence with a very friendly and informal feel.

This is a very attractive hotel on several levels.",5,2018,03,12
111,Great service!,"Room was in excellent condition, good bathroom / shower, all very clean, comfortable and quiet. The hotel team consistently great approach to delivering customer service. 

Minor things in the a/c slow to respond and room hot for too long, but spring only just starting so maybe understandable. 

And while club room breakfast good overall (very good coffee!) could do with a toaster, very slow getting slice by slice toasted by servers....minor gripes, overall very good.",4,2018,03,11
111,Possibly the best hotel I’ve been to,"My other half booked this for a birthday, they upgraded us to a junior suite to say happy birthday. The room it’s self was amazing, heated floors, ambient lighting, massive tv, lounge area, sleek design, comfy beds, this hotel was great. Staff were very friendly too, the door guy always complimented us! We were also greeted with champagne on arrival which was really cool. Thanks Montcalm, will be returning! ",5,2018,03,11
111,Great Birthday weekend ,"This was our first stay at Montcalm and it certainly won't be our last! 
We booked the hotel as a base as we had a lot planned this weekend! We both agreed however that we are coming back just to enjoy they hotel itself! The staff were amazing and very helpful! The room was so modern and immaculate! The complementary fruit was delicious! The champagne in  the mini bar was amazing! Our only regret wasn't mentioning that it was a birthday treat we were on as reading the reviews it seems that the staff go all out, however everything we had was more than enough! We can't wait to visit again! Thank you for an amazing stay!  ",5,2018,03,10
111,Great Location -Business/Pleasure,"We stayed in this hotel for a week -- business and pleasure. People were very friendly and helpful, but housekeeping was a little interesting. They provided us with over 20 bottles of shampoo and conditioners that we never used - bald guy and specific shampoo for wife. Ate prepaid breakfast each day in the club room which consisted of salmon, meats, cheeses, fresh bread, cold cereal, yogurt, and fresh fruit. Great pub at the lower level with a good selection of beer and don't forget visit the Aviary on the 9th floor - spectacular view of the city. visited the pool and spa one day, with only one other guest in attendance. If you are looking for a good pizza and don't want to go far, exit through the Long Arm Pub and turn-left - Pizzabuzz. Great inexpensive homemade pizza that the local frequent.",4,2018,03,10
111,Beautiful & Center of Everything,"Close to the coolest neighborhoods for food from hipster to classy. Next door to a fun park with a coffee shop in the center. Quiet area at nights unless you check out the bar and restaurant in the hotel. Beautiful modern rustic decor. Rooms were clean and full of amenities, favorite being the touch screen heated bathroom floor and the room's mood lighting. Spa pool is awesome. Easy to get to tourist sights via tube/train or walking. Big plus, walking distance to Duck & Waffle, if you need 24 hour eating options.",5,2018,03,09
111,Really good Service and awesome Rooms to boot. Roof top breakfast topped it all off.,"I was well looked after by Mandeep Singh the  reservation manager,
very courteous and managed my booking with ease.

The little things always matter when it comes to customer service, and they delivered. 

The front desk were very helpful with all the information i needed and were always at hand to help with anything i needed (info,where to go, what to eat where ect.) 

rooms were comfortable and very clean. had mood lighting and scenting (YES lol) it was a good experience.

Coming back just on the strength of that.. and the roof top breakfast ;)",5,2018,03,07
111,Great Hotel With Great Staff,"Hotel is about 8 minutes walk from Liverpool Street station. The hotel rooms are big enough, bigger than some luxury hotel rooms in London.

The Hotel has a rooftop bar and terrace which is very popular during the summer months especially on Friday and Saturday, with great views of London. Due to the location, you often get young professionals popping to the rofftop bar after working hours to catch up with colleagues, for cocktails, etc.

The bathroom floor is heated which can be controlled from the wall panel. There is an android type smartphone in each room, International guest can use the mobile phone for local calls and data at no extra charge. This comes in handy for guest that have expensive roaming data plan (just remember to sign out of all social media platforms before you check out). 

The Hotel also has a spa and a swimming pool with heated jacuzzi.

If you are looking for a hotel that offers great views of London from a rooftop terrace with good amenities for a relaxing weekend etc I will recommend a stay at the Montcalm Royal House London.",5,2018,03,06
111,Special Hotel ," 
This was my second visit to this gorgeous hotel and the warm welcome shown by reception and concierge was most appreciated.  

This hotel is stunning but does not have the pretentiousness that it so easily could adopt.  The attention to detail was obvious and the staff maintained a positive attitude and ensured I felt welcome during my stay. Everyone treated me with dignity and respect and I  was amazed at the consistency in their performance and willingness to go the extra mile.
 
Your staff were well groomed and took pride as representatives of the Montcalm Royal London House.",5,2018,03,05
111,Absolutely fantastic! Cant rate the highly enough.,"Firstly i would like to say a big thank you to Sannitta. She was absolutely wonderful in making arrangements for my partner and I a birthday. The review comes quite bit delayed however i can't pass the oppertunity to leave a review. 

The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Very well decorated and nice a modern. Its clear that attention to detail has been made here. 
I will make you aware that you walk through a bar to get to reception, which we also feel was wonderful however i'm aware some others do not share the same enthusiasm. There was no problem with noise where this is concerned (not for us anyway). 

The room was absolutely fantastic and the beds were unbelievably comfortable and large! We stayed at the Intercontinental London 02 the following day and i must say, We felt as if we had been downgraded, even though we paid for an upgrade at the 02 and at a much higher cost! (Not that the IC was bad, it just wasn't Montcalm!)

The staff really could not do enough for you. Were a very 'average' couple an were made to feel very welcome by everybody. 

Sannitta was kind enough to put a birthday desert in the room for us with a fruit basket. Honestly, we were so pleased with there efforts. 

Well done to all the staff at Montcalm, You did a fantastic job!

111,Lovely hotel with excellent service,"I was staying in this hotel for a business trip but due to bad weather in Dublin and London I had to extend my trip by 4 days and rebook rooms twice at the last minute. All hotel staff were very accommodating - managed to find a room, allowed me to keep the same room when rebooking and were always friendly and helpful which was very much appreciated at a stressful time. The rooms were also lovely and the restaurant and spa were very nice. Highly recommended.",5,2018,03,04

My hotel of choice when on business this side of the Capital.",5,2018,03,02
111,Great hotel!,"The stuff in the hotel is very welcoming, I felt like a princess. I must say that we had a fabulous room with everything you need. The view on the eight floor is fantastic and the high tech in the room is impressive. The rooftop bar is also worth to visit. 
It’s well situated, the tube is at a 2 minutes walk where you get every tube line. Perfect!",5,2018,03,01
111,Great staff!,"The hotel ha a great location, offers comfortable rooms, nice facilities such as the Club lounge and the gym.

All in all a really nice hotel staffed by fantastic employees.
Well managed!",5,2018,03,01
111,Special thanks to Dado!,"We spent a weekend here and the experience was beyond expectation. The room was incredible and even came with a smartphone to spare, and the hotel also has great spa and gym facilities. The staff was great, and were super helpful when it came to getting help with directions and recommendation, and when I needed help with printing some documents they did it very quickly. However, one of the most positive aspects of our experience was the warm welcome we got from Dado at the reception, her hospitality and authenticity really made the stay a wonderful one. Thank you Dado!",5,2018,02,28
111,Excellent hotel near Shoreditch,"I've stayed in many London hotels and this has been my favorite. 

A couple things that stood out:
- The staff was incredibly accommodating, attentive, and sharp
- The room was fantastic and modern
- Good gym with free weights, rowing machine, machines, and cardio equipment 
- Full spa that I didn't get the chance to use unfortunately

Close to Shoreditch. Will certainly stay again",5,2018,02,28
111,"Confortable, welcoming good hotel in the center of london","We had a room on the 8 floor with a beautiful view on the square and the cityskyline. The room was well furnished, a really good bed, tea and coffee was for free. The bathroom was very clean and has a super shower. The staff was really welcoming. A place to stay.",5,2018,02,27
111,Amazing Birthday,My stay here was truly excellent. Especially the kind service me and my friend received from Dado and Dorina. The hotel is very stylish and clean and room was lovely. When Dado was informed it was my birthday she arrange for a complemtary desert sent to the room and bottle of prosecco. Dora truly made me and my friend feel extra special. I will be booking this hotel again and will recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in central London.,5,2018,02,27
111,Amazing!!,"I booked this hotel as a birthday treat for myself and my friend for her 21st birthday. The hospitality at the hotel was amazing. Dodo and Dorina were fantastic and made our stay extra special, with a complimentary room upgrade, dessert and bottle of prosseco in our room! 

The hotel decor was beautiful and in a great location. I will definitely be staying here again!",5,2018,02,27
111,The staff makes the 5-stars!,"The staff is very helpful, kind and always helps when needed. The room, facilities are wonderful. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay there. I surely recommend this hotel! It is the staff that makes the 5-star! Without them our stay would not be so great! See you again soon but then with kids :) ",5,2018,02,27
111,Beautiful hotel in good location,"We booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced for London but also it looked fabulous.  The hotel is lovely especially the rooftop bar area which is really relaxing and informal and has amazing views.
The room was also lovely with a huge bed and large bathroom with underfloor heating.
The controls are on a panel in the room where you adjust the temperature.  We had a bit of bother with the heating on the panel but it didn't affect our stay and staff went out of their way to resolve the issue.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful and made you feel very welcome.
You have a mobile in the room which you can use as a map guide when you are out and about.  Also the TV was massive and had sky movies and sky sports on which was great for us football fans.
The hotel is also in a good location, five minutes walk from Liverpool street station.
We would recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we are in London.
.",5,2018,02,26
111,One of the best hotels out there and best staff,"the hospitality provided to us during our stay at the hotel was unbelievable. The stuff were really good, helpful and not to mention the smiles they always had on their faces they made us feel very welcome and I made a few requests which in some hotels they wouldn't do it complimentary but did very well for a special occasion. The spa team are very professional and have years of experience you get what you pay for and more. I would recommend the club room it's worth it and the club lounge was an icing on the cake. I would definitely go back there again very clean, cosy and comfortable rooms and very modern too with sky tv",5,2018,02,23
111,A great location for city and Barbican - quiet location and good coffee eateries close by,"Quite a busy downstairs reception area - possibly business folk meeting after work or getting together for a meal. Rooms are modern, clean, cosy and comfortable. I had a std twin room for £240 - it was on the small side and had no bath, but an awesome shower. Very quiet room, great TV with Sky, Youtube, phone mirroring etc. Nespresso coffee machine and great quality tea. Minibar is very expensive (if you're a middle earner like me), but you get a free bottle of mineral water e.g gin (good quality) is £13. They turned down my bed and put mood lighting on while I popped out to Bone Daddies Ramen at Old Street tube (5 minute walk). Staff were friendly. Amenities were great. Nice bowl of fruit in the room - I love to eat fruit when travelling.
3 negatives - they took an old-fashioned imprint of my card (1990s style) - I don't trust this even though some of the numbers were redacted. Also, the bed was quite soft for me - I prefer a firmer bed, but it was still a comfortable bed. Finally, the young doorman gave an obviously flirtatious look when a teenage girl walked by - I noticed this but hope that she didn't. Three very minor negatives which haven't affected my overall ratings; this is a great hotel in a great location and shows touches of quality.",4,2018,02,21
111,Wonderful staff member at reception. ,"I would like to commend very highly a front of house staff member, Sunita, for the way she looked after us. We had a small problem and she sorted it out for us by giving us complimentary breakfast and a bottle of Prosecco. We also had unlimited access to the club lounge. She went above and beyond for us.

111,Amazing experience in the heart of the City,"I would like to express my feedback regarding my experience at your Montacalm royal London house during valentin's Wekeend.

A special attention for all details ( The spa/My  suite  and the breaksfast )everything was Excepcional.
The Hotel  is Suberb
Im very satisfy and Happy about making the choice.

Big Well done to  all team  who makes all  the difference",5,2018,02,20
111,My favourite hotel in london,"Absolutely loved our montcalm experience, booked to stay here for two nights for my boyfriends birthday. It was perfect from beginning to end and faultless. I was very impressed with the level of communication leading up to the stay and throughout (emails before hand to check if it was a special occasion, email whilst there to advise they hadn’t been able to clean the room as we had accidentally pressed the do not disturb button on the  electronic controls in the room and to let them know when convenient!) On check in we were given a glass of champagne and they kindly upgraded our room to a suite due to it being a special occasion, as well as providing complimentary breakfast and Prosecco and a happy birthday plate of nibbles in the room. They sure pay attention to detail and go the extra mile to ensure you enjoy your stay. The aviary is a must to visit to see the rooftop bar views, also ground floor bar was nice and relaxed, we enjoyed having friends come over and playing the shuffleboard. The spa is nice, with a pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi, which was perfect for relaxing. Location 5 min walk from morgate tube station and santander hire bikes right outside!! Ohh and one last comment... the beds and bedding are to die for, huge and like sleeping on clouds!!! Highly recommend the montcalm and will be returning, thankyou to all the fabulous staff!",5,2018,02,19
111,amazing stay,"This hotel is amazing, was my partners birthday and they made sure they made it special with a complimentary room upgrade along with a bottle of wine and a birthday dessert. The rooms are up to such a high standard and the staff are all lovely. 

Wont go anywhere else now.",5,2018,02,19
111,Wow wow wow,"First visit and won’t be our last!! Greeted with some champagne and because it was my birthday our room was upgraded, what a lovely gesture! Rooms are incredible, I’ve never stayed anywhere so amazing. All the amenities you need, so spacious and the bed is amazingly comfy. The rooftop bar is a must!! I would not hesitate in staying here again, I can’t wait to return. Thank you!",5,2018,02,18
111,Excellence in London,"Very spacious room; huge bed; great hotel facilities - both Burdock and The Aviary bars are beautiful; in-room kitchenette was handy

The mattress was quite soft. Enjoyed the Nespresso machine but small cups and only four pods provided each day prior to contacting reception.",5,2018,02,18
111,Mr Johnston ,"We have stay at the montcalm now for the 6th time and each time it gets better 
From the amazing friendliness & interaction from the staff, to the personal care they try to give each customer and feel good feeling throughout the whole hotel e.g.. the lovely decor rooms, well staffed in all areas, 1st class roof top restaurant / bar & indulging spa facilities what is there not to enjoy from the montcalm our 100% recommendations for a great stay in london 
",5,2018,02,18
111,Amazing upgrade!!!!,"I booked the Montcalm for my husbands birthday (The first since we were married). Having looked at many hotels and apartments in London I booked Montcalm as it had good reviews, looked modern and was in a great location. I was emailed the week leading up to our stay and was asked to inform the Hotel if it was a special occassion. I would never usually do this but thought as they had asked I will inform them about it being my husbands birthday. I heard no more. 

On arrival guests were being greated with a glass of prosecco which I though was a lovely touch. The hotel is very well presented and decorated and has a great feel to it from the moment you walk in. 

However what made our experience slightly different was that we were welcomed by a staff member called Dado and she had given us an incredible upgrade. We were upgraded to the penthouse suit on the top floor. We had an amazing room with a huge balcony/garden area over looking a fantastic view of London. We even had our very our plastic igloo on the balcony with chairs, heating and blankets. We were provided with a free bottle of prosecco, some very yummy chocolate brownies and the staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating. The suite was amazing!

Even without the upgrade I would have written a lovely review however having staff at the hotel such as Dado who are keen to go the extra mile really did lead to an incredible stay for us. 

Thank you Montcalm and Dado for making our stay so fantastic. We were blown away and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody!",5,2018,02,18
111,Super comfy beds and great rooms,Stayed here a couple of times now and each time has been brilliant. Staff are friendly and the hotel is immaculate. The rooms are fabulous. Very spacious and extremely comfortable. No noise either time we have stayed and the bed is exceptionally comfortable. It’s located within a five minute walk to the underground and there are a few good breakfast places nearby such as the Breakfast club (15min) and Ozone (10min) should you not want hotel breakfast. Probably my favourite place in London and I’ve stayed in many (although not reviewed them all here). ,5,2018,02,16
111,5 stars indeed!!!,"I have stayed at the end of February travelling for business. From the time i arrived i felt very welcome, from the doorman who greeted me with a big smile, to the reception everything was perfect. The check in was really smooth. Dorina from guest experience took care of me all the time, she is a very bubbly lady. Ionut at the concierge desk as well he is a star, he gave me very good directions and recommendations for restaurant, nothing was too much trouble for him. The room was very clean and tidy. It is my first review, but for sure this hotel makes you doing it. I will definitely come back.",5,2018,02,16
111,Superb hotel and staff,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Montcalm Royal London House.  We wanted a relatively early check-in so had some lunch in the hotel's restaurant whilst a room was prepared.  We were delighted to be upgraded to a junior suite by a very helpful receptionist.  The room was superb.  The hotel has a great vibe of informal professionalism and great bars and activity areas. Superb location.  Highly recommend.,5,2018,02,16
111,Lovely Night in London,"My girlfriend and I had a room for the night for an evening in the city. The attention to detail was great, from the champagne in the room to the rose petals on the bed. The suite was perfectly equipped with mood lighting and Sky TV. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting to stay for any reason.",5,2018,02,15
111,Amazing beyond recognition,"I`m in all honesty not one for writing reviews , but our stay at The Montcalm was beyond anything we ever expected. To start with the hotel itself , it is located right next to Moorgate tube station and Liverpool street station , very convenient if you like to get out much and explore. Upon arrival we were greeted by the wonderful doorman Marcus? Marco? ( Very sorry if i got that wrong ) who offered to help us with our luggage and showed us to reception and all we could do was smile :) .
Once ended up at reception , everyone was smiling and gave us the feeling that we are not just some strangers walking in a hotel , but more like this is where we should be right now . Amazing atmosphere overall , the people from reception were just simply wonderful ! 
The room was beautiful ! Touch pad technology at your fingertips , huge smart tv for movie addicts , mini bar filled with goodies , there is even a smartphone in the room which you can use to make your way around the big ol` city of London , the bed was like sleeping on a formation of clouds .. probably the best sleep i had in a while. Rooftop bar and restaurant which is a must see if you are staying in the hotel , spa with Jacuzzi and swimming pool , lets face it , this is 5* at its finest and it cannot be faulted.
I would like to thank everyone who took care of us during our stay , and i would also like to give a special thanks to Adrian who made sure that from the moment we landed we were well taken care of and made our visit to London so much easier and memorable. 
Thank you Montcalm for this unforgettable experience.",5,2018,02,14
111,WOW,"Fantastic stay from start to finish and THE best upmarket hotel I have ever stayed in.

I booked the hotel as a surprise for my partners birthday. I called the hotel directly and booked the Club Double room. The gentleman on the telephone informed me that this included use of the club lounge, complimentary drinks and canapé reception, continental breakfast the next morning and use of the spa facilities.

A few days before our stay the hotel got in contact with me to ask more details regarding our trip (was there a special occasion etc) which I felt gave the experience a personal touch. Thank-you Sinitta!

We arrived at the hotel early and were greeted by various attentive and friendly staff who took our luggage bags from us and allowed us to check in. We then explored our surroundings and came back a few hours later when the room was ready.

Hotel and Room:
-	The hotel was of 5* standards, modern and clean with unique artistic features. All staff smartly dressed and polite
-	The room was also of the same standard, under floor heating, mood lighting and great views of Finsbury square and London. We were also greeted to a lovely ‘Happy Birthday’ message written in a dessert, a bottle of bubbly and a personal greeting card for my partners birthday. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the walk in 'rainfall' shower was also a treat. 
-	My only slight negative regarding the room would be the size. As the hotel was 5* and I had paid for an upgrade I expected the room to be slightly bigger. This didn’t spoil our time here but was more of an observation and perhaps heightened expectations on my behalf.
-	The club lounge was a brilliant highlight of our stay. From 5.30pm they had various brands of alcoholic/soft drinks and canapes on offer for those to help themselves. We spent a few hours drinking in there before our meal.
-	Our stay included a continental breakfast. There was a brilliant spread of cold meats, cheeses, yoghurt, cereals etc on offer but we fancied a hot breakfast and was informed that the rooftop restaurant and bar (Aviary) offered this at an extra cost. We had the most amazing breakfast, help yourself hot buffet. The restaurant had amazing views over the whole of London; we had wished we had known about it the night before to visit when the sun had gone down.

Spa
-	We made use of the spa facilities before going home. (sauna, steam, jacuzzi and pool) The atmosphere in the spa was very relaxing and the complimentary cool drinks and snacks on offer were also a nice touch

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the personal touches made it extra special for the occasion we were celebrating. I have recommended this gem to so many people already and would love to visit again!",5,2018,02,12
111,Very satisfying!,"I would like to start my review from their lovely staff.Def you will feel at home from everyone’s approach to your needs.They are helpful,friendly and accomodating.They always put smiles on their faces.Keep it up guys!Breakfast were great.Room was super clean and yes housekeeping is everyday😀.Good ambience and location too.Def coming back in this hotel on our next trip!👍👍👍",5,2018,02,11
111,Fantastic hotel & impeccable service ,"What a treat! Staying here is a absolute joy the ambience and rooms along with the staff - all first class

Breakfast was a little limited but I don’t eat a lot so didn’t bother me. 

Would stay here again great place to stay with clients. No need to worry. ",5,2018,02,10
111,Late booking ,"We decided to stay at short notice - very comfy bed and nicely appointed  room- well stocked mini bar and tea and coffee facilities.  Everything you need. Staff nice 
My only gripe the lights took a little bit of organising. Bath room was well appointed struggled a little with the taps !.Great location . The pub attached had a great menu but we didn’t eat there",5,2018,02,09
111,Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed here for 1 night during the summer; At check-in the receptionist was excellent and extremely friendly and accommodating. She arranged for a bottle of champagne up to the room when she heard we were celebrating my husband's birthday. 

The hotel room was fantastic; heated floor and all the bells & whistles. Super comfy bed and quite roomy, surprisingly.
Our view was dire, we were looking at offices, but that wasn't really an issue. 

We ordered room service, which was disappointing unfortunately. The burger & chips was quite plain, and the chips were like the ones you'd get in McDonalds. 

After our night out in London we came back to the hotel to have some rooftop drinks. The rooftop was closed, so we didn't get to appreciate that unfortunately. Also, the bar staff were a little bit rude to us. They were closing the bar at 11pm and seemed disgruntled when I asked for a glass of water. 

The breakfast the next morning was disappointing; just some cold meats & cheeses. There was no hot food option. With the price of the hotel I would have expected a hot breakfast. 

So in summary, the hotel itself was FAB for a short break, most of the staff were super friendly, the room was excellent, location is good, but just one or 2 small disappointment. Overall I would probably still recommend it, and would go back.",4,2018,02,08
111,OMG 😍😜🎉🤸🏿‍♀️😘,"First I would like to say a big thank you to Dado, Gabby and Lily (Guest Experience)

I booked club double, the room was perfect the bathroom was spacious,  on arrival I was given a glass of Prosecco it was sweet (just wondering what extra was in it?!? hmmmm)

As it was my birthday my room had special touches again thank you the Guest experience team. 

Loved the food supplied at the club lounge especially the prawns and falafel. 

Downstairs I used the gym, jacuzzi and pool which was very clean.  Next time I come back (March) I will use the steam room and sauna. 

All the bar staff upstairs at the Aviary was very attentive from the person at the stairs to the desk then to the bar and waiters and waitress prefect and accommodating.  The cocktails was nice from what I can remember lol, and everyone should get a cocktail that comes with roasted marshmallows (it’s a must). 

I was scared to do solo, but you would never have known I came by myself, the way I was treated like a queen. 

Thank you for making my birthday the best to date xox ",5,2018,02,07
111,A modern lovely hotel,"We stayed with our two teenagers in this hotel.  The hotel was easy reach of town with great  nearby transport links.  The management and  staff at this hotel are very friendly, efficient and nothing seems to be too much trouble.  Little gestures like a drink on arrival and our boys very much liked club lounge for snacks.  Would recommend you try out the restaurant especially for breakfast with great views.  Good cocktail and wine selection too. We enjoyed the spa and gym.   too.  Will definitely return.",5,2018,02,07
111,Fabulous hotel and service,"I stayed here with family for my wedding in September 2017 and have so many positive things to say.  

Overall, I cannot overstate how brilliant our stay was.  The hotel itself is a very pleasant place to stay, rooms and general interior are of a very high standard.  We had access to the VIP lounge area where there is complimentary food and wine, which is fab.  Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant is excellent.  

But the most outstanding thing about our stay was the super team of staff.  Krisztina and the rest of the team could not do enough for us, right from my initial viewing of the hotel as a potential for our stay.  We received a warm welcome, everyone on the team had such a lovely manner and made us feel very at ease.  The team were very accommodating with any request and always did their very best to assist.  Krisztina and team made the Royal London House a wonderful place to stay and I would really like to stay there again in the future.

Specifics:
Rooms – lovely decoration, spacious, good beds, great views from the upper floors, good TV, excellent heating/AC system (including underfloor!), good minibar, great bathrooms with Hermes toiletries.
Hotel – beautiful interior design in bar, reception, VIP lounge, and main bathrooms.
Fitness / Spa – did not use.
Food & Drink – lovely food at the bar, in the VIP lounge and breakfast at the rooftop restaurant.
Location – excellent location just a couple of mins’ walk from Liverpool Street.
Price – quite pricey but completely worth it for the hotel, location and service.
Staff – absolutely amazing, 5*+ !!

A big thank you to the whole team at the Montcalm Royal London House!",5,2018,02,07
111,My stay at Montcalm ,"A little bit about my recent stay at Montcalm.. 

All in all I had a great stay. Mostly down to one staff member in particular called Dacio. He understood that it was a special occasion as me and my girlfriend were celebrating her 21st! He went the extra mile and made sure that we had a memorable stay. Even Sinnitta in Guest experience was very accommodating and done as much as she could to also ensure I had a nice stay. 

There were a few bad points but because of the exceptional service given by the staff it didn't put me off my stay. 

The spa was something I was disappointed with. I called them a day in advance which I realise is late notice.. I booked 2:30 but when they prompted me for a time slot I said I was unsure as it is a surprise for my girlfriend and I'm not sure what she would want... the Spa said no problem just let us know when you get here. When we got to the Spa we were told that they needed notice to prepare certain treatments such as the Algae body wrap and the hot stone massage so all they could do was a facial or a massage.. this disappointed me as we had to settle for the plain old treatments. 

One more thing.. The aviary bar closed the outside bit at night which wasn't ideal as we had planned to spend the end of the night looking out over London. 

Luckily the room was amazing as was the service from staff. The LED lights in the room with iPhone connectivity was a big highlight. All in all it was a good stay and I would certainly book with you again. 

As for things to improve - For me one of the main attractions was the club lounge where you could get free drinks and snacks at a certain time... it was good but could do with some added spice... it doesn't look like a 'club lounge' rather just a regular bar. Add some lights or some signs I don't know that's up to you guys but thought I'd leave my piece! 

Thank you for the hospitality and send my regards to Dacio. 

Dan ",4,2018,02,06
111,Fantastic first time !!,"We recently stayed at the Montcalm royal London house and was blown away from the service ! 

Dragoslava really went above and beyond our expectations!

Outstanding service across the whole hotel from the spa, club lounge, bar and the aviary !

All staff was absolutely amazing and professional!

We was looked after from the first moment on arrival until we checked out!

Thank you so much for everything, we cannot wait to return 

Thank you again ",5,2018,02,05
111,"Great rooms, friendly staff, awesome free use of spa/gym and great rooftop bar!","We spent a night in this hotel on a Saturday night in early February. The hotel kindly put a bottle of prosecco in our room for only a small extra fee as it was my girlfriend's birthday. We were extremely happy with the room - clean, a good size and very comfy bed. The staff were excellent throughout and free access to the spa and gym was a great bonus. We'll definitely be staying here again - don't miss the rooftop bar either.",5,2018,02,05

111,Club room,"Great location in the city. 
Large spotless modern rooms. 
A lovely view from the roof top bar.
Special thanks to the guest experience team (Mandeep & Sinnitta) who went above and beyond making this stay Extra special. ",5,2018,02,03
111,Amazing roof terrace,"We have just stayed 1 night. Fab bed, linen and pillows. Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. Had a lovely evening sitting out on the roof terrace which had fantastic views. Only negative was the price of drinks but bearing in mind the location I guess that's to be expected. I would definitely stay again.",4,2018,02,03
111,Real good,"I was stay in the hotel for few nights during my business trip to London. Hotel is nice and clean, rooms could be bigger, but generally are ok. Staff is nice and friendly, check in and checkout were smooth.
There is rooftop bar, but they closing it quite early, so don’t expect long stay. 
Continental breakfast is tasty and served in nice wide room on ground floor. 
No big reason for complains. Last but not least location was super convenient for me.",5,2018,02,03
111,Superb room in ‘hip and happening’ Shoreditch!,"The rooms in this Montcalm are large & modern and the beds large & comfortable. Other niceties: all systems (light, airco) can be controlled on a small touchscreen, the coffee machine is from Nespresso and one can use the fully equipped fitness / gym. 

Sonia everything perfect? Perhaps the service could have been a bit better (I had to wait fo a relatively long time to checkout) and nicer (one of the porters didn’t seem to have a ‘client-oriented’ attitude. 

But all-in-all my favorite hotel in this part of the city and I will definitely be back!",5,2018,02,02
111,World Class Service and Style,"This is a truly fantastic hotel, the staff are superb, the rooms and facilities are beyond compare. Every detail is in place and the care shown by all who work here really delivers on the promise. I stayed here for business and used the first class spa facilities and the restaurant. Food is of the highest standard and I really look forward to returning soon.",5,2018,02,02
111,Incredible Hotel,"I have stayed in and around the Finsbury Square area for almost 10 years. I’ve tried a number of different hotels. This one is tops. Staff are friendly, rooms are quite spacious and the amenities are great. Even has a pool!  Definitely headed back here. A little pricey but if you work the websites and time your trip it’s probably in line with other luxury hotels. ",4,2018,02,02
111,"Nice room but facilities, service lack polish","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on business in late January in one of the “Club Montcalm” rooms on the basis that this would give me access to the club lounge. I found the hotel comfortable, and the bed is great, but the lounge is a little disappointing, and the services such as housekeeping a little poor. 

The lounge is just off reception and, unlike the bar at the front, lacks atmosphere in the evening with no attempt made to provide one and the evening snacks almost inedible. Cold prawns, spring rolls and chicken and some corn chips and popcorn represented the extent of the food on offer, and the selection of wine is cheap and nasty.

By contrast breakfast in the lounge is good and the service prompt. During my stay I had to ask twice for my room to be cleaned late in the afternoon despite having the “room clean” light lit outside my room all day.

The hotel has a gym and pool. I didn’t use the pool but it looked good, but the gym is tiny and equipment is too close together. You can’t have a workout if there are more than 3 or 4 people in there.

One definite benefit is that the hotel is very quiet. In my room I could barely hear any noise either outside the room or outside the hotel which is great. Location is useful for Liverpool Street station and Moorgate but if you want access to Oxford Street you may wish to stay further towards the West End.

Overall, it’s not a bad hotel but I was expecting better.",3,2018,02,02
111,Just one word:Excellent!,"Perfect location,great hospitality,comfortable,spacious and clean.
Such a superb cosy place!
All the staff was super friendly and helpful throughout the stay.
Special mention to Dado and Sinitta ,they did an amazing job and went over and above to make the day special for us. 
Couldn’t have been more sweet.
Serban just finished our getaway in the perfect way.
I can’t thank you enough but I can say I will be back!

111,Amazing Stay,"We have just come back from a 2 night stay here, and can only say that it was amazing. We were greeted with a glass of Champagne and check in was really smooth. We have been really happy with this hotel. The snacks in the afternoon and canapes were a really nice touch and the whole experience was really nice. 
The room was really tidy and clean. 

I couldn't find a criticism of this hotel",5,2018,01,29
111,"Room was great, disappointed with the service","First off, the hotel location and the room and amenities were wonderful. Very comfortable and spacious, especially for London! 

The staff at arrival were very friendly, although I realized the next day I didn’t get much info or the right info at least. On the first morning, I went to the breakfast area I was directed to when I checked in (across from reception). After I had made up my continental breakfast, the lady asked me for my room number and told me I could have went for a hot breakfast in the lounge on the 10th floor. But that was just a small issue, I knew better for the next morning!

My main issue with really disappointing customer service came after I had checked out. I left the hotel and realized after 90mins that I left my Bose earphones in the drawer of the night stand. Obviously, completely my fault! I hightailed it back to the hotel, and explained to the guy on reception exactly what I’d done and told him exactly where I left them, I advised I was 100% sure I had left them in the room as I only use them in the evening time in the room. I had asked if I could pop back and check the room, accompanied of course as I had checked out. He called housekeeping to see if the room had been cleaned and checked if anything had been found. He failed to advise them exactly where I had left them or any of the details I had given him. He told me the room was cleaned and nothing was found. He didn’t do any further follow up or check which I thought very strange given I had told him I was 100% sure. He wouldn’t let me pop up to check the room either, so I asked him to have the room rechecked and to call me as I had to go to the airport. 

I didn’t receive any call, so 3 hours later I called the hotel as I was concerned someone else might be checking into the room and it wouldn’t be possible to do a second check. When I called the hotel I got through to the same guy and he hadn’t arranged a second check. He apparently did so then when I called and advised me to call back within 5 mins. I did and the outcome was unsuccessful. Not expecting much, I called a week later and of course the same guy answered the phone again!! I asked if anything had shown up since, he didn’t check with house keeping or anyone, but advised straight away nothing was found. I asked if he needed to call someone to check to be sure. And he advised he would have heard if something was found, that may be the case but given my previous experience with the guy not following through I was skeptical!

I also emailed the customer care contact from the website, just to feedback the issue and my disappointment. I hadn’t requested a response from them but I didn’t receive one anyway!! 

So a beautiful hotel and very centrally located. Just don’t leave anything behind you as it will never be returned! Especially items that cost as much as the 2 night stay in the hotel!",3,2018,01,29
111,Lovely Get Away,"Staff was friendly and observant very kind.
Rooms were lovely comfortable. Loved the technology lighting etc was amazing.
Everything you needed was provided could of done with some Netflix but it was ok as you had sky etc.
Spa was lovely smaller than expected but very nice not overcrowded therefore peaceful and calm. The Restaurants were also very nice Aviary rooftop bar and the Bar at the front (forgotten the name). I would definately return was worth the money. Parkin is not as bad as it seemed as street parkin after 6.30pm was a flat fee til 12am n then free til 8.30am. However the carparks were ridiculous would defo say get a cab.",5,2018,01,29
111,Good Business Hotel for London City visitors,"Stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House for two nights. Location very good, near to Liverpool Station and Finsbury area.
Check-In very smoothly. Got an upgrade on the room which I very much appreciated. 
My room was very modern, very well equipped with rain shower. Bottle of mineral water for free.
Breakfast on the roof terrace. Excellent view over the roofs of London City. Good choice of food.
Overall very good hotel for Business trip to London City.",4,2018,01,27
111,Outstanding Service,"My wife and I stayed in the Montcalm on the 1st weekend of the year. It was a special weekend for us as it was her birthday and Orthodox Christmas on the Sunday.  We arrived and were immediately upgraded and had a beautiful chocolate surprise in the room wishing her a Happy Birthday. The room was fantastic, very modern, huge TV and the most comfortable bed I think I;ve ever slept in. All of the staff were extremely nice and helpful and made us feel very relaxed and welcome.  I asked if we could have breakfast in our room as a little treat and was completely blown away by the response. 2 large trays of delicious food and even had gluten free bread which was amazing. An ice bucket and lovely bottle of Prosecco. My wife was over the moon it was quite a spread and made our stay such an enjoyable and memorable one.  I would really like to thank the staff and management for their excellent service and will without doubt make it our hotel of choice when visiting Central London.  Thank you all.",5,2018,01,27
111,Amazing hotel great location,The hotel is lovely. It's based 4 minute walk from moorgate tube and 10 minutes from Liverpool Street. We stayed in a studio room that gave you access to the club lounge  and spa. The club lounge does a good continental breakfast and had drinks. The room was lovely and had lots of added extras. Bed was so big and comfy. Very clean and modern room. The staff in the hotel were faultless always wanting to help and so polite. Really good value for money given its location and quality of room. Definitely a 5 star. ,5,2018,01,27
111,Fantastic Hotel & Service,"In London on Business, this was not my first stay with Montcalm, but my first at the Royal London and it blew me away. The room was gorgeous and the service from Sinnitta Kinlan from start to finish was extra special, what a credit to the Montcalm brand. 

I booked a table at the Aviary Restaurant and have to say it exceeded my expectations, the atmosphere was great and the service and food were again top draw. You have to try one of there signature cocktails! Expensive? Yes, but well worth it. 

Unfortunately i didn't get to use the gym as I was out early but can't wait to see the rest of the facilities when i next stay. Have already recommended the Montcalm brand to several clients already and will continue to do so when they set the standard so high.",5,2018,01,25
111,City Business Trip,"Stayed here for two nights in Jan 18 whilst working in the City.  Excellent location, near to Moorgate Tube and surprisingly quiet.  Was upgared on arrival to a Club room - not sure what the difference was compared to a 'normal' room if I'm honest but that was a nice touch from a service perspective and got my stay off to a good start.  It was a very nice room - spacious, spotlessly clean and a huge comfortable bed.  bathroom was very clean and modern - lovely finish throughout.  The room faced the rear of the hotel so the view wasn't great, although it was nice and quiet.  If I was staying for pleasure rather than business, a nice view of the City might have been good.  The staff I encountered were all very professional, courteous and helpful.  Overall, an excellent hotel and I would be happy to stay there again.",5,2018,01,25
111,Fantastic throughout. Daisy and her team have surpassed expectations of any 5* hotel in London.,"In a city of many attractions, my fondest memory of my time in London was the fantastic service received from Daisy and her team. I have been fortunate to stay in numerous 5* hotels in London and without a doubt, my time at the Montcalm Royal London house was the best. The spa and club lounge are fantastic additions to the hotel and offer a huge advantage to any guest choosing this hotel over another of London's several options. Needless to say, I will be staying at the RLH for all future business trips in London.",5,2018,01,25
111,Husbands special birthday,Fabulous treatment from Sinnitta Kinlan Guest experience with access to Club Lounge.  The stay was amazing making my husband's birthday and cancer milestone extra special.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2018,01,24
111,Wonderful Stay Again.,"This hotel never disappoints,
 I always booked direct with the hotel, the extras are amazing. Access to the Club Lounge alone is a fantastic treat. We also get a continental breakfast included in the price, our room this time was 806 it had wonderful views over London & Finsbury square, The staff are amazing from the lovely doorman to the house keepers they all have a huge smile for you, you can feel the happy working relationship through out. The Avery roof top bar and restaurant  is a must, not quite the same on a cold rainy January evening, but it’s still a must. I’ve still to visit the spa area, I’m hoping next time my schedule will be a more relaxed and I can do so. Well Done Team Montcalm you’re  all fantastic.",5,2018,01,22
111,Very welcoming and relaxing,My partner and I were originally booked to stay at the City Suites however on arrival we were pleased (and surprised) to be told that we had been upgraded to the Montcalm Royal London House.  We were transported to the hotel and again pleased (and surprised) to learn that we had been allocated a Club Room with breakfast included.  The hotel was fantastic and the staff were brilliant in looking after us.  The terrace bar is a must to visit to see the views.  We would both recommend this hotel to others and hope to return in the very near future.  A special thank you goes to the young lady in the Club Lounge for looking after us so well.,5,2018,01,22
111,Amazing Value,"Had a perfect stay here while visiting London for my girlfriend’s 30th. Montcalm’s guest experience team contacted me before the stay and asked why we were in town and whether they could do anything to help with our stay.

For a small fee they put petals on the bed but on top of this when we arrived they had upgraded our room and organised a complimentary dessert that was waiting for us on arrival. The club lounge access gives a free continental breakfast which was really good with decent coffee.

Unbeatable in London for the price.",5,2018,01,21
111,An very enjoyable stay again!,"My wife and I visited last Sunday and Monday.  As per our previous experience the room, spa, club lounge and most importantly staff were fabulous! 
We were particularly impressed when Sinnitta who was walking through the clubroom got my wife a latte, rather than ask someone who was working in that area to do so.  She also enquired as to the specific strength of coffee that my wife enjoys.  The next morning when she noticed us going into the club lounge she specifically came through and asked my wife if she would like her latte done the same way.  This may seem like a small thing, however these are the things that stand out when deciding where to return on our next trip to London.  We were also very impressed with Nicoleta, who was very friendly and efficient.  She like Sinnitta has a very obvious desire to offer an excellent customer experience!",5,2018,01,21
111,A beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel. Everyone was so helpful and friendly too. 
I paid for bed and breakfast and I  could enjoy snacks though out the day. The rooms are clean and very good. Breakfast was very good too. We enjoyed our stay.",5,2018,01,20
111,thank you MRLH,"very comfortable experience. very polite staff, very good service at the hotel. on the other hand, regarding the restaurant on the top floor, the Aviary, my impressions are not so good. i didnt feel the place. great decoration but, something was wrong. maybe it was the days, maybe they were crowded, i can not tell. service was a bit slow and the most important, in the Aviary  I felt that they wouldnt care if i was guest of the Montcalm hotel or not. i noticed selective smiles at the reception. in terms if the hotel and our stay stay there only the best memories. thank you very much for such a good hospitality Montalm Royal House.",4,2018,01,19
111,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel is beautiful. The staff are really friendly and attentive. We was upgraded when we arrived and our room was massive and the bed was so comfortable! The shower was amazing. 
I will definitely return. ",5,2018,01,19
111,Outstanding,"This was my second stay at Montcalm Royal London and it was as fantastic as the first. 

The hotel is wonderful, the location is excellent and the staff are above and beyond brilliant.

Being no more than a 10 minute walk from London Liverpool St station it amazes me how quiet the rooms are. You hear absolutely no noise from the outside world and nothing from other rooms.

This time I was placed on the 8th floor in a room overlooking the square. The room had floor to ceiling windows which gave a great view of the square itself and also of the London skyline, the Walkie-Talking, SushiSamba,and the Shard included. The rooms are incredibly relaxing and comfortable, they aren't just a place to rest your head for a night or two. It's like staying at a friend's house where you can just take a day to chill out without going out.

The staff are beyond friendly and I can not thank Sinnita and her team more for the fantastic welcome and departure we recieved. Sinnita always seems to go the extra mile to make sure a stay is as perfect as possible. She made sure to make herself available if needed, to the point of letting us know what time she finished work and began the next day. Any requests were dealt with immediately, regardless of the urgency.

Small things such as remembering your name the next day at check out, offering non-alcoholic alternatives to complimentary drinks, service with a genunine smile, these are what make the Montcalm hotels so special.

The Royal London lives up to the reputation of the Montcalm group and is a very welcomed addition.",5,2018,01,19
111,Amazing costumer service,"Me and my boyfriend visited the Spa and the Bar on the roof top earlier this year. We were impressed by everything there. Upon our arrival we were welcomed by the lovely receptionist Gabby who not only showed us everything around but also accompanied us to the spa to make sure everything is sorted for us. I had an algie massage while my boyfriend was enjoying himself in the pool. The spa was very clean with a nice atmosphere. After that we went to have a drink in the Aviary and this time Savia accompanied us to the bar where  we found out she has booked us a table beforehand. 
Overall we were exceptionally satisfied with everything. Thank you Montcalm, we will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,18
111,MUST stay if in London!!,"We had the most wonderful stay at the Montcalm Royal London House and we would most definitely stay again. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, especially at the front desk. We were very grateful for our room upgrade and the brownies once we were in our room. It really made the weekend and my partners birthday special. The champagne upon arrival was also a surprising but wonderful addition, we both mentioned that we had never had that when checking in at a hotel before!",5,2018,01,17
111,Hidden Gem,"This is with out-doubt my favorite hotel in London. We stayed here at the weekend while visiting a live music club in the centre of town. The location is brilliant and just a short 4 minute walk to Moorgate tube station. The hotel is luxurious and has the most amazing roof top terrace. All the staff we met during our visit were wonderful, professional, friendly and made us feel so welcome. This is a quality five star hotel that offers five star service right through from check in to departure. I will be using the Montcalm Royal London house again for business and leisure. Easy parking opposite the hotel and they have a great spa in the basement. A special thank you to the night team who helped up with our room key on Saturday night, also thanks to the door man and the gentleman who checked us out on Sunday morning.. I would highly recommend.",5,2018,01,16
111,Superb,Had a 2 night stay in January 2018. Everything was top notch from start to finish. Hotel even supplied our favourite kind of Nespresso capsules allowing us to enjoy our weekend ritual of coffee in bed before the start of of each day.  We ordered room service breakfast and it arrived exactly on time as well. I couldn't fault the hotel and would thoroughly recommend it.,5,2018,01,14
111,Birthday weekend ,"What an absolutely amazing stay! This hotel was beautiful and from the second I arrived I felt like a vip. I booked a weekend of surprises for my partner, and upon liaising with the experience team prior to my arrival, Sinnitta went above and beyond to make the stay as special as possible! Thank you so much. We were upgraded to the club room, which had lovely mood lighting, power rainfall shower, heated tiles, coffee machine, super comfy bed, smart tv... and access to the club lounge!!! This was the best! We had 24 hour canapés and  drinks (Alc/non-alc)... well worth it! And she even arranged a birthday treat to be brought up to our room!!!! A very pretty tray with a happy birthday message and brownies! My partner was thrilled! 
We loved the breakfast view and the bars are awesome! I was given prosecco on arrival and even refilled when I said it was lovely... the staff were unreal.
I’m gutted I had to leave today, I cannot wait to return, even if for a relaxing stay on my own or with my partner. Probably my favourite hotel in London I’ve used. 10/10 from me and my partner!!! Faultless. Thank you! Is it time to return yet?? 
Sarah ",5,2018,01,14
111,Perfectly Pleasant,"Stayed for two nights in January, staff are polite and courteous, Carl in the ground floor bar was especially helpful.
Room was big, modern and all facilities were as described. Good location for exploring the city.",5,2018,01,14
111,Amazing service from Maitre D' Olivier!,"A great stay from check-in to check-out. Upon arrival we were welcomed back as returning guests (our second stay here). Check-in was ultra smooth and the glass of Prosecco upon arrival a great touch to start our Friday afternoon! A quick walk to Bishopsgate to The Botanist (owned by ETM group too) for a late lunch (spicy chicken burger was amazing) and then an awesome evening at the Royal Albert Hall to watch Cirque De Soleil (only 30mins on the circle line). Saturday morning at breakfast Olivier remembered us from our previous stay in July 2017 and he was a tremendous credit to Montcalm Royal London House. He took time to chat, made us feel extremely welcome and the efficient but relaxed breakfast service was exceptional. Definitely our go to Hotel now for London. Will be back soon for shuffleboard and ""Busy Bee cocktails soon as well as wanting to try the new Long Arm Pub with its own brewery onsite!! On top of that an invitation to the Montcalm Club loyalty programme was greatly received. Top service, top location, top stay.",5,2018,01,13
111,Fabulous on all points,"Fabulous experience and I highlight of my business trip to London.  From Jessica’s first greeting (and continued friendliness and Professionalism) to the facilities, breakfast staff, cleanliness, and overall experience, again, just fabulous.",5,2018,01,12
111,Dissapointing,"Went to stay at the Montcalm just after xmas as mine and my husbands annual stay in London.
I cannot fault the actual hotel and the staff, the hotel itself is absolutely amazing, however we had been given an upgrade to a room that was huge, it was cold and we had to keep the heating on all night, the TV did not work properly the sound for Sky TV kept going on and off.
The bathroom floor was freezing.
Great for meetings but not as a Couples room 

however I cannot fault the bar on top floor the Aviary  which was amazing !

Overall I would not recommend this Hotel unfortunately.",3,2018,01,10
111,Company Conference 2017,"We held a company conference here in 2017 and it worked very well for us.  The rooms were lovely: extremely comfortable, quite high tech and spotless.  There is a lovely coffee shop on the ground floor with great service, good coffee and very tasty light bites.  Superb rooftop bar and restaurant with great views.  Good location. Generally good service throughout the hotel.  The conference facilities were good although the room layout wasn't ideal for our numbers.  Nevertheless everyone had a great time and it will be remembered.  Would stay again for a person visit (and indeed have already done so)",5,2018,01,09
111,Highly recommended!!!,"
My partner and I recently celebrated our Anniversary at The Montcalm Royal London. I'm Delighted to say it was an amazing occasion, the hotel was beautiful the room  and the room was brilliant.The help from the staff  was five star, they went above and beyond to especially from a staff member called Lilly who made our stay ten times better, making us feel at home, helping us to locate a set of earrings that my partner had thought she'd lost. Nothing was to much trouble for to go out of her way to make our stay even more memorable. We will definitely be back and would highly recommend anyone to stay here.

",5,2018,01,08
111,Superb team performance,"I stayed with my daugther for 3 nights at the hotel during our sightseeing trip. The team is very friendly with a very high and fast customer attendance. Rooms are very comfortable, silent and clean. Internet is very fast!! Would always come back.",5,2018,01,08
111,Absolutely Perfect!,"Absolutely blown away by the level of customer centric service provided by this hotel. They made sure our stay was memorable and did so with flying colours! Dado went above and beyond to ensure we had the best stay possible.

The room (Club Double) was very clean, very spacious and had luxury extras such as mood lighting, Sky TV and fruit on arrival. I will DEFINITELY be using this hotel again and will highly recommend them to all. Thank you",5,2018,01,08
111,stayed twice in 1 month.,"I have to first and foremost apologize for the delay in this review, its a long one and I just havent had the time to do it.

I stayed here at the beginning of oct 2017- it was my partners surprise 30th birthday and we stayed here for 2 nights.
I had emailed the hotel prior and had asked for a room with a bath, upon checking in (with a glass of bubbly on arrival), I found my room didnt have a bath and when questioned, they said they didnt have 1 available. Ok, I thought, the room was a nice size non the less and the bathroom was spacious. Nice smart TV in the bedroom.

Staff kept knocking and interrupting our stay though which we didnt appreciate, 1 to deliver the bubbly as they forgot when we checked in.
1 to check the minibar?? (20mins after we checked in, we hadnt even noticed where it was as yet), 
and another to check if we wanted a turn down service (it was 5pm)
could 1 person not do this all? I appreciate the bubbly being delivered and human error happened and they forgot to bring it originally but the mini bar stock check and the 5pm turndown service wasnt needed.

We didnt spend much time in the room as was out celebrating my Mr's birthday but the staff were pleasant.
Breakfast in the aviary was expensive and not good in the slightest. 1 slice of toast with half and Advacado was £9.95.
The hotel should of made it clear that the aviary is a separate entity to them as it did tarnish our stay a bit. 
I had asked about the cooked breakfast option for £24.95 but there was no veggie alternatives, No hash browns or veggie sausages. 
So for £24.95, Eggs and beans on toast was extremely expensive.
So the next morning we went out for breakfast as it was a lot cheaper to eat out.

we checked out after our 2 nights, was given a voucher for the parking machine which didnt work and spent 45mins waiting for NCP to arrive who said the hotel are issuing out old vouchers hence why it wasnt working. finally got it sorted and we headed for home.

So these 2 nights were fine, but werent spectacular and we didnt receive the finesse or service typically given by the Montcalm.

So onto my next stay, the weekend after.
It was for 1 night with my mum, we were celebrating her birthday and had a spa package included with a massage and a glass of bubbly.

I had emailed the hotel again prior and had insisted a room with a bath this time (I only have a shower at home so when away, I like to have a soak in a bath)

Upon checking in we were told the room wasnt ready, and we would have to wait for another 20mins if we wanted a room with a bath and we agreed to wait, once we finally got in the room i saw we had a bath (yay). 
They also left these beautiful macaroons and half a bottle of wine. 

We had a club room- The room wasnt as big as my last room but I didnt mind as I had a bath but the lighting where the floor length mirror was, was shocking! it was so dim, it was like getting ready in the dark!

The spa was great, thoroughly enjoyed it, massages were fab!!

Me and mum visited the club lounge for drinks and canapes- this was excellent!
beautiful appetizers and canapes (satay chicken, nachos, sweet chilli king prawns)
and the drinks selection was fab (Grey Goose, Prosecco, Courvoisier, Beer, JD, Martini plus others.
 
We then headed out for dinner and drinks, and got back for around 10.30pm.

Now this is when it all started, I thought I would relax in my bath with a last drink before bedtime......
BUT there was no bath plug! I thought it was a joke and started searching, yet no bath plug found!
An hour and a half later which included 5 phone calls to reception, 4 visits from staff, 2 glasses of complementary champagne I finally got my bath at around 12.30am!!!!
The bath plug had disappeared and housekeeping didnt notice it, the staff found 1 that didnt fit and so another member of staff drove to a sister hotel to find one. Im not sure how this got missed, I waited extra for a room to make sure I had a bath.
It was a complete joke, no one was calling me back so I was constantly calling reception to find out what was going on and I was just getting more wound up.

Anyway I finally had my bath and retired to bed around 2am exhausted by it all!

The next morning, we didnt have breakfast in the hotel as it was too expensive and was limited so had it elsewhere.

We packed and went to check out, the lovely girl on the front desk (cant remember her name sorry)  had asked if everything was ok with the stay? I laughed and said no not really and she replied, oh yes, I can see you had some issues last night. 
She asked if we could give her 1 moment and we did, she went and spoke to the hotel manager who came and greeted me personally, and apologized sincerely and asked if we were in a rush to go. We said no, He then insisted we stayed for lunch in the aviary and we took him up on his kind offer.

Our luggage was whisked away to be safely stored and we went up to the Aviary where he said to the staff,
""let this ladies lunch on me, anything they want, food, drink, its all on me""
Well, what a kind offer! And wow did we have an amazing lunch!
Oysters for starters, Sunday lunch (the best sunday lunch weve had) and then we proceeded out to the roof top terrace for desert and to finish our bottle of wine and cocktails. 
The staff in the Aviary were fab and told us not to worry about what to order and order what we want.

I cant remember the name of the hotel manager (apologize) but wow, what a way to turn an experience and stay around.
When we were leaving, 1 of the ladies (tall, slim with Blond hair, Eastern European accent possibly) hugged my mum and got her a box of the Macaroons she loved with a Montcalm Umbrella
(I have 1 from a previous stay and my mum has always had her eye on it)
Special Hello to this lady as my mum loved her!

Well, we left extremely happy and couldn't fault the way our issues were rectified.

Me and my mum have stayed at the Montcalm Shoreditch and The Brewery and always had good service there so had really high expectations for this one, so was quite disappointed when these problems happened but what a turnaround!

I am happy to leave this review as 5*  

The Montcalm Chain is still our favorite hotel chain and we are looking to book the Marble Arch Branch soon to complete the 4/4 locations.  

My mum still talks about this stay now and compares every hotel we stay in to the Montcalm (""No hotel chain is better than the Montcalm"")

Well done Montcalm!!!!!! 

Look forward to staying in Marble Arch.....",5,2018,01,08
111,Wonderful customer service and great hotel,"We had a truly wonderful experience staying at the Montcalm this weekend. We had stayed in December and had such a good experience that we decided to book it for a night out for our brother's birthday. We all felt extremely welcomed and my brother and sister in law were made to feel very special for their birthday. The customer service is some of the best we have received in our stays at other hotels in London and around the world. The rooms are of a great standard and the beds extremely comfortable. We also think it's a great idea to have the mobile in the room for overseas visitors.

We will definitely stay again and will recommend the Montcalm to our friends.",5,2018,01,07
111,"Great, as usual","We stayed for a pre-Christmas long weekend and found the hotel to be a very good standard. Our room was cleaner than on previous occasions and the beds here are very comfortable. The complicated in-room electronics are still a little baffling, but we managed.

We had a lunch in the rooftop restaurant and ate breakfast twice. The food was of a very high standard, except a rogue hair in the Eggs Benedict that the wait staff fixed quickly.

The front of house staff are very good at this hotel. My only observation was that one of the senior restaurant managers was extremely rude to his staff, although not to the guests. It's a wonder any of them put up with it, based on what we saw.

All said, we'll definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,01,07
111,"Rooms not as advertised, descriptions are wrong","The hotel is modern and stylish and very upscale.  However it was very disappointing that the room we booked (Montcalm Club Double) was described incorrectly on the hotel website. I chose to stay at the Montcalm specifically because of the advertised size of the room - at approx 32 sq meters - but when we checked in the room we were given was much smaller -- around 22 sq meters. Not only that, but the room that we were initially given was also dirty with several pieces of trash (including a champagne cork and wrapping). 

When I raised this with the duty manager she quizzed me about where I had seen 32 sq meters and insisted it could not have been on the hotel website, until I found it on the hotel website and showed it to her. She did find me a ""suite"" instead (this was a room approx the size I booked with a sofa) but the entire episode was frustrating and disappointing, particularly as more than one week later the hotel website is still misleading customers with the incorrect room size listed. 

They did comp us breakfast for our trouble but neither of us were very hungry as we were suffering from jet lag.  The buffet breakfast in the roof top restaurant looked to be very good, with a wide range of food offerings, if only we'd been hungry.

The new room was fine, except we had many problems with the technology - heating and lights were all controlled by a tablet. The tablet didn't work and we had to get the technician to reset it. Even later it was very slow and frequently not responsive. I would have much preferred a regular switch to quickly put on the bathroom lights or adjust the heating! The tv volume also did not work, although the remote worked for changing channel. 

And sadly, the spa experience was also a let down, although the spa itself was beautiful (if a little small). We arrived and signed in and filled out a waiver, then were handed a towel. Every guest to arrive subsequently was shown all the facilities, and given a robe and flip flops. We felt like second class citizens. Once I'd found the changing room myself and changed into my swimsuit I came out to find the Jacuzzi out of service! Why weren't we told this when we arrived at the spa? The staff member we asked about it seemed unable to tell us what was wrong (it appeared to be warm and working) or when it would be fixed. This seemed to be a language issue.
But what really disappointed me, was the lack of response when I replied to an email I received after our stay asking for feedback.  I don't usually respond to those messages but I took the time to send a detailed email outlining my feedback (as well as complimenting them on the lounge, more on that in a minute) but I did not even receive an acknowledgement.

Finally, if you are not mislead on room size and have low expectations of the spa service, it is definitely worth booking one of the club lounge rooms.  The lounge was the best part of our stay.  Very relaxing and great service, complimentary tea and coffee during the day, breakfast and evening snacks, plus cocktails and beer and wine.  It was a very nice perk and well run.",3,2018,01,05
111,Loved my stay here!,"Business took me to London where I was booked a the Montcalm.. The staff was friendly and courteous. Each time she saw me Claudia greeted me by name and asked if there was anything she might help me with. Excellent personal touch and service. 
A friend visited me and she dubbed the closet with kettle, tea and coffee ""the magic cupboard"" because it held so much goodness.
Overall the hotel was nicely decorated and very comfortable. Would definitely stay there again!",5,2018,01,05
111,Fantastic,"I recently stayed here with my girlfriend, whilst sightseeing in London. Our stay was fantastic, and I was extremely happy with all the efforts put in by members of staff to make sure we had the best experience possible.

I couldn’t recommend the Montcalm Royal London House enough, and the 8th floor room was brilliant.

You will most certainly be getting repeat custom from myself and people I know.",5,2018,01,05
111,Happy New Year,Stayed overnight on New Years Eve. Hotel excellent. Efficient and quick check in with complimentary glass of bubbly. Very friendly and helpful staff. Room beautiful and clean. Celebration evening meal was very nice and the Restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere. Would highly recommend this Hotel,5,2018,01,01
111,A Good Overnight Stop,When in London for business I am always looking for convenience. You are only using the room for a few hours to sleep and shower so the quality of these are critical. All work for me with the added bonus at this hotel of a breakfast room with excellent views of the City and its constant redevelopment. Breakfast is good too.,4,2017,12,31
111,"Great facilities, below average service","My wife and I stayed at the Montcalm Royal on a Friday evening in December to celebrate a birthday. This hotel should have received a 4 star rating from us due to the long list of pros below however their customer service really let them down and so I have only been able to offer 3.

Pros:

- Great room facilities including a good view of the City, large TV screen, mood lighting, Nespresso machine and stylish furnishings
- Great location which is just a 5 min walk to Liverpool St Station or a 15 min walk to St Paul's with a good selection of trendy shops and restaurants
- Excellent parking. There is an NCP directly opposite that charges £55 for 24 hours but hotel guests receive 50% off. Simply ask at reception when checking out
- 'Club perks' - if you book a club room at a small additional cost to the double you get access to a lounge area that offers a free continental breakfast plus snacks and drinks (alcoholic and non) throughout the afternoon. I highly recommend this as it is a great standard and excellent value

Cons

- Below average service:

- No doorman on arrival and therefore no greeting. A small issue but first impressions count
- We were offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival. This was pre poured and left on the side so was served warm. When I informed the waitress she said there was nothing she could do about it
- We arrived slightly earlier that official check in and as the room wasn't ready we were told to wait in the club lounge. The receptionist said that she would come over when the room was ready but nobody did for over 40 mins. As a queue had formed at the desk I asked a club lounge host to check for me and he said it was nothing to do with him and I needed to go back to the desk. This was quite shocking. 
- We informed the hotel that we were celebrating a birthday and had previously read other reviews that said they arranged a complimentary cake, bottle of bubbly or room upgrade. We didn't receive any of this, instead received a generic welcome card addressed incorrectly. We naturally felt disappointed as a result.
- We ordered room service in the late evening but one of the dishes arrived luke warm and was clearly a microwave meal. At £16 plus £5 tray this was simply unacceptable so we returned it and asked for it to be removed from the bill. On check out they still attempted to charge for this

111,"Lovely hotel, spoilt by poor maintenance, in a suite as well !! ","This is our second visit to the Royal London House, both over the Christmas period, the service is impeccable and hotel have really tried to add that luxury touch. We are a family of four and enjoy 5* hotels all over the world, however on this occasion we have been a little let down. We booked a family suite (£350 gbp a night) and first night had the toilet constantly filling up, which was annoying and we had a pretty uncomfortable nights sleep, I called maintenance on the second day, they came promptly and “fixed it”, but it wasn’t fixed at all, time to call them again, it was the same issue, same message they miraculously”fixed it” again, day three....... guess what :-( came back after a long day to the broken toilet, called maintenance, this time they couldn’t fix it, and on our last night offered to move us, I think we will just stick where we are, grin and bear it, and try another hotel chain next year! 

I will end by saying , everything else but this, was very good, but disappointed the hotel let us down.

",2,2017,12,29
111,Fantastic!,"After a great stay at the Montcalm in Shoreditch in the summer, I decided to try I out the new Royal London House 

Booked a quad room for my wife and 2 girls, which consisted of 2 inter connecting doubles /twins which came with complimentary access to the club lounge giving us continental breakfast, canopies until 2030 and drinks (prosecco, estrella white and red wine) 1730 -2300 

Rooms were fantastic as usual 

Ate in the 10th floor Aviary restaurant upstairs which was v good and enjoyed a great cocktail after dinner.

Hotel also has a nice roof top terrace which looked good, but we’ll save that for when it gets a bit warmer!

Thought this hotel was better than the Shoreditch hotel based on the roof terrace and sky bar.

Looking forward to returning 10/10

",5,2017,12,29
111,nice stay for a different part of the city.,"As we wanted to be near Liverpool station so to hop a train to Stansted Airport, we selected the Montcalm Royal to stay.  It was a good choice and an interesting section of London to start a walk.
The hotel and room design is very modern with multiple lighting scenarios within the room.  Things got a bit too high tech when the panel that controls heating, lighting, and other elements froze up.  We mentioned it to the front desk as we went for a walk and everything was reset and room tidied by the time we returned.  Very nice people working there.
We would return.",4,2017,12,27
111,Good ,"This is the second time me and my partner have stayed here, overall the hotel is very nice, the rooms are nice however I don’t see the difference in rooms when you upgrade, they look and are designed exactly the same. Hotel staff are friendly, we enjoyed the breakfast. We also booked a meal in the restaurant upstairs however with it being Christmas time there was a set Christmas menu and lots on Christmas parties happen so you couldn’t hear the waiters or the person you with with, if you like that kind of atmosphere that’s fine but it wasn’t for us.",4,2017,12,24
111,Awesome! ,"We stayed in the Montcalm to celebrate our second anniversary recently and had a fantastic time! Our room was lovely and we were so touched by the complimentary prosecco and macaroons that were added once the staff knew we were staying for a special occasion. The club lounge and it’s food and drink was excellent and the pool and spa area was fab, just wished we could have stayed longer to make full use of it. Every member of staff we spoke to were super friendly and professional and made us feel very welcome. Keep up the good work as we’ll definitely be back! ",5,2017,12,24
111,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"I have stayed here several times and back tomorrow for 3 days. 
I cannot fault the hotel. Its club rooms are big, very comfortable and I love the bathroom and makeup mirror. Water and fruit in the room is a lovely addition. 
The staff (from the concierge, waiting, restaurant) especially front of house are excellent, professional, friendly and always smiling. Love the Aviary rooftop restaurant and bar and the club lounge. 
It’s my favourite London hotel. 
Nothing too much trouble and treated as an individual not a number. 
See you soon! ",5,2017,12,24
111,Great option in the City of London,"Just spent two weeks at the Montcalm Royal London House. It was a great experience. This hotel is perfectly located if you have business to attend to in the financial district, otherwise it is a little off the main tourist attractions (though it is close to several subway stations) and the area is generally very quiet during the weekend. I understand the hotel is fairly new so everything works well. The rooms and bath are large for Europe and well appointed, the bed is perfect for a good night sleep. One drawback is that there aren't many options for dinner at the hotel, I ended up ordering room service, the food was decent but not great. Overall, a very pleasant stay and the price was reasonable, compared to similar options in the area. I would definitely go back.",5,2017,12,23
111,Fantastic meal and setting,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel.  The service was outstanding. Fantastic view from the 9th floor suite. We especially like the igloo pod which allowed us to sit outside and enjoy the view.
The general manager was very professional and helpful 😄.
Outstanding service and professionalism 👍🏼",5,2017,12,23
111,Fantastic hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel several times and have always been so impressed, the staff are very friendly and the hotel facilities are excellent. Would highly recommend for either a business or personal stay, also in a great location.",5,2017,12,22
111,Update: Excellent response to poor experience,"I had previously left a review for a stay in August which left me with a very poor impression of this hotel (TripAdvisor deleted it when I submitted a request to edit it....).

Since leaving that review hotel management have been in contact with me directly and have gone above and beyond to ensure me that they took on-board and actioned the feedback I provided and have put in place necessary measures to avoid these issues in the future. I feel the attention given to this issue was sincere and coming from a place of wanting to improve the hotels' performance.

With this in mind, I have chosen to update my review and rating. I will be staying at the hotel again in the new year and plan to expand on my review once this stay is completed.",4,2017,12,21
111,Great stay...,"This was our first time staying at a Montcalm hotel and it did not disappoint. Even before we arrived we received an email asking was there anything that could be done for us prior to arrival. I said that we were celebrating and on our arrival we were upgraded to a suite with a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us. Great start.

A good location on Finsbury Square, close enough for everything we needed but also a good base for anyone wanting to stay in London and not be in the bustle of the West End; tube stations are plentiful in this area and you can be in the West End within minutes.

The room itself was clean and modern, large TV with all the Sky channels, a wide variety of lighting options from normal, to small night lights at skirting level on the walls, to different colours! Bed was big and extremely comfortable, bathroom well equipped with a generous sized shower and under floor heating. The only negative I would point out that the electronic control panel over complicated the heating for the room and we could not get the room warmer...

A lot of the reviews mention the Aviry and this is a real asset to the hotel. We went up for drinks in the evening and also had breakfast there in the morning; both times the view was spectacular. Breakfast was on the pricey side (you are in central London after all...) but plentiful and good quality. In the evening the bar was quite busy, but it was a couple of weeks before Christmas yet we were still able to find seats and be served promptly.

We also visited the spa, but did not have any treatments. I would echo some comments on here that the spa itself is fairly small and by the time we left people were waiting for loungers to be come available. But we enjoyed the time we spent in there and felt relaxed afterwards.

The whole feel of the hotel is modern and to a high standard, from the decor in the rooms and lobby to the bars and restaurants. I must also mention the service from every staff member we came across, not only could they not do enough for you but it felt genuine, which is not always the case in other hotels.

Sometimes when you spend a bit more on a hotel you come away feeling a little let down or that you did not get value for money. This is definitely not the case here. We loved our stay, would gladly come back and recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,12,21
111,Good but not breakfast ,"A lovely hotel with great staff and vacillates.
Location ok but a mile from everywhere 
The breakfast was very poor for the £25 you had to pay. A buffet style were the hot food was empty most of the time , the restaurant wasn’t owned by the hotel so don’t bother complaining because they only pass the buck 
Not a great 5 star but a very good 4 star ",4,2017,12,19
111,Comfortable business hotel,"The rooms are well equipped.  Bed is very comfortable
Service is pleasant and professional
The only drawback is that I had issues with the tablet that controls the air condition.  They fixed it and then it didn't work again.  In the end they turned the air condition on from the outside and the room was too hot until I had to call at 3 am to stop it.  No compensation was offered",4,2017,12,19
111,Fantastic Hotel,"Don’t know where to start. From the moment when you arrive, and greeted with lovely staff, a glass of champagne, to an excellent, quick and efficient check in, the hotel impresses. Great location a few minutes walk from Moorgate tube station, the hotel offers everything you need.
The room is immaculate, well decorated and offers everything anyone needs, making you ready to hit the town.
Would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,18
111,"Outstanding, lovely rooms, great venue, superb service","I had my first stay here during a busy week of Christmas events. Faultless from the off, a courtesy email after booking to check if anything special was needed, a handsome venue, a warm and helpful welcome. The room was lovely, and the facilities in the hotel (including the three excellent bar/restaurants) ending with a fun evening in the well stocked and well staffed rooftop Aviary bar. Even the price was reasonable for something that was, admittedly, a bit more special than usual. I'll be going back definitely, thank you Montcalm!",5,2017,12,18
111,Disappointed ,"I stay here when visiting London because my company has a “deal” with the hotel. This is my fifth visit and consistently this hotel under perform given its rating. 

It’s a very disappointing place to stay. Yes the rooms are ok, and the bar/ restaurant is ok as well.

What really lets this place down is the service. Rooms do not get cleaned thoroughly and as an example today, still not made up by 1600. Really? 

Room electronics and TV controls overly complicated as well. 

Looking forward to my company deal migrating to another hotel, indeed will push for this. Had enough. ",1,2017,12,18
111,Great Stay.... again,"Stay here almost every 4 - 6 weeks. Great hotel and staff. Service excellent. This month, special shout out to the Manager and team in the Burdock bar. Despite being extremely busy with all the Christmas gatherings, they still made us feel like special guests.",5,2017,12,16
111,Excellent hotel for business and/or pleasure!,"Having been at the Montcalm at the Brewery hotel a couple of times, I had to try out the new Royal House Montcalm. And I was not disappointed. This is a wonderful luxury hotel, with comfortable rooms, friendly and helpful staff and great surroundings. 
Conveniently located towards the City and the hip Shoreditch area. 
Highly recommended!",5,2017,12,15
111,Honeymoon spoiled because of a terrible SPA,"When you go on a honeymoon and you decide to dish out a lot of money for 5 star hotel (because you don't do honeymoons every year, right?), you except everything to be perfect. I really wish this was the case...

Unfortunately, I had my honeymoon spoiled. The room wasn't bad, don't get me wrong - although I wouldn't say it matched the price and 5 star rating by any means. I would, however, overlook this, especially given the location, which was perfect. However, I would expect that the SPA in a 5 star hotel would match that and that certainly wasn't the case.

Where do I start with this... The SPA wasn't really clean and was overcrowded. I hoped to have a relaxing time where I'd be able to calm down and just enjoy the moment - but how can you do that when everyone is so darn loud and talking selfies right and left? And it seems to be fine with SPAs management. They didn't even have enough free lockers so I could leave my stuff without going back to my room.

Overall, the honeymoon stay here wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't for all of this. But if you want a luxury stay in London and are looking for high quality accommodation that would include great facilities - avoid this by all means!",1,2017,12,14
111,Completely underestimated,"I stayed in this wonderful hotel last weekend, and although slightly hesitant at first, this will definitely be my go-to hotel in future.

A deluxe double room cost me approx €180 for a Friday night. Compared to other 5 star hotels, this was incredible value (hence my slight hesitation, I wondered was there a reason as to why it was significantly cheaper). 

I arrived at the hotel 3 hours prior to check-in time, and was eager to avail of an early check-in. Unfortunately the room was not ready, so I enjoyed a coffee on the rooftop (beautiful views), and went back downstairs and waited in the lobby.

Two hours later, the receptionist informed me that my room was ready and told me that they had upgraded me to a Junior Suite - incredibly sound! I checked in to room 310 and what can I say - it was perfect. Very large room, mood lighting, the bathroom was immaculate and the shower was huge. 

I would like to thank the hotel for their wonderful hospitality. From the smiley concierge, to the receptionists, to the waiters and waitresses - you were all exceptionally friendly and welcoming.

In terms of location, Liverpool Street station is merely a 6/7 minute walk from the hotel. I would recommend taking two stops to St Pauls district where there are lovely bars and restaurants - including the First Dates restaurant.",5,2017,12,13
111,Wonderful Birthday Visit,"I booked a stay here for my boyfriends Birthday and we had a magical stay. He was very happy with all that was planned. Everything worked out perfectly, the hotel staff created a distraction to enable me to pay for the hotel without his knowledge the champagne upon arrival was such a nice touch. 

The hotel has been decorated for Christmas in such a beautiful way.The Birthday package in the hotel room was worth the extra money, we both couldn’t be happier with what was received. Balloons, chocolates, fruit, champagne, it was fantastic. This hotel is on the expensive side but worth it for a special occasion. A stunning hotel and we will be sure to visit again. All the staff were very friendly and could not help us enough, they really made the stay special. 

We had dinner upstairs at the Avairy which is another beautiful part of this hotel, great drinks and wonderful food, the 4 course Christmas Menu was tasty and substantial. The breakfast in this restaurant in the morning was lovely with a great buffet.

The location of this hotel is ideal as its central to the city and near Old Street and Moorgate station. Cannot wait to visit again.",5,2017,12,13
111,One of the best hotels in London!,"Stayed at the Montcalm Royal London house before and stayed again this weekend. Such an amazing hotel with great service all round. The staff, the facilities and the rooms are all 5 star!
It's already one of my favourite hotels in London and will be staying here again soon, for sure! 
A massive thanks to Sinnitta in guest relations who made our stay feel extra special! I recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone and have done so already. If you haven't stayed here yet, you're really missing out! 
We will be back! :) ",5,2017,12,12
111,Amazing Experience Topped With A Proposal,"Having stayed 5 previous times at this amazing hotel this occasion was even more special and certainly one to remember. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the lovely Dado. We were upgraded to the palm suite which was incredible unaware of what was going on my Fiance had been in contact with Dado the night before to arrange his proposal to me! Dado had orgainsed a beautiful igloo on the rooftop with champagne and strawberrys, where he proposed. It was the most amazing evening and the fact that Dado had managed to pull all this off with 1 nights notice was incredible. My Fiance and I cant thank you enough for making our night so special, you are a true credit to the hotel. We would recommend this hotel to everyone, all the staff are lovely the rooms are amazing and the rooftop bar is beautiful and of course we will be back.",5,2017,12,11
111,Great weekend,"Made our 2nd visit to the hotel last weekend, lovely stay, rooms are excellent very well equipped and clean. The aviary bar is excellent for a drink and food, we spent the whole afternoon there chilling. The staff in the hotel are fantastic and the hotel offers. 50% discount on the NCP car park right opposite which is great for driving up to London. Definitely returning soon",5,2017,12,11
111,Top notch,"This is a really good hotel. From start to finish it is impossible to fault, even if you have a problem it is sorted efficiently and with empathy.
This was our first time at a Montcalm hotel and if this the standard we’ll be using others.
The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and professional and certainly not stiff - you get a genuine feeling they enjoy working here.
We had a good size room, clean and well maintained. 
Nice club lounge plus other bars and places to eat if you’re in the hotel.
We had a small problem in the spa - quickly resolved and then checked by Gary the  House Manager to ensure we were happy.
We will definitely return when next in London.",5,2017,12,10
111,Lovely stay,Beautiful room perfectly prepared with rose petals and red wine . Everthing you could wish for . All hotel staff attentive and extremely courteous.Roof terrace well worth a visit.Good base lots of pubs and restaurants close by .,5,2017,12,08
111,"Nice bed, bath, bar. Service needs work.","This is a confusing property. It’s really well located. I stayed for a meeting at work and loved the quick walk to Moorgate.  

But the problems started at Check In.  
1. Despite booking a room for the week and adding a night specifically for early arrival after a transatlantic flight, i was told the room had been given away.  After the deal clerk confirmed with the manager, i was told i had a “special club room” and given access to the club lounge (which is located just across from reception).  
2. The hotel key system works about once every tenth time you wave your key at the door.  
3. Housekeeping failed to clear a fruit tray in the room for five days.  
4. The touchpad heating and air on system does not work. The front desk took control remotely one night (when the key again wouldn’t work and they had to accompany me to the room) and that was the only night/day the heat was functioning. 
5. A glass of wine i had on Wednesday went uncleared in the room for days.

But the best was when, after being referred to the makeshift “lounge” - a tiny room on the 9th floor because the real lounge was busy every night for private events - we were initially served (i had been there the prior night) - and then while seated with my boss, was told that I had no access and we had to leave.  The attendant meant well but not only was my boss present but at another table were other colleagues.  It was mortifying!  The woman had my room number and could easily have waited but instead told my boss that he couldn’t have the complementary snacks - it was too funny to be irritated but what a mess! 

Add to this the three bars on the property and there are just loads better places to stay for business. ",3,2017,12,07
111,Loredana stay in Montcalm,"I was accommodated in the hotel at the end of November, trying to combine the usefulness of a business trip to London with the pleasure of visiting one of the most beautiful capitals. Since reception in the premises, I was welcomed by the pleasant atmosphere as well as by Mrs. Dado, who was nice enough to make a generous hotel tour to accommodate me with the view.
I had the most pleasant surprise, to have waited for a wonderful fruit basket, along with some delicious chocolates and an enticing champagne in the hotel room. A delight!
For 3 nights I had a pleasant stay, I was impressed by the hotel's facilities and the level of services offered. I'm sorry I did not have enough time, because the weather really took us through the city and it was very nice, and we did not take advantage of the spa, but that's just another reason to come back with love again. Room 323 Thank you Dado",5,2017,12,06
111,Beyond expectations ,"I had an awesome stay here. The Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Tube.  The use of the complimentary smartphone for the entire was definitely a 👍🏻😊. I love the Club Lounge. Overall, smiling from ear to ear, I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,12,06
111,Sudah and Kamal Vedi,"My husband and I stayed on Sunday night 3rd December in a club room.  Our experience at you hotel was amazing. The facilities are the best we have had for along time.  Your staff go above and beyond our expectations. 

We look forward to visiting again.",5,2017,12,05
111,Exceeded expectations ,"We thought we had booked the sister hotel at Old st which is the most fantastic Gotham City style looking building. Initially we were disappointed to have to make the 5/10 min walk down to Montcalm royal but it was certainly worth it. With a welcoming glass of fizz, lovely helpful staff and a spacious room with good view we were not disappointed. The bed and bedding were delightfully luxurious and the room lighting was the best I’ve come across. Will definitely return.",5,2017,12,05
111,Regular Guest,"I've stayed here quite frequently this year and been very pleased with level of service and helpfulness of the staff. The welcome package for a regular visitor is a nice touch and much appreciated. I'm not generally cool enough to hang out roof-top, but it is one of the few spots in London with such a great set-up. The room controls are a great use of technology, and who doesn't love to smell of Hermes green oranges.......",5,2017,12,04
111,Absolutely excellent in every way.,"I rarely write reviews, but feel compelled to congratulate the whole Montcalm team on providing a thoroughly enjoyable stay, from checkin to checkout!

The room was very well appointed with high quality fixtures, quiet and comfortable.  

I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",5,2017,12,04
111,Amazing hotel!,"Can not fault this hotel at all. The staff were so lovely, the rooms and hotel are amazing and the rooftop bar is stunning. We really did not want to go home on Sunday when we checked out - we will 100% be coming back to this hotel!",5,2017,12,04
111,Stunning Hotel with a  Beautiful View,"Welcomed by very friendly staff and really felt like we were being looked after.

The rooms were lovely- clean, spacious and we had a great skyline view.
Breakfast was delicious, fresh and they had a good variety of food within the buffet- from full english options to muffins, breads, cereals and fresh juices.
The view from the rooftop is very special- its smart with a modern edge, it is very quiet and relaxing compared to the bustling streets which is refreshing.

They also had a bar and shuffle boards for guests which is a nice touch and fresh fruit also for you to enjoy.

Good location with shops just around the corner if you require anything and there are 2 nearby stations that are great for getting you about London.

Wonderful Hotel and would highly recommend.",5,2017,12,04
111,A real special treat!,"My partner reserved a room for 2 nights at the beginning of November for my 40th birthday. It was a surprise and l only found out on the day. When l entered the room, ""happy birthday"" balloons covered the ceiling, a bottle of champagne was waiting for me as well as chocolates and brownies. I could not believe it! The staff of the hotel really went the extra mile for this occasion. Thank you very much to everybody involved! You really made my stay and my day extra special!",5,2017,12,02
111,Cannot fault this place,"From check in to check out I was made to feel most welcome by all staff, although my stay was only a few days for business purposes it most definitely a pleasure to come back to the hotel at the end of each day knowing I could relax in the calm surroundings of my room or unwind in the hotel lounge or avail of the rooftop views in the Aviary restaurant 

I hope my next stay isn't too far away!!!
Thank you for a most enjoyable stay",5,2017,12,02
111,Brilliant stay fir our first Christmas function,"Can’t fault this hotel - great people and service, amazing rooms and facilities with a very special roof top terrace . The breakfast was varied and very well presented and would certainly return to the hotel again ",5,2017,12,02
111,Beautiful New Hotel,"We loved our stay at this hotel, the rooms are amazing and the location quiet but very accessible from Moorgate and Liverpool Street stations. As the hotel is new the decor is rather exquisite and we felt lucky to stay here even though it was very affordable. 

Most of all the staff could not do enough for us, we would definitely return. ",5,2017,11,28
111,London’s warmest welcome,"We’ve stayed at other Montcalm properties and have always found them to exceed expectations. Trying out Royal London for the first time we had high expectations but were blown away. Our young daughter was welcomed with such genuine warmth as were we. The facilities are excellent. The room was lovely. But it was the staff that made the place - everyone we met went out of their way to do something special for us. We felt like VIPs. Particular thanks to Gabby who helped us pre-arrival and everything was as she had promised. We would highly recommend and will definitely stay again. 

Thank you! ",5,2017,11,27
111,Birthday celebrations ,"Great location, welcoming, friendly staff. Room was lovely and the room scent was a lovely touch as was the birthday cake, wine and fruit.
The club lounge touches were really nice and the hotel had a lovely modern decor. Especially liked the beautiful lights in the club lounge. 
Would definitely recommend a stay and the location is so nice away from the hustle and bustle at weekends.
",5,2017,11,27
111,Birthday stay...,"Hands down my most amazing hotel stay! 

Prosecco on arrival, birthday room upgrade and a chocolate brownie surprise on entry to the room.

The hotel is stunning and looks recently renovated. It’s really stylish and has such an expensive feel to it.

The location is perfect, really central with other bars, restaurants and shops close by if you don’t want to venture too far out.

The room was spotless, including loads of nice little touches like comfy slippers and robes, elemis products and a fully stocked Nespresso machine. 

The rooftop restaurant was gorgeous, there are igloos on the roof that you can dine in as well as plenty of space inside the restaurant. The views are breathtaking and it’s great for photo opportunities. Oh and the breakfast was delicious.

The downstairs bars are lively and a great place for a drinks to start or finish off your night.

Couldn’t fault this hotel or the staff. I cannot wait to return!!

Thanks for everything!x",5,2017,11,27
111,Perfect stay as always,"I had a perfect stay, greatly appreciated the free upgrade and the team was fabulous as always.  Great rooms - modern, clean and spacious. Nice and quiet for a good night's sleep.  Great location.  Highly recommend",5,2017,11,27
111,Superb hotel,"This hotel is as seen in the pics.  Nice quick easy check in with a nice touch of Proseco. Room nice and spacey and beds comfy with a choice of pillows, scent in room.  A hotel with robes and slippers. Bed so comfy it was hard to get up. Coffee and tea making facilities, iron and iron board if needed. Expect to pay a premium price in the bar and for food. Come on peeps your in the city. Pool,jacuzzi,steam room,sauna all clean and a great free facility. Did not use gym but looked good.  The Atrium rooftop bar restaurant was a nice touch a outside area with heaters blankets and plastic domes. Excellent views and great service. The attention to detail was spot on. Did not try restaurant food but had snack food in downstairs bar which was very nice. The microbrewery pub downstairs was also good. The staff was so helpful we had a small problem that was rectify very swiftly. The staff were really friendly and happy to help. Overall I cannot fault anything. I was impressed well done to you all keep up the good work. 👍",5,2017,11,26
111,Luxury and excellent value for money,"What's not to like!! Champagne on arrival, lovely welcome by staff, lovely soft bouncy carpet. The room was beautiful and I loved the lighting. They left a welcome card in the room with two caramel brownies and fruit ....what a great touch. The bathroom was perfect. I loved the roof top bar and the club lounge was a massive surprise and I highly recommend paying abit more for this benefit, free nibbles and drinks. All in all it was great value for money and I would definitely stay again. Plus I slept like a baby and can't remember when a hotel turned down the rooms, loved this. Thank you.",5,2017,11,26
111,Amazing few days,"My husband and I spent 4nights at the Montcalm Royal last week and thoroughly enjoyed every minute, the room was beautiful, the rooftop bar was great and the staff were brilliant, always looking to help us in any way they could and always with a smile - Excellent, Rita",5,2017,11,25
111,Perfect stay for a great weekend of joy!,"We have had a great stay in this hotel. The staff has been very welcome from the first till the last minute of our stay. Rooms very very comfortable, spa very relaxing and rooftop restaurant great atmosphere and food. 

Last but not least the guest experience manager helped Dada was very helpfull to create a romantic experience as we had our engagement this weekend.

All together: thank you very much for an amazing weekend!",5,2017,11,24
111,Fantastic hotel in London,"I have stayed here twice, most recently was for 9 days. Every part of the experience was premium, from the doorman to the reception, to the food and beverage facilities, to the rooms. Definitely will stay each and every time I am in London.",5,2017,11,24
111,One of the BEST London Hotels,I visited this new hotel while in London on business. It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and enjoyed my time there.  The rooms are terrific as are the hosts. The dining rooms and exercise rooms are top notch. I loved the rooftop hotel restaurant and view of the city of London. Check this hotel out if you ever visit this beautiful city.,5,2017,11,23
111,Birthday surprise,"Sorry for the late review. This was booked as a surprise for my fiancé's birthday. Guest relation were informed of it and somehow there was a communication problem. Krystina and Sinnitta eventually resolved the issue. This is a beautiful hotel, highly recommend the rooftop Cocktail Bar and dinner in Aviary.  Please check it is not reserved first for private function to avoid disappointment. The hotel is easily accessible and easy to commute to other part of london. The Montcalm Spa is awesome, Very relaxing atmosphere. Will definitely recommend this hotel and looking forward to our next stay. Thank you to Sinnitta and Krystina. :) I am giving it 4* because our stay could have been smoother and few things did not go as I wished. However this is based on personal experience and do not get put off by this. Enjoy the spa :)",4,2017,11,22
111,My favourite hotel in London!,"Everything about our stay was perfection! 

From the outstanding service by reception staff, to prosecco on arrival and brownies in our room this service in this hotel is second to none!

We had a junior suite which was gorgeous and the bathroom is incredible - perfect for doing makeup in dark evenings! 

The addition of underground heating in the bathroom is a lovely touch. While we didn't make it to the rooftop bar or the poor we are already planning our return in order to experience these facilities.

Fantastic value for money, I cannot recommend enough - thank you!",5,2017,11,22
111,Wonderful hotel experience ,"This hotel was a perfect fit. Really close to several bus lines and tube stations. Room is good size and the smart lights, etc were simple to use. Will definitely stay here again. The complimentary food/drink room was also so nice!  

Con: the shower floor is super slippery! Be careful. And the cell available for use in the room had an alarm set that we could not figure out how to turn off. ",5,2017,11,22
111,Excellent stay again for business trip,"My stay was excellent, as always. Staff were most welcoming, polite and professional. Room was of an excellent standard. Immaculately clean. Huge TV with Sky channels. Complimentary water.
 
Many thanks for another great stay.

But please bring back the Hermes toiletries!",5,2017,11,21
111,First stay but impressed,"For London standards, Montcalm definitely did very well for itself. For a business traveler, its location is perfectly situated close to the CBD yet away enough to be exclusive.

Rooms were not exceptionally spacious but clean and well decorated, tasteful and elegant. They even provide you with a local phone with free data for you to get around, which was very helpful.

They can definitely improve its service level (which is already very good) for more personalized attention, but no complaints on that. I would definitely come back the next round I'm in London for my business trips.",4,2017,11,19
111,My first stay at the Montcalm ,"This was a first stay for ya and we were so taken back by the friendly service we got from the reception staff then the room we had was so comfortable then to top all that off we paid a visit to the roof top restaurant and bar and wow we were so blown away 

All in all it was a great experience ",5,2017,11,18
111,Almost perfect,"This hotel offers a tasteful elegance that is both modern and classy. The heated bathroom floor is a real treat. There is a PDA for you to use locally. The lounge offers good breakfast and evening drinks. There is also a pool and a jacuzzi, the pool is relatively small, but you can get a workout with the ""treadmill"" currents. A big facility downside, however, is that there is no business center: strange for a business area hotel. The elevators are also not efficient: two of them that cannot be called with one button. You need to check and see which is closer to your floor then choose that one. 

The main reason, however, that I am not giving it a full 5-star is due to the service: clearly still lacks training for it to get to the level commensurate with the facilities. Two example: as there was no clock visible from the pool, I asked the attendant to let me know when it's a certain time. Not only he never came, he had in fact left and never told his replacement about the request. In the lounge, with just one customer and two waitresses, they were too busy chatting with each other to pay attention to service. Overall, the services felt more contrived than sincere. 

But hey, there is heated floor and night light!",4,2017,11,18
111,Unforgettable experience ,"Stayed for one night but the staff/service was above and beyond any expectations!

I was in contact with guest relations prior to my visit hoping that the hotel would help me make my stay extra special as I planned to propose to my girlfriend! The response and service I received was out of this world - they really did do everything and MORE to make our stay amazing!

Would highly recommend to anyone!!

10/10 all round!",5,2017,11,18
111,Excellent ,"My stay was lovely and The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much. I’m allergic to feathers and I had to ask for my bedding to be changed and it was not problem. 

I would stay again in a heartbeat. ",5,2017,11,17
111,Exceeded expectations ,"We were blown away at how well we were looked after in this hotel. 

We were checked in by a lovely young man who was so friendly and welcoming. We were chatting and he asked if we had planned to use the restaurant, I told him we hadn’t as we were going out with friends for my 30th birthday celebrations. Well that was like music to his ears and he did everything to make sure we celebrated in style! 

Before I said it was my birthday, he informed us we had been upgraded. Our room was stunning! Clean, modern and fresh. Then once in our room, we had cake and wine delivered, complimentary of the hotel. We then went for a walk and we came back to the hotel, there was a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us in our room!! Literally felt like royalty! 

Thank you for a really lovely stay! We loves it. 

Definitely recommend this hotel! ",5,2017,11,16
111,Exceeded expectation,"Our stay with you was a pleasure from start to finish.
The room was lovely and fulfilled everything we could have wished for.
Beds lovely, room quiet, bathroom lovely.
All of the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.
I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel",5,2017,11,14
111,Excellent Service and stay from beginning to end,"This is a great hotel with great decor, a great spa and a great roof top bar and restaurant.  Our room was really nice and overall the hotel decor was excellent and clean.  But as in all hotels its the staff that really make your stay what it is and the staff at the Montcalm are excellent.

From the gentleman who welcomed us at the door to the bar staff in the roof top bar, to the receptionist's to the service staff to the team down in the Spa all were so welcoming, polite and made us feel at home.  We have stayed in hotels all over the world and the service at the Montcalm really was up there with the best.

Thanks to all the team at the Montcalm Royal London!",5,2017,11,13
111,Going the extra mile,"I booked 2 rooms here for a family event and when we arrived we were met by an extremely polite and friendly doorman. This was just the start of a very enjoyable stay. The team in the hotel made my mum feel comfortable and couldn't do enough to make her birthday stay special. From the smallest thing to the cake in her room and a massage in the Spa. Nothing was too much for them. 
The rooms are beautifully decorated with all the amenities that you need. We had a sofa in our room, which made it easier to talk & drink wine without having to sit on the bed. The Aviary bar on the roof has spectacular views looking towards the Walkie-Talkie building, Shard etc. with heaters and blankets provided it was great to sit out there in the evening with a cocktail.
Definitely one of the best hotels to stay in if you want to be pampered and enjoy the incredible sites of London.",5,2017,11,13
111,"another Montcalm great, 5*","We have stayed at the Brewery so knew what to expect

We stayed over the weekend, Friday and Saturday nights 

The wow factor was evident from the time we arrived, check in was painless as they already had my husbands details.  
Our room was lovely, a great size, HUGE television.  Fully stocked mini bar, fresh fruits and lovely Elemis products in the bathroom.
The mood lighting was an added bonus too.

We had access to the club lounge which was very well stocked with drinks of all kind along with some apples and crisps.

We had an enjoyable day in London and when we arrived back my husband had received an e-mail saying they were unable to service the room as we had left the 'do not disturb' sign alight.  
I went to reception and they immediately sent someone up to do so.  

We visited the roof top bar and restaurant, really wonderful views and a lush restaurant although we didn't chose to eat there. 
 We didn't get a chance to even visit the spa, (save that for next time)

We took advantage of the room service, this was extremely prompt and the food was of high quality.

Check out time of 12 was great and check out was quick and easy.

There was an issue which we discussed with a lady on reception.  
Later on that evening my husband had received a very nice e-mail from the hotel.
The issue was nothing to do with service and would not prevent us from returning, the opposite in fact, the professional attitude towards customer satisfaction is second to none, thank you and we hope to return again soon.

I have already recommended to colleagues at work, thank you for another stunning hotel.",5,2017,11,13
111,Fabulous hotel ,"What a find! Lovely hotel in City location - potentially not the hotel for you if Covent Garden & Kensington are your social destinations although the tubes are easy to use and close by! 

We arrived early at the hotel and were met by pleasant and helpful check in staff who happily checked us in and took our bags for safe keeping until our rooms were ready.  On our return to the hotel at around 5pm our bags had been placed in our rooms. 

Beautifully appointed, large (for London) and clean rooms with great facilities and a very comfortable bed. 

Roof top bar nice but slightly lacking in atmosphere by 11.30pm (it does close at midnight).

Service from all staff we had contact with was excellent.  Would definitely recommend and we will certainly return next time we visit London. 

",5,2017,11,12
111,Returning visit!,"My partner and I love this hotel. This was our second stay and could not fault it again. Luckily on this visit we had time to use the spa twice and it was an added treat. 
As always the club lounge is an added bonus to this hotel and we will always ensure we book this class of room for this feature. 
The staff are amazing and even when I made an error with the booking (totally my fault) they did everything to rectify it and sorted it so quickly and professionally. 
I can't wait to return!",5,2017,11,11
111,Amazing,Went to the hotel for my boyfriends birthday and was blown away by the amazing service we received! The hotel is beautiful and the customer service is outstanding! It is lovely to be somewhere that members of staff actually care about your experience. Each and every member of staff was happy to help! The rooms were lovely and well equipped and the bed was also some comfortable! Will definitely be going again! ,5,2017,11,11
111,Fabulous restful oasis after a frenetic day in the City.,"Excellent service and attention to detail. Relaxed and professional which is really tricky balance to achieve. A superb team. But I wish I wasn't telling you because I'll want to be able to go again, and don't want you lot booking all the rooms for ever and a day!",5,2017,11,08
111,Weekend Break!,"Took a lovely weekend trip into London. 

We took a Club Room which was very worth it. The Spa facilities where clean and comfortable. The Staff where very helpful expect for the Club lounge waitress who could use some people skills.

Will definitely revisit and enjoyed the stay.",4,2017,11,08
111,Fantastic hotel,"Had a lovely 2 night stay, and my parents also stayed 2 nights and we really enjoyed our stay and my room  was quiet and luxurious.  The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating.  Really great location.  Breakfast was really good.",5,2017,11,06
111,Fine hotel,"Comfortable and spacious room, excellent wifi, totally professional, helpful and good-humored staff. Good buffet breakfast and, a nice touch, evening drinks and canapés for guests. Convenient to the City, tube stops close by.",5,2017,11,04
111,Favourite hotel in London,"I have stayed at this hotel several times now and it gets better with every visit. The hotel room was immaculate with a stunning view and the beds in this hotel are some of the comfiest I have ever slept in.

The club lounge is an enjoyable extra and the environment of the lounge is consistent with that of the hotel as a whole - elegant, comfortable and relaxing. 

All of the staff I have ever encountered at this hotel have been wonderful - including the reception staff, club lounge staff and room service. All have been very friendly, professional and accommodating and are a credit to the hotel. 

The Aviary rooftop bar in particular is excellent with phenomenal views across the city. When the bartender at The Aviary was unable to make the cocktail I had requested due to not having a particular ingredient, he asked what drinks I enjoyed and created a cocktail for me on the spot which was one of the best I've had! 

I have recommended the Montcalm to all of my family and friends as I cannot fault it. 

I will be staying at the hotel again next week and I am looking forward to it already -  it is quickly becoming my favourite hotel to use whilst in London on business trips. 

Thank you.",5,2017,11,02
111,Proposal to my girlfriend,"I am not one for leaving reviews however I couldn't not leave a review after a 2 night stay in the Montcalm. I booked the Hotel for proposing to my girlfriend while in London. Right from our arrival we were greeted to the warmest of welcomes. Such friendly staff all so smiley and helpful. We were invited into the club lounge for drinks while reception processed our booking. We were then informed that they had upgraded us to our surprise. We could not fault the room it was immaculate and so modern and the facilities were amazing. The view was great of Finsburry square and of London. 

After my successful proposal we returned to the hotel for the staff to have laid petals and balloons throughout the room with prosecco and cake. The morning after we were greeted by the manager when we checked out and they were so happy to congratulate us. We were invited up to the aviary rooftop for complimentary drinks. They helpfully stored our bags while we went into town and on return booked us a private car to take us to the airport and invited us into the club lounge while we waited for the car. 

Overall the Montcalm has been the best hotel in the world I have stayed in with absolute amazing staff. I could not pick a single fault and would give it 10/10.

Me and my now fiancee would like to thank Dado, Sinnitta, the reception staff and all other staff that made our trip amazing. We cannot wait to come back 😊.",5,2017,11,01
111,My favourite hotel in London...hands down.,"I visited Montcalm Royal London House this weekend, what a hotel. The gentleman who checked us in immediately gave us up to date information about the hotel, including information on the three bars, spa etc. We didn't get the complimentary glass of champagne as others stated however there was no wait at reception and our room was ready at 12 which was a nice bonus.

Our luggage was taken to our room and we were impressed by the quality of the room, very clean with the mod cons. Your TV is linked to SKY box in room including sports and movies which is a MUST have and a real treat for a hotel to be offering this - we took advantage on Sunday by having breakfast in bed and catching up on the news. In addition you can link your phone up to the TV and play your music, WIFI signal is strong throughout the hotel and complimentary. Unfortunately the phone in the room for the travel connection wasn't working so we cant comment on this - but it wasn't a big deal as we walked a lot of places and didn't really understand what it did. I'm sure if we had told reception it would have been replaced.

Breakfast in bed is a must - it'll cost you £45 for two but is well worth it. Its great quality, and a real treat to be able to relax - especially when check out isn't until 12!

We visited the spa which is very relaxing and wasn't too crowded - all clean and the staff are very welcoming. We both had massages, I wasn't overly impressed by the treatment however think that's just preference of the type of massage rather than it being poor. 

Finally - the aviary. What a bar... views are spectacular, the staff are second to none, the music/ambience is relaxed and the drinks are good choice and quality. We ordered bar snacks here which are reasonably priced and tasty - drinks are expensive but you are in a roof top bar in London - what do you expect. 

I most definitely wont think twice of staying anywhere else when coming back to London, luxurious, great service and just a really nice feel to the hotel.",5,2017,10,30
111,Amazing hotel but....,"The hotel and location was amazing, the staff in the hotel could not have been more accommodating. We were given a glass of bubbles each on arrival which went down very well and when we were shown to our room where we were given a thorough run through of the room and the facilities. Although the room we were staying in was underground so the only view from the window was a fire escape.

However, we went for dinner in The Aviary which is the restaurant at the top of the hotel which was disappointing, we were given the wrong food from what we ordered and had to ask for the bill multiple times. This was quite frustrating as we were planning on having a quick dinner as we had plans in the evening which we were made late for in the evening. 

When returning to the hotel late at night we also saw a mouse in the reception area, which if you were scared of them I am sure would have given you a real fright!

That being said all else about the hotel was fantastic it was just a shame about the added extras!",4,2017,10,30
111,Excellent Hotel- Service and rooms exceeded my expectations.,"This was my first experience staying at Montcalm Royal London House and I was blown away. From start to finish the service was superb, everybody was welcoming, attentive and I couldn't recommend it enough. The room was spotless and it was the little touches that really made the stay special. 
I was truly blown away and look forward  to staying there again.",5,2017,10,30
111,An Excellent Stay At Montcalm Royal London House!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm. All the staff were friendly, polite and hospitable at all times. My hotel room was very comfortable and luxurious with some very Hi-Tech features in the room. I enjoyed my Spa and massage treatments and the champagne that was included in my deal was soothing after my massage. The masseuse gave me a very good Swedish massage. I enjoyed my breakfast on the 10th floor viewing the London skyline. It was an amazing experience and I will definitely go back there in the very near future.",5,2017,10,30
111,Our first stay and loved it.,"We booked here for a weekend trip for our wedding anniversary and had a great stay.

On arrival we were greeted with a glass of gorgeous spicy hallowe’en bubbles and a room upgrade and shown to our room where we had been given chocolates and a bottle of wine on ice, a lovely touch.

The room was spotless and very spacious
With a great bathroom.

We ate in the rooftop restaurant on one night and again we were given a free glass of bubbly and a stunning chocolate dessert.

The view from the roof bar is amazing and very romantic and the cocktails are gorgeous too.

What really makes this hotel great is the staff.
Nothing is too much trouble and anyone of them will make sure your stay is perfect.

We will definitely return to this hotel once back in London and would happily book here again without hesitation and would not feel the need to look at other hotels. ",5,2017,10,29
111,Luxury hotel ,"This is our fourth time of staying here and yet again the service has been brilliant. At check in we were given a room upgrade to a junior suite . After coming back from shopping we found a welcome back card with some wine and chocolates left, what a marvellous touch. We had access to the executive lounge and again I think this has got even better with a wide choice of food and alcohol. We went for a couple of glasses of wine prior to dinner and finished of there before we went to bed. The hotel I think has got better and better . They even had toffee apples for free. Thank you once again for a lovely stay we will be back x ",5,2017,10,29
111,Absolutely fantastic!!,"We stayed in this hotel Friday to Saturday night for my boyfriends birthday. On arrival we were greeted by the concierge who opened the door and welcomed us warmly. We then headed to the reception desk to check in (few bits of paper work to fill out). The reception team were very welcoming and overly nice. 
We then headed for the room. On the 3rd floor located in a quiet corner we found our room. Spacious, clean and very modern. Much nicer than expected. Underfloor heating in the bathroom so your tootsies won’t get cold!! Sky in the room as well which was a nice touch. We popped out to come back to a complimentary desert waiting in the room for his birthday- absolutely delicious- Massive thank you. 
We didn’t dine in the hotel however making the morning cup of tea I managed to blow the fuses in the room- haha!! Sorted in 5 minutes with a quick call to reception. 
The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, feather pillows and covers which were so soft and very comfortable. I can’t recommend this hotel enough, worth the price! 
The location is also fantastic, 5 minute walk to the tube. 

Thankyou to all the staff for making our stay exceptional and one to remember!! 
",5,2017,10,28
111,Absolutely perfect!,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The location was great, only a few minutes to two different tube stations and with some great restaurants and cafes round the corner.

The room was lovely, every little detail cared for. From the Nespresso machine and mood lights, to the integrated tablet that controls the air con, do not disturb, maid service etc., there was nothing forgotten about. The rooms were very spacious also, with a large and sparkling bathroom and a huge walk-in shower! And don't get me started on the bed, it was absolutely amazing. So much so, that we noted down what brand the mattress topper was so we can buy our own!

The facilities were great also. We didn't use the spa/wellness area but the Club Lounge and the Aviary are nice touches. The Aviary is a must if you stay here as the experience and views alone are stunning.

All staff here were incredibly friendly and kind and made a great impression on us. They went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible.

We had an amazing weekend here and will definitely be coming back. Thank you so much!",5,2017,10,25
111,Dado thank you for the amazing stay 😊👍🏾👌🏾,"We just spend the last two nigths at the montcalm. The room was very nice and also the rooftopbar. All the saff were very frindly. I would like to give to Dado an extra compliment. Becouse she was very competent, sovereign and attentive. She made our stay unforgettable. Thanks",5,2017,10,25
111,Very good Hotel,"Well situated, secure (not cheap!) NCP right opposite with discount for residents. Rooms are first class with significant 'mod-cons'. Quiet and comfortable. Short walk to underground is ideal, edge of the City if it is a business trip makes life easy as well. Bar & Pub both excellent, top floor bar where breakfast is served offers good breakfast and views (of the London high-rise building site!).
Staff are first class, helpful and attentive. This is, I believe, the best of the three Montcalm hotels in this locality - have stayed in and reviewed all three.
Enjoy - I would recommend it.",5,2017,10,24
111,Great hotel,"I really like this hotel. I stay there everytime I'm in london. Its well located but most of all the staff know how to look after their customers. It has an amazing view from the rooftop, a great gym and the breakfast is awesome.",5,2017,10,24
111,Amazing stay in a Amazing hotel,"Amazing room,very clean , big bathroom with a big douche, fantastic bed and still room, absolute friendly and helpfull staff,Amazing restaurant and good breakfast with a view on the skyline of the city and a excellent terras",5,2017,10,23
111,Fantastic Stay with all the extra little touches,"I stayed here for one night to enjoy a weekend break with my girlfriend (whom I would propose to). I booked this hotel as it was a great location, looked pretty modern, great reviews and all for a good price. What's not to love?

On arrival, we were greeted by Champagne (or Sparkling wine - who's to know?!), and promptly checked in. We noticed there was a spa on site, so I was gutted that I didn't bring any shorts!! Next time..

We made our way to our room, facing Finsbury Square, and were very impressed with the facilities. Ultra modern with mood lighting, tablets to control various lights, and can you believe it... your own mobile phone to use, free of charge with minutes, data and tour guide. Nice. Room was lovely, and spacious, and had everything you need and more. We had two bottles of mineral water and fruit on arrival. There is a Nespresso machine, minibar, snacks etc. All lovely. 

Usual touches, robes, slippers, hair dryer, TV with all channels (Sky Sports included), Bluetooth speaker, iron, ironing board... basically everythng you would need during a short stay. Great.

There are 3 great, atmospheric restaurants on site. Highly recommend Aviary, for which I have reviewed seperately. Very unique, for those special occasions.

Hotel went that extra mile when they prepared the room with petals, a bottle of prosecco on ice on our return from the Aviary restaurant, and all at no cost! Wow.

This is a place that cares about it's customers, there is not athing they will not do to assist visitors. When checking out they offer a service to look after luggage which was very helpful.

One, very very minor gripe... and I am only writing this to assist the hotel. The table on the wall by the bathroom door needs to be able to dim/or turn the light off after a period of inactivity. It brightened the room too much when trying to sleep and I had to wedge a menu in to the side of the mirror to cover it and make the room completely dark. There is also an alarm/sprinkler or something that flashes during the night. Those who like their room completely dark, may have an issue with this if being completely fussy. By no means did it detract from our stay which was 5* all the way.

Thanks again.",5,2017,10,23
111,Great hotel and great brand!,First time staying in this particular montcalm. Very attentive staff and guest relations. Good club lounge and spa. Trendy hotel with great good and views from the aviary! Definitely recommend. Great location for getting around London.                                              ,5,2017,10,23
111,Wonderful,"Big thanks to the staff who made my Mother's birthday stay wonderful. Lovely room and hotel. the bars were lively and young, not really for us, but it did not impede our peace or enjoyment. disabled facilities were fantastic, still looked elegant. Prosecco and chocolates we a welcome gift. ",5,2017,10,21
111,Lovely place,"I have stayed at many hotels in London. This one is the best for me. If you are in the city for the business purposes, this hotel is really for you. It is walking distance from Finsbury Square to Liverpool station. The hotel is newly opened, by chance I was there when the staff was celebrating the one year anniversary of openning. The restaurant is on the top of the hotel and has a great view. It is close to 2 underground stations (Moorgate and Liverpool Street) for the variaty metro lines. Stayed there in October and now returning back again on November. The hotel rooms are very good equiped with new technologies. ",5,2017,10,19
111,40th Birthday,"Thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Montcalm last weekend, celebrating my 40th Birthday. The hotel was fantastic, friendly staff, and we were very kindly given a room upgrade and a glass of Prosecco whilst checking in.  
The roof top Aviary was a great bonus, amazing view both during the day and then the night time skyline. We also enjoyed listening to a very talented singer whilst having a quick drink before we hit the shops.
We will be back!",5,2017,10,18
111,100% Recommend,"Stayed here for 1 night in October - really nice hotel throughout, staff were great and nothing was too much. The sky bar is a nice touch. 5 minutes walk away from Moorgate tube station. Cooked breakfast are a bit on the high side at £25, but I suppose that is normal in a 5* London hotel. Room was big, modern and a very comfy bed. A glass of fizz on arrival and a complementary drink as I was leaving the hotel. I'd definitely return again! I wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2017,10,16
111,"rooftop bar, great interior design","Great central location for business, I loved the design and the rooftop bar with outdoor terrace and a great view! Great bed, big TV, Ipod docking for listening to your own music, a desk plus chair to work at, tea and coffee in the room, free water, free Wifi ... everything you need without having to ask for it! That makes a great hotel. Would always come back.",5,2017,10,16
111,Pure class,"From the moment we arrived it was class! The staff, the decor and the atmosphere were amazing. Our room was so comfortable with every amenity you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. This hotel exceeded my expectation and I can't wait to go back. We booked a club room and availed of the treats each morning and it was fresh and delicious. ",5,2017,10,15
111,Amazing,"This new 5star hotel is all you can ask for your family or business trip.
located in the business area, easy to get to any part of the city, great large rooms and high quality service.
The breakfast at the upper floor is worth the few more pounds and serves variety of food with great view. 
The manager Olivier is extremely nice and will be happy to recommend the right places to go around the city. 
We had an amazing week here and we highly recommend the hotel and all its facilities.",5,2017,10,12
111,Weekend break,"Absolutely loved this hotel, the rooms were first class clean modern with every amenity on hand for you in the room.  We stayed two nights & must say we really enjoyed it.  We didn’t eat in the hotel as we were out & about day & night, but we saw the restaurant & bar were always busy.  The roof top bar is the biggest plus here, with amazing views of London’s skyline.
I would absolutely recommend this hotel, definitely stay again. 😀",5,2017,10,11
111,Birthday celebration,Thanks to the Montcalm my partner had a great stay in London. They couldn’t do enough for us. I’ve stayed in London many times but the Montcalm was my best stay ever. Every member of staff were fantastic. Many thanks,5,2017,10,11
111,Most impressed with Staff attitude and rooms,"Stayed 2 nights and really impressed with the staff attitude and also rooms were amazing . Fresh clean. Good value fro a London Hotel. Will be on my list for another stay.

Bar was good and overall handy place to stay in London",5,2017,10,10
111,Excellent Hotel,"It was the best hotel I have stayed at in a long time. Underfloor heating, mood lighting, sky subscriptions, nice and courteous staff. I could go on and on but I still wouldnt be able to do it justice

Definitely a hotel worth staying in",5,2017,10,09
111,Very good hotel,"Very nice hotel, great location, nice and helpful staff. Everything is new, the hotel just turned 1 year. Rooms are spacious, bed comfortable. Don’t forget to ask for a quiet room as it could get noisy if you’re close to the rooftop bar/restaurant. Fairly expensive for London standards. ",4,2017,10,08
111,Brilliant,"One of the best hotels I have stayed at worldwide. Staff can't do enough for you, rooms have everything, clean, comfortable and it's also in a great location. Will definitely be staying here again. Great spa facilities also. Love the stout in the Burdock bar too!",5,2017,10,08
111,Excellent hotel service and location,"I stayed 10 days in that hotel and it was a really nice stay with a very good service. Rooms are big enough with amazing view. 
Do not miss the breakfast, one of the best I had in an hotel. The croissant is delicious and I had everyday chil avocado on toast. 
On top of it you have a roof top bar and an incredible swimming pool. 
It is very closed from the subway. 
I will definitively get back to that hotel.",5,2017,10,07
111,Perfect from start to finish,"After a short walk from Old Street Station we were greeted by a lovely Door Man and met with a welcome glass of fizz during check in. Check in is extremely fast, efficient and check in staff are more than helpful.

The room itself was beautiful, modern and the beds are ridiculously comfortable, I genuinely miss that quilt! Being able to hook our mobile up to the TV for getting ready at night time was an added bonus.

The hotel is in a great location and we would highly recommend the 10min walk to Shoreditch High St at night to pay a visit to Dirty Bones, wow!",5,2017,10,05
111,"Comfortable, clean, great!","I stayed at this hotel on a business trip in September. The Staff was very welcoming even though I arrived at the hotel quite late from a flight.
The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Everything is controlled from a centralized dashboard.
The bed was high and comfortable. The shower very good. The shower gel smells great!
There was an iron in the room to iron the shirts, usb socket.
Breakfast was very tasty and fresh.
It was a great stay",5,2017,10,03
111,Amazing!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights. My partner booked the hotel as a birthday surprise and it was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. 
We arrived early in the morning, the hotel stored our bags and told us to come back whenever we liked as the hotel room wasn't ready they offered us the wash rooms to freshen up after traveling and were allowed to use the spa facilities. All staff were really pleasant. We went out for the day returning in the afternoon where we were greeted with champagne and our bags had been taken to our room already. 
The room was fantastic, touch screen for underfloor heating, air con, bathroom lights  and maid service. The room was very modern huge tv, hair dryer and laundry service. Along with a phone that you could take out of the hotel which gave you restaurants, directions and recommendations for shops and places to see (was a really nice touch). 
We went to the roof top bar at the hotel it had lovely views and again polite staff. 
The hotel was located about 5 minutes from the underground Moorgate. Lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. 
Would definitely stay here again
Thank you",5,2017,10,02
111,Excellent ,"I visited here with my wife as was working in the City the next day. The staff at the front desk, service and the number of people who say hello is surprising. This is a wonderful hotel and great location. Rooms are clean, good size and the beds are really comfortable. Was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a junior suite. 
All the bars in the hotel are wonderful and have a relaxing atmosphere. Must got to the 10th floor to check out the views and have a drink. I will always try and come back here.",5,2017,10,02
111,Brilliant hotel and staff ,You have a brilliant hotel with very good faculties and the staff need alot of credit always smiling very helpful and they look like they enjoy working for the hotel.Anyone visting London have to stay at this hotel.will definitely be coming back,5,2017,10,02
111,"“One the best hotels been too, excellent service”","Amazing stay at the Montcalm last weekend, the hospitality, service was amazing well looked after. They made our weekend stay so special and for my ring proposal with their guest experience service provided was 10/10, can’t thank the team enough. Everything was so perfect from the moment we walked in and departed, felt so warmth welcomed, the hotel room selected for us was amazing with a great view. I would like to specially thank Sinnitta, Tamara and Saviya- Manager for providing us an amazing hotel room, hospitality and making my proposal weekend amazing all going to plan with all of their great help.
Amazing Montcalm Team- cannot thank them enough. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an amazing guest experience or special weekend with their partners at a 5 Star service hotel. 
We will definitely be coming back on a visit again for a stay. 

",5,2017,10,01
111,The most perfect night,"I had the most amazing stay at the Montcalm on Friday evening. Everything was perfect from the moment I walked in to the moment I departed. My welcome was warm, the room was immaculate, the view is just stunning, and the breakfast was fantastic. We had drinks in the new Long Arm Pub with all beers that are vegan and vegetarian friendly, we played pool and had a blast! My partner and I then tucked into food in Burdock which was really great followed by relaxing over-looking the beautiful skyline view from our private terrace in our bedroom. The team at the Montcalm are wonderful and I can’t thank them enough. I want to say a special thank you in particular to Sinnitta, Tania and Tamara they truly are a brilliant team and made my stay so special. I will be sure to book again.  Can’t recommend this hotel enough! 5 STAR FANTASTIC.",5,2017,09,27
111,amazing hotel,we arrived after 6pm and for some reason our booking had been cancelled (nothing to do with hotel but booking site) The management could see we were very stressed out after missing train connections in France and acknowledged our booking with an upgrade to a business room with breakfast. Fantastic.,5,2017,09,26
111,Excellent Hotel,"Booked to stay for one night only so we didn't make use of options such as breakfast and all three of the bars. 

Location wise the hotel is a short 5 min walk from Moorgate and under 10 mins from Old street. Easily accessible from Northern Line. 

You can walk to Shoreditch Hightstreet in under 10 mins so can easily visit Boxpark, Brick Lane, Sushi Samba and Spitalfields Market 

The Hotel has a man entrance through one of the bars and can be accessed through the 2nd bar from the other side of the hotel on Worship Street. 

Check-in was swift and easy. Prosecco and rose offered while waiting to check-in, and staff made the whole process smooth and effortless. A bellboy was offered to assist but with only hand luggage this wasn't required. 

Room was on the 8th floor with a large King size bed. The rooms have a large TV with Sky and included Sky sports which was a pleasant surprise. 

The room has a full mini-bar and complimentary dressing gown, slippers and travel kits. 

The bathroom was large with underfloor heating. This is all controlled by a small touch screen panel on the wall. The rooms also have floor lights to help guide at night if you wake, I found them a bit bright but others may not. 

The rooms are very stylish as is the hotel in general. The Aviary Bar was busy and popular with a good selection of drinks at the usual London prices. 

My only small issue and its not an issue more a surprise are the lifts to the rear of the hotel for guests are not in keeping with the rest of the hotel, they are plain with not even a mirror inside them, at first I thought this was a staff only lift but it wasn't. I would have thought the lift to be as stylish as the rest of the hotel. 

All in all the hotel is a great choice for anyone looking to stay in that area. Its a perfect location and the staff are really helpful and friendly. and I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,09,24
111,Just pwrfect,"This hotel was amazing, it was a step above the rest when it came to detail such as the decor or room lay out it had everything, the rooftop bar was perfect you could sit inside or outdoors, with an unbelievable view of London, it was situated very close to two tube lines was made it so handy and accessible for us being tourist, it was in a busy area which made you experience true London life. We loved our stay and will be back for sure. ",5,2017,09,23
111,Wedding anniversary ,"My husband and I stated here for our wedding anniversary. We booked the club room and a massage in the spa and we was not disappointed.
When we arrived we was offered a glass of champagne and check in went smoothly. The only thing that confused us was when we walked in the hotel, you walked straight In a bar so we wasn't sure if this was the main entrance but if you walk through the bar, pass the lifts, you then see the front desk.
There wasn't a door man when we arrived but we did see one the next day.

Room: room was lovely clean a spacious. You get complimentary slippers in the wardrobe.
There is also a tea and coffee machine.
The bathroom had a big walk in shower with the biggest shower head I've ever seen.
The flat screen tv had sky channels and the bed was so comfy. 
We didn't have a view out the window but we didn't mind as you can get a amazing on their food top restaurant/bar.
Room was very clean and I loved the hermes toiletries.
The only little niggle was I would of liked some anti bacterial hand wash ( the clean freak In me)

Spa: the spa is on the ground floor of the hotel and is complimentary to hotel guests. Treatments are extra.
The spa is small but perfectly form. The massage was really good. We went in the steam, sauna, Jacuzzi and pool. All very clean. 
I also liked the decor of the spa.

Restaurant : we decided to eat at their roof top restaurant. We made the reservation when we checked in.
The staff and the food was amazing and the view of London was beautiful.
We order oysters for starters and steak and prawn pasta both very good.
You don't have to eat at the restaurant to enjoy the view, it's also a bar with a outdoor terrence ( please note that the terrence is closed at 10pm but the bar and restaurant is still open)

Club lounge: we booked a club room so we had access to the club Lounge.
In the morning there is a continental breakfast which is very nice.
During the day, there are canopies ( we didn't get to try these).
In the evening there are little snacks and a open self serving bar, alcoholic drinks included.

Over all a very pleasant stay at the montcalm. I think my husband and I will make it a tradition to come back every year for our wedding anniversary.",5,2017,09,23
111,Was a pleasant surprise!,"I must say, this hotel is slightly deceiving at first. The entry is definitely not your conventional lobby. Once you get used to this, it actually has a great ambiance from either entrance as there are bars/cafe on either side. Very vibrant in the late afternoons and early evenings.

The rooms are lovely! They are very spacious and very modern. The shower was my favourite part. It is HUGE by London standards, with lots of water pressure. The rooms are very neat and clean.

Location is good as you have many great places to wine and dine in Shoreditch around the corner. The roof top restaurant/bar is also amazing! The views are really beautiful and one could easily spend hours up there.

Thumbs up from me!",5,2017,09,22
111,Excellent service and perfect location,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. Staff was very friendly, kind and professional. Restaurant on the 10th floor was amazing, with an excellent food and very nice atmosphere in the evenings. Rooms are new, very cosy and I loved attention to details – bottles of water, coffee machine, tea etc. 

Location is perfect - only ca. 7 minutes to the Liverpool station.",5,2017,09,22
111,"New property, latest technology but good old warm hospitality","I was staying here for 5 nights. Its a newly built property. Needless to say the rooms were modern. Also got good upgrades. The staff was extremely courteous. Especially Silvia Cruciani who literally went the extra mile to ensure our comfort right from check in to check out. All in all I am sure that I would be staying here whenever i visit London!

Cheers
Siddharth Pethe",5,2017,09,21
111,Very nice ,"The hotel was very nice, staff were on hand to tend to every need. I had an extremely good dealing with guest services who ensured my stay was ever more special. The rooftop bar they have is brilliant, although we didn't use it in the evening we went up for breakfast and sat looking out with a cup of tea. The only thing I was let down by was a pair of men's dirty underwear found in our room which belonged to neither my or my partner. Again I understand these things occasionally happen and the hotel we're extremely apologetic and were kind enough to wave any room expenses we have occluded during our stay. I would definitely stay there again. ",4,2017,09,21
111,Anniversary celebration ,"My husband and I recently visited this hotel after much deliberation after reading other reviews we chose The Montcalm Royal, all I can say is wow! We had briefly popped in a couple of weeks before our trip to check it out, and were introduced to the lovely Dado who showed us around and was very sweet from the off, she advised about the club room category we had chosen and was very informative about the hotel, after our sneaky peak we very very pleased with the choice we had made. Fast forward a couple of weeks and from the moment we arrived at the hotel we were literally treated like royalty, Dado came to greet us and advised us we had been upgraded to a junior suite and in our room was a bottle of wine and sweet treats, and lovely card congratulating us on our anniversary, my brother had called to say they were arriving later in the evening, and she even upgraded them to include the club lounge although they hadn't paid for this, so they could celebrate with us.. (the upgrade to the club room is well worth the money, with tea coffee and soft drinks served from 11, and alcoholic drinks and canopies served from 5.30, although the weekend we were there prosecco was also served all day, baring in mind the prices you can pay for drinks in London this was staggering to us, also it seemed very generous) The hotel is slightly out of central London, but we found uber prices very reasonable and the tube station is nearby.
Another big thank you goes to Olivier who was the manager or Maitre D of the Avery restaurant which boasts a roof terrace and has amazing views of London, he was so lovely and helpful to us even getting us an introduction to The Radio rooftop bar and a glass of champagne, his banter and attitude was so amazing and down to earth, a definite big asset to the hotel, in fact all the staff are so lovely, I have been to other 5* hotels in London which are more expensive but the staff have never been this great, and always I felt too stuffy, so whoever is doing the hiring at this hotel they are doing a great job! So to finish this lengthy review I will just say another thank you to Dado and everyone at The Montcalm for making our anniversary so special, and we look forward to returning soon, and I urge anyone thinking of booking, do so, you won't be disappointed.",5,2017,09,20
111,"High end, fresh and new - recommended","Stayed over here just for one night when I had a late night business engagement in town. The hotel is brand spanking new so fresh and sparkling in every way. It has a modern and bright outlook and is a pleasure to enjoy. Staff are friendly and attentive.

Pros
1. Great central location for the city
2. Clean new and fresh
3. Friendly and attentive staff

Cons
1. It is a good hotel in the city - so its not cheap.

",4,2017,09,19
111,Perfect Stay,"I came to this hotel to reunite with a friend I had met travelling. Upon arrival the staff were so welcoming.. offered prosecco and a lovely lady called Sinnitta showed me to the room (they'd provided a little gift in the room due to the nature of our visit). The hotel itself is stunning, peaceful and has so much to do - so much so we barely left! I can't recommend this hotel enough and already thinking of a reason to visit again. ",5,2017,09,19
111,Sarah,"We stayed here on a Saturday night for a weekend away. The room was lovely, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. The facilities were all very good too. It's a very smart hotel that is close to the shard which we visited. The rooftop closed at 10pm though which was a shame because it was the only reason I booked it. ",5,2017,09,18
111,Fantastic hotel in a fantastic city.,"Absolutely lovely hotel, decor is fabulous as is in other Montcalm hotels I have been to in London. Excellent location just a few minutes walk to Moorgate station. Bed extremely big and comfy. Only downside is  the mini bar had two coke no diet,when I called to ask for a diet was told it would be £10 because of room service charge. Very minor fault in a fabulous hotel! ",5,2017,09,18
111,Lovely Hotel Shame About Burger Van,"Booked this hotel through booking.com. Looked at photos but never wondered why there are no front photos of the hotel until we arrived. 
There is an NCP under ground car park at a cost of £55 but on check out ask for a voucher and you get 50% off. As soon as you walk up to the hotel all you see is a white graffiti burger van parked right outside the hotels front door, surrounded by queues of taxis and men congregating around it eating....
The hotel itself was amazing. Our rooms were 704 and 706 and both amazing and quiet. The staff were amazing! The most attentive and pleasant I have ever come across. 
The hotel has a roof Top bar which is amazing and the rhubarb and rumble cocktail is to die for. We arrived at 6pm on Friday evening and the bars were crammed...but this does not affect the quiet nights stay. Payed for the cooked breakfast but was very dissolved at £25 per head as it was very cold and my daughter couldn't eat it...shame as it would of been fantastic...Staff again amazing....Would I return yes! Such a shame about that bloody van. If you have to arrange a taxi maybe order prior but the hotel ordered one three times and it didn't show. We nearly lost our City Social booking....",4,2017,09,17
111,Superb on night stay!,"My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this gorgeous hotel. The moment we arrived, we were welcomed by incredibly friendly reception staff who made sure we were well informed to make the most of our stay. We were unexpectedly upgraded to one of the 9th floor suites by Deceo (I think that's the correct spelling). - he was really sweet and made us feel like special guests. 

Our room was spacious, clean, well equipped and with a lovely view! We definitely received 5 star treatment. The room was luxurious, from the heated bathroom floor, the waterfall shower, really comfortable bed and pillows to our private terrace. 

We also experienced the roof top bar which was really classy and comfortable. It wasn't overcrowded or rowdy. The only negative was that the bar prices were expensive but no more so than any other bars in the Liverpool Street area. Great views of the area at night time.

After our night around the Liverpool Street area, we returned to the ground floor bar to for a glass of wine. Although we had missed last orders, the bar man was really accommodating and served us - with good banter too! 

Overall, I can't fault our stay! The service from all the  staff we spoke to was of a really high standard and felt genuine (as opposed to the fake smiles and service I've experienced at other hotels in London). It was a really refreshing stay and made even more special by the little extras of the service the staff provided. 

Will definitely be staying again! Well recommended!",5,2017,09,17
111,Lovely rooms and great location for business ,"Having spent many nights at their sister hotel my expectations for this one were high...and I was not disappointed. The rooms are to an excellent standard and the bathroom in particular is wonderful. The shower and underfloor heating is the stand out plus if you like Sky Tv then this is perfect for you. The reception staff are really engaging and make the checking process straight forward.

We had private dining for the night and the service was not as good as the rest of the experience. The meals did not arrive together and they had to be prompted on a couple of occasions.

Great location as the hotel is in Finsbury square.

",5,2017,09,17
111,Pucker hotel,"We stayed here because it was recommended to us by a friend in his early 20's I thought a it would be a bit far from everything b because of his wot would he really no about nice hotels let me just say he was spot on ! Easy access from 2 tube stations Moorgate and old street not far to walk to St. Paul's cathedral , but the hotel it's self was very nice indeed rooms were very nice we didn't have a view but the was all you could want great bathroom nice beds loverly decor staff were nice friendly and good we have diner there all 4 of us had different things food was very good and good value I had the cheese burger 🍔 best I've had great drinks were wot you would pay for a 5 star hotel so not cheap but I've stayed at the langham and you would have to sell a kidney to pay for the drink there ! The breakfast was ok and I think over priced . There's a roof top balcony that weather permitting would be great to sit out with a drink but it was raining so that was a no go . I would and have recommended this hotel to any one if you book early you will get a good deal I will use this hotel again thanks to all at hotel 9 out of 10 from me 👍",5,2017,09,17
111,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our 20th Wedding Anniversary celebrations.Loved the hotel.Lovely room and lovely staff.Room was amazing, everything you needed including a travel buddy mobile phone to use free of charge.We went for an executive room which was bigger and we had continental breakfast included as well as use of the club lounge which included drinks and canapes.The roof top bar had a fab view too.Definately recommend staying here.It was dearer than some hotels, but as a five star hotel was worth it for a treat or special occasion.",5,2017,09,14
111,First Class Experience ,"No matter the reviews...booking a reservation is always somewhat of a gamble until you arrive and see for yourself. 
At the Montcalm, not only did my family and I see - we experienced! An unforgettable, impactful, yet unobtrusive experience that shall never be forgotten. So good, that we can easily extend accolades to Max and Alex for their extraordinarily attentive service without having to use a pen and paper to remember their names...over a week later! Do you ever find yourself trying to remember what happened the day before? I do. But, when you are immersed in an experience that welcomes you, looks after you, provides for you and makes services available for you based on your trip schedule, you not only feel like you've gotten your money's worth, you feel like you've hit the jackpot! And it makes the rest of your experience in that locale memorable. 
From accessible transportation, to plush accommodations, to the alluring rooftop bar with stunning views and good-looking, classy, fun after-work crowd; what more do you have to ask for? 
Whether you require peace and tranquility or a trendy locale with class and unassuming luxury, the Montcalm exceedingly satisfies. 
Happily, I overwhelming confirm the the positive reviews. The Montcalm is Luxury without airs. A beautiful environment with impeccable touches that make your temporary nesting there feel like home. And if by chance there's something else you need that isn't provided in the room already, there's a high probability that your request will be met with ""of course."" The staff, first class. And if they say they'll be right up, they get there so fast it's like, ""I just hung up the phone and my request or my need is at the door!"" Be sure to spring for the package that includes the continental breakfast and afternoon drinks! It's definitely worth it. By far my best hotel experience and I am professional trained within the hospitality field. The Montcalm is your place to stay when visiting London!",5,2017,09,14
111,Very nice hotel to stay at!,"Never heard about this chain of hotels, but liked our stay! Very nice rooms, friendly staff, had a smartphone you could use and take with you, the room had all the essentials. Also, there is a nice rooftop. Would recommend!",5,2017,09,13
111,City Hotel,stayed for 1 night in a room on floor -1. Windows had frosted glass and woken up at 7am by what sounded like tables being moved on the floor above. Apart from that roof terrace was quite fun and staff were very pleasant and helpful,4,2017,09,13
111,A wise choice of hotel for a city location,"•         Staff were friendly and helpful.
•         Location and property is very good 
•         Room was accurate to the pictures on booking.com
•         Bathroom was spacious, clean and I appreciated the high quality of the fittings
•         Bed was incredibly comfortable.
•         Also appreciated the smaller things like the bottled water, nespresso machine, the iPhone and huge choice of tv channels.

Overall, highly recommended and I will be staying at the hotel again in the future.",5,2017,09,12
111,Beautiful hotel with thoughtful and friendly service...,"We stayed at the Montcalm for a special occasion and it was such a treat!

All the staff we encountered were warm and helpful. We were treated not only to a glass of bubbles on arrival but also a room upgrade, with cakes and rose petals decorating the room (it was a joint birthday/wedding thing).

The hotel decor exudes understated glamour I felt, the carpets from the lift to our room were like walking on air. The bed itself was perfect - a firm mattress topped with crisp white linens and a super soft duvet. We heard no noise from outside the room and the curtains were so ample not a chink of light crept through - we slept wonderfully. The electronic room controls were new to me but were perfectly straightforward and I loved being able to easily identify how to control all the lights, rather than the usual run around trying to figure out which switch did what!

The rooftop restaurant and bar have an excellent view, particularly after the sun goes down and all the buildings around sparkle.We didn't get to try the shuffleboard downstairs but I intend to return and will do; it looked such fun.

I highly recommend the hotel for business stays or for couples/friends looking for a luxurious stay in the heart of the city.",5,2017,09,12
111,A smart choice in the City,"I was reluctant to try yet another hotel chain after years of loyalty with leading hotel brands.  My first try with Montcalm at the Brewery left me less than thrilled. But I decided to try this location since it is so close to my London office. Glad I did!  After a pleasant check in, I went up to my standard room. This is not luxury - but it is a solid choice for most business travelers.  The wifi is free and solid - important since my cell service on the inner room was very spotty.   The bed and pillows were comfortable.  All lighting controls are in the panel by the bed.  They are on the wall, so you have to know which button controls what - little challenging when you are sleep deprived after a red eye. The A/C worked great. The shower was larger and bathroom more workable in size than many U.K. hotels, including major US brands in the City.   Add to all this that there are plenty of channels on the smart TV, a pool and spa in the building (albeit small), and a rooftop bar and you have a winning combination.  ",4,2017,09,12
111,A five-star hotel? Really??,"First of all, this was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in, and I travel on a weekly basis. The room next door can't be blamed on the hotel, and neither can the late night thumping music on Finsbury Square, but the music from the bar meant there was no rest until midnight.

That's ok, because I could turn on the TV. The first couple of nights the BBC iPlayer helped to block out some of the noise (although I would rather have been able to rest) but on the third night it insisted I sign in to something. Doesn't the hotel see to that sort of thing?

So I crawled into bed around midnight each night. The mattress was thick and good quality, so it was a shame the sheets were far too small and hung down the sides without reaching the bottom of the mattress, meaning they rucked up during the night. They weren't tucked in at each end either, so I had to do this myself. 

The bathroom was lovely and the shower excellent, but the towels for some reason smelled of cooking.

The gentlemen who opened the doors were always polite, though never friendly, but once inside it was more of a struggle. There is a narrow corridor to the lifts and stairs, and for some reason they divided this even more into two slivers. One was blocked every night by some random people (private party greeters?) who ignored hotel guests while not letting them pass, and at the same time managed to block access to the first lift. 

The turn down service came between 9.30 and 10pm for some reason, but fortunately the automatic Do Not Disturb sorted that one out.

These are all small things, but the week before this I stayed in a tiny 3-star place in France where the stay was fantastic from start to finish, and in contrast this place was tiring and disappointing. I travel every week to different cities and hotels and this was easily the worst place I have stayed in this year. A real shame, because it had the potential to be an excellent place to stay. I won’t be going back to find out if they get it better in the future.

111,Stunning,"A modern beautiful hotel with very high levels of service. The room was large, high spec, and was quiet.

To be honest, next to the Apex wall hotel in the City of London, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The balance of exceptional customer service, stunning room specification and a beautiful roof top bar and restaurant with stunning views over the city makes this a hotel I would recommend to everyone and will be staying here again myself. 

If you want to know more about the room and hotel facilities, such as swimming pool, visit their website. It does a better job describing it than myself. 

The hotel is ideally situated for bars and restaurants and is a close walk to the tube.

If I could give 6 stars I would. So 5 will have to do. ",5,2017,09,10
111,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful throughout and the rooms are excellent  and luxurious.  All members of staff were courteous, helpful and polite at all times.  The Avery is a must visit - beautiful views.
Looking forward to my next visit",5,2017,09,09
111,Great hotel,"It is a very good hotel. My wife and I enjoyed staying there. Everything was great. The rooms, the facilities and the superb attitude of the staff. We look forward to our next visit in London and staying in the Montcalm Royal House.

111,Quick Night Away,"Nice room and the staff are excellent. The gym and pool are a bit small but if you aren't looking for that as the key reason to travel then it won't be a let down. The rooftop bar is great, but not easy to get a table outside!",4,2017,09,06
111,Ex Workplace,"I booked the Montcalm Royal London House as part of our family around the world trip, based on the fact that I worked in the building in the late 90's.

The check-in on a Friday evening was a little hectic with lots of people hanging around in a very small reception area. There appeared to be a lot of people hanging around the bar area you need to walk through to get to reception.

The rooms themselves were good and well provisioned with all the amenities you need for a stay. I particularly liked the pod coffee machine. There was mood lighting and a good entertainment system on the large wall mounted tv set.

We had breakfast in the rooftop Aviary bar on the first morning which was enjoyable.

The location is ideal for exploring London with being in easy reach of both underground and bus services.",4,2017,09,06
111,"Good service, Good location",My fiancé booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday. The hotel decor is very nice and I will highly recommend this hotel as it is convenient location for sight seeing and business. The spa is awesome and very nice facilities. Suneeta from Guest relation and Krystina on front desk resolved a few issues we had. Dinner in Aviary were a very nice treat. Please check if  there is no private event at Aviary to avoid disappointment. Please check with The Montcalm hotel directly for booking for price match.,5,2017,09,05
111,Amazing stay over bank holiday,"My boyfriend and I stayed on Friday 25th August for one night for our 1 year anniversary. 

We had such a lovely stay at this hotel from the warm welcome at reception to the moment we left with a glass of prosecco. I had mentioned it was our anniversary in my booking and was pleased to receive an upgrade to your club room and then really delighted to see a lovely cake for two as a welcome in my room.  The room was lovely and modern.  We were even more amazed and surprised the next morning to receive a complimentary breakfast as well.   it was really nice touch and all the staff made us feel very welcome.  The extra touches definitely made it feel more special and made it more than the average hotel.  Loved the rooftop bar also and all the decorations.  Oh i nearly forgot to mention the delicious cocktails we tried in the bar.   will definitely like to come back again and had a wonderful stay.",5,2017,09,05
111,Just lovely,"Stayed for one night for our anniversary. Loved that the hotel contacted us prior to our stay to ask if we were visiting for a special occasion. Very impressed that we were given a complimentary dessert, sadly they didnt offer a gluten free option for my partner, however provided a complimentary bottle of wine instead by way of a good will gesture...thank you!

Stayed in a basic double room which was just lovely. Love the wall controls. Comfortable bed. Huge tele. All the extras you could hope for. 

One minor negative was the fact that reception didnt ask if we wanted breakfast or explain how we could add this to our stay. Needless to say we probably wouldnt have had time but would have been nice to know how much it would have been/options available. 

We ate in the rooftop restaurant The Aviary- which was superb! 

We will return.

(One slight point re our room 506 and im sure the management are aware but the windows are severely marked- it almost looks as though someome has been scratching trying to get out.) ",5,2017,09,04
111,An Amazing experience and stay!,It is an amazing hotel to stay in i would definitely be staying here again. The facilities where amazing and i have no faults with my stay or with The Montcalm Royal London House. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an amazing stay in london if its for a night or longer!,5,2017,09,04
111,One night stay,"I stayed only one night so I didn't have the chance of the whole experience, but I really liked the hotel and the people working there were lovely. My room was spacy and comfortable. 
I had dinner at the last floor. Great service and beautiful scenery.
 
Overall it will be a hotel that I would definitely recommend.",5,2017,09,04
111,Great stay!,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate a birthday and we couldn't fault it. 
The room itself was perfect, certainly no complaints there.
The staff were all very helpful and lovely to deal with, especially when we wanted to spend the day in London after check out and we were able to leave our bags at the hotel for the day! 
The roof top bar was great, great atmosphere for a few drinks before heading out for dinner.
The location was good, easy walking distance to two tube stations. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel for a special stay!",5,2017,09,04
111,A great stay at this lovely hotel.,"Having stayed at this hotel a few times on business I stayed there with my family recently. Well the attention from the staff and personal touch was great and made my family feel special. With two young children some places would frown upon them being there but they were welcomed with smiles all around the hotel !!
First Class stay from start to finish. Thanks all at Montcalm RLH for a great experience.",5,2017,09,04
111,A birthday to remember,"I stayed in this lovely hotel the night before my birthday. It's the attention you detail that has stuck with me. My room wasn't quite ready on arrival but I was offered prossecco and somewhere nice to take a load off. 

My room was nicely appointed. There were plush robes and slippers on offer and mood lighting as well as the ability to select a scent for your stay. 

I had been given a little birthday cake which was a lovely touch and a member of the team popped up with a very portable potted plant as a pressie.

There is a turn down service and one of my favourite details - Hermes toiletries!

I dined and had cocktails in the restaurant upstairs, great views!

All in all, a lovely stay with a very attentive staff team. 

You'll have a lovely stay!!",5,2017,09,03
111,A Royal Secret.... try it,"It's my 3rd stay here since November last year and I always feel special when here. 
Bed is very big and comfortable, clean bathrooms, free mobile phone during your stay, great rooftop bar and a beautiful spa for relaxation! 
Breakfast could be better in my opinion... once you commit to giving breakfast, it much be complete as most hotels do (after all how much food can one consume in the morning? )
",5,2017,09,03
111,Perfect Stay!! ,"Wow, just like so many other guests I only have wonderful things to say about our stay. We were only there for one night but the staff were perhaps the most professional and accommodating we have experienced within our stays in London. I don't often write reviews, but they deserve the recognition. Just a big thank you to everyone that looked after us at the hotel, you made my sister's birthday truly special and memorable. No request was too much, from decorating the room with balloons for my sister's birthday, to sorting out a rollaway bed on such late notice and always with a smile. Our room was upgraded and was gorgeous, clean and had everything we needed, loved the range of sky channels that came with the 55"" tv. We were concerned about parking, but we didn't need to be as there is a NCP across the road from the hotel. Full rate for 24 hours was £55, but the hotel offer a discount so we only paid £25 which wasn't bad as it seemed very secure and had loads of free spaces. We will definitely stay here again!!",5,2017,09,02
111,Amazing London hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate a special wedding anniversary  and we were not disappointed. Nothing is to much trouble and the service would be difficult to beat.  We only stayed for 2 nights but most staff had gone that extra mile to know who we were. The rooms deserve their 5 star rating with everything you could need. Views and atmosphere from the roof top bar are amazing.  We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend to anyone as I think it would be very hard to beat.,5,2017,09,02
111,""" Whatever your needs before booking speak with Sinnitta you will not be disappointed. She goes the extra few miles""","I can honestly say that the experience was brilliant the service  was more than exceptional and I felt very accommodated and there was a nice feel about being welcomed and felt comfortable with dealing with all members of staff.  I have stayed around London before and I can certainly say that this place is a definite 10/10 comparing to other places I have stayed at.  

I would highly recommend the Montcalm Royal House London to family and friends after the experience I have just had it was absolutely amazing.

Finally I would like to say a special thanks to Sinnitta as my time at the Montcalm Royal House London was special due to your organisation and preparation it was 100% bang on. 

I am a great believer of "" the staff are a core part of any business"" especially in a customer focused business. You certainly add value to the business and you should be commended for that.

A lovely location in EC2 overlooking Finsbury Square, great for a walk to explore Brick Lane .and Tower of London etc.
Staff were pleasant and welcoming. 
Cocktail bar on the roof terrace overlooks the city.",5,2017,09,01
111,Excellent and modern hotel in central London,"I really enjoyed my stay. In particular, the room was very clean and extremely modern with a lot of new technology, above that which I see at most other hotels I stay at.

The bar was nice with some good drinks although the draught beers had limited selection with a number of empty taps and the shuttleboard should really be free/discounted for hotel guests.

Breakfast was really nice with a great selection of food and pastries. It is served at an amazing roof top bar with stunning views over the city.

Overall I enjoyed my stay and look forward to returned at some point in the future.",5,2017,08,31
111,"Exceptional Staff and Impeccable Service,  5-Stars are not enough.","No matter how new, modern or perfectly decorated a hotel may be, I find it is the staff that makes it memorable. The staff of Montcalm Royal are extraordinary in every way and go out of their way to make you feel welcome and special as guests of the Hotel. 

Dado was exceptional in particular, she anticipated our needs even before we thought about them. Her beautiful smile greeted us on arrival, a glass of well needed bubbly in the lounge, then off to our room which was very modern and comfortable. Thank you Dado.

Dining that evening on the rooftop restaurant The Avery was another fantastic experience. The view was wonderful but it was the attention we received from Catalin that made and completed our experience. 

Definitely will be back.",5,2017,08,31
111,Brilliant,"From start to finish the experience was fantastic. W e were upgraded to a junior suite and as it was a special occasion, guest services brought up some chocolates and some cool fruit drinks. The hotel, staff, views from the terrace were are amazing. would defo return and hope to do so later in the year",5,2017,08,31
111,Superb service!,"The staff from the doorman to the manager were absolutely stellar. I was in for a nice surprise and they all knew about it, hiding the secret behind their grins. Every morning, the manager, Dado, greeted us with a warm hug and made sure our stay was everything we hoped for. The staff made sure we were taken care of in every way. The rooms are nice, the shower is great, dinner in the Aviary was delicious and the view from the rooftop was exactly what I wanted. It's definitely one hotel to check out!",5,2017,08,31
111,"Beautiful room, great location for City","A grand hotel in an excellent location, easy walking distance to the City for my business trip and Liverpool Street station. Beautiful, quiet, spacious room and gorgeous bathroom with quality toiletries, mini-bar and Nespresso. Bathrobes, slippers, fluffy towels and a huge comfortable bed. Free Wifi and fresh milk was made available for tea in the room upon request. Had a few niggles which reflects in the review rating as you don't expect to have these when paying to stay in such a quality hotel: Reception took an awkward while to find my reservation (until I showed my email confirmation as proof), there were a few stray hairs in the sink and bathroom shelf (yeuk!), there were old litter/tissues under the sofa which I moved just to get the angle right for the television. For these reasons, I probably would not stay here again. Check-out was swift and efficient.",3,2017,08,30
111,Faultless,"This hotel is impeccable. It also offers everything you could want from a hotel. 

The decor; it has the perfect mix - chique, plush, comfortable, unique, I could go on. You can wear jeans and tshirt or a suit, you won't feel under dressed or over dressed. 
The staff are attentive yet not over bearing. 
The small touches are important, from the scent in the lift to the scent in your room when you arrive. 
As for the room, spacious for a hotel not just London. The bed is tall and very very comfortable, the bathroom large and beautifully designed. Perhaps the most important thing for a hotel is the noise - the large corridors, carpeted floors and thick walls meant, despite being two floors down from the roof bar and having a child in the next room, I didn't hear a peep - brilliant night sleep in absolute comfort and quiet. 
As for the bars, the ground floor has a funky bar with a good feel, but the rooftop is where we wanted to be with views of the city to compliment your cocktails; yet if you want a pub you can transport yourself in to a side street London pub through a set of doors on the ground floor that feels like you're entering another time zone! 
This hotel is practical too - Moorgate station is a straightforward 5 min walk at most. 
Even breakfast was excellent - good choice and what was there was very nice - and I'm fussy with breakfast! 
Can't recommend this enough and a particular note of thanks to Dado who made our trip all the more memorable with her generosity. 
Will definitely stay here on future trips to London. ",5,2017,08,30
111,Amazing Service,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London this past weekend and I have to say it was exceptional. It was for a special event and when I contacted the hotel to see what packages they had to make the room special etc. I spoke to Sinita, who was more than happy to help. we had an extensive discussion of what we could do to make it special and put together a perfect plan.

A few days later I popped into the hotel to bring some things in the help decorate the room and was greeted by Sinita's colleague Dado. She already knew of our plans and was so excited to help, which was actually so nice! We sat down and had a lovely chat about what we could do with the room, I left feeling very excited and couldn't wait to see the end result.

Upon arrival we were greeted by Sinita, who went out of her way to make sure she checked us in and took us to our room. Sinita was accompanied by a colleague (I didn't catch her name, but I'm sure Sinita will be able to tell you). They took us to our room and handed my partner our key, when the door was opened, the room looked absolutely amazing, balloons, prosecco, macaroons, petals, little hearts, pictures stuck on the walls in a heart shape... it was just perfect. Sinita and her colleague must have spent a long time putting this together and we are very grateful!

I cant stress enough how accommodating the whole team were during our stay, having only stayed at a Montcalm once before, this experience put this hotel in our top hotels list and I cant wait to stay at another one again! 

Please pass on my thanks to the whole team, especially those mentioned above. It made our stay so memorable.",5,2017,08,30
111,Great hotel,"Had a great stay here earlier this month. I was able to check in early after a long flight from Australia.

The staff were so friendly and professional and made me and my partner feel very special and welcome. The hotel was beautiful and incredibly clean with amazing facilities. Dado from the guest experiences team was lovely and walked us to the room personally where we arrived to a lovely message I had requested for my partner in the room which was no trouble to be arranged. We will definitely stay here again. 

Thank you so much for a perfect experience!

111,Third stay," This is the third time I spent the weekend at royal house finsbury. We had something to celebrate and at are arrival I mentioned it to reception and they told me the room would be ready in 1 hour. When we got to the room it was decorated in most beautiful way (see pics attached) and as always all staff from the doorman to the bar restaurant provided excellent service friendliness to gives you the feeling of coming to your family. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and pool which were fantastic! I can highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for perfection efficiency friendliness and relaxed atmosphere  all staff highly professional and somehow they manage to give you the feeling you are only guest in hotel. Of all the hotels I have stayed in i would rate this hotel more than 5*. Tania the front desk manager and her staff and the hostess sinnitta make the icing of the cake they are absolutely fantastic!!! ",5,2017,08,28
111,Exceptional customer service ,"Wow. I have just had a wonderful stay at the montcalm RLH. The staff here were all exceptional - really friendly but professional and non-intrusive. Hands down the best customer service I have experienced in a UK hotel.
The trip was made extra special by finding out I had been upgraded to a junior suite and shortly after arriving received a knock on the door - prosecco and fruit as a welcome gift!
The room was spotless, smelt amazing (i later found out you can choose your room secnt) with a super comfy bed and lots of (easy to use) gadgets - nespresso, interactive TV, panel for adjusting lights/air con/underfloor heating and a free to use smartphone with free calls and wifi to use around London! 
Despite the luxury feel, there was nothing pretentious about this hotel and the staff were truly wonderful. 
I have found my new top place to stay in London :)",5,2017,08,28
111,August bank holiday weekend 2017,"I booked as the location suited & had previously stayed at this hotel on various business trips

On arrival we had a horrendous experience on checking - not one but twice we got keys for rooms already occupied!!! And to compound the issue there was no urgency from any of the staff to allow us to speak to the duty manager....

So things could only get better & they did.  An upgraded room was offered which included breakfast for the 2 days we were staying & 1 nights dinner for 2. To be fair to the Montcalm management they couldnt have been any more apologetic & our stay most certainly improved. Staff were extremely friendly & helpful & on departure the manager again made sure that we got a personal message & further apologies

The one star feature is the rooftop bar with spectacular nighttime views across London ....... unfortunately the prices are also spectacular - £52 for 4 * G&T's. In the words of my immortal son ""that's London for you""",4,2017,08,27
111,Excellent Stay - will definitely return,"My stay at the Montcalm was more than amazing. No words can describe the wonderful experience I had.
Excellent location and facilities. The staff from the porter to the receptionist to the pool and sauna, restaurant and roof top bar employees were truly exceptional. Totally caring and professional. 
You are indeed the standard that luxury hotels should compare to. Keep it up. Will definitely return in the very near future.  Thank you :)",5,2017,08,27
111,Lovely hotel with very caring staff ,"My wife and I stayed at the Montcalm for our 10th wedding anniversary in August and had a lovely time. There were a few hiccups but the staff resolved most of these quickly and compensated us for any inconvenience.

The hotel itself is a little gem with a gorgeous roof top terrace and the aviary bar providing good food with lovely views. The spa and leisure suite are first class and a perfect place to unwind after pounding the streets of London. The rooms are very modern, large and spacious with all the facilities youbwoukd expect from a 5* hotel. My only negative is that the terrace can become quite intimidating and busy in the evenings due to business conferences etc. This can often make you feel second rate as hotel guests. Overall i would recommend this hotel and we would definitely look to stay here again.",5,2017,08,27
111,"Great hotel, attentive staff and amazing breakfast ","I had the pleasure to enjoy a great stay at this hotel as part of a business trip with colleagues. Everything was perfect during our stay but the breakfast this Saturday morning at Aviary definitely gets a special mention. What a nice choice of food and display. 
We arrived late for breakfast but the French manager and team did their best to  to accomodate us. We will be back as soon as the opportunity represents itself . ",5,2017,08,26
111,"Very nice stay, a couple of pointers","I was at this hotel for an extended business stay in London, and it was a very pleasant experience overall, a couple of bugs need ironing out, otherwise all was well.

The hotel is well appointed, comfy large bed, good bedding, nice bathroom, Hermes products, space is a little premium, however, value for money for central london on point.

Any issues you have the hotel do their utmost to attend to. Nice touch to have unlimited Sky TV, and as much bottled drinking water as you could want too. All the staff are attentive and helpful. 

There is a gym which is a little small, especially the weight area, but functional and clean, and the Spa and pool area looks nice too.

The highlight for me was breakfast. There is a very decent selection from a buffet and array of a la carte from a menu, the restaurant itself though is on the roof, and is quiet until lunch time. Spectacular views, good service and decent food, and they will happily serve you outside on the terrace (apart from Thursday when there is some kind of boot camp).

Dont stay on the 8 floor if you want quiet. There is a busy roof top restaurant and bar at this hotel, which is not run by the hotel. It can be quite noisy with people and furniture moving around and the thud of music until 10pm or so, which on nights when I need to sleep were distracting, especially as I had the family room, so young kids may find it distracting.

The tablet style controls were very bright and seems to me there should be the ability to turn them off. I hung a piece of cardboard over the one in my room.

All up though, great stay, nice hotel and I coped...good job Montcalm.",4,2017,08,26
111,"Fantastic Hotel, Wonderful Staff","We - family with 2 teenagers - just stayed for 10 days. The management surprised our daughter with gifts and treats who was celebrating her 15th birthday. All staff were so friendly and helpful and accommodated all our requests. This hotel has new furnishings, comfortable large rooms with speedy WiFi and free 4G LTE smartphone for use in London. Restaurants had good food. The club lounge has free snacks and drinks, wine, beer. Wonderful time in London.... Highly recommend this Hotel.",5,2017,08,25
111,"Perfect rooftop bar and nice hotel, but a few disapointments with the hotel service","Modern hotel in quiet area, good beds, nice room and a lovely rooftop bar. We like the area close to Liverpool station, Shoredich and the marked place in Spitafields .
There were a few things to put a mark on at the hotel that makes me not want to stay there again. Before we arrived we had asked for a room high up, but got one at the ground floor without a view. We arrieved in the night so we were to tired and only wanted to sleep. We have earlier stayed at M by Montcalm in a higher floor with a nice view that we missed at this hotel. There were no room service meny in our room and when we asked in the reception they told us it was in the room, but we looked everywhere and in the end we just called roomservice and ordered. There was only one bathrobe in the room so one of us went to the spa whitout. The spa was ok, but the water machine was broken so we had to go to the gym to get water from that watermachine. The gym was really small. The spa was a bit dirty and one of the saunas was out of order, but the pool was great after a long day of shopping.",3,2017,08,25
111,Amazing!,"A wonderful hotel, I highly recommend it. Lovely rooms, comfortable beds, waterfall shower, big TV, quiet and very clean. Friendly staff who were also incredibly helpful. Complimentary bottled water and Nespresso machine, we also got chocolate truffles on departure. I'll definitely be staying again! ",5,2017,08,22
111,Favourite hotel in London ,"Very good, new feel hotel. HUGE tv in the room with all sky channels, cool touch screen panel in room that controls AC, underfloor heating, do not disturb etc. Great bed and bathroom. Top floor bar was amazing.....just keep the standards up, had to ask for sachets of milk and no shower gel added second night, little things, but they make the difference.",5,2017,08,21
111,"Beautiful property through and through.  Accomidations, Staff, Amenities all top shelf.","I had the opportunity to stay at this property last week whilst on a business trip and I was very pleased.  Overall I had a wonderful time at the Montcalm Royal London House. 

The staff was very friendly and willing to go out of their way to assist.

I've been to the property on two occasions thus and had two types of rooms.  Each had a well-designed layout, useful technology options, comfortable bedding, and washrooms were well appointed.  Overall accommodations are comfortable and easy to use.

I enjoyed the entertaining options at this property and found that I did not have to venture too far to get the experience I was looking for.  The rooftop bar and patio offered a different experience to the shuffleboard lounge and onsite brewpub.

Overall I was very pleased and will be returning to this property.",5,2017,08,21
111,Wonderful,I came here to celebrate a 30 wedding anniversary mainly for drinks on the roof top bar but also for a meal. The views from the bar were spectacular and it was lovely to relax with a cocktail and admire the view. When we went in for the meal the staff were very friendly and a complimentary glass of champagne was much appreciated. The meal itself was lovely. I will be returning at some point.,4,2017,08,21
111,An amazing stay from start to finish ❤️,"We stayed at this hotel whilst in London for a sightseeing weekend in London. On entering this hotel there is a friendly, welcoming feel, the guy on reception was so lovely and explained what's included. We had booked a club room so had the club lounge included which was really worth the extra as you get drinks, nibbles and breakfast included.
Our room was perfect, it had a fab view over Finsbury square. We had a large room with coffee making, water, fruit, gowns and slippers and elemis toiletries. Literally everything you need and spotlessly clean, with the scent of peony and green tea and anti ageing pillows that I had chosen when booking.
The icing on the cake has to be the aviary bar, it is breathtaking! The views are amazing and is a must to visit.
We absolutely loved our stay here and will 100% be back as soon as we can. ",5,2017,08,21
111,"Great location, lovely rooms","I stayed here on business for one night. The check in was quick and efficient, and I got a surprise upgrade (not bad considering I'd booked using rewards from another hotel booking site!). 

The room was on the 5th floor, the view was nothing to shout about, but room was a junior suite. Had complimentary fruit and water, and a full mini bar. The bed was enormous, very comfortable and not loads of stupid cushions all over it! A small sofa, and a massive TV with Sky.

Breakfast was included, but was pretty appalling really! I was offered a coffee after sitting for 10 minutes, and the offering was tiny. A small selection of bread, 3 types of cold meat, teaspoon sized salmon, some small pots of cream cheese and 3 other types of cheese, plus cereals. At no point was I offered any type of hot breakfast, not even an egg! The coffee was a small cup out of a machine that made lattes, hidden away in the kitchen. Given that this is a top notch hotel in London, this was pretty pathetic as breakfasts go. 

The staff were lovely and helpful, and the roof bar is a nice touch. I don't think it's worth the money though, as it's overpriced for what it actually is... Stupid London hiked prices, and there are better places out there...",4,2017,08,20
111,Excellent Experience at Moncalm Royal London,"It was truly a good stay.  The room was lovely and clean when we arrived, the staff were attentive and helpful at reception.  The electrics, etc worked well, and the mood lights raised a smile.  Our double club room was well sized.

The club lounge was fine, although I would prefer arm chairs and coffee tables to the more formal tables and chairs.

The bar downstairs seemed nice – the fresh tank beer was good.

If I had one annoying niggle – that in the evening on Saturday, one of the lifts had been taken over by an event upstairs with a menacing bouncer etc.... which meant we waited ages for the one remaining lift to get to our room.

We will back if the prices remain competitive.",5,2017,08,20
111,London Trip,"Upon our arrival to the hotel my boyfriend received an email, instructing us to let the hotel know about our visit, what the occasion was, and our arrival time. There was a whatsapp option so we took advantage of this. But still on the day of our visit the message had not been replied to or read. He therefore sent an email, this was also not replied to. 

I was so excited to arrive at the hotel after reading all of the many reviews of how guests are greeted with a glass of prosecco. However we seemed to be the only couple not greeted with a drink. We had informed the hotel that the stay was to celebrate a birthday and graduation. I saw other guests being greeted with a glass, I therefore was slightly disappointed due to me being excited to stay in a lovely hotel and be treated upon arrival. 

Our room wasn't ready because we were very early, so the staff kindly took our cases and we went to explore Westminster. The Moorgate tube station is a short walk away from the hotel and was extremely convenient for the whole weekend. We ordered oyster cards and traveling all over London on countless amount of tubes didn't cost more than £18 for the whole weekend. 

Our hotel room was lovely, everything you could ask for! We took some time to get used to the touch screen pad on the wall, but it gave the hotel a really modern feel. We were slightly confused as to why our room had not been cleaned on the Saturday, and I had to phone down for some fresh towels and for someone to take away the room service plates from the night before. 

But I then realised that there was a 'clean room' option on the wall touch pad, so we came to the conclusion that it was our own fault for not selecting this. 

On the Saturday night we ventured up to the rooftop bar before going out. It was beautiful, being in the hotel you would never think that it was there. Walking out of the silent elevator into a trendy bar atmosphere was like being in a film. I ordered prosecco and the barman said they only serve Champage, that was quite pricy at £25 for two glasses. But being in London and in such a lovely bar I suppose that's around average price. 

We ordered room service again on the Saturday, and it took ages, so I phoned down to cancel because it was getting very late, but they said they had tried to deliver it to us. We were both awake waiting for the food up until I phoned, so I believe that they didn't knock hard enough, cause they had the room number from our phone call. We still had to pay for this. 

Overall the hotel is in a great location to get the tube everywhere, from Moorgate we traveled to Westminster, Camden, Covent Garden, Oxford Street. I loved using the tube.. once we figured out how to get on the correct line! I probably would stay at the hotel again, the bed was extremely comfortable and the spa facilities were complimentary and it was lovely to have a morning swim. 

I was only disappointed with the greeting and room service charge. Many thanks to the staff who were always kind and helpful. 

",4,2017,08,19
111,Not the level of service we expected!,"We stayed for three nights at the end of a cruise holiday to see a bit of London. As this was in mid-July, we paid absolutely top dollar for our suite (I was with my niece & her husband). Booking the suite included access to the Club Lounge for breakfast & evening drinks & snacks which we enjoyed. The suite also came with a complimentary cell phone to use during our stay which was a nice touch. We did not use the pool. The ""touchpad"" system for everything in the suite took some getting used to & we discovered that if the ""power card"" fell out (it's on the wall right by the door where it can be easily dislodged when brushing past), it takes a few minutes before everything including the lights go out so that you are left not knowing what just happened. Unfortunately, our main impression concerned the dismal service from the otherwise very pleasant staff. There was a ""conference"" of some kind going on for the entirety of our stay which resulted in the hotel lobby being overrun by people partying at all hours & the casual restaurant being always full & unavailable for other guests. We were also unable to make a reservation at the rooftop restaurant. The biggest fiasco occurred when we tried to order room service the evening before we were leaving. The price for 3 bowls of soup, some buns & 2 bowls of fruit salad was exorbitant, the soup that came was not what was ordered & we had to call twice to get butter (it took over an hour to come). This alleged ""top drawer"" hotel clearly cannot properly service their regular guests while hosting large groups. We chose this hotel for its excellent location & reputation but given our experience, we would not stay there again.",3,2017,08,17
111,Great hotel,"Had a two night stay in this hotel was very relaxing and was worth every penny. Didn't have a chance to try the rooftop bar, but it looks like it'd be amazing. 

A 4-5 minute walk to Liverpool Street station (and district line), which was convenient for getting into tourist London as well as getting to the London Olympic stadium in the other direction. ",4,2017,08,17
111,Great Location in the City,"Delightful staff, relaxing weekend visiting London. Short walk from Moore Street station. Rooms was spacious, bathroom bright and clean. In room amenities were of good quality with a espresso machine. Bed was very comfortable",5,2017,08,17
111,Marvellous ,"I always love old building. This hotel is in old building with beautiful architecture outside. When you walk inside, you will feel totally different. Modern facilities and interior design. We stayed in a huge and clean room. Very modern with comfortable bed. The staffs are excellent. It is expensive though, but worth it. It was one of memorable moments that I have ever had. ",5,2017,08,16
111,An upgrade to the penthouse suite for a special occasion!,"We stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House when coming over to watch the World Championship Athletics. It was also our first night away from our children so it was a big weekend for us! And the hotel did not disappoint. The bars had a fantastic atmosphere, the staff were helpful, polite and professional, and our room was amazing! They upgraded us to a suite on the ninth floor - the balcony and views were incredible and the room was perfect!
A fantastic experience which I couldn't fault - will definitely be returning!",5,2017,08,16
111,Excellent Location,"Hotel is very large, lots of bars and restaurants. Rooms are small. We found the bed uncomfortable there are many red/blue lights on that you cannot switch off. If you switch off the bathroom lights, you cannot charge your electric tooth brush. There is ironing board, iron, tea and coffee making facitilies, a fridge which you can take their drinks out and put your own in. There is towelling robs and sleepers. Staff are very helpful. We also used the swimming pool and jacuzzi, no one showed us where the steam room and sauna was though. The breakfast is served at level 10. Not on the roof top which is called The Avery which is a bar but has comfortable chairs and views over Finsbury Square and London in general.",4,2017,08,16
111,"Lovely hotel with high spec rooms, shame about the noisy bars","This really is a high end hotel with some great facilities. First the location, just on the edge of the City of London and within walking distance of Shoreditch, there is a lot to do in the area. And there are two tube stations nearby with easy access to the West End. 
The hotel itself is modern without being sterile, the public areas are smart and comfortable. The best thing though are the rooms, they are fitted to a high spec. The beds are super comfy, with a choice of pillows. Lighting, air con and the do not disturb sigh are accessed by a touch pad. Although we had an internal looking room, windows take up one entire wall, so the room was never gloomy. The TV was huge, with Sky, Spotify and other choices. The bathroom was bright with a large heated mirror, a large walk in rain shower, which unlike at some hotels was easy to operate. Free water and a Nespresso coffee machine was appreciated in the morning, shame about the uht milk though. 
Staff were efficient, but not particularly friendly. Check in was a bit frustrating. Quite why they need photo id for uk citizens, I'm not sure. Luckily they accepted my work pass. Check out was much better, with plenty of staff on a busy Sunday morning.
The roof bar is impressive but the parade of obnoxious city boys and TOWIE wannabes walking round the hotel was plain irritating. As was the noise from both the bar on the ground floor and the roof bar, especially on Friday night. Luckily it didn't go on too late.
I would stay here again, but I'd check out other options first.",4,2017,08,15
111,Amazing hotel with first class service (with only one slight issue),"Stayed as a treat for my wife to celebrate her birthday. After making the hotel aware it was a special treat, on arrival we were very happy to receive a room upgraded. On arrival to the room, my wife had been left a treat and card which was a really nice personal touch. All the staff go out of their way to make sure you are looked after. We have stayed in many hotels, but the staff here are some of the best I have dealt with

In the afternoon we spent time on the roof top bar. This was amazing and we were well looked after. We were joined by family to celebrate my wife's birthday. On leaving, one family member placed some money behind the bar to allow myself and wife to be treated to a few more cocktails. On leaving the bar, due to not using all the money, I asked if this could be credited to our room. I was told this would be done. 
On checking out I enquired about the additional money. The staff  member told me he was not aware of this and due to the roof top bar being a separate company from the hotel, they would not know anything about this. Following this, I was then required to have what I would state was an embarrassing conversation to conclude where the money had gone. On returning back to the rooftop bar, the manager there also knew nothing about it stating I should have advised a manager about the money when leaving the bar. The whole situation was dealt with very affectively but left a slight sour taste in my mouth

I have gave this 5 star as regardless of this small issue, the hotel is fabulous",5,2017,08,15
111,Amazing hotel in an amazing city,"I spent a week at the Montcalm Royal London house on a business trip. The hotel was fantastic. Service was incredible, staff were friendly but the general atmosphere of the place is what wins you over. Maybe it was because i was there during summer but there is a vibe about the place that makes you feel like you are in the perfect place. The restaurant appears to be a trendy spot because there is always a que to get in and the views form the deck on the 10th floor at sunset is probably one of the reasons why. Food is tasty and the wait staff are all friendly (and from every corner of the globe) its all fascinating.The alcohol very expensive but that is the case everywhere in London I suppose. Was also close to Mooregate station so travel is pretty easy.",5,2017,08,15
111,1 night stay birthday treat,"Amazing. The staff were incredible, all so attentive and friendly. The room was exceptional, the rooftop bar is amazing and also the use of the pool and jacuzzi was brilliant. Would recommend staying here too everyone",5,2017,08,13
111,Excellent Hotel,I stayed for one night and had dinner in hotel too. I was very impressed. Efficient and friendly check in. The bar and restaurant were very welcoming with a knock out view. Coal oven cooked steak was delicious. The room was great with a excellent bathroom. Thank you for great value stay.,5,2017,08,13
111,Exceeded expectauons,Never been here before and booked one of the cheaper rooms so was pleasantly surprised to find I'd been upgraded and given a quiet room on the eighth floor. Full length widows gave a great view of Finsbury square and room itself was faultless with a really nice bathroom and shower. Went to the rooftop bar which I wasn't bothered for as it was very busy but on the whole my short stay was excellent. All staff were very friendly and helpful too,5,2017,08,12
111,Simply Fabulous!,"We had the most wonderful stay!It is the best hotel we have stayed in for a long time. The service and facilities were simply perfect.

We stayed in one of the Montcalm club rooms so we had access to the club room.  This was a brilliant place and well worth the extra money we paid. The quality of food and drinks on offer was fantastic. 

The room was perfect in size and spotless.  It had all the extras we would expect from a quality hotel, slippers dressing gown, tea, coffee and water.  We were also impressed at having an umbrella and phone we could take out with us.  

The bathroom was a brilliant size. I loved the extra magnifying mirror and the shower was powerful and again a very good size.

The staff were also fantastic. Everyone we met were lovely to us and you could tell would go out of the way to help you.

We also dined in the aviary bar on the Saturday night. What a beautiful bar and restaurant and the views, well what can I say. Pure perfection

The area surrounding is quiet on a weekend but a welcome escape from the usual hussle and bussle of London and there were plenty of places around us to eat and drink. However you also had everything you could ask for in the hotel.

We will definitely return and are big fans of the hotel. I have been telling everyone how amazing it is.",5,2017,08,12
111,Top class hotel,"We were in London for the International Athletics championships at the Olympic stadium. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was well equipped hi- tech and with a Very  comfortable bed. The room was very quiet, no street noise.
The roof bar and restaurant has  fantastic views of  the  City of London. It was a  pity we didn't get the opportunity to  have a cocktail or meal in the Aviary. 
The breakfast was served in the Club room. Continental style. Only criticism for a luxury hotel, was the lack of a good variety of fresh fruit.",5,2017,08,10
111,Best hotel on our trip,"We loved our stay at Royal Montcalm. Everything was wonderful, from beginning to end. Every single person that we met was so friendly and so accommodating. I never saw anyone that didn't have a smile on their face. The beds were so comfortable, probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The rooms are immaculate and serviced twice a day. We also really enjoyed the Jacuzzi and Pool. We took advantage of it every afternoon after our busy day. Thank you for such a wonderful experience, and we will certainly come back!",5,2017,08,10
111,"An oasis of calm, with some lovely liveliness too!","Great location, lovely roof top terrace bar and restaurant plus two other bars and restaurants at street level - too much choice! Really comfortable rooms with lots of great facilities - a peaceful night's sleep as Finsbury Sq is relatively peaceful too.",5,2017,08,10
111,Luxury stay in the city,"We stayed here as we wanted a room with an additional bed for our 3 1/2 year old daughter and I was so impressed with the hotel we are looking to stay again. The staff were amazing, polite and helpful. Everyone of them made an effort.  Room was spacious (junior suite), bedding was extremely comfortable and there plenty of complimentary extras. Strongly recommend if staying in the city.",5,2017,08,10
111,Too expensive to be missing basics...,"I went on a business trip and paid a fairly high price for the room. Overall staff was friendly, room is modern and clean, but on my very first morning there was no hot water. Later I complained and they apologized - too late as I had to take a cold shower. The room cost close to U$300, therefore I think this not acceptable.",2,2017,08,09
111,Dr ,"The Montcalm Hotel Royal London House , Finsbury Square. 
I have from July 2016 enjoyed the fabulous Terrace and the Sunday breakfast in the Aviary and spent two weekend as a over night guest in the hotel. It is an understatement o say this hotel 5*. I have stayed in many luxury hotel in the world from Dubai to America should certainly have 6* everyone fro the door man to the top floor are always very friendly service minded patient and doing whatever is possible for there guest. The double rooms That I used were excellent everything was to the best of standards I would also like to mention the chamber maids and they excellent cleaning skills,24/7 they serve you to the the very best of quality at reception savia, sinnitta and Tania have been exceptionally service minded as I faced some office problems I can highly recommend this hotel in the heart of London to whoever visits London.

111,Absolutely fantastic!!,"The best hotel I've ever stayed in!! Such a good experience!
Everything was great from the welcoming at arrival with complimentary bubbles, the size, cleanliness and comfort of the room (we had a club double), the location of the hotel, service from the staff, the club lounge, the rooftop bar with fantastic views to the spa area which I highly recommend you try during your stay. ",5,2017,08,09
111,A real gem of a hotel! Would definitely recommend!,"A real gem of a hotel !

Very friendly and helpful staff. 
We had a problem on our first night as we were in a lovely suite on the 3rd
floor but being light sleepers, we were disturbed by a humming generator
outside our room in the night. The next day the reception staff immediately
apologised and moved us to an upgraded suite on the 7th floor which was very
quiet. They even gave us a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates as an
apology , which we thought was a really nice touch. 
Rooms are very modern , spacious and luxurious, fully functional.
Rooms are also very clean.
Room service menu, very good.
Burger and fish finger sandwiches in Burdocks (hotel bar) were delicious.
Staff were very attentive to our needs and made us feel welcome. 
Gym very good, has all the main equipment required. 
Pool beautiful but restrictions re kids usage so check the times in the
information in the room.
Overall really great place to stay, good value. Would most definitely
recommend and we plan to return in the future. 
Top tip, invest in club room facilities.",5,2017,08,08
111,Luxury hotel,"This hotel is exactly as it appears in the hotel, it's really modern, clean and comfortable. Rooms are well equipped with everything you could possibly need, huge TV's with Sky, and electronic controls. It was really well furnished. Hotel staff were very friendly. Room service a bit pricey but generally very good. Good location to stay in, although all shops in the City are closed over weekends which isn't ideal.",5,2017,08,08
111,Excellent hotel! Great staff! Loved our stay,"Stayed during mid July for a personal cum business trip. Its a great hotel at the center of London. Staff was very polite and helpful. Room service was prompt and food was excellent. What I loved the most is their outstanding customer/guest service. There was a small glitch in the centralized lighting system, which they swiftly fixed, but next day they left a small box of chocolates along with an apology note. We loved the gesture. Not only this, we loved their small espresso cups (my wife have been looking for those types to match her set) and asked them if we could buy from them. They were (staff named Maxim at the reception specifically) kind enough to offer a new pair (packed) free of cost. I mean at how many places you would see such nice staff who go out of their way to help. I would highly recommend the hotel to my friends and families. ",5,2017,08,08
111,Fantastic Central Hotel,"We have just departed London after staying at the Montcalm Royal.  Our accommodation was beautiful.  A lovely room, a good size and the little touches of fruit and chocolate on arrival was unexpected and a lovely touch.
Staff we all great.  With ready smiles and helpful answers it was good to know nothing was a problem for anyone.
Would recommend to others who wish to be central to most of areas of the city. A good walk but easy to the river, London Tower Bridge etc.  Minutes to Mooregate station.  Vibrant restaurants and bars also close to shows via train or taxi.",5,2017,08,07
111,Weekend away,"I stayed at The Montcalm Hotel in Finsbury Square. It was one of the best hotels we had stayed in. I stay away a lot in various hotels for work and this hotel exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. The hotel was flawless and had some amazing features and was finished to the highest quality. 

I want to say a massive thank you to the staff especially Dado who was one of the staff there who made our experience every bit more pleasurable.",5,2017,08,07
111,EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel, and in particular the service.  A VERY special thanks to Dado (reception ambassador) who was attentive to our every need and  made our stay exceptional.  As well to Tommy - Concierge who arranged theater tickets train travel and dinner, and to Mira in the club lounge who was always had a smile on her face and was a delight.  They should all get a raise!   I travelled there with my husband (who was on business) and our two sons.   We stayed 7 nights.  Having missed breakfast upon arrival, Dado arranged immediately for the continental breakfast to be sent to our room.   They quickly accommodated us with a junior suite room for four, so we didn't have to rent two rooms (which would have been cost prohibitive for us).  Dado personally gave us a tour of the hotel, and made a reservation for us at the roof top restaurant (which was great).   We ate at both restaurants on first floor AND ordered room service and were very happy with all the options.  The club lounge provided excellent food in the morning and good nibbles/spirits in the evening.  An amazing perk of the hotel.   We also used the spa pool/hot tub. several times...very clean and well maintained.   The massage I got was one of the best.   Location of the hotel was great as it was 5 minutes from Moorgate Station, and walking distance to St. Pauls, the Tate, Borough Market, Tower of London, etc. I can't think of another place I'd rather stay.",5,2017,08,07
111,Absolutely Loved my Stay,"I stayed at the Montcalm for three nights whilst in London on business.

I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  Great welcome on arrival from the staff who were only to happy to help me with check in and any request I made during my stay.

The room I had was great.  It was clean and well appointed and full of great technology.  The hotel has a luxurious feel to it which I really liked.

I also loved the roof top bar which was fantastic for a couple of post work drinks.

Will definitely stay here again on future business trips to London.",5,2017,08,07
111,Excellent service throughout,"My partner and I were celebrating her birthday over the weekend. I chose this hotel as the location was ideal for where we wanted to be in London. On arrival it was clear I made the right decision on booking this hotel, the staff upon check-in were so amazing, especially Doda who went out of her way to make our stay more pleasurable.The spa in the hotel was amazing also. This hotel certainly has a feel of superb luxury with its decor and furnishings. I would highly recommend this hotel for any couple wanting some luxury time together; you're certainly well looked after by the staff. Thank you",5,2017,08,07
111,Love this hotel,"Just finished a 3 night stay at this hotel and found it excellent for Central London. Staff were at attentive and extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast and Club Lounge were small and friendly, didn't get enough time in Lounge but had busy schedule. Food in Aviary was of a good standard and place had a nice feel, not quiet but that added to the atmosphere. Nice open area on rooftop, with good views.Bedroom was very comfortable, pillows to die for; superbly finished throughout and immaculately clean. Only slight problem for me was aircon, wasn't particular hot outside but even on full rooms were a little warm...oh and those room freshners, spent more time vibrating and alarming :)
Will definitely stay here again !!",5,2017,08,07
111,5* hotel with 5*hospitality,"I wish to thank all the Montcalm Royal team who made our special celebration stay so relaxing, enjoyable and welcoming. From the checking in desk with prosecco, to the very attentive and friendly staff on the 10th floor, the whole experience was a pleasure. The room was spacious, the bed was truly one of the best Ive slept in for a long time, we loved (and played with) the gadgetry changing the mood lighting, 4G television gave us a treat after our west-end show for a free Sky movie in bed,and the Club lounge access was a fabulous birthday extra for my husband. We come to London a lot, and husband stays for business frequently too. Montcalm Royal will now be my No.1 choice as I feel the genuinely friendly, professional but relaxed service is something that is missing in so many top chains in the city. Hopefully next time I will get a chance to use the spa which looked lovely.
I wish you all wore little enamel name tags so I could pass on my praise to Montcalm HO, so please do so on my behalf. Until next time.....",5,2017,08,07
111,Always a pleasure to stay in Montcalm Hotel,I have stayed several times in Montcalm Royal . Staff cant do enough to help they are always curtious with a smile on their faces. Food excellent and delivered extremely quickly when ordered as room service. Avery Bar has great view of london. Room's have everything you need with fresh fruit and water complimentary. The bed is amazing. Wifi never an issue with access. This is my go to hotel when in London.,5,2017,08,06
111,"Fantastic staff and service, lovely room, great experience","This trip was arranged as a surprise anniversary present and staff went above and beyond to make our stay truly special. We received an upgraded room, complementary drinks on arrival and personalised card and bottle of wine in our room which were all much appreciated and really added to our experience. The jacuzzi and pool, available to guests, was a welcomed addition, and the Aviary on the 10th floor had excellent lines of communication with the rest of the hotel and great food and views.

Dado, at the front desk, really looked after us and made our evening complete with the additions to our stay. Thank you very much for our stay, we would definitely recommend this to anyone and we will be seeing you all very soon I am sure!",5,2017,08,06
111,Hotel stay,"We had a two night stay in the Montcalm Royal, coinciding with a visit to the world athletics championships. It was a memorable and enjoyable visit. The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating, particularly Dado, who took great care of our family. We had breakfast on the roof terrace, which was fantastic. The rooms were excellent, we're now in another hotel in Edinburgh, but wishing we were back at the Montcalm. Thanks for making our two days so memorable.",5,2017,08,06
111,Service fit for a king.. and his queen..,"A birthday weekend made absolutely unforgettable. I have to personally thank Dado and Gary for honestly going above and beyond what most hotels would offer and truly provide a service which will have me rebooking with the hotel again and again.
I celebrated a surprise birthday weekend last weekend which was all pre organized. 
Dado and Gary both upgraded my room and offered bubbly on the house which was such an incredible gesture. 
All the staff members made me feel welcome and all the additional personal touches in and around the hotel really make you feel that you're in London at all. 
The views from the balcony are spectacular.  I honestly feel they provide better views than the roof top gardens in London which are a stones throw away from the hotel. 
Accessibility to Moorgate/Liverpool street station are genuinely 5-7 minute walk away.
This is the choice hotel in London, truly 5 stars with 5-star service.
I've recommended this hotel to friends and family already and I'm more excited about them visiting this hotel so they can experience true quality and service. 
Thank you for the experience, i cannot wait to meet you again.",5,2017,08,06
111,Fantastic service,"This hotel is wonderful. The decor and ambience are amazing, and all staff will go out of their way to say hello to you and to help. 

We only stayed over one night for a birthday celebration, so I didn't get to enjoy as many of the facilities as I would have liked, but from what I could observe looked really good! The roof top bar when breakfast is served is definitely a highlight! 

There were a couple of small issues during our stay, which were raised and dealt with at the time by friendly and professional staff, and I mentioned this on the survey emailed to me after. 

Since then, both Savia and Daniel (Duty Managers) have contacted me to ensure that my next visit to the hotel will be perfect. Outstanding service. 

I would recommend anyone to stay here, and even if something doesn't live up to the expectations, talk to the staff, and they will go above and beyond to assist you. ",5,2017,08,02
111,Smart but friendly hotel - very much recommended,Excellent experience here starting with a complementary drink and very welcoming staff giving a personal touch. The spa was good and the rooftop Aviary bar superb. Our room was among the best we have had - excellent furnishings/facilities and a terrific view.,5,2017,08,02
111,"Dan,Essex","Superb. And an added bonus was the chap with the hot dog van parked outside. Apparently he's been there years and is very popular with cabbies and those of us who suffer from late-night munchies. 

I can recommend the bacon and egg torpedo. ",5,2017,08,01
111,"Lovely hotel, outstanding staff!","I was looking for a good hotel to spend one night in after a very busy weekend and after seeing such brilliant reviews, I chose the Montcalm RLH for a night in July. 

Upon entering the hotel (which is just a few minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station), the reception staff were very attentive and I was soon able to check into my room. I did experience a few small issues with the room which were merely down to miscommunications between hotel departments. However, I spoke to the reception staff who were more than helpful and I was then contacted personally by the House Manager, Gary, and these issues were resolved extremely quickly. 

My room was comfortable, very spacious 
and the shower was fantastic! I also enjoyed using the electronic touch pads to control lighting and air conditioning etc. Having access to Sky TV was also a very nice touch, as were the complimentary slippers (the most comfortable hotel slippers I've found so far!)

Unfortunately on this visit I didn't have time to use the restaurant or rooftop bar, but I am looking forward to a return visit very soon and hope to have the chance to make use of them then. A huge thank you to the staff who created an experience that I won't forget!",5,2017,08,01
111,A Fabulous Hotel,From the first entrance you will be able to see that this is a hotel that will deliver a special experience. The staff on reception were extremely proficient but also very helpful and charming. Our room was a perfect combination of luxury yet homely. The continental breakfast was just right to start off the day. And the shuffleboard bar was a great place to start off an evening out on the town. All in all I can't rate highly enough.,5,2017,07,30
111,Outstanding!,"I love this hotel and will go back anytime possible! The staff makes you feel very welcome and at home and they will provide any support needed. I loved the dessert and hand written card that waited for us when we arrived because of our anniversary. Such a nice treat! The rooftop terrace is fabulous and so is the breakfast that guests enjoy either in the adjoining restaurant or on the terrace. The spa is also very beautiful and clean, like everywhere in the house. We relaxed in the pool and whirlpool in the late evening - it is open until 10 pm which is really cool. 
The location of the hotel is also perfect. You are close to everyhting.",5,2017,07,30
111,5* experience from start to finish,"On entry, check-in was a little bit slow but we were both served a glass of prosecco. 
The staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful. As it was my 21st birthday, they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room and delivered a selection of macarons with a small bottle of wine. This was a lovely surprise and I am very grateful. 
The room was tidy, unfortunately our view was of a car park. We were also woken up by drilling, not sure if this was part of the hotel or another building outside. The hotel is clean to a very high standard, however, the pool area should be cleaned more often. There were lots of empty cups left around and a few clumps of hair along the sides of the pool.
In comparison to the Shoreditch branch, this hotel is less busy but the rooms and pool areas are much smaller. ",5,2017,07,30
111,Couldn't recommend more highly,"I've stayed in the Montcalm a few times and I couldn't be more impressed.

The place is beautiful, the rooms, the decor, the pool. The breakfast is incredible, there's an option to have an English breakfast though I usually opt for poached eggs and smoked salmon. 

Despite the amazing building and food, the staff and service are, to me, the best thing about this hotel. Every person I've dealt with has been friendly and hospitable and do all they can to make the stay as comfortable and luxurious as possible- Dado especially.

Thanks so much for another great stay!!",5,2017,07,30
111,Family weekend,Stayed here with family for in laws 80th birthday surprise. The staff were fantastic and went out of their way to make the weekend special. Loved the peaceful roof top terrace. Can't rate this hotel enough. ,5,2017,07,30
111,Beautiful hotel,"130 of us stayed at this lovely hotel for a business conference. My room on the eight floor was fabulous, a good size very clean and views across the square and of the London Skyline. The bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was at the rooftop restaurant and was good quality with a good choice.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,07,25
111,Posh Stay,"In not so posh area of London is a very posh Hotel. Price of room matches the decor of the Hotel. In walking distance more then enough pubs, restaurants and nightlife. Ask for a room facing the square as the backrooms have no view.",4,2017,07,25
111,"Amazing hospitality, staff, rooms and view from the Aviary on the 10th floor","From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were delighted. The concierge took our bags and carried them to reception where we were met by an extremely friendly and helpful lady who gave us a glass of fizz each. She was so welcoming. Our room was also very modern and had sky tv. The hotel just feels like luxury, the decor and furnishings are gorgeous.

Be sure to take the lift to the tenth floor and take in the view at the Aviary bar. It really is stunning.",5,2017,07,25
111,One of the best hotel in London,"Good location in the heart of the city.Very quiet, clean and comfortable rooms. Stuff is polite and helpfull. Amazing view from the terrace.  Special thanks for Raluca and Daniel! Real five star hotel!",5,2017,07,24
111,Excellent stay!! ,"We had the most amazing time at the hotel. The experience was perfect and I could not think of anything that could have been done differently. The rooms were large, clean and trendy, as is the whole hotel. Hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant and made our stay all that much better. The roof top bar was amazing!! I would certainly recommend this hotel and I will be returning soon! ",5,2017,07,24
111,A wonderful Birthday weekend in London,"Booked a 2 night stay via last minute.com at a fantastic price. normally stay in Mayfair or similar but couldn't get any availability so went for the Montcalm even though it was in the city. From the moment we arrived the service was exceptional, you would expect this from a 5 star hotel but all staff went above and beyond. the guest services team arranged for a birthday treat for my wife and we were met with champagne, chocolates and rose petals on the bed, a really nice touch. The aviary bar upstairs was a great venue to enjoy the sunshine and see the London skyline, even though it was very busy, service again was slick and efficient. i did have reservations over the location as we lke to stay around the west end, but this stay ended up being one of the best we have had in London, short walk from Liverpool street tube got us to Oxford street in 10 mins and we found some really great places to eat/drink in the city that we would normally have never found. A huge thanks to the team at Montcalm for making the weekend a great success, will definately return.",5,2017,07,24
111,"Boring breakfast, Good Rooms","Wish there was an ounce of  variety in the breakfast - after a week of exactly the same dishes I wish I was moving to another place next week... 

Other than that it's a very convenient place which has an excellent location nearby tube stations.",5,2017,07,21
111,Amazing,"Our son paid for a weekend for us in this amazing hotel. (He joined us from USA)
From check in to check out, the staff were extremely professional and friendly , nothing too much trouble. Bar staff informative and helpful.
Not too far to walk for sights. Bedrooms luxurious . Highly recommended .if we are ever
in Capitol we will definatley book this hotel",5,2017,07,21
111,Just a one night stay but with an added bonus.,"My wife and I stayed for a Saturday night as I had a works function to attend, as soon as were arrived we were greeted by the door man who took are bags to reception and as soon as we were walking to the desk I noticed that all the staff behind the desk acknowledge our arrival with a smile even if they were busy with someone else.

Within 30 seconds we were asked if we would like a complimentary glass of prosecco which the wife took and stated it was one of the best she has had, I myself just had a glass of lemon/mint water that is on tap at the reception.

As we were only staying for a night and knew it was somewhere we were only going to get changed and we would be back late we had booked just a standard double room, but to our great pleasure and surprise the (as things like this never happen to us) the lady behind the desk explained and apologised that they were upgrading us to a junior suite as there had been a mix up with the room and this had been doubled booked.

As our new room wasn’t quite ready and again apologising for this she asked us to wait 10 mins and if we would like to wait in a seating area she would come and get us. Within 8-9 mins she found us and we booked in and again she apologised for the delay.

The room was amazing as the French doors opened to a seating area overlooking Finsbury Sq that what I think can only be used by the 4 suites or booked for a function, the mini bar was very well stocked the bed was possibly as good as the one at home, bath robes on hand, 45-50” TV to watch while I was waiting for the wife to finish getting ready…… Aircon, hair dryer, tea/coffee on hand loads of room and everything else you would expect to find in a top hotel.

Here it goes my only gripe….as we got to bed at around 03:30 and if I would of payed the full amount for the suite the last thing I would of wanted at 08:00 was the sound of someone dragging the furniture along to floor in the outside bar area in the floor above, I understand that things like this need doing but lift the tables don’t drag them, due to the state I was In I just buried my head in the pillow and partly died again.

Top hotel, top staff and they are a credit to the work that makes a great hotel.",5,2017,07,20
111,WOW... just wow!!!,"What can i say!! Our stay was AMAZING!. My husband organised us a night at the montcalm on 1st july 2017 as we was going to watch adele (sadly she cancelled). He had informed the staff it was my birthday aswell as our wedding anniversary, he organised with them ballons, rose petals and champagne in the room 😊. But first arriving at the hotel early we were greeted at reception with prosecco. Our room was not ready however the fabulous staff were happy to keep our bags untill we returned. 
After a few hours sight seeing we returned to our room. A club double. It was beautifull. Spacious, the most comfy bed i have ever slept in. All latest mod coms including touch screen pad for lights, mood lights etc. As i said earlier the staff had decorated our room with beautiful fresh rose petals on the bed, ballons, a birthday card, champagne on ice and chocolate dessert!. After an amazing shower we headed out for a night in london!
Waking up in comfy bed, no noise all night could be heard from our room we slept like babies. We made our way to the spa for a lovely sauna and a quick swim. The facilites were spotless, clean and a lovely fresh feel.  Breakfast we had in the club lounge. Continental was included in our price and included smoked salmon, hams, cheeses, pastries, breads, cereals, yougurts etc. A choice of Tea and coffes were available with table service. 
We can honestly say it was the best hotel we have ever stayed with in london. We came home feeling pampered and refreshed. Cannot thank all the staff enough and will defiently be returning. We havent stopped recommending to all our friends. WELL DONE MONTCALM!! and thank you! ",5,2017,07,18
111,Their staff was absolutely bar none the best!,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House a month ago while visiting London. I called in advance as I wanted to know details about this hotel vs. their other property in Shoreditch. I spoke to Gabby at the front desk who was extremely helpful. She checked with management and was able to offer me an upgrade to my room. When I walked into the suite, there was a handwritten note from Gabby and some exquisite chocolate truffles she had left, which was amazing. I was so impressed by her helpfulness, thoroughness, and attention to detail! 

Later, my boyfriend ended up getting nauseous from some food we had outside of the restaurant and Cal who works at the bar on the 1st floor of the hotel went above and beyond to give me soda water, limes, and mint for my boyfriend. Cal even helped me carry all of this up to the room. 

I've stayed at many very nice hotels all over the world and this treatment from their staff made this experience the best I've every had! The room was gorgeous, amenities were top notch, and the rooftop bar was super chic and fun. Thank you so much, Gabby and Cal! I will be staying here again because of you!",5,2017,07,18
111,Great hotel.  Great Value,"Absolutely brilliant - and brilliant value. Special thanks to Dado for the welcome at reception and the kind gifts when she learnt we were there to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. Sorry we didn't manage to drink everything! 

Great staff and great rooms. My only comment on the room is that the iPad light control is rather too bright at night - would be great if it could be switched off. 

Had lunch in the bar downstairs - tuna salad and chicken Caesar, and both were cooked/made to perfection. 

Dinner at the Aviary was awesome for the birthday dinner. What a great venue and we were superbly looked after. Really nice food. We were required to have a little patience with our cocktail waitress as she was obviously new with little English - but that was ok, she was very willing and we all have to start somewhere!

Will be back again soon I hope. Thanks to all the staff",5,2017,07,18
111,Short night,"Hardly fair to review, really. Checked in and left again within 15 minutes, back late and left early morning. All worked fine except breakfast which doesn't start until 7 so not even a coffee leaving at 6.45.",3,2017,07,15
111,Wonderful service; convenient city location,"The hotel opened recently and the staff and management are extremely accommodating and eager to please. The rooms are nice but not overly large. There is a nice pool and a small exercise room.The restaurant is excellent. We had breakfasts and dinners there and enjoyed them very much. It is also close to the tube and within walking distance to many excellent restaurants.
There were a couple of minor glitches, probably owing to the newness of the hotel and staff. The fire alarm went off one evening by mistake and the alarm for the fragrance machine went off because the battery needed changing. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and hated to leave. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting the city location.",5,2017,07,14
111,A wonderful stay for a birthday celebration,"An amazing experience! I booked the Montcalm for my boyfriends birthday and the service was amazing from the booking stage to checkout. Sinnitta arranged room decorations for me and my boyfriend was blown away. We received an upgrade which meant a bigger room and breakfast at the aviary which added to his special day. We also had access to the club lounge and even when canapes were over, there was a lovely waitress who helped to gather up some lovely cheeses for us.

Prosecco upon arrival was a lovely touch and the team did such a good job and in all honesty, I was a demanding individual. Thank you once again to Sinnitta, the check in team, the other members of the guest experience and the club lounge waitresses. 
We will definitely be coming back!",5,2017,07,13
111,Weekend Stay at Lovely Hotel!!,"I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London with my husband from 7th - 9th July.  We arrived late in the evening and as mentioned in previous reviews, you enter the hotel via the bar area which was incredibly busy and the queue to the lifts for the roof bar was stretching to the front door.  We had no issues passing this area, and made our way to reception.  Check in was smooth, and the staff were very polite.  We were given our cards to our room, and made our way to third floor. 

Room 317 unfortunately has no view at all, smaller than some I've stayed in previously but well designed and incredibly comfortable.  Lots of amenities, including kettle, coffee maker, water, mini bar, snacks, sewing kit, shoe cleaning etc.  Large TV with Sky channels to choose from.  Bathroom toiletries are Elemis which is one of my favourite brands, our room didn't have a bath just a lovely big walk in shower.  The best bit about the room is the room controls on the walls, you can set the aircon, room privacy, under floor heating, and the lighting.  You can choose mood lighting (various colours), floor lighting, bathroom lighting etc. It was a really nice touch.  The bed is one of the comfiest I've slept in!

The hotel is located in Finsbury Square, and whilst I am not used to this area of London, the literature in the room lists restaurants/pubs within the area for you to visit which was very handy.  Five minute walk from Moorgate tube or ten minute walk to Liverpool Street or there is an NCP car park right outside.  The hotel is also directly in front of various bus stops so incredibly easy to find and get to.

The rooftop bar was packed on the Friday evening, but we did visit on Saturday evening.  A nice area outside with views across London, and an outside bar too.  The restaurant was fully booked both nights so we didn't get a chance to eat there.

Only one issue over the weekend, we decided to have breakfast in bed on the Sunday before checking out.  At 10pm the night before, we placed our breakfast order on the door handle.  In the morning when the time we selected passed, I checked the door handle and the order was still hanging there.  I tried unsuccessfully for half an hour to get through to room service to order the breakfast.  In the end I went down to Reception who dealt with it straight away, were incredibly apologetic and our breakfast was delivered to our room within 10 minutes.  I was very satisfied with the way they sorted it out.

All in all, an excellent hotel, one I would definitely stay at again, and would recommend to others.",5,2017,07,12
111,Nice hotel but....,"Just spent 3 nights at the Montcalm Royal House and first impressions were excellent with a lovely modern decor and warm welcome. We were greeted with a glass of Prosecco whilst we waited for check in (which wasn't the quickest but could have been bad timing). Only two people on the desk and then a third joined as the queue grew bigger.

The staff are fantastic and very polite/friendly. We were given the key to our room but when we entered the room the bathroom smelt of drains/damp so we rang reception and were quickly moved to another room (we were given chocolates and wine for the inconvenience which was a nice touch.

The rooms are nice with huge TVs and a mobile 'Handy' smartphone but we could not get the smartphone to work. No views from the rooms other than the building next door and I wouldn't expect any of the other rooms had a view based on the the building layout. The room had a hairdryer, ironing board, coffee machine, air con, underfloor heating in bathroom if needed and the bed was very comfy but very soft so anyone who likes a firm bed may not think so.

The hotel has a Spa which has free use f the small pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna as well as paid treatments if needed. There is a rooftop bar (Aviary) on the 10th floor although the view does not seem to reflect the gallery on the hotel website (cannot see the Gerkhin) and we were not allowed to enjoy the terrace on Friday night because it had been reserved (which we didn't feel was fair considering we we paying guests of the hotel). We stayed in a hotel in New York, which had a roof top bar being used by a private party, but we were still allowed to use it because we were paying guests and this is how it should be.

we enjoyed our stay but felt certain issues let the hotel down. I would summarise the pros and cons as follows:

Pros:

Very modern
Clean
Good facilities
Nice rooms

Cons:

Location - near Moorgate but if you want the majority of tourist attractions then you would be better being more central. Not much around the vicinity of the hotel either.
Aviary - not allowed to use terrace at all times
Check in/out - Very slow
TV - had sky as an option on main menu but not available so shouldn't have it on menu.

Overall, the hotel is good but it felt like it was aimed at the business guest.",4,2017,07,10
111,3 Night Stay,"I stayed here with my husband - we are a couple in our mid-30s. We like a luxurious room, nice spa, good customer service and just something that wee bit different or extra in a hotel - without paying over the odds. For us, the Montcalm Royal London House ticked all of those boxes. The things that made this hotel top class in our book were:
1) A decent sized, contemporary room with modern features e.g. underfloor heating in the bathroom and nightlights that could be operated with an easy to use keypad.
2) A nice spa area - small but perfectly formed with gym, sauna, steam room, pool and most importantly a jacuzzi that can be switched on when it suits you rather than having to wait for those automatic cycles.
2) Nice extra wee touches - glass of fizz at check in, shuffleboard game in downstairs bar and rooftop terrace with fantastic views.
3) The club room lounge for breakfast, evening snacks and nice quality drinks.
4) Polite and helpful staff members.
5) Good location near an underground station, bars and restaurants.
There aren't many hotels we would pay a return visit to but we would make an exception for the Montcalm Royal London.",5,2017,07,10
111,Loved the hotel - avoid the Aviary restauarant,"Stayed here for 2 nights Friday and Saturday for my partners birthday - thank you for the complimentary cake. Check in was a dream (nice glass of fizz on arrival) - hotel very new and beautifully decorated. We had a club room - fantastic views, comfy bed - lots of extras in the room . We had dinner in the room one night and we really enjoyed the food. Staff all lovely. Swimming pool really nice addition. Location great for lots of nearby restaurants and bars - Spitalfield market etc. Great comms before, during and after our stay. Couldn't really fault it and we hope to be back. The only bad thing was the Aviary restaurant. I'm not sure it is fair to leave the full review of that here and so will review that separately.",4,2017,07,10
111,Kevin & Lucie ,"Had the most amazing day Gary, Sinnitta and the whole team made our day truly amazing I proposed to my now fiancée and they really turned on The style.  Made us feel so special with their hospitality I owe you all so very much for marking the moment one to remember   Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Would strongly recommend this place to anyone ❤️🥂💍xx — with Lucy Forman.",5,2017,07,09
111,Not five star,"The staff are not well trained and some are very rude questioning you if you guest, 20min wait for a coffee which was served cold. The room was ok but dirty, the towels have stains and hairs on them. I would not recommend this place to anyone. ",1,2017,07,09
111,nice discovery,"Due to high occupancy in my frequently visited Hotels in the City, I've chosen this one, this time.

Very helpful at the Reception, generally an experience that lasted throughout.

@Hotel: ""Please do not close the nice terrace at 22:00 - especially, when guests can enjoy it from morning (breakfast) to evening, once the weather is nice in London"".",4,2017,07,08
111,"Nice hotel, Great Service","We stayed at the Montcalm a total of two nights (one night before departing on a cruise from Southampton and one night after returning from cruise). Hotel is beautiful and met all of our needs. Continental breakfast and evening treats were key. Service was superb. When we arrived after a transatlantic flight, our room was ready earlier than expected which allowed us to settle in and rest a bit. Highly recommend it.",4,2017,07,08
111,Fantastic London hotel...simply perfect ,"I visited this beautiful hotel yesterday for a business meeting and was lucky enough to view the rooms, spa, both restaurants, and the gorgeous rooftop terrace. 
The staff were so helpful and the food was 5*! The views from the rooftop were just amazing. 
I am definitely going to be a regular visitor to the restaurant and also book in to stay! 
Many thanks to Sandeep Singh (the senior business consultant) and Ashish who really made my company feel welcome and were so hospitable. Looking forward to bringing many guests your way and holding events at this hotel! Special mention to the chap in the downstairs restaurant for making sure I was well hydrated on such a hot day! Thank you again for a lovely visit! ",5,2017,07,07
111,One night in London,"Great hotel, very conveniently situated  to Moorgate and Liverpool Street underground and bus routes and close to the banking district. 
An incredible deck at the Aviary bar and restaurant on the 9th floor with views over London for drinks or a meal. Although we didn't make use of it, there is also an in-house spa.
Our room was very spacious, beds comfortable and bathroom excellent. High quality fittings and amenities and very good staff.
Rates were reasonable, and the staff was accommodating with a request for a late check out.
Highly recommended.",5,2017,07,07
111,Great Value for Money!,"Stayed here for our anniversary. For a 5 star I thought it was great value for money and easily located to the tube station. 
Greeted on arrival with a glass of bubbly and had a nice room with air con and all the other facilities you expect, including sky TV. 
Was given complimentary use of the club lounge and this was a great added bonus. Used the restaurant upstairs and the food was great. 
Will definitely return to this hotel!",5,2017,07,04
111,Wow!,"I chose this hotel as I was coming in by train and it's really close to Liverpool Street.  The whole experience was wonderful from the moment we checked in - very friendly and helpful staff, beautiful decor throughout, and a very well-appointed and spotlessly clean room.  Due to other plans we didn't eat in the hotel, however I thoroughly recommend the cocktails (and stunning views) at Aviary, the rooftop bar.  Will definitely stay again!",5,2017,07,04
111,Excellent 2 Night Stay,"My boyfriend & I stayed here recently for a business/leisure trip. He was attending a weekend course in Islington & we selected this hotel, in the main, due to it's proximity to his location. It's very conveniently located between Moorgate & Old Street (10 minute walk, maximum, to each) but is also close enough to central London that, should you wish to walk to Covent Garden/Oxford Street you can do so (I did, on both days of our stay, about 40/45 minutes)
I've stayed at Montcalm locations before, though this was my first time at the Royal London House, and it didn't disappoint. The hotel is exceptionally clean, very modern & has a feeling of luxury about it. There is a restaurant/bar area to walk through, before getting to reception, which felt a little odd at first but certainly didn't cause any issues during our stay - in fact, it's a great place to grab a drink & light snack; the ambience is great & the staff are very friendly & efficient.
We stayed in a deluxe room & I cannot fault it. Spacious, clean, comfortable bed, excellent bathroom & a great mini bar selection.
We had a couple of minor issues during our stay but the staff were extremely helpful & efficient in rectifying these. The gentleman I encountered on checkout was, quite possibly, the friendliest hotel staff member I have ever come across (disappointed I didn't get his name, as he deserves recognition)
All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again, a great addition to the Montcalm brand.",5,2017,07,04
111,""" Feel at home away from home with family ""","A thoroughly modern relaxed place with fantastic people who work there.
The top management must be well on top of everything. 
Wow...
Great atmosphere and amazing service for a city centre hotel is rare to find. It was such a lovely stay ""Five star is not enough ""
Being myself in service industry, I would say this place is a real Gem.
Thank you and keep up the good work.
We will be back :)",5,2017,07,03
111,"Don't hesitate, just book this wonderful hotel","My daughter and I have just returned from an overnight stay at this fabulous hotel. It was a last minute change to our plans after missing out on the cancelled Adele gig. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and treated with the best customer service I have ever experienced in any hotel. 
We were upgraded and given complimentary breakfasts after I mentioned our disappointment at not seeing Adele perform. 
The hotel itself is an absolute knock out, the decor, the style, the overall ambience, the place oozes luxury. 
Our Club room was sumptuous, my daughter loved all the gadgets and we were both very impressed at the little touches in the room, the aroma box, the coffee machine, the Elemis toiletries all added to the experience 
The very best thing though is the warm and welcoming attitude from the staff, nothing is too much trouble and the fantastic service is consistent throughout all the staff, everyone that we encountered had just the right mix of warmth and professionalism and made us feel that they genuinely  cared that our stay was perfect. 
The location was great, a few minutes walk from the tube and the rooftop terrace has to be seen to be believed!
I will be recommending this hotel to anyone that will listen! ",5,2017,07,03
111,Excellent,"I stayed here for two nights. There was an issue at check-in regarding the room rate, this was almost immediately resolved by the person I was dealing with. (In an exceptional manner) during the discussion we were provided with a very welcome infused water. 

The hotel offers rooms with 'club' access, in my opinion this was absolutely worth the slightly increased room rate. Everything in the lounge was complimentary; continental breakfast in the morning (Smoked Salmon, three types of cheese, ham, salami, etc.) soft drinks all day, and a good selection of decent spirits (Grey Goose, Bulleit bourbon). 

Moving on to describe the room, we stayed in a Club Double; this had a very nice view of Finsbury Square, was roomy and the bed was very good. (During your booking, you can select pillow types and a fragrance for the room. Which is a very nice touch indeed.) I ordered room service the first night, I feel that a particular mention for the houmous should be mentioned as it was very good. The bathroom was very big and the shower fitted with Grohe hardware was as expected, excellent. 

On checking out there was again a query about the rate, however after a very short discussion the person at the desk advised they would take care of it, and advised us to not to worry. 

All in all, our stay was beautiful and I will definitely book again. Finally, a small note should be left regarding Daniel, the concierge he is a definite credit to the hotel and left both myself and my partner feeling exceptionally welcome.",4,2017,07,03
111,Impressive Hotel,"This is a new hotel and it is very modern. We were very impressed with the facilities including Sky TV in the room, safe and minibar.
The bathroom was very clean and had a great shower including underfloor heating. The room was operated by a very modern touch-screen interface. 
Great bar downstairs serving snacks and drinks with a couple of table games - not sure what they were though.
There is also a restaurant at the top level with roof top bar which is impressive. 
There is parking in a NCP right outside which is discounted by the hotel. For a hotel of this standard I thought it was remarkably good value.
Breakfast was downstairs and good although fruit wasn't offered in this buffet, although I think if asked for it would be supplied.
Can't fault it.",5,2017,07,02
111,Give it a miss ,"We booked in here for 2 nights. Good points - nice room and concierge. Bad points - you have to walk through a bar to reach the reception. We arrived late on Friday evening and so had to make our way through numerous drunken people to check in. The receptionist was slow, unfriendly and didn't know the basics about the hotel. We paid extra to have breakfast at the rooftop restaurant on the Saturday morning, but this was closed on the Sunday. We were asked to go to a room on the ground floor for a buffet and there was literally no food out - at all - just a row of empty plates. We asked if they could be replaced and 15 minutes later nothing had changed. I asked to speak to the reception manager, who was so rude and patronising it actually ruined my stay. I asked if she could do anything to help us and she said she couldn't as she had to stand and listen to me! Unbelievable. I was very calm and pleasant in my request for assistance and she was just awful. This is the worst treatment I have had in any hotel - ever. She said we could go back to the restaurant we had tried to go to originally but this in no way made up for her unpleasant attitude. Two people were excellent during our stay - Oliver who sorted out our breakfast situation - and Daniel, the great concierge. 
I would advise against booking this hotel - it is poorly organised with poor service.",1,2017,07,02
111,Best hotel in London ,"I would like to thank the hotel and it's staff for giving me and my lovely girlfriend the most amazing stay which created live long memories. The hotel was far more than we expected, the staff was amazing, so friendly and helpful. The food was to die for and the rooms where out of this world. It really does show why the hotel was rated 5 stars. I honestly can't thank the hotel enough for helping celebrate me and my girlfriends anniversary. Still to this day I think about that stay we had and I can't even put it into words how amazing it was, which is why I'm leaving this review. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, it's the only hotel in London I would stay in and hopefully I see it again next year for our anniversary again.",5,2017,07,01
111,Amazing!!!,"My stay was absolutely outstanding!!! 
 
Every single member of staff was so kind and polite and it felt like they couldn't do enough to help. From the reception to bar and even those in the corridor they were all so helpful. 
 
Our room was fantastic we were kindly upgraded and left a tray and bubbly in our room to help us celebrate our day at the races. 
 
The hotel is amazing as are the staff and I will be sure to return, hopefully sooner rather than later. 
 
Thanks Montcalm for making our stay a brilliant one! ",5,2017,06,28
111,Wonderful Customer Service,"My husband and I, stayed here over night last weekend (24.6.17) as a birthday treat for myself. All of the staff we're amazing, processco on arrival, processco sent to our room which was upgraded all for my birthday! We had access to the lounge area and use of the swimming pool and Jacuzzi. Could not fault the hotel or the staff!",5,2017,06,27
111,"Fantastic Night Fri 23rd July - Sunshine, Great Company and amazing hotel","I visited RLH for the 2nd time and visited again the Aviary Rooftop which is just a magical experience.  

As a returning guest, the hotel manager Gary came and personally asked if he could assist me in anyway throughout my visit and went above and beyond to ensure that myself and my guests were treated absolutely fantastically.  He really does know the meaning of Hospitality and I can't recommend the hotel enough. 

I have previously reviewed the hotel, therefore won't repeat myself except to say that it surpassed my 1st visit which was perfect so 'God' only knows what they can do to better and already faultless visit.",5,2017,06,26
111,Amazing Stay!!!,"We stayed here for our anniversary and had the best weekend! We were offered a free room upgrade and were able to select the room we wanted which was unexpected. We felt ourselves calling the reception a lot of times from our room (nothing major- more just questions) and the staff were very helpful and friendly. If you stay here breakfast at the Aviary is a definite must as the views are just amazing. 
We wanted to do a lot in London but just didn't feel like leaving our hotel. 
Thanks to everyone who made our trip very special :) 
Mr & Mrs Taak",5,2017,06,26
111,Great place to stay!,"We have just spent a lovely weekend in London celebrating a special anniversary and this is in no small part due to our stay at this hotel.  We felt very special from the moment we walked through the door.  The staff are outstanding in all areas of the hotel, from the welcome at reception, to the bar and restaurant on the rooftop. On arrival, we were greeted with cocktails and treated to a room upgrade and gifts.  This was all very unexpected but much appreciated.  The rooms are extremely comfortable and quiet and the hotel is in a great location for getting around. However, it is the pleasant attitude and attentiveness of the staff that makes this hotel special.",5,2017,06,26
111,HIGHLY Recommended City Hotel and Conference Venue,"This is the second time I had the pleasure of staying and hosting a conference at the Montcalm Royal London House. Everything from check in to execution was flawless. It has always been challenging to find a suitable venue in The City, look no more!

A special thank you to Brigita (Cluster Events Sales Manager ), Sunnita (Guest Relations) and Voinov (Events)!

Looking forward to our next project together!",5,2017,06,26
111,First visit .....and we were blown away!,"We were new to the Montcalm brand, however the Royal London House exceeded all our expectations.

The location is excellent - less than five minutes walk from Moorgate tube station, close to St Paul's, and a short walk to the Tate etc. 

A glass of fizz and a warm welcome from Sinnitta and the reception team set the visit off to a great start. And the stay simply got better and better from there.

Our room was spacious, had a great view of the square and was immaculate. The Club lounge was a great addition, and thanks to Sinnitta for arranging the little surprises for my husbands special day.

Thanks also to Gary for helping with breakfast arrangements on both mornings......we loved the tenth floor restaurant and Terrace....just the place to enjoy the cityscape and beautiful weather.

Every staff member we came into contact with during our stay was genuine and friendly which has helped raise this hotel head and shoulders above others in this crowded five star market. It is evident that this business knows that people make a stay special. 

Our stay was perfect, and we've already recommended Montcalm Royal London House to several friends and colleagues. We look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2017,06,26
111,Great stay,"I have to say that the hotel was one of the most balanced and sensible we have stayed in. We have used every type you can imagine!
Right price, right package and great customer service.
We enjoyed the Aviary but the pool and room really were good.
Location...spot on.

The guy on breakfast in the Aviary was fab. Front of house was great and Sinnitta really gets what good customer service means.
It was all done with a big smile.
On our next visit to London we will stay with Mntcakm and I have no problem recommending the hotel to our friends.
Thank you to the team for  their efforts and attention to detail.

Improvements...
Any mentioned would be picky",5,2017,06,25
111,A Modern London Hotspot Boasts Excellent Service,"I had two separate stays here over a period of two weeks. The hotel is modern and sleek. The service in this hotel is exceptional. The rooms include a great bed, huge walk-in shower, heated bathroom floors, huge smart TV with over 500 channels, coffee pot and amenities, iron and board and a good hair dryer. They also include an appliance that gives you a choice of scents for the room. This is a social hotspot, with a rooftop deck that attracts a lively crowd. They have a continental breakfast for some room classes. That lounge stays open all day and in the evening they have light hors d'ouvres, deserts and a pay-for bar. The hotel has a restaurant and bar on the main floor with moderate prices and a very good restaurant, The Aviary, on the top floor that has a nice menu. I hope to return!",5,2017,06,25
111,Super Square Mile hangout,"I love this hotel. One of the many good things is the terrace at night , especially in summer.
The breakfast is brilliant. The rooms state of the art.
The location is in the city but walking distance to Shore Ditch",5,2017,06,24
111,Luxury hotel in excellent location,Attentive staff and facilities of the highest standard. Special birthday treats were left in our in room. We will definitely stay again. The roof top bar is a lovely addition though it does get busy on a sunny day!,4,2017,06,24
111,"Stylish Hotel, Great Staff","Upon arrival the doormen were kind and ready to assist. I had come via a redeye flight and needed to shower before heading to the office. I had neglected to request early check-in. No problem, front desk was very accommodating and found a room that was ready. Quite a relief. The room itself was perfectly nice and more spacious than I was expecting given other experiences in London. 

For those that are inclined, the gym is better than average but if you're serious about such things, there are two gyms right around the corner: Fight Gym (where I went) and Barry's Boot Camp (which offers classes). The fitness center also includes a small indoor pool and sauna which I regretfully never made use of. Next time. 

The hotel bar downstairs has a very relaxed atmosphere w/ a couple of shuffleboard tables. I found the bartenders to be very friendly and engaging. After nearly a week, it almost felt like home largely because of the staff. I should also mention that the servers and (very lovely) hostess that served breakfast upstairs at the Aviary were all wonderful, as well. The Aviary then turns into quite the scene come evening. A bit too crowded, loud for my taste. But there are evidently MANY others who flock there.  

One minor nit is the fact that you need to have your room key in the slot by the door to maintain electricity for lights, A/C, etc. I happened to be in town during an uncommonly warm week and I couldn't keep the room cool as whenever the room was cleaned, my additional card would be removed. And I know the need to have a room key in the slot isn't uncommon, but even the bathroom light is operated by a touch pad. Sometimes just a switch would be nice w/out any further hassle. But this is a small thing. 

Overall, I think  they've done a wonderful job and I look forward to telling other co-workers visiting London to choose the Montcalm Royal London House.",5,2017,06,21
111,Great roof terrace ,"Been a few times now and never get bored of the roof terrace.  Great views of the city.  Would be a great place for a date or dinner party.  Had the burger which has great, right up there with the best.  Service a little slow but generally ok",4,2017,06,21
111,Perfect,"This was a perfect stay from start to finish.
We were greeted with a glass of prosecco upon arrival- a lovely touch!
The room was very stylish with fab tech gadgets. 
The rooftop garden was stunning with amazing views of the shard and gherkin
We also had treatments in the beautiful spa. The therapists were excellent.
Didn't want to leave and can't wait till return. 
Thank you montcalm for a great weekend!
",5,2017,06,21
111,Truly an Amazing Surprise,"Living in London can on occasion throw some unexpected curveballs but last Saturday this was a positive one! After basking in the sun for most of the day, my boyfriend treated me to dinner later that day at the Aviary in the Mostcalm Royal house. Stunning location overlooking the city of London. We started with a cocktail on the terrace and had a dinner to remember. The food and service was amazing in an electric environment. After dinner the surprise of my life, a ring! Followed by a room key in the most magnificent suite.  Little did I know, major planning went into this and we must thank the guest services for arranging everything in advance unbeknownst to me. The service was amazing and the little touches were truly special and we are greatful forever. They do have a beautiful pool but with no costume, it wasn't an option. Breakfast followed in the morning and The manager (female) sent over a glass of bubbles. I will always remember this stay and would highly recommend this place.",5,2017,06,20
111,"Great hotel, location","Wanting to be at the center, seeing the skyline from roof top bar, this hotel was our first choice. Roof top bar is packed after work, view is spectacular, the hotel is nice, has a great breakfast area and bar/restaurant at the ground floor. Room are comfy, service was great. We got an upgrade, made our stay very very memorable and great. Thank you!",5,2017,06,20
111,Nothing special - a city business hotel like many others,"Check-in was completed very quick, given they already had all the information needed from a previous stay of mine at one of their London Montcalm hotels.
Elevators that take you up to the room are unfortunately not linked, so you better press on both buttons to avoid betting on the wrong horse. Once entering your room, you will be welcomed by a very distinct smell. For reasons unknown, they decided to place an ugly black box on the desk that keeps parfumeing your room. You can well unplug it, but housekeeping will make sure it's plugged in again. In my opinion, the smell is rather sickening, but I must admit this perception can well be very personal.
Room lights are controlled via touch panels, also here - I just don't like the fact that I have to push a panel multiple times (e.g. activate the panel first, then switch on the bathroom light) instead of having just an oldschool button.
Rooftop bar is very convenient for those staying at the hotel, but be prepared to not be warmly welcome at all times. On our second night, the guy on the groundfloor claimed it's at capacity and we had to intervene that it's not acceptable for hotel guests to not get access. Once upstairs, it was apparent that the place was far from being packed. 
If you should chose to use the mobile they provide you with in the room, make sure you delete the call log unless you would like to disclose your contacts to the next guest.
Not sure what the rate was, as it was all taken care of, but would definitely not consider paying any premium above general london rates for a standard business hotel.",3,2017,06,20
111,Professional,"My stay was wonderful. I was upgraded to a big room and I loved the wine, fruits and coffee in the room. The breakfast area is beautiful and the service was excellent. Checking in and out was a breeze and the staff were fast. The bed was super comfortable and the toilet was nice and functional. Thanks for everything. I had a pleasant stay.",5,2017,06,20
111,Excellent Hotel Great Location Friendly Staff,"We were kindly upgraded to a Montcalm Club Double which allowed us access to the executive lounge with free drinks and canapes from seven to eleven pm and a free continental breakfast (which was lovely)
This room also has a view of Finsbury Square to the front of the hotel which is pretty.
The rooms have great facilities, lovely furniture, including one of the comfiest beds we have stayed in. 
Everything was in order and as you would expect. 
The Aviary bar/restaurant is a must. Very cool with stunning views and buzzing vibe.
We will definitely book here again
Thank you Montcalm for a fantastic stay!",5,2017,06,19
111,There are some hotels in London that are pretending to be 5 star...,"The Montcalm Royal London House isn't one of them. From the luxurious reception area to the warm reception from the staff, you are immediately made to feel welcome. The complimentary upgrade for my partner's birthday was an amazing touch, as was the cake and rose petals that were in our room.

When we wanted to go up to the rooftop bar and have a snack, the pleasant staff phoned up to check if there was space.

What's more, the spa and pool is very clean and the perfect way to unwind/detox after shopping and partying.

I would definitely return and recommend to friends.",5,2017,06,19
111,Expected more,"Did not feel any service was delivered. The rooftop that they advertise is open for the public and very crowded with loud music. Each time we entered the hotel we were asked if we were hotel guests or if we wanted to visit the rooftop (very annoying). Would not recommend this place, although the beds are nice.",3,2017,06,18
111,"Great Hotel, Excellent Service","We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this hotel if you are having a break in London. The service and attention given by the staff was excellent. We arrived hours later than intended on Friday night due to travel issues. Tired and hungry we went up to the restaurant to find it fully booked, so were resigned to just ordering something in our room. However the Maître D' suggested we have a drink at the bar as they might be able to ‘find a table’ but we didn’t think it possible seeing how pack out the place was. But not only did they find us a table, we got very quick service too – brilliant!
Definitely will be back the next time we find ourselves staying in London.",5,2017,06,17
111,Unexpectedly absolutely fantastic stay,"We reserved this hotel for our stay at London when my wife had to spend a week  on a business trip. The hotel sits in a former Royal Mail building, completely remodeled from a ground up. Very nice spacious rooms, 60 inch Tv's, gorgeous modern bathroom with frameless sliding doors and large shower, everything electronic, from the A.C. controls to lights to room indicators. Heated floors ! Very business traveler friendly - with US and European plugs, LAN and Wi-Fi network connection etc. Very friendly, mostly Eastern European stuff. They also have a very nice gym, indoor pool ( although fairly small) and saunas.
The only thing they could change is dovet - it was  way too hot to sleep under.",5,2017,06,16
111,Urban chic in a calm environment ,"What a difference from my Paris trip.  Calm efficient reception staff and escorted to my room.  For the most expensive real estate the room was spacious, well appointed with lovely luxuries - Hermes toiletries - free mineral water!   Headed to Aviary restaurant - well mixed G&T and good food (make sure you book in advance as very popular).   Good breakfast - overall 4.5 but can't give that.  My new go to Hotel!",4,2017,06,16
111,Outstanding service from all trained people ,"We came up to London for a west end show (Bat out of hell) and to visit the city of London where I used to work many years ago. We checked in early and the room was not ready (I didn't expect it to be so planned to leave my bag until later). They upgraded us to a room which was ready. The check in person was professional and polite and interested in us. He asked why we were in London so we told him re the show. The next day at check out another person served us and asked us if we had enjoyed the show! Obviously the first guy had written a note but that's great.... And the second guy read it and bothered to ask. In fact all the staff were great. Special mention goes to Oliver  - the manager who runs the breakfast restaurant. He was so nice and caring - he really made us feel welcome. So kind, caring and professional and an inspiration to us all. Book this place now! ",5,2017,06,14
111,Don't expect a drink after 12,"Nice hotel, completely ruined by the lack of a residents bar and nightclub doormen who rudely order you out of the bar at midnight....not an experience one expects when staying in a £200+ a night hotel.  Wouldn't go back.",1,2017,06,11
111,3rd Stay in a month! ,"What a find! The Montcalm at Finsbury Square is just perfect for both business and leisure travellers. There is simply nothing I can fault about this fabulous hotel, the most attentive genuine staff I have ever encountered. The rooftop terrace is welcome retreat after a busy day with its stunning views across the city. Rooms are spotlessly clean with comfy beds. To top it all the amazing concierge Mr Adrian is truly the face of both the hotel and the Montcalm brand. We will be back soon! ",5,2017,06,11
111,High quality hotel,"Have stayed at this hotel a few times on business and on each occasion have been impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the accomodation. 

The rooms are spacious and decorated to a very high standard and modern style. Nespresso machines and good quality tea are also nice to have in the rooms. 

Breakfast on the 10th floor has amazing views over finsbury square and the city skyline. 

Rooms are generally very quiet, though the ones on the lower floors do get a bit of traffic noise. ",5,2017,06,09
111,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"There's not a better hotel in proximity to London's financial district. Get a club room which includes a great breakfast.

The staff will make you feel very welcome and the gym is well equipped.

The hotel is only a few minutes away from the Moregate tube station.",5,2017,06,08
111,Re-visited 3/4th June,"The weekend will be remembered for two things, firstly the very sad events of London Bridge and Borough Market, we had discussed going there on that evening but decided instead to stay in the comfort and luxury of the Montcalm so relieved we did!

The second memory will be the wonderful and attentive services of the hotel staff throughout our stay. From the moment we arrived we were given nothing but kind offers of assistance in all areas. The rooftop terrace was a delight on the morning of our arrival, sitting in the hot sun with generous measures of Pimms and Gin and tonics whilst enjoying the rooftop landscape of London. A lovely touch was the tactful placing of sun screen on each table a thoughtful and appreciated gesture. The maple bacon sandwich went down a treat and to be highly recommended as a tasty snack to kick start the day.

The rooms have been well documented on here so I will not repeat the description of the fantastic services they provide, a massive television with extensive choice including full Sky packages plus mood lighting makes them truly enjoyable and hard to drag yourself out from. I mentioned last time I reviewed this the most enjoyable showers and this remains a pleasure to use with a large drench head tempting one to stay in there much longer than is perhaps good for the skin. One very minor negative point on the bathroom if at all is the lack of a plug or ability to fill the basin for a wet shave, perhaps this could be considered for future improvements.

We used the dining room for both our evening meal and breakfast the following morning, the Dining Staff could not be faulted in the evening, our waitress was helpful and considerate offering advice on what to eat and recommendations on wine also. The food was delicious and the desserts were exceptional, a chocolate sundae was much more than that and had to be eaten to be appreciated for its moreish tastes.

The staff were again helpful with storage of our bags whilst enjoying the London scene and at the last minute when we returned to the hotel to collect them the free raspberry and mint flavoured water in reception was not only the saviour for two thirsty walkers but was an utter delight and a further thoughtful addition to the hotels attempts to think of everything for their visitors.

I highly recommend going and will certainly look at returning once more next time we visit the big smoke. Thank you all the staff and especially Daisy for making our weekend a most memorable and enjoyable time.",5,2017,06,08
111,Fantastic hotel with an excellent service ,I'm a guest at the Royal London House since they have open back in October 2016. This hotel is always my first choice when I'm in London. The whole team is doing a fantastic job and provides an excellent service. A special mention for the team at the reception: the staff there in general and Kristina in particular are top notch. You feel more than welcome and they make your stay to a special expericence every time. Best value for Money!,5,2017,06,07
111,Fabulous hotel - superb value.,Ultra modern hotel with fab rooftop bar . Staff were great and couldn't do enough for us. The room was extremely spacious with all mod cons including very good air conditioning and a huge flat screen TV .Bed was large and comfortable . I haven't a bad word to say .The only negative is parking which is understandable in central London however the hotel offer 50% discount at the NCP car park directly opposite .,5,2017,06,07
111,Wonderfully Welcoming!,"Firstly, when we pulled up outside in our taxi we instantly were impressed by the doorman at the door and it gave us the impression that this was going to be an up market hotel.  No sooner had we exited the taxi but the doorman had took my case and very kindly brought it to the reception.  The entrance to the hotel was bright and welcoming and we were impressed at the quality of the décor and the ambiance.  Unfortunately, as we had limited time due to our booking at the Globe Theatre we did not have time to explore the downstairs bar but it looked very nice.  

Our check in experience was lovely, your staff are very welcoming and friendly.  We were also pleasantly surprised to meet someone from our local area in Sheffield who works for you so we really enjoyed chatting to them. 

On return from the theatre we were once again met by lovely staff and invited to your roof top bar.  Our bags were in our room on arrival.  The room was gorgeous! We had been upgraded by your staff as it was my husbands 50th birthday which was a nice surprise and were delighted to find a lovely gift of macaroons and a birthday message.  Our room overlooked  Finsbury square which was lovely.  The dressing gown and slippers were a lovely addition to the room.  The bathroom was bright and we felt all the little added touches were great including cotton buds, cotton wool, shampoo etc.  We loved the coffee machine and the fruit and wine was wonderful too.  We felt that it was luxurious and we felt a little spoilt.

We visited the spa which had a very relaxing ambience and the pool was really warm , we thought the tide machine was really clever as it meant you could swim in a small space.  My husband has a bad back and he said that the jets really helped with that.

We then visited the roof top bar and restaurant for the evening.  The roof top bar was lovely, a wonderful view which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The drink selection was very good but I would have preferred  to see some sparkling wine on the menu other than champagne, whilst I did drink a couple of glasses  I mostly drank white wine but would have preferred the option to buy a bottle of something sparkling other than champagne.  The staff were very friendly and there were plenty of bar staff and waiters and waitresses so that we did not have to wait to be served at the bar.

The dinner menu was great and we liked what was on offer.  We chose to order the Chateaubriand, on the menu it advertises the meal for two people so we thought that this would be fine.  To be honest it does advise to order additional sides and the waitress reiterated this so we did, we ordered some fries each.  Our waitress also advised that it would be a 25 minute wait, which we agreed to as we were having a drink and didn't mind.  Unfortunately the 25 minute wait was actually 45 - 50 minutes.  After 45 minutes a member of staff did come to see us and advised that our meal had been plated up and ready to bring out, I wondered if she could see that we were really hungry at this point and starting to look a little fed up.  

The main course was exceptionally tasty but we were disappointed that there was no salad or vegetables that accompanied it, in addition it was not enough for two people to eat as advertised and truthfully only enough for one.  So, whilst we cannot fault the presentation or taste of the food, we did expect it to feed us both without us being left hungry.  The waitress on ordering the food did ask us if we would like to see the cut of meat prior to ordering it, which is a lovely idea but I opted not to do this as I felt conscious of the other dining guests and felt that this may appear a little pretentious.   

We returned to the terrace overlooking the lights of London which was lovely and we forgot about it, albeit still a little hungry! Thank fully we had macaroons in the room and had those with a cup of tea before bed!

The bed was really comfy with large pillows and duvet.  The bed was a good size, my husband is 6ft and I 5ft so sometimes he can take up all the room but there was ample room for us both to be comfy.  One of the best sleeps I have had in a hotel!! 

Check out on the morning was extremely easy and again the staff couldn't help us enough.  

 On a whole we were very very impressed with your whole hotel and I have been recommending it to friends, colleagues and family.  I am in no doubt that we will stay with you again.  However, I would possibly reconsider eating at the restaurant again and just go for drinks next time.  That said I cannot fault the friendliness of the restaurant staff or the taste and presentation of the food.

Thank you again for such a welcoming, warm and wonderful stay, ",5,2017,06,05
111,Luxury in the City,"We were attending an industry event at The Brewery and were put up in this hotel by our hosts. This was our first experience of this group of hotels. 
The state of the art room was very well finished and had everything you would need for a stay. With touch pad lighting and ac controls, under floor heating in the bathroom and your own sky box on the large screen TV. Guests are also provided with free use of an android handset which gives free calls and Wifi, although we didn't get a chance to try it. 
The bathroom was one of the nicest we had experienced in any London hotel with a large walk in rainfall shower. My wife loved the free Elemis soaps & shampoo etc. 
Breakfast was served in the roof top restaurant with stunning views of the City. It was a bit hectic on the day we were there with a number of people having to wait for a table. 
Overall we'd definitely stay here again or try one of the other hotels in the group. 
The only disappointment was that we left something behind in the room and despite 2 emails to the hotel, we've had no response............we still hope this will not sour things. ",5,2017,06,03
111,"Great location, good value, great service ","I thought the hotel was excellently located, the business lounge was appreciated and the rooftop bar was a welcome addition to end the day.
 
The staff were very polite and helpful. The only feedback I would give is with the bathroom being all white, the lighting was extremely bright. Would be nice if there was a dimmed lighting option.

I will definitely be going back.",5,2017,06,02
111,"Trendy hotel, great service in the renovated Royal House","I was delighted to discover this hotel in the heart of London City in the renovated Royal house.  Luxury and clean rooms is the norm, starting from the rooms and restaurants, and going to the newly opened spa. However what makes this place unique is the level of service and dedication of the staff.  I was pleased by Gabi and Ivet who went out their way to ensure I feel welcome and find my way around London respectively.  Great place - recommend for both business and family travel. Don't miss the terrace bar at the rooftop - it's chic and trendy place with great after work yuppie crowd.",5,2017,06,02
111,Special weekend treat away ,"We arrived at 5.30, Friday before the bank holiday... it was especially sunny. And crazy busy!! We were worried at first, but the queue was to gain access to the sky bar, not a surge of guests. As it was packed up there we waited till Saturday afternoon before popping up for an afternoon drink, and it was lovely up there. Breakfast was also served there and that was lovely too. Breakfast choice was good, plenty of Full English and Continental cheeses and ham, surprisingly no sliced tomatoes and mozzarella. And the fruit was a bit limited with pineapple, gala and watermelons. Plenty of cereals, muesli, nuts, yoghurts, and pastries to choose from. More on A La Carte, Egg Benedict was good. 
We didn't get chance to eat in the restaurant, but it was lovely surroundings and very popular.  
Our room was great, a small junior suite, quiet, spacious and spotless. 
Staff were all really helpful and kind. There was a lovely spa, but unfortunately hadn't quite worked that out after a conversation with staff at spa the previous week.... but it's up and running now and looked great! Bar on ground floor had some bar games, that made a nice touch.  Wouldn't hesitate going back to one of these hotels again, lovely weekend. Special thanks to the hotel manager on last weekend!! Thanks for a great stay! ",5,2017,05,31
111,"Fantastic location, comfy rooms and friendly staff!","Exactly what you want for a hotel, good central location (stone's throw from shoreditch with easy access to the underground) cosy rooms and very friendly staff. The hotel bar was also well layed out with a good selection of cocktails and draught beers. Would visit again!",5,2017,05,31
111,Excellent Hotel,"I was lucky enough to spend a night here on business due to a good offer being available and it was definitely a big step up from the hotels I normally get to stay at.

The front door is opened by a uniformed member of staff who welcomes you warmly into a cool and spacious interior. Check in was quick and easy with all the staff being super helpful in a formal way.

I had a standard room which was large and well equipped with a sound system, room perfume dispenser(!), large TV and as a nice touch a small bowl of fresh fruit to go with the bottled water.

I struggled to find the bathroom light switch until I accidentally activated the touchpad in the wall that operated all the lights for the room. A little high tech for me. I was up on the 6th floor and with the windows shut the sound proofing was just good enough to keep the early morning traffic and sound of bin lorries at bay.

Breakfast was served upstairs on the 10th floor, (I think), which gave a nice view and the added advantage of a breeze from the open terrace doors. It was the usual buffet offering but to a very high standard and once more, relentlessly helpful and polite staff.",5,2017,05,31
111,"Amazing trip, excellent staff.","We arrived early at the hotel, hopeful we could leave our luggage there so that we could enjoy the city. This was no issue so we went off to explore. Once we returned, we were escorted up to our (upgraded on account of my partner's birthday! Thank you!) room by a lovely gentleman. Shortly afterwards, he returned to our room with a dessert with a ""Happy Birthday"" message next to it for my partner. This was a lovely touch! The rooms are outstanding and modern, with everything you could need. The bath was huge, I almost fell asleep in there. Location of the hotel is great, couple of minutes walk to Moorgate. We also had a nice walk from the hotel to St Paul's. Had some drinks in the rooftop Aviary bar which were also great. Overall the location, comfort of rooms, staff and value for money are all excellent and I won't be booking to stay anywhere but here in future. Incredible hotel!",5,2017,05,31
111,Fantastic weekend break in London,"We stayed for our 10th wedding anniversary and weren't disappointed.  The standard of the hotel is excellent, particularly the level of service.  The staff really do go out of their way to make your stay as special as possible.  We ate breakfast only at the hotel, which was superb.  The location in the heart of the City is excellent.  I've stayed twice now; once for business and now this trip - on both occasions I have been very impressed.  Keep up the good work!",5,2017,05,30
111,Beautiful stay,"Very happy to say that having stayed for a night this past weekend with my other half for her birthday, we were both very impressed. Not just with the quality of the hotel and rooms but the polite and helpful staff who take time for each and everyone who stays within their walls. We felt very looked after with all the little touch's that made us feel special. The restaurant was magnificent and Spa equally lovely. Good location too only a few minutes walk from Liverpool street station. The only slight disappointment was due to the fact that come 10pm the rooftop terrace was closed which was a shame as the views are great. Will certainly be staying again in future. Special thanks to Dado and the team for looking after us.",5,2017,05,30
111,Nice place to stay,"I would have given top rating had hotel not spoiled my checkout experience. Its a nice place to stay and staff is good.
During checkout hotel added some additional items from minibar which made it bad experience for me.",4,2017,05,30
111,A great new 5 star concept ,"I booked this hotel with some excitement and a little trepidation. Excited because I scored a great price. Trepidation because of the comments that the MRLH does not present as a 5 star hotel. The entrance IS through a hip bar and snack area. So forget ""grand"" and instead think very sleek, artistic, classy materials, comfortable, high tech, and innovative. 
Great staff. I echo all the positives in other reviews. 
Location. In the downtown financial district. But not to worry. Away from the maddening crowds. Easy access to the Moorbridge tube to go to all the sites. And a pretty small park across the street. Great food options at the hotel and in the neighborhood. A boots pharmacy and a great food market in the Marks and Spencer department store basement a block away. With every take and go item you could want including alcohol. 
We LOVED the hotel. Very unique and special. ",5,2017,05,29
111,5 star!,"This hotel has everything you expect from a 5 star hotel from prosseco on arrival to a fabulous rooftop bar and restaurant, the rooms are gorgeous and have everything you could possibly want. I would stay in this hotel over many 5 star hotels in London. 100% try the food and drink at the restaurant and there is a bar called flights round the back of the hotel brilliant and fun place to start the afternoon.",5,2017,05,29
111,Fantastic-would of been 5 stars but..,"The Montcalm is probably the best hotel that I have had the pleasure of staying in and I would of happily given the hotel 5 stars if it was only being rated on the hotel but unfortunately the bar/roof top doesn't take it there. I'll get on to that but I'd like to first write about why this place is fantastic. 
I came here with my partner for the weekend for Comic Con. Having read reviews before leaving,I already knew that the reception wasn't located at the front of the building and therefore knew to carry on further down the corridor. When we arrived there was a doorman who opened the doors for us and gave us a warm welcome. Checking in was easy,the receptionist that we had was ever so pleasant and welcoming. She room care of our luggage as our room was not ready until 2 and we had arrived in the morning in order to get down to Comic Con. The lady said this wasn't a problem and when our room was ready,our luggage would be taken up to the room ready for us. I had asked if there was somewhere we could freshen up before heading back out and she kindly took us to the lift and directed us to the spa. The lady we encountered at the spa gave us a towel and told us we could freshen up in the changing rooms,which were very nice. So far,my first impression of the hotel was great and I was excited to see our room later in the day. 

When we returned back to the hotel,we went back to reception and was given our door key and we proceeded to head up to our room. I was very pleased with our room. A decent sized room and the bed!!! Extremely comfy and very spacious. The room was very clean and felt luxurious. A nice sized TV with sky! A nice little area where there was a kettle and a coffee machine with a selection of teas and coffee. The bathroom was very clean and rather big. 
The only down side to the room were the control panel. It's located on the wall and allows you to control the bathroom light,air con and a few other things. I loved the air con,being late May,it's getting warm at night and I liked that I had full control of the temperature of the room. Down side to this panel were that it was slightly laggy. I did find that I had to tap what I wanted a few times before it recognised the touch. Maybe a software update is needed. 

Our room however wasn't cleaned on the second day. I had no idea that we had to select the option on the panel to 'clean room'. All hotels that I have stayed in,the rooms are cleaned every day. So when we left for the day on the second day,I left all our towels in the shower to be collected but when we returned they were still there. That's when we realised. It didn't matter too much as we were leaving the next day. However if someone is on a long stay,it may be worth noting this. But a maid did knock late afternoon and asked if we needed anything. She then came back with fresh towels and a bag full of supplies. 

The spa was absolutely fantastic!! Very relaxing and the lady at reception was SO nice. She handed me flip flops when she noticed me waddling out of the pool area,back to the changing room,dripping over the floor. She also showed me how to use the lockers and was helpful with anything else I needed. The spa has a steam room,sauna,jacuzzi and a pool. Also included was a fully equipped gym. All were open until 10pm which was great for us. Overall I can't fault the spa area at all.

Now on to the bit that wasn't too great..the roof top bar. The Aviary which is the restaurant at the top of the hotel is apparently a well known place and very popular. If you do want to eat there you will need to make a booking. We couldn't get a table so decided on just going up to get a drink around 10pm. As you entered the vibe on what the place was,was mixed. To the left was the restaurant area where people were seated and eating. To the right and on the opposite side of the bar,was the bar life. It was like walking in to a busy bar in central London. There was a DJ pumping loud music and the place was heaving. People there to have a good time. It was obvious that this section was heavily used by non hotel users,it was a very popular location for night life. And because of this,when I turned up in my jeans and a casual shirt,as we had been out to dinner in Camden,I felt extremely under dressed. Even though our intention was to just have a night cap and see the view from the roof top. Any how,once we had managed to be served (£6.70 for a pint!!) We headed in the direction of the roof top,only to be told by the guard on the door that no drinks were allows outside after 10pm. This I can slightly understand as its not uncommon for pubs and bars to stop drinks being taken outside after a certain time. A little annoyed,we found a table away from the bar and crowd of people,situated near a window. Only for a member of staff to come over to say that we couldn't sit there as the restaurant area was closed. I looked around and stated that the other people sat at the other tables all only had drinks to which he responded that they had been dinning there. 
With that,we stood at the side of the little dance floor,downing our drinks so that we could head outside. Once out there,the view was worth seeing. It's lovely seeing the city lit up. But as we are standing at the glass,admiring the view,a member of staff is clearing away the tables and chairs,pushing them up against the glass and sweeping. When she got to us,she asked us to move. Which is a simple enough request. But after being told we couldn't go out with drinks,couldn't sit down in an area and now being told to move so it could be cleared up,it just felt like a huge let down. The service from the hotel had been fantastic,and we get up to the bar,where all we want to do is see the view and we are met with a lot of you can't do that. 
I also found it to be confusing up there. Is it a bar or is it a restaurant? If I was turning up to the bar in a swanky outfit (which is how a lot of the people in the bar were dressed) I wouldn't want to be walking in and the only thing I can smell is fish!! 
What was also off putting was that the first lift as you enter the lobby is used in the evening for the roof top bar. So a bouncer is situated there and often there was a que of people for the lift. I felt a little uncomfortable walking past all these people. I'm not in a nightclub or a bar. I'm in a hotel. 
And this is why it won't receive 5 stars from me. It's either a high end posh hotel or a high end,bar and restaurant. But being both just doesn't work in my opinion. 

Upon leaving this morning,again I was met with such great staff from the hotel. My luggage was wheeled to the door and down the steps. And I was wished well. I would stay again in a heartbeat but maybe next time I'll give the rooftop a miss. ",4,2017,05,28
111,Had a fantastic stay!,"Stayed here for 3 nights and have nothing but good words to say about this hotel. The service, staff, rooms, breakfast and spa facilities was perfect. 
We were lucky to have very nice weather so we used the 10th floor roof terrace for drinks and outside breakfast buffet. 
The overall details and finishes in the rooms, Versace designed spa and elsewhere is perfect. 
We will definitely recommend to stay here. 

Location is also good with just a few minutes walk to Liverpool street station and old street station. Neighborhood is also clean and safe. ",5,2017,05,28
111,Energetic hotel,"Spent one night at the new Montcalm recently for a business trip.    The service was excellent, my room was very nice, and the first floor bar was busy and fun prior to dinner.    There is a nice rooftop deck that is well appointed and comfortable.",4,2017,05,28
111,Very  nice hotel with very nice staff,"The staff was very helpful, and for my first stay they gave me a better hotel room than the one I paid for. 
We ate at the bar, and the ffod was good. 
In the bathroom, the soaps were Hermes fleur d'oranger, one of my favorites.",5,2017,05,27
111,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed recently on a business trip. We found the staff to be welcoming and helpful. The room we stayed in was nice tastefully decorated and touch screen to switch lights on.  The room had a safe, tea and coffee making facilities and included a robe and slippers. The bed was a good size and comfortable and an interesting picture on the wall of an old market which made a change from the usual thing.  We visited the swimming pool and spa which was lovely.  We had a meal on the roof top restaurant and the food was delicious.  It was nice to see London going from dusk to night and seeing all the lights over the city.  ",4,2017,05,25
111,Flatters to deceive,"Very impressive lobby and rooftop bar but aside from the receptionist, staff very poor, and more interested in chatting and giggling amongst themselves than dealing with customers.  Draught beer not looked after.  The club lounge is a poor Hilton 'wannabe' - the evening snacks consisted of nachos (admittedly very nice) and salsa. If your going to offer this then do it properly or not at all.  And please don't keep closing the room curtains when it's broad daylight outside....room was dark enough as it was.",3,2017,05,24
111,"Comfortable, but average and not luxury","I arrived early and the staff was great to accommodate me and give me a room, although I needed a room move later on since I was trying to rest and since my room was right by the elevator, there was a lot of noise. 

The front desk staff was not friendly, and when I came back to my hotel after being out at around 4 45pm, my room had not been cleaned. When I called downstairs to ask, the front desk staff was very short with me and told me that they finish cleaning at 5pm so I should wait til then. Throughout my entire stay, the Front Desk staff were not friendly. Always very short with answers, made me feel like an inconvenience and never warm and welcoming. Although the gentleman who helped with my bags was great and very helpful! 

The food quality of room service was average, and they would bring up a credit card machine and would make me pay every time I ordered, as they mentioned I wasn't set up with an ""account,"" which i found very strange as I thought that would be a given, since I left my credit card details when i checked in. 

When my boyfriend called to ask if he could send flowers to my room, he was told that they didn't know where they could order flowers, and put him on hold so they could ask other people. For any luxury property, this is pretty basic knowledge for the concierge. 

When I checked in, I was not told that my room came with breakfast. When I went upstairs on my last day for breakfast, I tried to pay and the waiter told me it was included with my room. If i had known that I could have had breakfast there everyday, I would most definitely have done so. 

I didnt know where anything in the hotel was, I had to ask or find out for myself. The Front Desk did not let me know where any of the hotel facilities were when i checked in. Again, another given in any luxury property's check in process. 

The rooms were spacious and comfortable with plush beds. All the lights and temperature settings are controlled by a touch screen pad on the wall which made it easy to navigate. 

the location of the hotel was ideal, with shoreditch very near by, and lots of buses and a couple of tube stops convenient to get to. The rooftop bar was lively and had great views of the city. 

Not the best choice for a hotel in London. I was comfortable, but did not feel like i was staying in a 5 star luxury property, as they have advertised. But most issues could be solved with a well-trained Front Desk. 
",3,2017,05,24
111,"Nice, with a few quirks","First, the positives - The staff is efficient and friendly, the rooms are large and clean, with a very comfortable bed. The breakfast spread on the 10th floor is extensive and the view of the city is great on a clear day (good luck with that in London, though).

The quirks - You enter the hotel expecting to see the reception, instead one walks into the coffee shop/bar. The reception is further down the hallway. The two lifts are not synchronized i.e. you must call each lift individually. The lifts closest to the reception area don't go all the way up to the 10th floor (where breakfast is served), instead one has to walk the flight of stairs to get to the 10th floor. There are lifts in the back that do go up to the 10th floor, but I only discovered that on the last day of my stay. The bathrooms are large, but for some reason have bright white light that remind me of a sterile hospital ward. The room was a little dark, as there was only one window which overlooked another wing of the hotel, so not much natural light.

Overall though, a good stay.",4,2017,05,24
111,Great Start,"I believe this is a newer hotel, and it shows.  Fairly spotless, attractive modern design, and very friendly staff.  The area is nicely quiet on the weekdays and weekends.  I agree with other reviewers who have noted that the smartpad that controls the room, while perhaps a sign of the times, seems a bit much.  Small matter, though, for an otherwise lovely stay.  5-star review is partly owing to the great value: price relative to luxury.",5,2017,05,23
111,Very Nice Hotel,"Located in a very accessible location in the City, this new hotel is a very welcome addition to the city of London. The staff are very professional and eager to assist. The rooms are large and modern.",5,2017,05,23
111,Slick but frustrating,"The hotel is very modern, stylish and clinically clean. Unfortunately the focus on aesthetics has made simple things unnecessarily difficult. Key cards need to be gently moved over a flat black surface rather than inserted or just presented. Rather than light switches, there's a control panel which is blank until you touch it. And the shower looks very pretty and symmetrical with a shiny chrome drain plug in the centre, which you constantly find yourself treading on. Apart from these niggles it's very nice with friendly, helpful staff and a super comfortable bed. If your room rate includes breakfast, be sure to go to the 10th floor restaurant rather than the much smaller one in the ground floor - I didn't realise there were two and there are no signs in the lift. I guess that would spoil the look!",3,2017,05,23
111,Fabulous hotel in the City of London,"All I can say is the little things really do make a difference and this hotel focus on that. From a glass of Prosecco on arrival to the extensive amenities within the room, every thing we needed was catered for. The room itself was spacious, luxurious and very clean. Location was great and less than 5 minute walk to Moorgate and Old Street tube stations - most things nearby are closed at the weekend (due to the business location) which is a shame.

Staff were polite and welcoming... although we were bothered by them at our door three times during our stay.

Amazing Rooftop Bar and I mean AMAZING... a must visit!

My only gripe would be that the bar downstairs was very expensive for what it was... 2 sandwiches, 2 fries, a beer and a coke came to just under £50???!",5,2017,05,22
111,Beautiful hotel and great service,"We loved our stay at the Montcalm - just wish we stayed for longer than 1 night! We had stayed in the Montcalm London City Suites before, also a lovely hotel but the Royal London would be my preference for future visits. It was a short walk from Old Street Station and also close to Barbican And Liverpool Street. When we arrived we were offered glasses of champagne as a complimentary welcome drink. As we'd got there before check-in we were able to leave our bags there until we returned later on when the room was ready. When we did, we were given a free upgrade which was a lovely surprise. We were in London to celebrate finishing university so the upgrade to the club double really made our weekend extra special. The room was luxurious, with a huge comfortable bed. The bathroom was equipped with a large rainforest shower and Elemis toiletries. 
Check out was easy and quick, before we left the hotel we went up to the Aviary - the rooftop bar and restaurant for a drink. View was lovely but the drinks expensive.
We will definitely try to return to this hotel this year as we had a lovely experience.",5,2017,05,21
111,A bit above average,"Good:
Large shower towels
Good sleep quality/little noise (despite being on floor 1)
Good room layout with the family suit for 1 couple & 1 adult/child (1 room with king bed and connecting suite that a fold out and its own full bathroom, tv, and door entry.)
Good bathroom counter space 
Comfy bed & pillows
Good air conditioning 
Black out curtains
Good internet (sufficient for streaming)
Good location for underground (Moorgate and Liverpool stations)
New equipment in fitness center
Friendly staff at the front desk 

Not great:
Had to wait 40 min past check in time to get room key (we were given instruction to go to the pretty rooftop bar and have complimentary drinks; however, having to explain this once the bill came was awkward since we didn't yet have a room # to sign with).
Control panel for room lighting was more burdensome than smart 
Fitness center not open 24 hrs (approx 7am-7pm)
Wifi signal nonexistent in fitness center
Poor service in downstairs restaurant (I had to order and later ask to pay at the bar because the 1 server working had too many ppl to look after and just didn't get to us.)
During the weekend little around the hotel is open since it's in the financial district and stores/restaurants cater to the Mon-Fri crowd.",3,2017,05,20
111,Modern and welcoming,"Stayed here last night. Room was spotless, every member of staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was well equipped and in close proximity to our event. We had a lovely breakfast which had something for everyone and all in all a very good stay. Our room was nice and quiet. The only thing that was slightly frustrating was the room card, which required a certain knack! Parking was fairly easy and is a 2 minute walk at the NCP. Make sure you ask for the voucher on check out to save £25 off 24 hours. ",4,2017,05,20
111,London vacation ,"Modern hotel with gorgeous indoor pool and spa. Club lounge is nice for drinks and light snack but get there early at night because they put out one tray of each of the 3 cooked (cold)  appetizers and do not replenish them, ever. That means if one person shows up and eats it all, that's it, no more for the evening except for chips salsa and hummus. We were told that the kitchen gets too busy and they don't have any way to cook the appetizers in the back room of the lounge. Maybe a portable toaster oven or a microwave. If it can work in a college dorm room I think a 5star hotel should be able to figure something out. Still, the open bar at night and smoked salmon at breakfast more than made up for  this and I would recommend getting a club room to anyone who drinks alcohol. There are also several other dining options in this hotel to enjoy.  ",4,2017,05,19
111,Excellent customer service,"The hotel is very clean, customer service was excellent, the SPA area is very nice and the pool very clean. The quality of breakfast was very high, the rooms were soundproof, I was welcomed with a fruit basket which I really appreciated, red wine and a dessert for a special occasion. The bathroom was spotless and had all I needed. Coffee and tea facilities were excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,05,19
111,Great Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel! I stayed while on a business trip to London and was very impressed. Staff couldn't do enough for You, the room was very well decorated and had a very big king size bed with lovely linen, one of the best nights sleep I've had in a while! Great location too!
",5,2017,05,18
111,Anniversary Treat,"Absolutely amazing hotel. From the second we got to the entrance, we felt so warm and welcomed. We were greeted with champagne and given a complimentary room upgrade. There were also treats in the room for us. The room had a constant flow of lavender which was lovely. We had lunch in the bar and the food was great - I had the meatballs. 
The staff were all so lovely, 10/10.
Only down side was that there were 8 screaming children in the small pool area at the same time as us, so it was difficult to relax.",5,2017,05,18
111,Great hotel for business visit,"Hotel is in ideal location for business meetings in the city. Comfortable & modern. Staff very attentive to all requests with a big smile at all times. Room comfortable & very modern. Great very large screen TV & info system.
The few minuses - windows outlook an internal courtyard with no view excepy the otherside of the hotel, The far lifts (elevators) have no central command and both elevators have to be requested for. Enterance to hotel is through the bar - making both the bar & the enterance less attractive.",4,2017,05,17
111,Excellent customer service,Excellent hotel with very close parking nearby.  Wonderful staff and absolutely stunning rooms.  Breakfast was wonderful on the roof top restaurant with views to die for. We cannot wait to return very soon.,5,2017,05,17
111,Very good hotel,"I really like this hotel as it is very modern and is very well furnished, the room was good with a very decent sized shower, the addition of having Sky Tv was great if your the kind of person who likes to chill in the room during the day, The club room is seriously one of the best stocked I have ever came across with really premium spirits, would stay again.
",5,2017,05,14
111,A Normal Stay,"Tried this hotel since its new and everything is normal in regards to the price and location.
Let me mention a few things worth taking a note:
1) Rooms have fancy lightings (color)
2) Housekeeping is good.
3) Door card reader buggy
4) Beds too soft (personal preference) and a joint twin bed.
5) TV selections are awesome including sports.
6) No toothbrush
7) Breakfast so so but service good.

Overall it is ok with the price i am paying.
Location is great since its very near my office (financial).

",3,2017,05,14
111,Nice hotel,"Nice spacious room, food was nice, avery (if im not misspelled it) has a good view just on the top of my room. they provide mobile phone with free data you can take during your visit, there is underfloor in your bathroom heating which is quite nice. It was just a little bit noisy in the morning. Maybe because i stayed in 914 which is exactly beneath the stairs.",5,2017,05,13
111,Nice setting and very attentive staff,"I visited here on business after complaining about the Montcalm at the Brewery. I got a room which was very noisy (mechanical noise from air con units). There were no other rooms left so they moved me to RLH. 

What can I say, I hit jackpot! Beautiful hotel in all areas. Staff are very attentive but not annoying so

If I could afford to stay at RLH then I would come back",5,2017,05,13
111,Favourite of all!  Especially after missing our train... and thanks to Gabby!,"This was our 1st visit to this hotel for myself, my partner and 2 boys, 10 and 12.  We were in London for the Arsenal match on Sunday.  (we always knew it would be tight on time to get the last train home from Euston at 7.30). 

Upon arrival we were very impressed, the reception area and  complimentary glass of Prosecco was lovely.  the boys were over the moon to have their own room with interconnecting doors to us.  The rooms were stunning and the bathrooms were heaven.  The lighting and modern touch pad controls made it very special.

We spent Saturday night on the terrace and in the Aviery, fabulous, food, service and ambience.

After checking out on Sunday morning, we left our luggage at the hotel to collect after the match. We really had it all planned well to get back and onto Euston in time for our train.  Not to be!  When we arrived to collect our luggage we knew we would not make it so sheepishly went in for our luggage and see if we could have a room again.  Thinking the boys would find it an adventure having an impromptu extra night and missing school the next day, I was wrong, they were tired and grumpy!  On reception was Gabby, who could see our dilemma, there was no rooms made up but if we waited half an hour she would have one ready.  She also spoke with her Manager and got us the room at a massively reduced rate.  This was extremely helpful as I had train tickets to purchase again!  Overall, Fantastic and Thank You.",5,2017,05,11
111,Regular traveller,"I have enjoyed my stay at the Montcalm Royal London House, I stay away for work regularly and like to stay somewhere familiar and friendly. Having stayed at a number of different hotels in the City - this one is great. Great staff which results in good customer service, always accommodating.",4,2017,05,11
111,Luxurious hotel with luxurious facilities ,"Hotel was beautiful and from the second we stepped inside knew we were going to have a lovely time. Staff were very welcoming and made us feel special. The rooms were modern, lovely and clean and felt spacious for central london. The facilities were beyond lovely, the spa was lovely, perfect to have some relaxation, gym looked amazing (however we stuck to the pool and jacuzzi!). The rooftop bar is a must, the atmosphere was lovely and the view was perfect at sunset. Staff were very happy to help us, quickly seeing to our every need. We'll definitely be visiting this hotel again, it's in a good location, 5 minute walk from London Liverpool Street. ",5,2017,05,11
111,Great new hotel. Love This hotel! ,Love this hotel. Great entry when you enter the hotel. Really cool eclectic decor. Excellent service from the staff. Spacious bathroom and bedroom with a really Comfortable bed. Love the rain shower head. You have the option to customize your air freshener in your room - with the scent of your choice as well as the type of pillows of your choosing. (Wow- a nice option for a hotel to provide) A really cool restaurant on the roof with a patio outside with views of the city. This hotel sits in a Great location. I really love this hotel. It's Great for business or for a romantic get away or even families. I love the layout of the hotel. I will definitely be coming back here to stay!  ,5,2017,05,10
111,Great customer service and location,"This was our second visit to this hotel , the first was when the hotel was brand new and our visit was disappointing on that occasion for a number of reasons. This second visit was superb, we could not have been treated any better. A key factor is the superb staff for which nothing is too much trouble.Our suite facing Finsbury Square was excellent, good size super bathroom and Hermes products.Hotel has a small indoor pool but with swim up exercisers to compensate. Breakfast in Avery roof top restaurant for great views of London which would be even better in summer with the terrace.Location of hotel very good , 5/10min walk Liverpool Street and Moorgate. In all highly recommended",5,2017,05,09
111,New fave hotel!,"Stayed here in April for a music gig in Camden and absolutely loved everything about it! Ate at the Aviary for lunch and had the ham hock crumpets which was amazing, the service was fantastic during our whole stay, I would definitely stay here again and have since been recommending it to everyone!

Great location, fantastic rooftop bar and beautiful spa - everything you need for a perfect stay in the city! 

I had an email from Guest Experience a few days before our stay asking what the purpose was for our trip and arrived to find complimentary cake and wine in our room to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and our anniversary.

Loved this hotel, staff went above and beyond and it had all the finishing touches!",5,2017,05,09
111,Amazing Anniversary Trip In January..,"Me and my partner had our anniversary evening spent here, our first ever hotel stay may I add as a couple, so we went for somewhere special to celebrate the occasion..  and it was absolutely perfect, from the service provided, the luxurious room, the diligent and attentive approach by all staff within every area to ensure our needs were met.. we couldn't fault any aspect of our stay! 

Rather frustratingly I cannot remember the name of the lady whom provided a little anniversary surprise for me and my partner with complimentary cake and treats upon arrival to our room.. such a lovely gesture that we were both very much appreciative of! The Spa was luxurious, hoping for an extended stay in there this time around, am hoping that treatments will be available soon as they weren't at the time of our first visit? 

We are staying again on the 26th of this month and cannot wait for our return, we consider this to be 'our happy place'.. we regard our first visit so fondly, hoping for another wonderful stay once more. Sam and Kimmy x",5,2017,05,09
111,Loved it ! Top UK hotel,"Stayed for two days - treat as was running the London Marathon. Loved everything about it. Very clean and modern place, beautiful !! Simple and classy. Perfect service.. couldn't ask for anything better. Thought about coming back to that beautiful hotel was extra motivation for my marathon run and helped me going. Everything spotless beautiful terrace roof with amazing view. Turn down service, nothing too much trouble. Definitely will be back. Best hotel I have ever stayed in England. Thank you to all the staff that made our stay memorable. Worth every penny!",5,2017,05,07
111,Exceptional hotel with friendly staff,"This is a luxury hotel, with great facilities and staff who will do absolutely anything to make your stay enjoyable.  We celebrated our wedding anniversary and enjoyed a free room upgrade, with wine and fruit in the room.... a nice touch and very much appreciated.  The Aviary roof top bar and restaurant is very trendy, and the views of the London skyline are breathtaking.  Food and drink costs at the high end but commensurate with the top quality of this great hotel and well worth the extra for the exceptional treatment we received.",5,2017,05,07
111,What a great place to stay !,"The ""Montcalm Royal London House - City of London"" is a modern hotel where you feel comfortable like in a warm cocoon.
It is located between Old Street (Northern - two stops from St Pancras) and Liverpool Street (Central). Great.
The staff was very welcoming. All the people working at the hotel that I met during my stay were always smiling and very attentive. Perfect!
The room was nice and so clean, with modern equipment (a touch pad for light and heating, a connected TV (with satellite TV, spotify, youtube, etc ...), USB ports on the desk) and small ""+"" (like fresh fruit). There was complementary nespresso coffee and tea with biscuits, and bottles of water. Bathrobes and slippers were provided.
The bed was high and very comfortable. The shower was huge and very clean.
And I had the pleasure to discover that the room was switched to ""night time"" when I came back late in the afternoon (the bed was ready and the curtains were closed).
For this quality of service the price was very good !
And again the staff was great ! A perfect stay !",5,2017,05,07
111,Great hotel with a bit annoying room service,"The hotel's location is great and due to the proximity of 3 larger train/tube stations very well connected to almost all areas in London. Rooms are modern and well equipped and sufficiently large. All services are great, except one...

The only annoying thing is the room service although it was always clean. Even if you locked the room they kept knocking for 5 min and entered rather earthy in the morning (even on a bank holiday). For this reason, always switch on the ""don't disturb"" sign.  Often they failed to provide tea, took away complimentary water, claimed I had something from the minibar (which they took of the bill without hesitation, however, as it was still in the fridge). Even when using the bathroom close to the lobby, they knocked and stressed for about 2 minutes. I hurried up and found that they didn't wait - why putting the guests under stress then?",4,2017,05,06
111,Tim,"The front of  house staff are excellent, they cannot do enough for you.  They are attentive and friendly.
The food is of the highest quality, both in the restraint and via room service. 
My room was clean and equipped with every thing you could possibly need .
I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again- first class!",5,2017,05,05
111,Fantastic hotel- first class!,"My friend flew over from the United States to meet up with tow of us that had met in New York three years ago.The staff here pulled out all of the stops, welcoming us with pictures, food, and a bottle of prosecco. Our rooms were amazing, and the staff couldn't do enough to help us- even finding us a place for breakfast on bank holiday Monday for our sore heads!

Thanks everyone at the Montcalm Royal London House for making our stay so memorable.

Molly R.",5,2017,05,05
111,Wonderful 4 day birthday stay 24-27 March,"Upon arriving we both were handed a glass of prosecco each, what a lovely start. We were shown to our room, oh and we were upgraded too, nice touch! The room was amazing, massive tv, aroma setting, digital air con and lights. Nespresso and Jing teas in room. Elemis goodies in the room as well as some fruit and complimentary water too. Just perfect!! We ventured up to the aviary rooftop and had some food and cocktails. The burger was one of the best tasting burgers we have ever had. The cocktails were lovely too. Very busy atmosphere for a Friday afternoon and the view over London was wicked (see pic below). On the Sunday it was my birthday and the hotel was very accommodating, lovely freshly made trifle was placed in our room. Also that day was Mother's Day and the hotel was giving out lovely potted flowers and cupcakes to the guests, what a lovely gesture(see pics below). My only very very small gripe was breakfast wasn't included, I believe you could buy it, at £19 per full breakfast, I thought it was a bit much. That didn't spoil our stay though, all the other positives made up for it. We would go back at the drop of a hat and will definitely return in the future, thanks again for a delightful stay Montcalm!!",5,2017,05,04
111,Birthday Celebration,"
A fabulous birthday surprise .It was indeed a memorable stay at the Montcalm Royal London House..From making the reservation to the checkout was a smooth transition ..Special thanks to Mandeep and his reservations team for taking care of every detail  for this special occasion...very glad and would recommend this hotel to people I know.",5,2017,05,03
111,First Class service at the Montcalm Party Hotel,"We didn't book this hotel. We actually booked and paid for a high floor room at The Montcalm At Brewery further up the road, but on arrival we were told we'd been 'upgraded' (mild worry starting...)
Sooooooo..... we were put into a taxi which took us to The Montcalm Royal London House.
What can I say about this hotel chain? It's brilliant. Simply brilliant. We come to London each month to visit family (and babysit our toddler grandson - remember this bit - very important detail) and usually stay at the Montcalm Tech City. This hotel chain's attention to detail is amazing:
Silent rooms (you can't hear the person in the next room flushing the loo through the night or hear people trundling their wheelies down the corridor at 2 am)
Spotlessly clean and aircon that works.
Bathrobes, slippers, coathangers that aren't chained to the rail (seriously, who would want to help themselves to a coathanger?)
Everything you could possibly need in the bathroom and possibly a few bits you wouldn't ever need.
Fresh fruit, 2 bottles of mineral water.
You get the drift?
HOWEVER .... this is The Party Hotel. You may remember we'd been babysitting the toddler? We were wrecked. We needed peace and quiet. A quiet drink in a relaxing atmosphere. Not a chance.
We arrived back at 9 pm to find that the hotel had attracted every bright young thing in the vacinity. Had to fight through a forest of shreiking women and loud guys playing something akin to 'Shove - a-ha'penny' in the foyer to get to the lift. Loud music. A woman was floating about carrying a clipboard - maybe it was a private party? 
We went up to the top floor (roof terrace and bar). Should've been lovely. No way - couldn't get served. Really busy and noisy. We retreated to our bedroom.
Got out of the lift on the second floor where our bedroom was (we'd requested a high floor room....) to find loud 'techno' music being played on the tannoy. We could hear it INSIDE the bedroom so it was a trip down to reception to complain.
Had a bit of a problem at breakfast in the morning (this was the 'upgrade' - on the 9th floor-with-a-view) when we appeared not to be on 'The List'. Very embarassing. Back down to the ground floor to resolve the problem.
On a positive note, the staff here are delightful. The hotel group is wonderful. If I was 30 years younger I would have LOVED this hotel. Sady, it's situation and roof top bar mean that it will always attract the young trendies who want to let their hair down , so until guests are given priority over non-guests, we won't be returning.",4,2017,05,03
111,Very comfortable & enjoyable stay,"I & my family stayed 4 nights at Montcalm royal house london from 25-29 this April . We booked a family suite which is a connecting room of 2 guestrooms. Very nice to have 2 bathrooms for our family stay . Rooms well equipped & provided mist & aroma diffuser which is caring & good for skin in these dry days. Rooms are super clean & get clean up as well refill everyday efficiently but we never bumping up to any cleaning ladies . They all seems well find their ways to do their jobs without any sudden obtrusion which is good & professional. Breakfasts are in good quality though not many choices but we are happy with. Hotel neighbourhood is ambient & with everything you need all around. One thing would like to mention, staff are friendly & enthusiastic all times which made you feel welcome & professionally taken care of. Definitely will come back . My top list value for every penny hotel in London.",5,2017,05,02
111,Very Good,"Chose the Montcalm Royal based on great reviews & its location for our itinerary. It served us well. The hotel is new so in good shape & our Montcalm Club room was quiet, spacious & sleek with comfy beds, luxurious bedding & a nice outlook over Finsbury Square. Bathrooms are glossy monochrome with terrific showers & a generous supply of Hermes products. We received an array of arrival treats including some delicious homemade chocolates. Club rooms are worth the small price uplift as they include continental breakfast & complimentary drinks & canapés. That said, the club lounge is a soulless spot & we didn't wish to linger. Staff were sweet & helpful in the club breakfast room but not quite on it, failing to notice the absence of cutlery, crockery, glassware etc. In general though staff were polished & well drilled & we found the reception team friendly & efficient. We had an excellent meal in the rooftop restaurant 'Aviary'. Food was top notch & service similarly matched. The restaurant is buzzy & atmospheric though the throb from the music played in the attached bar is on the cusp of being annoying. It's a great bar though, very popular & with great views over the city.",5,2017,05,02
111,Luxury in a great location!,"Stayed here for one night on business but the 5* facilities, location as well as fantastic rooftop terrace, bar and restaurant made my stay out of the ordinary. The luxury was only matched by the customer service which I have no experienced any where else in London. Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,02
111,Outstanding customer service in beautiful hotel,"I can not rate this hotel highly enough. The service from every single member of staff was beyond exceptional. They were so professional and friendly and could not do enough for us. I wish I knew more of the staff's names as every person we came in contact with was wonderful. We were checked in by Michael, who was so polite and welcoming, providing us with all the information we needed to know about this incredible hotel and then another lady came over to offer as a glass of bubbles - wonderful service! 
I had previously spoken with a lady called Sinnitta from the guest experience department and told her we would be celebrating my partner's birthday, she had asked about the things he liked, so that she could put some personal touches in the room. What she arranged for him went above and beyond anything I could have expected. She had decorated the room in a car theme with a road made of cardboard and biscuits decorated as cars, and a had created a book with information the classic cars my partner loves, amongst other lovely treats! My partner was absoloutley over the moon and I was so impressed at the effort she and her team had gone made to create this wonderful birthday surprise. The service continued to be perfect at the hotel's incredible roof-top bar and the next morning at check out.
The hotel building is beautiful, with wonderful interior design, where you can see no expense has been spared. It truly is an exceptional hotel, I have stayed in many 5 star residences within central London but this truly is the best by far. I would not consider staying anywhere else in future.",5,2017,05,01
111,"Overpriced, staff are strange. Didn't get the room requested.","We went in with rather high hopes. The hotel is pretty immaculate but the receptionist was quite weird. In the room itself, it was nice and I liked the mood lights but at times I thought there was too much going on and we really had trouble operating the lights. I had requested for a room with a view only to be given a room with a view of a rather ugly building. I've seen better 5* hotels. This wasn't the worst. But it wasn't brilliant either. Also they only supplied one bathrobe knowing there were two people in the room? Really?",2,2017,05,01
111,"Excellent hotel, perfect location","The Montcalm Royal London is in a great location near Liverpool Street and Spitalflields Market but quiet enough to be away from the crowds of either.

The welcome at reception was perfect, and the decor at the hotel is modern and stylish. There are two excellent bars, one downstairs and one rooftop, which serves perfect cocktails and has a buzzy scene. There's also a restaurant and while we didn't eat there, it looked good. 

The room was large and comfortable and well-equipped (with the usual Montcalm extras, like the aroma machine). The shower was up there with the best. There's also a small spa/swimming pool which was a great respite after an afternoon shopping and eating. 

If we're in the area again (and we're very likely to be, with the plethora of restaurants around Spitalifieds, City and Shotreditch), we'd have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2017,05,01
111,Fabulous once again,"Another great trip to the RLH.
 I was emailed prior to our visit asking if it was for a special occasion and when we planned to arrive, low and behold we were given an upgrade and the room was decorated!

Staff are so polite and friendly, the rooms are beautiful and we cannot wait to go back.

The roof terrace is an added bonus either to watch the sun go down or at breakfast time.",5,2017,05,01
111,Absolutly Amazing,"When we arrived at the hotel we was given a really warm friendly welcome, check in was nice and fast, got down to the room, as we arrived so late was on the -1 floor, which safe to say had no view at all, the room was a good size with a nice big bathroom, the room controls were all done from a futuristic touchscreen monitor in the wall, each side of the bed had its own controls from the bedside lights to the mood lighting to the bathroom light, the bathroom had underfloor heating. the tv on the wall was nce and large, with many different controls, with information about the hotel on, different apps, Bluetooth connectivity for media playing and sky. On our 2nd day then when we went out for the morning, we returned mid day to grab a few extra things for the event we were attending that night, while we were there we had someone to come round to inspect the fruit we had in the room which had been left out for us. There was also a nice welcome card, bottle of bubbly(I think) and some nice fruit and cake things, not to sure what they were. The bed was very big and comfy. The bathroom was a good size with a very big shower, and also a set of scales which I haven't soon before in a hotel room. On our 2nd night there after we had gotten back in at about 2 in the morning, we got a bit peckish and decided to order room service, to guy who came down for the room service was ery nice and pleasant and couldn't do enough to help you, the food and drink didn't take long to arrive considering the time, and was extremely nice. There was however a few very minor bad points about staying, 1st is there was no menue/price list for the mini bar in the room, normally I like to have a drink in the middle of the night if I get a bit thirsty but since I don't know the price didn't this time, I asked at reception for one but they couldn't seem to help. 2nd was the in room phone didn't seem to be working, I tried to phone for room service a couple of times but didn't work as it kept just ringing out, and had to physically go up to reception to make my order. 3rd was there was only 1 bath robe in the bathroom even tho the room was booked for 2, we had 2 set of slippers, shower caps ect just only 1 bath robe. 4th, there were no curtains for the bathroom, the glass was frosted so you cant see though/into the bathroom, but when is mid morning and you wanting a lie in, or if the suns up early, there was no way of blocking it out, the curtains in the main room were brilliant, but the light still shon through from the bathroom lighting up the room. 5th, as we was on the -1, there was a bit of noise from the bar above but luckily, we weren't in the room for the long, just got changed then went out so wasn't really in the room while the bar above was open so didn't effect us to much.But overall the hotel was very good, all the staff were very warm and welcoming and always looking to help. Also the hotel is only about a 3 minute walk down the road from Moorgate underground, so getting there is an absolute doddle.",5,2017,04,30
111,stay for boxing,"Visited London for the boxing with friends,and this is a short review.I will not bore you with too much detail but instead highlight everything shortly with bullet points.

1.Hotel,definintely 5 star,staff are amazing and will do anything to make you comfortable,management if you read this please take note-Your staff are superb.
2.Modern hotel,great bar,rooms amazing with large flat screen TV's,great soft bed,great bathroom,great gym,great pool,great jacuzzi,steam room etc.........great everything.
3.Quiet,modern,clean,new,amazing for everything...........

Last but not least,the downside which is very small in comparison.............

1.Large dirty white burger van sat right in front of this exciting luxury hotel's reception with suited and booted doorman-why? Probably not your decision i am sure,but needed to be mentioned.

2.Breakfast,not great to be honest.Great views but the food,in all honesty is average at best and possibly one of your weak areas.Service collapses a little when busy.

3.Bar closes far too early.

4.Noisy generator from next door buzzing all night

Thats about it,thankyou for our stay and i really recommend everyone to come here-it is superb.",5,2017,04,30
111,Treated like royalty!,"New hotel, so not everything is in totally perfect order yet. When I stayed the lockers in gym changing rooms were not installed, a few items that I would consider standard at breakfast to be offered was not but I think this is still being tweaked. 

The exec lounge is one of  best in terms of drinks offered.. none of this Smirnoff vodka stuff, they have Grey Goose here, a good selections of red and white wines, a lovely prosecco, a wide rage of fruit juices, even strawberry! 

Pool is smaller than their sister hotel up the road but it's lovely all the same. 

Extremely comfortable beds, glad to see the Hermes shower gel and shampoo is here also as I'm addicted to the stuff and can't seem to find it to purchase retail so maybe just a contract to supply hotels with???

Didn't go up to the rooftop bar at night but it certainly looked nice in the daytime so much be stunning at night. 

Staff were all nice and as per usual Indira was her usual delightful self. 

I will be back! 

",4,2017,04,29
111,First visit,"We were on the 5th floor in this nice hotel. 
The room was very modern with a lovely bathroom. Huge TV on the wall! Great touch panel lighting, underfloor heating and air con. 
We both slept very well and would certainly be returning. 
Thank you :)",5,2017,04,29
111,Loved it :),Only stayed here for a night but I loved this hotel. Service at the front desk is quick and if any issues they can also resolve it quickly. The room was nice and spacious with a Really comfortable bed! If you're looking to be close by spitalfields then this is a perfect spot. ,4,2017,04,29
111,Below Average Business Accomodation,"Only stayed here because it is close to my office. 

Hotel below average. Room was clean but missing basic items such as when the gym opens, timing of breakfast,mini bar prices. 

In room dining menu is extremely limited (only 5 main dishes). 

Gym is very small (2 treadmills) and only opens at 630am.

Air Condition control is maddening. 

Aside from the positive location to my office, the TV has a wife selection of channels.",2,2017,04,28
111,"Fantastic hotel, I would highly recommend!","I had a really great stay.  Lovely room, the staff were probably the friendliest I’ve experienced.  A special mention for the ladies on your Reception who were absolutely first class, I would definitely return.",5,2017,04,27
111,Excellent hotel,I don't have what bad to say. It was pleasure to stay with my family in this hotel. Smiley staff. Really quick chek in. Our suite was with really comfy king size bed and sofa where our kids enjoyed the stay. 2 bathrooms one of them with bath and very nice showers. Everything is modern and new. Very clean and tidy. I just would like to say Thanks to the Housekeeping team for keeping our room very clean and serviced on time when we asked because this is very important for us. I saw one yong guy from the Housekeeping Staff there which we asked for service and he came immediately with one nice lady. After the service he came back to check how we are and do we need something which was very sweetheart. We enjoyed and the Rooftop bar with my husband where try the cocktaills which was really nice prepared from really lovely bartender. Really i would like say THANK YOU to all Montcalm Team. We will be back soon!!!,5,2017,04,26
111,The most comfortable beds ever!,The beds here are very comfortable. The room was peaceful and quiet for a good night's sleep. The room was lovely. Good quality hotel & very central hotel to the city. Staff were great! loved my stay.,5,2017,04,26
111,Great stay,"Stayed here last night and had to write a review. Great location - close to lots of the tourist sites and minutes from the underground. Rooms are brilliant, a great size which you don't normally get in the capital with lots of modcons such as the touch screen controls allowing you to have ""mood lighting"", underfloor heating and air con. Staff were really friendly and helpful. 

Breakfast great, I had the hot buffet and the bacon was amazing. ",5,2017,04,26
111,Big hotel - but great,"I found it surprisingly good. 
I’ve travelled the world and have a love-hate relationship with large hotels.  Often you just feel like a digit on a spreadsheet.
But with the Montcalm it was different. The staff were the thing that made the difference - the welcome at the desk; the personalities of people serving in the restaurant. 
Oh - and my room (a junior suite) was great; the free drinks downstairs was brilliant; and I thought the food in Aviary was top notch.
I'll go back, for sure.",4,2017,04,26
111,"Lovely place, just a few things to fix ","It would have otherwise been a lovely experience had it not been for  a few niggling issues (the not so great cleaning of the room in particular). However the staff is really helpful and they try. 

Not much else to complain about ... Good location, nice decor and fairly comfortable room. Would give them another shot. ",4,2017,04,26
111,Polished and professional,"I was moved here after booking at a sister hotel-but appreciate it being the eve of the London Marathon 

The welcome was warm and very professional-including a lovely glass of fizz!- and was upgraded and given free breakfast for any inconvenience 

A lovely stay and the hotel responded swiftly and positively when I emailed them a minor follow up concern around breakfast charges 

A luxury stay that I would recommend",5,2017,04,26
111,Lovely Hotel - Great Rooftop Bar!! ,"My friend and I stayed here for our birthdays over the weekend. I love the decor of this hotel and you can tell it's relatively new! The room was great - we loved all the modern technologies in the room (the little things) like the light changing colours and electronic panels for lights etc. We were treated to some macaroons, fruit and wine in our room for our birthdays which was a lovely touch. Our favourite thing about this hotel was the rooftop, as we were early for check-in we spent a few hours having some drinks on the rooftop bar. The views of London are great and especially on a dry day this is a must. Whilst it was abit chilly we were given some blankets to take the edge of the wind. The pineapple cocktail sharer is a must. We will definitely return to the rooftop over the summer and stay here again. The only negative would be the service in the Aviary (rooftop) which was slightly slow, with a half hour wait on someone taking our order when there were only a handful of guests up there. Also, room service came to turn our beds back in the evening and when requesting that she come back after we finished getting ready she said she'd come back in half an hour but she never came back. This hotel has a great location and 5/10 minute walk from the closest tube station and frequent taxis outside. All in all a fantastic stay and I would definitely recommend!! ",5,2017,04,25
111,very positive hotel experience,"Staff keen to please. Very comfortable room, well equipped. Welcoming and relaxed bar area on ground floor. Lovely location on Finsbury Square. Rooftop restaurant fantastic location with some outside space. Less impressed with the food but we did only have one course so may not be a fair representation. Would definitely stay again and probably give the restaurant another try.",4,2017,04,25
111,Modern quirky luxury,"Having stayed frequently at the Brewery location we thought we'd try the new location as we love staying in this area as it's so quiet at the weekends. With parking a stones throw away we walked to the hotel and the doorman actually came out to greet us and to see if we wanted help with our luggage. This is a quirky, modern and friendly up market hotel at very reasonable prices. The staff are lovely, we did have 2 small hiccups but to be expected with a new hotel and nothing that wouldn't stop us from staying again. The hotel is immaculately clean with extremely comfortable beds and touches of luxury everywhere in room and throughout the hotel. Burdock the ground floor bar is just as quirky as the rest of the hotel with a great drinks menu and interesting things to keep you busy (check it out I won't spoil the surprises) and doubles as a great coffee shop. The rooftop bar and restaurant is a must try as the service is impeccable and again has a great selection of drinks in trendy surroundings and a great view of the city. I will review the restaurant separately but suffice to say it really was of a very high standard especially for a hotel, really tasty dishes using seasonal produce and very well presented.  This is a cool spot winter or summer.",5,2017,04,25
111,"Fantastic location, views and staff","Had a great experience at the Montcalm this weekend. The rooms are lovely, the location is great and the bar and the views are wonderful. The staff made it extra special by leaving a bottle of prosecco and chocolates in the room as we were celebrating a special occasion. We even managed to find time to use the pool and the spa, lovely. We will definitely be back.",5,2017,04,24
111,Lovely Hotel,"After an easy check in, we were delighted with our room. It was spacious and comfy. The room had some cool modern features, including a cool scented fan (not sure of technical name) it made the room smell wonderful! We were also able to access the club lounge to enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks which was a lovely touch! The pool/spa was not yet open when we visited but would definitely go back to see the changes since previously visiting. Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great food!",5,2017,04,23
111,Great hotel in London!,Been there last week for one night and I have been impressed by this hotel. Everything is great from the rooms which are beautiful and very well equipped to the services like the bar restaurant on the 10th floor which serves breakfast in the morning with a stunning terrasse and view on London!,5,2017,04,22
111,Amazing hotel 5*,"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel in Febuary I must say the staff go above and beyond to ensure guest needs are met and exceeded. On day one my husband was not very happy we called reception and the lovely lady quickly sorted the small issue with our room. Our 2nd day we went to concierge were a lovely guy Raymond helped us pick out the nicest little Italian restaurant to eat, that evening we had a apology in our room to which I called down to reception to say I do not drink red wine a lady came with a bottle of white problem solved. All in all I'd liked to say thank you to Raymond sanita and all the staff who helped ensure me and my husband were comfortable and happy. Rooftop bar has amazing views of London we will sure be back in summer!",5,2017,04,21
111,Great Accomodation,"The Montcalm Royal London House - Finsbury Square London. 
Really great specification rooms
Very helpful and attentive staff
Great location a very short walk from Moorgate station and only a few stops from all of the main London attractions. We had a nice relaxing stay over the Easter Weekend.",5,2017,04,21
111,Get the Montcalm MCRL Experience!!,"This is our second time at the Montcalm.

Our first stay was in January 25th-26th for our birthdays and we was delighted by the hospitality of the staff from the door man to the guest experience agent krystine who went the extra mile in terms of our overall stay. On arrival we was greeted promptly with door service, complimentary glasses of presseco as we checked in and help with our bags to our room. Overall we enjoyed our time in the MCRL hotel and the only let down was very minor being the underfloor heating in our bathroom but we was assured that all will be amended by the next time we come back.

Our second stay was 2 nights spend over this easter April 16th-18th and again the staff was completely professional and helpful.

The stay was again great but we had some concerns on the day of checking out. My partner had  been bitten by what could be a bed or dust parasite on her calf and lower left ankle. We took pictures of the inflammation of the bites and will be contacting the hotel to prevent any further such happenings. A slight ""downer"" to our break! We was also slightly confused as to why the admittance to the sauna facility now closed half an hour early then on our previous stay but we was happy to see the changing room was both running in accordance to this hotels standard.

As for the staff present during our stay, we would definitely like to thank Ivet the guest experience agent, who provided assistance from even before we arrived in terms of any special requests we may of needed. Daniel who was also very helpful. He handled our bags with care as he took them from reception to room and even then went the extra mile to provide  additional help by going to the aviary to bring my fiancé and I the dining menu, explaining how great the food and ambience was.
Also we would like to thank Johnny and Clairease who work as waiter and waitress in the avairy for such pleasant hospitality and would definitely be coming back very soon.

We really appreciate all the hospitality and offers to come

111,Hospitality second to non,"The staff, the room & amenities were fabulous. The free pens are pretty good as well!  The rooftop bar has one of the best views in London and we got served very quickly and plenty of room to sit down.Wish I could have stayed longer!",5,2017,04,20
111,Perfect,"Lovely stay at the hotel, it was our anniversary and we stayed in a family room with another couple. The hotel left a card, champagne and rose petals on the bed. It was very sweet and gave us a wonderful experience. Our bed was super comfy, and our friends that stayed in the other room on the pull out couch said it was pretty comfortable. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,04,20
111,The best hotel I've ever stayed,"There are several reasons why this hotel culminates to be one of the best hotels ever. In short:

Their staff are the upmost friendly, efficient and helpful people ever. Manager Daisy, arranged for the perfect trip for me and my fiancée by giving us a great room, with the best views. Their concierge and reception staff were extremely polite when we had any questions or enquiries. E.g I needed directions to get a few things and they even offered to show me where the place was by foot. 

Their room quality and room service is second to none: the room was decorated extremely well and there were zero quality issues. I ordered room service on a Saturday night and the food came on time, hot and tasted great (price was decent too compared to other London Hotels).

The spa and hotel itself is well maintained, clean and extremely nice. There are plenty of staff members around to direct you anywhere which is really ideal considering how large the hotel is.

The roof top restaurant and bar itself is perfect for an evening plan, making the hotel very convenient to stay and have dinner at. 

The hotel is situated in a square meaning there's not traffic outside, making the outside quiet and not busy. 

All in all, the hotel is the best chain of hotels I've ever stayed at. 10/10 recommended.

111,Above & Beyond. Thank You!,"I've stayed at many 5 star hotels in different continents to see what the world has to offer but I can confidently say the hospitality and service as a whole from The Montcalm Team at Royal London House went above and beyond; 1 of the best hospitality experiences we've received. Thank you to Daisy and the team. 

I was attending the musician Drake's concert at the time during our visit to London, as it was a gift for my partner for her birthday. We decided to stay at The Montcalm Royal London House to mark the occasion.

Not only did The Montcalm Royal London House Team greet us with complimentary red velvet cake slices with 'happy birthday' confetti sprinkled all around the cake; Ivet & Sinnitta personally went out their way to create a very elaborate concert programme inciting details about Drake, trivia we didn't know about the famous rapper and lyrics from some of his latest hits! This was laminated with a cute Montcalm bow attached to it, creating even more of an excitement for our night out at the O2 Arena for The Drake concert. I care to elaborate specifically because you can't emphasise enough at how much thought was put into this when it wasn't due at all. It's a warming touch, one my partner and I will never forget. 

Would like to make an observation of the room too. For a location deep in the heart of central London, the room's offer generous amount of space. The cleanliness was of very good standard. We also took notice of how Montcalm pay attention to the littlest of detail with our room preference: from what sort of pillows we would like to sleep with, to what scent we would like the room to smell of! 

A mention regarding front desk too. A warm welcome upon check-in and a pleasant farewell upon check-out. We felt right at home straight away. 

You can see why the Montcalm chain is rapidly growing across London. The service and quality in general offers no room for complaints. I'd definitely come and stay here again. I'd confidently recommend it to anybody reading this review. I'd especially recommend the hotel, specifically Montcalm Royal London House to my friends and family too. Thanks again to Daisy and Co.",5,2017,04,19
111,Not worth the money,"We stayed here for 1 night.  We requested a quiet room and unfortunately they put us on the top floor just below the restaurant. So noisy could constantly hear people walking around above and the music from the bar.  After calling down to reception and speaking to a couple of people they eventually moved us to another room. Although much quieter we experienced further  issues with the new room; no glasses in the room for the water, bath plug was broken (maintenance came to look and said they would need to order a new plug) so couldn't have a bath, faulty air con which kept us awake most the night, room service food arrived cold...  The next morning we informed reception of the issues and they apologised and refunded some money back to us and explained we would receive an email with offers/discount if we stayed again - yet to receive this email!   Reception staff overall were very friendly, however bar/restaurant service very slow.  Great location, just the issues with the room were disappointing given how much we paid and for a so called 5star hotel.",3,2017,04,18
111,Birthday surprise,"excellent stay in this hotel. it was my girlfriends birthday and anniversary and i contacted them prior to let me know.

The guest experience team went out of their way to make it special. the room was upgraded with a view of fins bury square, complimentary glass of fizz in the aviary and they even done a memory jar for us.

the service was 5* from start to finish i would highly recommend this hotel. 

The room was amazing also.",5,2017,04,18
111,Amazing hotel,"Stayed her on Thursday 14th April and was met by Gabby on reception.  She was excellent and couldn't do enough for us.  We checked in promptly, was upgraded to a club room and then went to the rooftop bar Aviary for drinks followed by dinner.  The whole experience was excellent and I would definitely recommend it.  Thank you Gabby for looking after us so well, you are a credit to the hotel.  Would absolutely return.",5,2017,04,18
111,Stunning Slick London Hotel!,"I've been looking for a Totel like this for a loooong time! Perfect location to my office and Moorgate Station. the style and finishing of the hotel on point, the rooms very modern and spacious. Breakfast options not so good though but good enough for a quick breakfast before the working day.

It's safe to say I will be back :-)",4,2017,04,18
111,Fantastic hotel!,"Recently stayed here for one night to celebrate our anniversary, we come down to London once a year to watch a show on the west end. 

We booked through booking.com, however the hotel we actually booked was the Montcalm London City Suites. 

When we arrived for check in at the Montcalm Brewery they advised us that they had to change us to the Royal London due to overbooking.

At first I was disappointed until I realised the Royal London sounded incredible! We were taken to the Royal London in a complimentary taxi from the Brewery.

We were 2 hours early for check in, we were asked if we wanted to leave our luggage and come back later. We said we would just wait in the lobby because we weren't heading out until early evening. 

We had booked a standard double room, but then the concierge told us that he had upgraded to club room and that the room was available right away! Such brilliant service. We were given a complimentary breakfast and access to the spa. 

The room was beautiful, on the 6th floor. We absolutely loved the technology with the touch screen buttons to control the lights and aircon etc. Especially loved the different coloured mood lights.

The tv was huge and has Sky, Spotify, YouTube etc. Fantastic! 

The rooftop bar (Aviary) was gorgeous with the amazing skyline view. The bar prices were expensive though. 

Every single member of staff we came across were polite and friendly. 

We will definitely be returning.

111,Amazing stay in Montcalm Hotel,"We spent 4 days in the Montcalm hotel in London. Very well located and with a stunning view of the city on the rooftop. The staff was excellent and devoted ! Adrian Paul and Raluca were so nice with us. 
The SPA was so great and relaxing, yet the sauna and the changing rooms too small... 
WE had such a great time ! ",5,2017,04,17
111,Just one night ....,"Fantastic friendly staff, the hotel was spotlessly clean everywhere with well proportioned technology enhanced rooms. The rooftop bar was excellent as too the lobby bar so you are spoiled for choice. Within easy access to all main routes and attractions we would definitely recommend this hotel and we are already looking forward to our next stop.

Definitely 5*

",5,2017,04,17
111,Lovely Hotel,The first time we have stayed here and I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is clean and stylish and in a good location. We used the Liverpool St tube station which was just a short walk from the hotel. The staff were all friendly and polite. Would definitely stay here again in the future. ,5,2017,04,16
111,Mr,"Monticalm Royal is such a classy place and the staff and Management make you never want leave. The hospitality is incredibly beautiful. High class response in shall you have any need for anything anytime. Love the Jacuzzi, Gym, Steam Rooms and most importantly the Champaign the offer you as a hole thank you when you stay with them. That 5pm free meal or snack service downstairs​ has made me fall in love with this place forever.",5,2017,04,15
111,Very fancy hotel,"Nice hotel. Very good beds. Neat technical solutions in the rooms with a touch screen that controls lights etc, though not without a few bugs/hangs. Nice to have a complimentary cheap phone with free Internet to use as a tour guide during our stay, though this was very slow and evidently mostly advertisement for selected attractions. The English breakfast was very good, but not entirely worth the premium price (it was not included in our room).",5,2017,04,14
111,4 night stay for business,"Staying at the Montcalm Royal was a great experience. This was my second time at the hotel and on both occasions I found it to be extremely clean, comfortable and having a relaxing atmosphere.
 
Staff were extremely attentive to all of my queries and the location is perfect. Also, the rooftop bar and restaurant is amazing!
 
Thank your for a great stay.",5,2017,04,13
111,Top hotel with great roof top bar and restaurant - fantastic views of city,"Dear Ivet,
I had a lovely stay at The Montcalm Royal London House, and want to thank you and all the staff I dealt with. Very pleasant, helpful and professional.
My highlight had to be breakfast this morning at the roof top restaurant 10th floor. A full fresh buffet breakfast laid out in a really great space with the most magnificent views of London City... You Gotta Experience This Place!!
I will be recommending your hotel and I look forward to my next stay with you.
Kind regards, 
Keith Redmond",5,2017,04,13
111,its home from home!,"I reserved rooms for myself, our CEO and a site MD for the night of Tuesday 12 April and we were all extremely pleased with the experience.  Our CEO is a member of your loyalty scheme and he was extremely impressed with the price of his room, particularly for the London location and as it’s only a 5-minute walk from our London office.

I received a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite which was stunning, the walk in shower with rainforest shower head was fantastic, the room was enormous and the bed extremely comfortable.

As and when we do stay in London we prefer to stay at The Montcalm Royal London House as it covers all our needs.",5,2017,04,13
111,Faultless!,"A truly exceptional hotel from the staff, service, decor and especially the amazing Versace pool. There is nothing I would fault; the hotel is the epitome of luxury. Ivette and her team exceeded my expectations and therefore I will be recommending the Montcalm Hotel to everyone who wishes to stay in a remarkable hotel in London. Thankyou again for making my partners' birthday special. Excellent value and top service for money!",5,2017,04,13
111,Absolutely excellent.,"This hotel is sleek and stylish; immaculately presented and spotlessly clean. Everything sparkles with ""newness"" and opulence! The rooms are wonderfully luxurious and packed with the latest technology to enhance your stay.

The staff are an absolute asset: receptionists are welcoming and helpful; the consierge go out of their way to accommodate your needs and the cleaning staff are extremely attentive. 

The location is ideal, with Moorgate station only a short walk away and there are plenty of eateries and shops nearby. I particularly recommend taking advantage of the Aviary rooftop terrace, where you can enjoy stunning views of the London skyline. However, be prepared, the view comes with a cost! The food and drink is very expensive and the wine menu is limited - we were considering eating there, but due to this, we decided against it and found an alternative restaurant nearby. Additionally, if you wish to sample a good old British burger then use the van parked just outside the hotel entrance (he opens in the evening); there you will find cheap and unfussy food served by a friendly face - the swarm of cheerful taxi and bus drivers who queue for refreshments cannot be wrong! 

The criticisms that I have are minor and offered on here constructively: firstly, upon arrival, our room was akin to a tropical greenhouse. The sun was steaming through the windows and the air conditioning was off, resulting in an unbearable temperature. It was so hot that the air conditioning was ineffectual for several hours, and with no windows to open, we did consider asking to move rooms but were so exhausted from traveling that we sweated it out. Even the contents of the mini-bar fridge were tepid! In future, perhaps on such a warm day, the hotel staff should ensure that the air conditioning is switched on in preparation for arriving guests.

Secondly and finally, we were disappointed to find cartons of UHT milk on the hospitality tray and not fresh milk (we did request this and a jug was brought up promptly), but in a five star hotel, I believe fresh milk should be supplied as standard.

This is an excellent hotel that provides five star surroundings and service for a very reasonable and competitive price. Highly recommended.",5,2017,04,11
111,Stylish but flawed for business trips ,"When I travel for business I have very different expectations than when I travel for pleasure 

First and foremost I need an environment that is no hassle, work enabling and allows for simple rest

Unfortunately, while having many advantages this hotel operations and facilities have all these small issues that while on vacation could be dismissed as amusing quirkiness but when on a busy work trip end up as yet another annoying waste of time

So here are the issues on  my most recent 1 week stay. Clearly all small issues, but the accumulation just make it a less than efficient place  (and my colleagues had very similar experiences):

- electronic room lock broke down, on 2 separate occasions. Kept going up and down to reception to get it fixed
- Room lights are controlled by that snazzy touch screen. Only that it keeps freezing randomly 
- when watching TV every 20 minutes or so some weird error message shows on screen obscuring the picture. Need to dismiss it using remote
- on check in asked for tooth brush as arrived without my luggage that got lost by the airlines. Nothing ever arrived to my room
- on room lock break #2 (see above) was promised it would be fixed the following day, which never happened. Had to remind them. 
- mistakenly charged for breakfast (although it was supposed to be charged back to my employer). First reception clerk claimed there is no such thing as ""charge back"" and only upon check out and with another manager I managed to sort it out
- 4 elevators do not have a single control, so every time on either bet on the fastest or go around and call all 4

Redeeming quality was the staff that was super nice, genuinely friendly and eager to fix everything
Alas, shortcoming in maintenance and arguably in management and skills are still making it a hotel I would hesitate to recommend to truly busy business travellers 
",3,2017,04,10
111,"Fab hotel, rooftop bar and great staff","I love this hotel - what a find! The rooftop bar is decorated Art Deco style and there is often live music and amazing cocktails. There's a small swimming pool, sauna, gym etc which are great too. The breakfast is tasty, the rooms are great and come equipped with a massive TV, coffee machine and a well stocked mini bar.
The staff are amazing and the doorman even remembered me from a previous visit.",5,2017,04,10
111,Lovely hotel ,"We originally booked at there sister hotel the brewery, however when we arrived they said they had over booked and transferred us to this hotel. 
We stayed in a club room with breakfast included. The room is spacious, modern and clean. With lots of technology. I just wish they had an instruction manual to explain everything. 
The breakfast was nice, and the roof top bar was lovely. 
The staff were lovely too. 
Our only issue was that we were awoken to loud drilling and banging at 8am which was annoying as we came to the hotel to relax and have a lie in. The manager did give us a discount on the nights stay though. 
Overall was a lovely stay, in a good location and was worth the money. ",4,2017,04,10
111,Absolutely fabulous!!!,"Me and my partner are pregnant and needed a well deserved weekend away! In all honestly we were treated like celebrities! Whilst checking in, got an upgrade on a room on higher floor with an amazing view of London skyscrapers. Room was lovely- complementary drinks + extra soft drinks as they considered me being pregnant they were extra nice and even received a card with a welcoming note! All channels on the telly + international telly + YouTube +Spotify etc. As well as films so it makes a perfect night in! The beds are super comfy that I am no longer comfortable on my own bed! Bathroom was very stylish but had everything you needed, even a phone if you need to make a quick call haha!
Best bits were the underfloor heating, computerised light control inc mood lights (fancy).
Room service was quick but probably cause the restaurant is just one floor above although food wasn't hot! In the morning I was not feeling too well so the staff kindly delivered our breakfast up to our room! Again, not hot and had missing ingredients which we called up about and was supposed to be with us right away - They never showed up (I blame a busy Sunday morning after Grand National) only other downside was that the key card did not work properly but again- this could have been a one off and lastly- the lifts are tiny! 
I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and I will surely stay again!",5,2017,04,10
111,"Great hotel, amazing city place to stay!","I have stayed at this hotel once before when it had just opened and there were a few teething problems, but this time the experience was amazing.

The moment I stepped up to the entrance the smiling and helpful doorman showed me to reception where a helpful lady assisting me with check in, the manager Daisy came out of her office to make sure everything was as I had requested for a romantic night with my girlfriend and said that whatever we needed she would be on hand to assist.

Daisy then made sure another helpful lady took me up to the room and showed me how to use all the tech equipment in the room. The room was set up beautifully with flowers and champagne that I had requested but also with some canapés and strawberries which I didn't expect but was a great addition.

In the evening we went up to the roof bar which was beautiful and had nice tranquil music and lovely views of the city. The cocktails were excellent and service was quick, it was rather busy but it was also the hottest day of the year so was to be expected I suppose. It was so nice that we left late for our night out elsewhere!!

In the morning we ordered room service for breakfast, my partner has a gluten allergy and although they made a mistake with the first order they quickly sent up the correct order and were very apologetic. The breakfast was excellent as well.

All in all probably the best hotel I have stayed in London and doubt I will use another hotel again!!",5,2017,04,10
111,Beautiful hotel ,"Beautiful hotel, the staff were very courteous and happy to help. 

The room felt very luxurious with good quality toiletries, bath robe, slippers etc. 

Great in room entertainment system. 

All areas of hotel were immaculate, roof top restaurant bar was very pleasant. 

One tip for room would be to supply mugs/larger cups in the room for making hot drinks in.  (We only had expresso size which not ideal for tea)

All in all I would recommend! 😊

",5,2017,04,09
111,Best hotel !!! ,"This was my 2nd time at the Montcalm hotel, the location is brilliant and the hotel is well and truly amazing !!! The rooms are beautiful and extremely clean and luxury.

I will 100 % be returning here. The hotel staff are also extremely friendly and kindly upgraded my room for free on arrival as it was my partners birthday. The staff also went out of their way to bring some delicious cake and strawberries to the room at no charge ! This is hands down the best hotel in the area.  

At night we visited the roof top bar for some drinks which again was very very nice , the atmosphere was great ! 

I cannot wait to return to this hotel !",5,2017,04,09
111,Speechless,"London has always been and will remain one of my top cities to visit. This time my London experience went from great to leaving me almost speechless at times because my husband booked us at the Montcalm Royal London House.

We were immediately attended to by the reception, behind which stood the very lovely and attentive Dado. She picked up on the fact that I loved the flowers all along the hotel. I was later greeted by orchids and lilies in the room, and along with that, champagne and plate with strawberries and macarons.

Dado and Cyann, I want to thank you personally again for making my stay truly memorable!",5,2017,04,09
111,Excellent hotel and brilliant front of house staff,"Fantastic new rooms, hotel is very quiet and the front of house staff are probably some of the best I've ever come across - very friendly, helpful and polite.

The club rooms are great for couples and young families, and a special treat when working away on business.

Highly recommend this hotel for business and pleasure!",5,2017,04,08
111,Hotel or Nightclub?,"This hotel struggles with what it wants to be!  Very disappointed with my 3-night stay here at the end of March 2017.  Private events on the rooftop restaurant/bar seem to take precedence at this hotel.  Want to use the elevator close to the front door to get to your room?  Nope, not if there is a private event going on.  A big bouncer guy will kindly ask you to use the back elevator.  Oh, and don't forget that you will have to navigate the hostesses and crowd in the ground floor restaurant and bar on both sides of the entrance to get to either set of elevators.  Seeking refuge in the club lounge?  Nope, it's this weird room directly across from the front desk -- with no door to keep things quiet.  No privacy there.  But wait -- the refuge of my hotel room!  Nope. The room is stylish and the shower is terrific, but the mattresses were lumpy and the two twins both sloped inward so you end up sleeping on the crack between them.  You can always sit in the stylish, but narrow, uncomfortable lounge chair in the room though.  Ok, but surely the breakfast will get you energised.  Nope.  While it's adequate, it is nothing like the breakfast feasts found at other five-star hotels in London.  Lastly, mention to the front desk at 17:00 (5:00pm) that your room has not been serviced and expect courtesy?  Nope.  Get scolded for not turning your light on to indicate you'd like housekeeping service.  To conclude, this hotel is obviously not for me or anyone looking for quiet, luxurious comfort that is attuned to the business traveler. I will be staying a different hotel during my next trip to London!",2,2017,04,07
111,Very good hotel ,"A 5 star hotel with competitive prices (tbh its prices are considered very low for London) and very very good quality. Very helpful staff, very cozy rooms with high tech gadgets, very good restaurants, two breakfasts to choose from. VERY satisfied and I will be there again when I visit London in June. Recommended.",5,2017,04,07
111,Hidden Gem!,"New hotel, very good value for money. The staff are wonderful. Cyann in guest relations and the Manger of the roof bar Chris really looked after us on our last visit. We will defiantly go back. The rooms are very well equipped with up to date technology (large smart tv) great showers and comfy beds. Its located close enough to central London but equally far enough away which makes it a little quieter in that area. Fantastic views of The Gherkin and others from the roof bar/restaurant. Nice clean spa facilities. Close to places like shoreditch for nights out, Moorgate station  
1 mins walk.",5,2017,04,06

The staff was terribly nice and helpful. They did not know what else to do me make me feel comfortable. its my new place to stay in London from now on!",5,2017,04,06
111,Excellent Price Performance,"Modern new hotel. Nice staff. Good facilities. Very nice rooftop restaurant and bar. Located in East of London city. Easy walking distance to Shoreditch High Street, Brick Lane and Spitalfields Market (recommended) . 2-3 subway lines closes. Several nice restaurants and bars close by. ",5,2017,04,05
111,Excellent in the heart of the City,"Our staying @ London was excellent due to the hotel. It is a modern place, clean and comfortable. Half an hour walk to Thames river. Half an hour by metro to the Oxford street. The receptionist are very helpful. The electronic system of the rooms is a little more complicated that I could handle. ",5,2017,04,04
111,Great and easy stay,"It's a great hotel, the breakfast is by far the best breakfast I've had at a 5* hotel. The spa is a great touch also with the gym. The spa is usually quiet, peaceful and the gym has top equipment. It is in a business area but still very central. Staff are pleasant and lovely. Would have liked a bath in the bathroom though but you do have a jacuzzi in the spa anyway! ",5,2017,04,04
111,The ingredients are all there....just needs some fine tuning!,"Some hotels appeal because of the brand of the hotel chain, some the architectural interest of the building, some the facilities, some the fittings and decor, some the staff, some the restaurant and others the location. Montcalm Royal London House has all the ingredients to score highly on all of these, especially in the jaw dropping rooftop bar with great views of the City of London skyline at night...so why only 4 stars? Let's just say that there were some growing pains. MRLH is a fairly new hotel and as such is still in it's formative years. We had some problems with the restaurant during breakfast and the evening meal and a couple of niggles with some features of the room but to their credit, once given constructive feedback, the staff went out of their way to correct them. A special mention should go to Sinnitta, who went above and beyond to ensure that we enjoyed our stay. Suffice to say, we left feeling that we really enjoyed our break and that MRLH has the potential to be a top, top hotel destination. We look forward to watching it develop from an awkward toddler into a confident teenager. We'll definitely be heading back in the near future.",4,2017,04,04
111,Amazing!,"So my partner and I stayed at this amazing hotel last weekend and wow! We were absolutely blown away by everything! The service, the facilities and the staff! 
Gregory, the night manager, was extremely helpful and Christina at check in was lovely too. But all the staff members were very professional, polite, friendly and efficient and it was great to see everyone working at such a consistently high level! Having stayed at hotels around the world and worked in hotels myself, I appreciate excellent service when I get in and that's exactly what this place has... EXCELLENT service! I will 100% be staying here from now on. My new favourite hotel in London, so much so that I've decided to become a Montcalm member! 
Thank you guys! You give 5 star a new meaning!!! ",5,2017,04,03

The staff at the hotel are amazing and go above and beyond to ensure your stay is 5star.

The decor of the hotel is stunning, food at the roof top restaurant was wonderful, and the roof top bar is def worth a visit
We will certainly be staying here again!",5,2017,04,02
111,Upscale Modern Accommodations,"Needing a room our children could share with us is always a challenge in the U.K. And Europe.

Our Jr suite had a fold out couch that worked well without making the room too crowded.

No view but the room did have a nice flat screen tv, numerous s lighting options from the bed, great coffee maker and coffee and a bathroom with a heated floor.

Bed was comfy and the room was pretty quiet.

Bar and restaurant downstairs were very trendy and busy.

Location is not too far from the Liverpool and tube stations. Many good pub and eateries closely available.",4,2017,04,01
111,Nice hotel well placed,"A new hotel well designed with nice rooms very clean and good space. Rooms have full Sky TV which is great and are very quite.
The Aviray Bar on floor 9 has stunning views worth a visit. Check in was good and so were all staff we had an issue with our room as someone had left makeup and had s coffe after checking out but they moved us to a new room with a bottle of wine which was really nice.
We ended up with a room at the front with a nice view. Close to Moorgate and Liverpool Street and you can walk to the Tower of London.
Good shops and amneniaties around the area too.
Would stay again easily.",5,2017,03,30
111,Thank you!,"I just wanted to say thank you to Sinnitta and Ivet for the absolute 1st class service that I received this evening at an event.. they notice a rip in my dress strategically placed, they came and told me, Sinnitta went off to get a sowing kit, whiles I waited in the toilets with Ivet. Fast forward 10 mins and I had the tear sown and back on my body with a glass of fizz in my hand. 

Thank you so much for your discretion and for making me feel comfortable. You are a both a credit. Thank you thank you!",5,2017,03,30
111,Brilliant ,Must stay at it. It was warm care. Also high edge technology like smartphone use it during the stay either in the hotel or outside it. And smart tv with sky. Comfort mattress and heated bathroom floor.,5,2017,03,28
111,Bang for your Buck,"Amazing room and facilities. Technology is highly integrated but could be it bit difficult to use sometimes. Service was excellent, especially the concierge. The highlight is the roof bar and really amazing place to be at night. It's at a convenient location, yet very quiet at night.",5,2017,03,27
111,Connot recommed highly enough,"My husband and I spent a blissful night on Saturday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This is a beautiful hotel, with attention to every detail. We were given a warm welcome, offered Prosecco, and told we had been upgraded to a suite on the seventh floor. The room was stunning with views over the square and the suite gave us an extra sitting room and second bathroom with lovely bath and enormous shower! We could easily have taken our two teenage boys and they would have loved it. The bed was extremely comfortable, every facility provided including iron and board and coffee maker, mood lighting and everything was spotless.   In the room was a handwritten card, delicious cake and a half bottle of wine, in addition to fruit and water. We felt very spoiled. All the staff were charming. The hotel is well situated for the Barbican and there are plenty of bars and restaurants close by. The view from the rooftop restaurant is just stunning and were only sad that we didn't have time to use the Spa. We would love to return and to take our boys. Thank you to the management and staff for treating us to such a special night.",5,2017,03,27
111,Absolutely wonderful stay in London here,"I booked the stay at the Montcalm as a celebration for my Partner's Birthday weekend in London. I simply cannot fault the stay here. I was immediately impressed with the convenient location - a 5 minute walk from Liverpool Street station, the wonderful Burdock lounge bar that greets you (where we had a delicious lunch) and the very welcome atmosphere at the reception - the staff were so helpful and accomodating. The rooftop bar is a lovely attraction point too, with wonderful panaramic view which we took advantage of and friendly bar staff. The room was excellent, it had everything we could possibly want including waterfall shower, Sky TV, a coffee machine,  a super comfortable bed, air con and plug sockets by the bedside tables - why don't other hotels have this?!! The cleanliness and comfort were very impressive too. We will definitely be staying at The Montcalm again and will be recommending it highly to our friends.",5,2017,03,27
111,Outstanding!,"My partner and I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House for her birthday. It will be a birthday to remember for years to come, because we had such an incredible experience at this beautiful hotel. The guest experience team made our stay very personal and amazing. They had reached out to myself asking if our stay was for any specific occasion, after explaining the trip was for my partners birthday they told me they would decorate the room, provide complimentary wine and birthday cake and even went that extra mile to find special helium birthday balloons which I had no way of getting to London without her knowing! The team at the hotel went out, got them and set them up in our room for our arrival to surprise her completely - and it was so amazing to see her face! It wouldn't have been possible without the hotel's help, thank you! Also, the views from the rooftop are breathtaking! What a superb hotel and weekend! :D",5,2017,03,26
111,Excellent 1 week stay!,"Stayed here with my husband while he was here for business and I had a week off work to then explore London. In short- great convenient location, excellent service and accommodations.

Location- located 5 min walk from the Moorgate station and the Liverpool station, making it convenient and accessible by public transportation. Was able to get to the hotel via public service to/from both Gatwick and heathrow airport. 20 min from London tower, 30 min from Parliament/Westminster, 30ish from Victoria (trains to Cambridge and Oxford) and 20 from Paddington (can take Eurostar to Paris). Also close to many great restaurants (som saa, Merchant's Tavern, lyle's), great markets (brick lane and spitalsfield) and great coffee shops (cream and ozone coffee). 

Accommodations- comfortable bed, spacious rooms, great rooftop bar with an excellent view and coffee shop in the first door! 

Service-- dedicated, kind and impeccable. Worked with Dado specifically who really went beyond what was required of her to help us procure 2 more nights at the hotel when it was booked at 96% capacity already with extreme professionalism and efficiency! Everyone was helpful and at the end of my husbands 2.5 wk stay and my 1wk stay the hotel staff even surprised us with champagne and fruit!

Overall, had a great one week holiday in London and Montcalm RLH really felt like a home here. Thank you!",5,2017,03,25
111,Wonderful Stay,"My partner and I stayed here for an evening in March.  The experience was outstanding from the outset with hotel set in a prominent building in Finsbury Square.  As we made our way through we were met in the reception area with a glass of champagne as we were checking in which was very quick and efficient.

The staff were very friendly and professional during check in and throughout our stay.  We stayed in a club double on the 7th floor which was far enough away from any ground noise and also allowed for a nice view of the square and city skyline.

Further up on the roof is Aviary bar and restaurant which we spent a short while in the bar.  It is very nice bar with a varied drinks and food menu.  The roof terrace is also a nice place to relax on and enjoy a drink.

The room was spotless and we were greeted by two large slices of red velvet birthday cake and macaroons as well as fresh fruit.  The entertainment and lighting are also of exceptional quality.

All in all a brilliant stay.  Would definitely return.",5,2017,03,25
111,Montcalm are Raising the bar!,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel and it exceeded my expectations.
The people who work there are outstanding in it's fullest sense of the word. Evette & Savia and the rest of the Guest experience team are excellent.
The rooms are lovely and well equipped with all you need & lovely slippers.. :o)
The club lounge is relaxing and calm and the rooftop bar reminded me of the fabulous New York roof top bars - same ambience and style with a unique London vibe and stimulating views. The range of drinks would satisfy all requirements.
The restaurant was excellent. 
It is set back in a quiet part of city of London, but nevertheless is located within a short walking distance to the tube and a little further to the river Thames, Shoreditch or other main areas. Whilst walking you do see more historic and interesting sites/buildings, shops, bars etc that you may miss staying in another part of central london.
Perfect all round and I highly recommend you try it out. I loved it.",5,2017,03,24
111,"Great location, perfect for business and leisure","Stayed at Montcalm Royal London House after an industry awards event. Let them know I'd be arriving really late and check-in was quick and seamless. Stayed in executive room and welcome card with fruit, bottle of wine and decent bed with lots of tv channels hit the spot. Woke up refreshed with a great view of Finsbury Square. Hermes toiletries are a nice touch to put that zing in your step first thing! Had breakfast at the Aviary restaurant on the 10th floor - amazing view. Overall a hidden hotel gem in London and affordable for single business / leisure traveller too. Will be back",5,2017,03,24
111,Calm among the hotel storm,"The Montcalm Royal London House in Finsbury Square has only been open for six months but I've already stayed there three times. It's only a few minutes' walk from my office so it's obviously hugely convenient when I need to stay overnight. 
I've been on the lookout for a good hotel for these occasions for some time - close-by, comfortable and not a ridiculous price and the Montcalm ticks all of those boxes. The staff are hugely attentive and helpful, the rooms and bathrooms spacious and there is a good bar on the ground floor and a good restaurant on the 10th floor.
All in all, a real find.",5,2017,03,23
111,excellent,"this was a fantastic hotel which we stayed at for 2 nights. As it was a special occasion, the hotel had cake and other desserts ready in our room for when we checked in. We were checked in at reception by a lady named Dado, who went out of her way to ensure that we had a wonderful weekend. She took the liberty of giving us access to the club lounge for some free drinks on arrival for my birthday and also took it upon herself to make sure we had a booking for the hotel's rooftop bar on the 2nd night. Excellent hotel and even better staff.",5,2017,03,22
111,Perfect,"Myself and my partner stayed here over our anniversary, just before our holiday the next day. We both could not fault this hotel! We were upgraded on arrival and our room was decorated with rose petals and balloons. They had also left us a couple of slices of red velvet cake, which we devoured. The room was modern, clean and very spacious! We went to the rooftop bar and restaurant, which has an incredible view, for a couple of glasses of wine and dinner. Service, food and wine was impeccable. we will be returning and have already recommended to friends and family.",5,2017,03,22
111,Lacked the WOW factor,"A Sunday night stay was booked through Secret Escapes for my husbands birthday.
Five star luxury stay, we were very excited.

Check in was fine, tho a little clinical.
Our room, 706, was fine, a large brown stain on the left hand side of the bed was ugly. 
The bathroom was spotless, bed linen excellent. We had no 'aroma box', we could have asked, but hey we are talking five star here and we shouldn't have to.

I had paid for a club room with club amenities, so as the Club Lounge opened at seven on a Sunday we popped down for a couple of drinks and a few canapés around seven thirty, to set us up for a meal at The Aviary upstairs. Roughly 20 drunk men were in the lounge and in the half hour it was open all the snacks had been eaten, there was pop corn all over the floor and these 'men' were being course and vulgar.
Whilst I appreciate the staff are caught between a rock and a hard place by other guests behaviour nothing was done until I mentioned this to the reception staff, we were told they were trying to control the situation and offered us a free starter from the adjacent restaurant. A kind offer, but again this is supposed to be five star and I should not have to ask, this situation should be monitored and guests treated accordingly.

We had a nice meal in The Aviary, and enjoyed the peace and quiet and the views.
A lovely nights sleep in a very quiet room.

Breakfast was taken in the club lounge, buffet continental, no butter present and sliced bread from a supermarket, surely a fresh loaf to carve or baguettes to go with the cheeses and meats? My husband just had coffee.

So to sum up no way would I spend the website price for a stay here, I'm so glad we only paid the Secret Escape deal price.
It's a shame because we are looking for a luxury bolthole.",4,2017,03,22
111,Perfect weekend stay,"This hotel is perfect for a weekend stay and was everything we could have asked for. We booked through a Secret Escapes deal so got a reasonable discount. We were over the moon to have been given a room upgrade for my Birthday and we were able to check in at the check in time provided - 2pm. We received a glass of prosecco on arrival and it was lovely that cake was left in the room again, a Birthday touch. The room was stunning - very spacious and with 2 tvs, a kitchenette, coffee machine, sofa and touch screen control panel to control everything from light switches to air con/heating (oh yeah there is also under floor heating!) The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in and we had an uninterrupted sleep - no noises at all. The room had lots of lighting effects - mood lighting which allows you to change colour of the lighting and various settings for the general lighting, all of which can be controlled from the bedside panel. The swimming pool and spa were lovely, they were a little on the small side but this didn't matter one bit as we had the facilities almost to ourselves with only one couple using them when we got in. The bar was lively in the evenings with a really impressive range of lager/ales and craft beer. The upstairs bar with the roof terrace was nice also although most of the beer taps were not functioning when we visited. If we had more time, we would have loved to have eaten in the upstairs restaurant which looked great. The staff were very friendly and there was always a good number about if we needed anything. Our room was not cleaned on one of the days, however we rang down to the gust services and this was quickly rectified and the room cleaned  to an impressive standard that evening when we went out. A very good stay all round and we would definitely love to return in the future! Thank you Montcalm.",5,2017,03,21
111,Excellent ,"Spent our first two nights here after getting married. We had some lovely treats ready for us in our room the moment we stepped in... a truly thoughtful gesture by the hotel. Bed was really comfy, service was perfect, and also in a great location in the City to get around to wherever you need to get to. Well done to all the staff and keep it up! ",5,2017,03,21
111,Fantastic birthday treat,"Stayed at this lovely hotel for a night away for my husbands birthday.  We were greeted with champagne on arrival and a card and fantastic cake was waiting for us in our room.  The room was lovely, the bar area downstairs was really nice, the rooftop terrace where we had breakfast was perfect and to top it all the staff were so attentive and helpful and even booked taxis for friends of ours who weren't even staying at the hotel.  We had a fabulous time, would recommend this hotel and will be back.",5,2017,03,21
111,Couples Birthday Stay ,"After staying at M by Montcalm tech shoreditch and enjoying the experience I thought I would try out this new hotel for my birthday weekend. The hotel is very good value for money we had a club room which included alcohol soft drinks and canapés complimentary each evening between certain times as well as breakfast, this was a really good perk and well worth the extra money! The rooftop bar offers nice views of the city and has a cool edgy vibe. Shower was very spacious and had Hermes products, TV in room was big and room itself was a good size for the two of us. Pool was good but very small compared to tech city, luckily we was the only ones using it when we stayed otherwise I imagine it would become overcrowded with 6+ couples. All staff were extremely helpful and polite they also decorated my room for my birthday which was a lovely touch. I would recommend this hotel for business trips and value for money for couples, between the two hotels  I preferred tech city as it was bigger room size and pool facilities and had more to offer for me,however apart from this royal London house is equally as good and I would recommend staying here. ",4,2017,03,20
111,Birthday treat for my husband,"We had a wonderful stay at the Montcalm, we were so touched by the lovely welcome and my husband was thrilled with the birthday card and cake left in the room. We'd been walking around all day so we really enjoyed relaxing in the hotel during the evening and eating in the restaurant, and we loved the beautiful views from our room. 

I'm really pleased with the level of service we received and the little touches that made our stay so special. I would certainly recommend staying at the Montcalm Royal London House to anyone.",5,2017,03,20
111,Finished,"Definitely got its act together since last visit in November. The roof top restaurant and bar have been completed and opened making breakfast a more enjoyable experience.
Staff excellent as ever and the hotel can now take its place with one of the nicer places to stay in and around central London. Stayed in the same room as before, which has also been 'extended' such that there are no noisy neighbours. The hotel has definitely listened to reviews posted on TA and has taken on board any constructive criticism. Will have to return in the summer to check out the roof top terrace bar and the great views over the city - even if only for a few drinks. Good spot to stay in City/Central London with relatively easy access to public transport links for the rest of Greater London and West End.",5,2017,03,20
111,Excellent staff and facilities,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. It has a rooftop bar and restaurant with a great view of London with a well equipped deck outside with heaters and blankets if it gets a bit chilly. The rooms are well equipped for this day and age and the television has Sky enabled which is great. All of the staff were very polite, prompt and helpful and you can tell that they are treated well by their employers as they all seem very happy to be in their job. I will definitely be visiting again and will be using the free spa and pool next time!",5,2017,03,20
111,Wonderful experience,"The staff at Montcalm really do go above and beyond to make your trip really special. Every member of staff we met were very kind and helpful. We were staying for our anniversary and on arrival were treated to an upgrade, and in the room a lovely hand written note, anniversary confetti and red velvet cake, which went down a treat! The rooms themselves are lovely, very spacious, clean and modern. 
We also went to the rooftop bar and the views are stunning.
The best level of service we have ever recieved and want to thank all the team again for a wonderful experience.",5,2017,03,20
111,Outstanding Attention and Hospitality,"On arrival at the gorgeous Montcalm Hotel, I was greeted by Dado at reception who checked me in and gave me all the information I needed. The hotel was exceedingly busy and all the restaurants were fully booked, but despite this, Dado paid full attention to helping me organise dinner and a much needed drink. Throughout my stay Dado made me feel welcome, was a superb host and treated me with warmth, care and friendliness. I work all over the UK often staying in hotels for up to three nights at a time and I can honestly say all the staff were hugely attentive, gave help immediately. It is rare to expereince this level of hospitality and I couldn't recommend the hotel more highly. Whilst this was a work related visit, I would most definately return with my family for a London break. It is a rare thing to be treated with such kindness.",5,2017,03,19
111,Perfect stay,We stayed at the Montcalm royal London house we loved the hotel the staff where amazing I would like to make a special mention of Dado Sinnita and Catalin. For their outstanding service the hotel rooftop bar was beautiful with amazing views of the shard and London I would recommend the hotel to others who want a relaxing enjoyable time.,5,2017,03,19
111,Miss Monaghan ,We stayed for two nights at the hotel to celebrate are engagement and my partners birthday and it was amazing. The decor was modern and classy. It was clean and even has its own fragrance machine in the room. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Even after checking out we was able to leave are bags to be collected later that day. We booked a table at the aviary and that was brilliant too. We will definitely book here again if we came back to London.,5,2017,03,19
111,Stayed here many times ,"And the service is always impeccable. We bought our 5 year old son with us for the first and the staff couldn't have been kinder in particular  Tania, Sinnitta, CynAnn who made a lovely fuss and gave our him a welcome personalised birthday package. 
Location is great, and breakfast is 5*",4,2017,03,19
111,Wow!! What a gem!! Fantastic Hotel!!,"Stayed over the weekend with my mum for her birthday treat and I must say it was the best birthday treat she could have asked for. From the doorman to the reception staff, complimentary drinks and cakes in the room down to the cleaning staff, everyone was amazing! A special THANK YOU to Ivet, Sinnitta and Cynann who went out of their way to make sure our stay was very enjoyable. I must say, people like these ladies make the hotel what it is. Well Done!! Enjoyed all the facilities and can't wait for another opportunity to stay here.",5,2017,03,18
111,Fantastic Hotel,"Great location, away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, but only 10 minutes on the tube to all the attractions. If you stay here and I would definitely recommend it, do try the Atrium restaurant and outside terrace on the top floor. The food is first class and the cocktails are to die for, then take coffee outside and take in some fantastic views of the London skyline. .",5,2017,03,17
111,Amazing 21st birthday celebration,"Hotel was booked as a surprise for my daughters 21st birthday. 
Wow !
They helped to create a wonderful memory for her. The hotel is outstanding as are the staff - from the moment I booked it.
Fantastic location, rooms, roof top bar with amazing rooms.
They even upgraded our room.
Absolutely perfect - my daughter is arranging another stay in May as loved it so much !!",5,2017,03,17
111,Lovely surprise - Fantastic hotel,"Well what can I not say about this hotel. Absolutely lovely, central to everyting, Fantastic service, beautiful fully equipped rooms. Even got a glass of wine on arrival - I love these special touches - great value -  we 100% recommend this hotel - love it :)",5,2017,03,15
111,Perfect,"Staff, room, atmosphere and the VIEW! Was beautiful and so relaxing. My partner and I went for a weekend break and we had the best time in ages. The view is breathtaking as well, I would definetly recommend for anyone and I would go back there again. We also got complimentary wine, cake, present, balloons and a card! ",5,2017,03,14
111,Perfect Hotel,Complementary upgrade to business suite on arrival along with complimentary champagne. Rooms are very modern and spacious. Rooms have all you need in them. Rooftop bar is amazing. The views and cocktails are to die for. If we go to London again soon there is nowhere else we would think of staying.,5,2017,03,13
111,Sky bar gem ,"A modern hotel with mode lighting in the rooms- pink, red, blue or green. 

Beautiful comfy beds but the hidden gem is the roof top bar and restaurant. Have the burger its the best I've had. 

The spa facilities with gym look like they are never used so perfect. The Elemis toiletries are a nice touch.  

",5,2017,03,13
111,Birthday treat!,"we had a fantastic stay at this delightful hotel. The staff were wonderful from check in to check out. As it was my Birthday we got a free room upgrade with top views over the city and a lovely personal message, balloon and cake waiting for us! The bed was super large and comfortable. The bathroom was also excellent with a large shower, sink and was super clean and white! We didn't eat in the hotel as we already had plans but did enjoy a drink in the bar. We had a great start to the next day with a trip to the hotels spa where we used the sauna, hot tub and pool. The staff here were also very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend a stay here!",5,2017,03,13
111,Birthday celebration,"Lovely evening celebrating a birthday. We had booked a group of 10. It's a different way to have as much as you like as it is not a buffet. You order the dishes and each is cooked fresh. The food was tasty but a little greasy for my taste. Service was prompt and very pleasant and the cost was very reasonable. We took our own cake and the staff brought it to our table singing ""happy birthday"", a nice touch. The restaurant also has its own bar. A good evening was had by all.",4,2017,03,13
111,thank you,"It was a real pleasure to stay at this hotel. Everything is new and amasing IT-suited that made very easy my access to all facilities.

The room was generous and with all small issues that made a good stay and an excelent bed. 

I was also at the pool and jacuzzi and relaxed one hour befor my departure. I recomend to fix a clock some where to see the time.

Not the least the people employed are so young and nice. I had surprisingly found Romanian and Bulgarian people working here with determination and willing to offer the best services. 

I got a complimentary tea upon arrival and a glass proseco in the night when I forgot my key in the room.

I can nominate Dado and Raluca for exquisite behaviour and determination to make a good day for me.
",5,2017,03,13
111,Fantastic!,"Perfect location for an evening out in Hoxton, Shoreditch or Spitalfields. Great rooms, super comfortable beds! Staff were amazing and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our stay. Although a city hotel, great vibe at the weekend and staff absolutely get different clientele types (week /weekend) and made us feel completely at home. Aviary roof top bar and restaurant is fantastic with the best views and ambience. I hear their Sunday Lunch is fab, didn't get a chance this time, but will definitely be retuning so maybe next time! ;)",5,2017,03,12
111,Excellent and sophisticated hotel,"Very nice experience;
Extremely nice and Very helpful staff.
Neat and sophisticated hotel design.
Nice and well designed rooms.
Comfortable beds.
Comfortably located nearby Liverpool street underground station.",5,2017,03,11
111,Heart of Shoreditch!,"My partner and I visited this hotel at the start of February. We had a little wait to check in but staff were very friendly and apologetic and was offered complimentary prosecco which was lovely. The room was spacious with a bonus of SkyTV in the rooms which we were not expecting. The rooms reminded me of the Aria hotel in Las Vegas with the touch screen pad to control the lighting, under floor heating etc. We stayed here as we were going out for my friends birthday in McQueen in Shoreditch and was only about 10 minute walk which was ideal location. The spa has a pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna which we used and was great to relax before our night. I would also recommend going up to the rooftop bar for a couple of drinks with beautiful views of the city.",5,2017,03,11
111,First but not last,"I was recently upgraded to the Montcalm Royal London House after having stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery on several occasions.  This new property did not disappoint.  The staff were extremely attentive and super friendly, from the door man to the front desk. The room service menu even had craft beer.",5,2017,03,09
111,Excellent stay at the Hotel ,"My husband took me away for the weekend and we stayed at the Montcalm. Couldn't rate service higher. We had a small problem with our room when we arrived so they moved us rooms and a lovely lady called sinnitta brought us up 2 buckets of complimentary drinks and was very helpful. All staff were very friendly and helpful during our stay. Roof top bar was amazing and the Spa was wonderful and very relaxing. We look forward to revisiting the hotel again very soon.
",5,2017,03,09
111,Gorgeous hotel with amazing views...,"I stayed at the hotel on Saturday evening, celebrating my birthday with a group of friends. The hotel was gorgeous. Indira and  the staff on reception could not have been more helpful. A lovely note, chocolates and prosecco had been put in my room before I arrived. The room was very nicely decorated, spacious with an extremely comfy bed. We had drinks in the Aviary bar on Saturday evening, amazing views over the city and the staff could not have been any more helpful. A very enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend and stay again in the future. ",5,2017,03,08
111,Great stay and superb breakfast area,Well located central hotel. Elegant rooms and friendly staff who were welcoming at check in. The breakfast area in the Aviary at the top of the hotel has amazing views over London and a great start to the day. Good choice too. Bit of a strange menu in the ground floor hotel restaurant and difficult to understand portion size but deliciously cooked when it arrived and thoroughly enjoyed.,5,2017,03,08
111,Excellent new hotel !,"Visited for wife's birthday largely based on reviews and given the very reasonable price (given it was the weekend after Valentines), I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have to say we were pleasantly surprised.

Upon arrival we were offered a nice drink of Prosecco and because our room wasn't ready we were seated in a nice waiting room with a wide choice of refreshments.

Once in our room, given the birthday/Valentines occasion, all my requests were met including special decorations. Moreover I was upgraded to a better room which was lovely with everything looking nice and brand new. There are nice little touches such as a fragrance machine, full Sky tv and latest touch pad technology to control heating, lighting (you can set different colours !). We also had a great view of the London skyline (Gherkin building).

The rooftop bar is great with again a great view, although the drinks are pricey even for a 5* hotel....guess your paying for the view though. 

Location is a bit out the way, but good room rate, so we were happy to cab it in to the West end etc. 

Breakfast was very good with a good range of hot and cold items and good service throughout.  Again it's served on the top floor, so nice views.

My only gripes are mainly due to the newness of the hotel, so for example some basic instructions are missing in the room along with some general sineage missing in the hotel e.g. to the Spa.

I'm guessing the Montcalm group are aggressively trying to make a mark in the London hotel scene and they will succeed at this rate (no pun intended !)

So in summary, a great value hotel with excellent customer service, swanky rooms and decor throughout.  If you can compromise on location it's excellent value and a great experience.  

",5,2017,03,07
111,Excellent - minus the drilling!,"After recently staying at Montcalm Tech City Shoreditch I must say this hotel is my preference of the two. Everything about it is outstanding, the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms & spa facilities are modern, and spotless. Unfortunately I was woken up the first night by loud drilling and banging which was unbearable! I called reception and they moved us room immediately, extremely annoying and inconvenient! Though they compensated us with fruit and a later check out. The hotel has no parking but the NCP opposite offer a 50% reduced rate for 24hrs priced at £25. Despite the little disruption I would definitely stay here again and recommend for those that like intimacy & class. If you prefer a more loud, fast-paced environment Tech City Shoreditch would be my recommendation as both these hotels are about 5mins apart.
",4,2017,03,07
111,Above and beyond all expectations,"I haven't written a trip advisor review before, but felt it would be completely wrong if I didn't document how fantastic both this hotel and the staff are. Without a doubt one of my best hotel experiences to date. Booked through secret escapes and stayed here for my girlfriend's birthday weekend and loved every minute from the moment we walked through the door. The hotel alone is marvellous, but it was the attentiveness of the staff and the additional little touches that really took this place to the next level. Once the staff heard it was my better half's birthday they upgraded our room and arranged for prosecco and cake to be delivered and generally could not have been more friendly and helpful when I had any enquiries, went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying ourselves. Facilities all top notch, lovely meal in the restaurant in the evening and a nice relax in the spa the next morning to blow away the cobwebs and set us up for the next day. If the hotel had just been ""faultless"" I maybe wouldn't have bothered writing a review, but it was beyond that, truly remarkable.",5,2017,03,06
111,Fabulous Location,This hotel has a great location just five minutes from Moorgate tube station.  Contemporary design with very attentive service.  We were lucky enough to have a complimentary upgrade.  The bedding is particularly noteworthy and a really comfortable bed.  Great rooftop bar which in  the summer I imaging is great.,5,2017,03,05
111,Modern Hotel right in the heart of the business district,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights for business and was impressed with such a modern hotel which had a great vibe.
The room was very comfortable and free internet enabled me to continue to work at the end of the day.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,03,04
111,Excellent service,"Would just like to say thank you for the welcome and great service we experienced on Saturday, having now experienced both hotels although both excellent the Brewery just has the edge I think mainly because the rooms are a bit more atmospheric and the Jugged Hare bar is one of our favourite places for a drink, can I give a special mention to Decio on reception who's excellent welcome started our stay on exactly the right note!",5,2017,03,04
111,Great new hotel - will stay again!,"I come to London for business at least monthly and have tried quite a few hotels around the City. I have also stayed at the other Montcalm hotels and have been disappointed. 
This hotel definitely makes the mark. The staff explain the features up front, the rooms are clean, and the lively bar and restaurant make the experience much better since there is something fun to come back to, not just a room with a TV. The shuffleboards are a nice touch. 
All of the Montcalm hotels have the same room layout and decor, so there was nothing new there. I got a handicapped room, which meant it was bigger. The rooms are noise proofed enough that even being near the lift wasn't a bother. The free phones are great for London visitors. 
The bar is well stocked and busy, but it doesn't feel like a hotel bar. It seems people come here and to the restaurant socially, not just those who stay at the hotel. The restaurant can definitely use more servers since service is extremely slow even when it is nowhere near full, but the food is good. 
I will stay here next time. Recommended!",5,2017,03,03
111,Overall good,"First impressions good.Welcome at front desk excellent.was offered a Prosecco while waiting for key card to be issued.Very relaxing indeed. Showed up to room by another most pleasant member of staff. Birthday cake waiting but should have been in Son's room who hadn't arrived yet. Rang down and our small cases brought up even though we were told would already be waiting for us.Went up to roof top Aviary bar which had amazing views. Had call from Son who had arrived .Their room was marred by horrendous roadwork noise from outside.They were then moved from floor 1 to another room but that to was only a couple of floors above original so again so noisy.After a couple of hours they were given an upgrade to a suite away from the roadworks .
Found turn down had been done on arrival back from evening out.Slept well even though room a little chilly.Went to make a cup of tea no mugs only tiny expresso cups.....
On way out reported this .On our return at 3.30pm they were there,obviously new as had two stick on labels which I removed and then washed.Room hadn't been made up neither had Sons.On way out early evening reported this at desk and apologies made.Also said no instructions in room how to alter heating etc. Told should have had a directory.Returned back and had a drink at downstairs bar( barman as previous night excellent) then went to room.Our Son's room had been done but not ours.Note under door however to say when would it be convenient to do room.Went down  to reception and told them.Again apologies and would send some on up.30 plus mins later 2 very polite guys came up with fresh towels ,water and teabags etc.A directory was sent up but only containes venues to eat etc.Tried to fathom out heating on tablet and wall and kept asking for password.
Next morning looking forward to cup of tea to find no English teabags (every other variety)had been sent up previous evening.Rang reception and brought up to room prompt.
To summarise plenty of most pleasant and attentive staff but not enough attention to detail.Will we stop again? The answer is probably.On checking out briefly explained what had happened .Took our email and said on next visit they would offer free upgrade and breakfast.",4,2017,03,02
111,Perfect place!,"Because it was my first stay at 5 star hotel I was a little bit timid. And when they couldn't charge my card (although needed amount was reserved and ""freezed"" by hotels bank) and I couldn't pay other ways, I thought I shouldn't be here.. :)
But senior manager Savia (sorry didn't ask for exact position) handled situation perfectly
and as result we've ended with a better room, free breakfast and free cocktail as gift for inconvenience! And it wasn't their fault, only miscommunication between banks.

That's what makes a hotel a 5 star hotel - not only nice interior but good experience. And the whole stay was a really special one!

Hotel areas, Room was beautifully designed, super comfortable bed, bathroom with Hermes toiletries, Nespresso coffee maker, smart heating and lights etc.

Highly recommended! 

(Thank You Savia once again!)",5,2017,03,01
111,Leisure ,"Thank you. Very good service, Miss Cynann & Miss Dalia were very helpful during my 4 nights in the hotel ! I will make sure to visit again.

More over the location of the hotel was fantastic , I had dinner in the palm rooms Resturent and it was very nice atmosphere  & food was good

111,"eight and a half out ten , courteous staff , clean and quality facilities","Booked three club rooms , two of which should have been for two plus one in size , not sure where the plus one would have gone so I suspect we did not have the larger room , likely my fault as I requested higher floor facing the park , which is exactly what we got so can not complain , although it cost me more for those two rooms. 605 and 606 .

The bottom casual restaurant/ bar is the space you traverse on arrival to get to reception , there is a doorman to assist .

The top restaurant is run by the same company as the bottom , I am not sure what the arrangement is but it seems they are seperate from the Workham group owners of the hotel itself . This being so you can not always be sure of getting space to eat as I suspect they have most bookings from outside the residents , at least at weekends .

The rooms are of a very good standard , thoughtfully designed , the technology is easy to master and providing it doesn't fail in the long term seems a good idea offering more variety of settings for lighting , air con / heating etc.

The staff were excellent and I hope to find it that does not change upon next visit , it is a conveniently located hotel , tubes stations within easy reach and relatively quiet at night .
The only problem they have is that before the conversion directly outside the hotel entrance was obviously a taxi stop for food , which they bought from a mobile van , the van is permanently stuck in front of the main entrance , so when you are on foot initially looking for the place you can not see the sign or entrance because of the van . Not ideal for the hotel either when they have committed so much capital to have their investment spoilt , it would not be difficult to move to the van at least a few yards/metres a bit of compromise needed , I would guess that issue is in hand .

Excellent value for money you will not be dis appointed unless you are thinking Claridges which would have been four times the price , good luck to them",4,2017,03,01
111,Amazing place ,"We had a wonderful weekend away at the hotel. Lovely professional staff extremely helpful. Club room was amazing, didn't want to get out of the rain shower. Roof top terrace was beautiful. Can't wait to return ",5,2017,02,28
111,Great hotel,"5min stroll from Liverpool St. Station.
Very comfortable rooms, spotlessly clean, with large bathrooms and a great shower, 55in TV with sky movies and Nespresso.
Book a club room and continental breakfast, snacks and a selection of complimentary soft and alcoholic drinks available at the club room opposite reception.
Great hotel for couples, not so great for kids as the pool is off limits for them.",5,2017,02,28
111,Outstanding!!!!,"Apart from a few minor hiccups, I would 100% recommend this hotel when visiting London. The rooms are spacious, spotless, modern and very well equipped. The Roof terrace is also well worth a visit. The staff are helpful, friendly and very professional. I would recommend reading the small print when ordering room service though. There are a few additional charges, tray charges, room service charges........The hotel is well located and just a short walking distance from Liverpool Street Station. Well worth a visit and we will return to the Montcalm the next time we are in London.",5,2017,02,28
111,Outstanding ,"We stayed at this hotel for a friend's 40th birthday and what an amazing find it was.  From the moment we arrived service was 5* nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are very high tech and of exceptional standard and cleanliness. Mood lighting, super comfy bed, fantastic shower, huge TV with Sky.  As it was our friends birthday a bottle of wine and cake was placed in their room. Breakfast may seem pricey but it is worth it. Staff have been trained to a very high standard and customer satisfaction is their number one priority.   We loved it so much we have booked for my husbands birthday in March and have extended our stay to 2 days so we can enjoy the facilities more.  ",5,2017,02,28
111,Top of the class !! Excellent Hotel in London,We have just came back from staying at the Montcalm Royal London House it was our Wedding Anniversary & the hotel went above & beyond our exception's from the moment we walked through the door's our luggage was taken care of  we knew we had picked the right hotel to enjoy our break away we had arrived 4 hour's early at 10 am due to our flights & didn't expect our room to be ready until 2pm but Raluca at reception desk seen that we didn't wait long for our room in fact it was ready for us within 30 mins & upon entering the room there was a bottle of prosecco on Ice red velvet cake & mixed fruit for us to enjoy complimentary of the hotel which was a extra special treat for our occasion all hotel staff were amazing from the door staff to the room service till the bar staff i cant rate or recommend this hotel high enough & would find it hard to believe there would be a better place to stay in London we will definitely be staying here again !!

111,Excellent and wonderful hotel,"The room and the amenities were wonderful.  The bed exquisite and loved the shower which can fit the whole family!
Enjoyed the widescreen TV with Sky and smartphone and all the other gadgets.
Loved the spa, jacuzzi and sauna (unfortunately steam room out of action)
The staff were amazing, very friendly, approachable and so helpful.
Delicious breakfast.",5,2017,02,27
111,AMAZING! ,"From the quality of the rooms and the attentiveness of the staff this hotel was truly amazing! Nothing was to much trouble. Going above and beyond!
We stayed for our anniversary and had a card and cake waiting for us in our rooms - a lovely touch. 
Thank you :) ",5,2017,02,27
111,Perfect Evening,"The staff at the hotel were amazing from the moment we booked in to the moment we left. 
We stayed for a special occasion and the staff arranged an anniversary surprise on entry to the room.
We spent the evening drinking cocktails on the rooftop bar followed by a morning spent relaxing in the spa.
The room was very clean, high spec and high tech and added to a a perfect stay. 
I'd like to say a big thanks to the staff for a memorable stay. 

",5,2017,02,26
111,Excellent hotel,"I've been with this hotel since they opened in October 2016. In the meantime, I've choosen this hotel eight times as the service, kindness and also the rooms are perfectly fine. Superb value for the price. I always feel very welcome and I'm excellently treated.",5,2017,02,25
111,Totally impressed,"Our stay just for one night was so amazing. Perfect staff, perfect location and perfectly located. Every time again and again. The hotel is built in a modern style with latest technology but also charming. And don't miss the breathless view from the rooftop bar.",5,2017,02,25
111,Check the side of the hotel your staying on if you fancy a lie-in after 9,"Firstly, the hotel and room were amazing and although I didn't eat or drink in the hotel the 'in house' restaurant looked equally as good. Staff were polite and helpful and I couldn't fault any of it. After a late night the one thing I was looking forward to was a lie in and a late check out. Unfortunately the road to one side of the hotel is being dug up and at exactly 09:00 we were treated to the loudest drilling I've heard in a while. When it started I was half expecting someone in a hard hat to be standing at the bottom of the bed. I know the hotel has no control over this, but it would have been nice to have been informed or offered a room away from the noise.",4,2017,02,25
111,Fabulous Hotel and Stylish Roof top bar,"From the moment of arrival until our departure, I can honestly say that both my husband and I were over whelmed by the warm, hospitable staff throughout the hotel.  The rooms are extremely well equipped, luxurious, spotlessly clean and comfortable.

I arrived early and checked into my room where was greeted by the Valentine’s rose petal heart and balloon, along with the delicious chocolate desserts and welcome card (see images below).  I checked in earlier than my husband and was allocated a room on the 9th floor.  Whilst waiting for my husband to arrive I took the opportunity to visit the Aviary Bar and had a delicious glass of wine outside on the terrace.  I took in the great views in brilliant sunshine – I couldn’t believe I could sit outside and be comfortable in February!

It was our first stay with the Montcalm family and we will definitely be recommending to our colleagues and friends.",5,2017,02,22
111,Incredible stay - best in London!,"Stayed here on sunday night for my girlfriend's birthday and the hotel blew us away from the moment we stepped inside. The welcome at the door was personal, the staff were friendly, knowledgable and couldn't do enough... Sinnitta and the team made us feel so special. We were even introduced to the manager who offered us a glass of proseco... as we were in a rush to get to a show in the evening we had to be quick so instead they left a bottle in the room on ice for when we got back. (They topped the ice up for us whilst we were away too!) The room was stunning and so comfortable with a touch screen to control pretty much everything from night lighting to under floor heating. Cyn Ann did an AMAZING job of setting up the room with balloons, birthday cake with fruit AND petals on the bed... it could not have been more perfect and my girlfriend was speechless. We woke up the next day after a beautiful sleep and visited the spa which again was clean, so peaceful and beautiful. The pool was spot on, the jacuzzi and steam rooms made us feel like we were dreaming. We left wishing we could stay another night and will be back without any shadow of a doubt. Thank you to Sinnitta, Cyn Ann and the rest of the team. ",5,2017,02,21
111,"Great value, good service","Nice new hotel, rooftop bar has great views and the ground floor bar has table top shuffle board which is fun. Our room was spacious, comfortable and quiet and had a Nespresso machine, good shower and good mini bar. Some of the gadgets were a bit unnecessary and annoying e.g. Touch screen controls for lights and do not disturb/clean room signals which didn't always do as expected. The spa was nice although because it's brand new there were no lockers yet. Service was great, they let us leave our bags all day after checking out and printed off our boarding passes for us. Location is good - 10 mins walk to Shoreditch and really close to Moorgate station. I'd definitely stay again.",4,2017,02,21
111,Almost perfect!,"Firstly, would like to thank most of the staff for a pleasant stay!

We arrived around 3, and after booking the Club Room was unaware we also had been given complimentary continental breakfast! We had let them know it was our anniversary prior to booking and to our surprise entering our room we had Cake, biscuits, a congratulations card & even rose petals on the bed! 

Although I did request a higher floor we was situated on the 3rd, but the room was perfect and made up for that. Large TV with almost every channel. Giant bed (Extra comfy!) huge walk in rain shower (with Hermes shower gel - not cheap!) and lots of extras (Robes, Slippers, Hair dryer, Iron&Board, Coffee machine, even an Umbrella! & more!) Modern room with a touch control system which could be used to operate the lights, air con, do not disturb/room cleaned - and even to activate the heated floor!). I also found it was a nice touch to have a 'mood light' switch at the bedside, which could toggle the room light colours! (Red, blue, Purple green etc!)

Our first issue came about half an hour into our stay. The rooms are advertised as 'sound proof' but roadworks below our room made it unbearable to relax as it sounded like someone was banging on the window! We asked to be moved rooms and they acted quickly and moved us higher to the 6th floor. We checked the room and was given a 'Disabled room' which was larger but not quite as cosey as our pervious one, but we accepted the room, left our belongings and headed out for the day. After getting back to our room at night (about 10pm) we noticed our bathroom as giving off quite a disgusting smell which made us both feel sick! (Drainage smell) so we then contacted the reception again to which they acted quickly and apologised - moving us to the other side of the hotel but on floor 1. So after messing about we finally settled room no.3 which we never had any problems with thankfully!

Spa area really nice & clean - very relaxing and although smallish, it was empty both times we went. (Between 8am-9am on the weekend). 

Rooftop bar is also a must! Great atmosphere, and perfect chill out area in the day or night!

Continental breakfast filled a gap - not much options but a nice way to start the day with cereal, toast etc.

Hotel is in a nice location - about a 5 minute walk from Moorgate tube station.

All in all great stay and would definitely return - would of given 5* if it wasn't for the room issues but confident the staff will make your stay enjoyable!

Thank you. ",4,2017,02,20
111,Excellent new hotel,"Stayed on business one night, the room had everything some nice modern touches. Great nights sleep.
The restaurant for breakfast was on the top floor with great views of the city. The breakfast itself was very good indeed will be staying again soon",5,2017,02,20
111,A brilliant stay,An absolutely lovely young man called Daniel - the concierge upon our arrival- who was so helpful and considerate. An absolute gem. Customer service skills very excellent. A credit to the hotel. Stay was brilliant .He couldn't do enough.,5,2017,02,19
111,Wonderful hotel with great hospitality,"This is a beautiful hotel with great staff, especially Krisztina who gave us a complimentary upgrade as is it was my partners birthday. The room was spacious and very comfortable - I would definitely recommend this hotel to all. 
(11/02/17)",5,2017,02,19
111,Birthday treat for my partner,"This weekend was for my partners birthday treat. What more can I say than your hotel completely enhanced our stay. Over the years we have stayed in many lovely hotels, but I would have to say you have the complete package. The place felt and was luxurious and your staff was absolutely fantastic with us from start to finish. Next time which will be for my birthday in may, we will not hesitate to book with you again. Fantastic hotel fantastic weekend, Thankyou for making it so wonderful.",5,2017,02,19
111,Fantastic hotel with great service,"We stopped at this hotel for a Saturday night out in London. Price was excellent value for a hotel of this quality and the customer service was exceptional.

Roof-top bar was fantastic.

Pool, sauna and spa facilities were all great

Hotel is well-located close to Old Street, Moorgate and Liverpool Street tube stations.

We couldn't really fault it.",5,2017,02,19
111,Such a wonderful stay!,"I had the best experience during our stay at Montcalm Royal, as soon as I arrived all the staff were wonderful. Christine who checked me in couldn't have been nicer! I had booked the hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday and they not only upgraded us but then included some red velvet cake and balloons in our room! The room itself was lovely and had such a comfy bed. The hotel also has a lovely spa downstairs with a jacuzzi and pool which was a great Saturday morning treat. The breakfast was also wonderful and served in the rooftop bar with great views. All in all, honestly couldn't have had a better time!!",5,2017,02,19
111,Not what I expected,"Not sure what I expected, but it wasn't to walk through the front door to virtually a pub-like atmosphere, with electronic music, foosball machines and lots of loud people. Further, the reception is deep into the ground floor level, so it's a bit awkward, and then, the entire reception desk is full of people, but not many of them understand what's going on. Confusing, and should you be arriving from afar, frustrating. Then today, day two, I called the front desk but connected with someone who was struggling to understand me, and I her. Again, frustrating. On the other hand, I think they want to do the right thing; it just appears that they are not trained in hospitality, at least not like the typical British hospitality professionals. Again, on the other hand, the room is nice. I always prefer a room with a window that opens, so if that's a must have, this is not the hotel for you. Unfortunately, something related to connectivity is happening with the very nice television screen, so watching tv is not an option until I contact maintenance. The continental breakfast is so-so, so don't pay extra for it. There are enough places nearby to get equivalent or much better for a lot less. In this immediate area, I prefer South Place Hotel, but it was pricier this visit. I know now that you get what you pay for.",3,2017,02,18
111,fantastic stay,"I have stayed here many times now and the hotel is always excellent. My latest visit was great had a lovely upgrade to a suite and wine , chocolates and cheese were provided. The pool and spa area is very good and not too busy.
The beds are really comfortable and the bathrooms are good. Breakfast on the 10th floor was superb, great choice  and fabulous views over London.
The staff are excellent very helpful and friendly.
Cant wait for my next visit in March!",5,2017,02,18
111,Best New Year ever!,"Me and my best friend were moved from Montcalm London suites to Montcalm Royal London House as an upgrade. Clearly our New Year's eve had a fab start from the minute we entered the hotel. 
The hotel interiors were modern and swanky - live with new year's celebration. We were greeted at Reception by a lovely lady called Gabbi - She was ever so kind, due to the mix up of our reservations in the previous hotel, we got complimentary breakfast included and Spa. She took exceptional care of us and we had the best experience ever. 
The Aviary bar lounge has stunning views, amazing decor art. Roof top terrace has some captivating views. Breakfast was fantastic and the staff are amazing.

We went on New Years day to have some sundowners and the lovely bartender Jannis made very exquisite shots which very complimentary. The cocktails are to die for! Such a great vibe and atmosphere.

It doesnt just end there, we received a complimentary box of champagne truffles - Our stay just got better by the minute. Might I say we stayed only 2 nights but it was certainly delightful! 

Absolutely will go back there!!!",5,2017,02,17
111,"Started off rough, but ended up a truly wonderful experience","Before I even begin describing the room, the facilities & the location, the customer service here is second to none.

There was some initial confusion due to pre-booking via Booking.com with a card that had expired, I ended up paying twice. Apologies were issued out for my inconvenience, and I was then taken my room on the 4th floor.

I had explained upon booking that this is a very special anniversary for me and my partner, as such I already requested that we stay on the highest floor in advance.

The personnel I spoke to dealt with this respectfully and promptly, within minutes I was introduced to a room and received a complimentary upgrade to Montcalm Club Double (along with access to the Lounge), where me and my partner were introduced to several rose petals on the bed, along with velvet cake, and a large bottle of Prosseco. 

I cannot express how helpful the staff were, even helping with the purchase of swimming accessories from their sister branch (M by Montcalm Shoreditch) and delivering it to my room.

Now the room? Spacious, beautiful lighting (especially the mood lighting when you are with a partner), an immaculate bathroom and shower. There were touch sensitive controls in place for underfloor heating, lighting & air conditioning. It has a very modern feel. The room includes an iron, ironing board, robes and slippers, an abundance of towels, mini bar and a coffee machine.

The TV size is 50 inches and includes Sky channels such as Sky Sports News & Sky Sports 1 (effective when your football team is playing on the same day you check in), good sound and also includes Spotify if you are really into getting the best out of technology in your room.

The spa has a steam room, sauna, pool and jacuzzi, all excellent in quality. In particular, the pool area, although small in size, has a luxurious feel to it.

The Aviary Rooftop bar is also great, reasonably priced food and drinks and wonderful views of the London City skyline. It's definitely busy on a Saturday night, so best advice is to book in advance

All in all, despite the initial mishap, the staff went above and beyond in making me and my partner's stay as comfortable and as wonderful as possible. It was the perfect way to celebrate and the staff are a credit to the company. Without a doubt one of the best hotels I've stayed in, if not the best. I will definitely recommend, and will look to stay here again in the future.",5,2017,02,17
111,My new London hotel,"The company I work for changed locations and so I needed to find a hotel near the new office.  While not the cheapest, the Montcalm was far more reasonable than others in the area and a short walk away, so I decided to try it.

I'm presently halfway through an 11-day stay and so far I've been thoroughly impressed.  There staff here is wonderful, as gracious and responsive as I've experienced anywhere.  And there are far more of them than I would have expected for a London ""city"" hotel in this price range.  The room is considerably larger, too, and very well appointed.  It's also quiet, something I appreciate given my typically jet-lagged condition.

The hotel has a small but well equipped gym adjacent to a small but new-looking indoor pool.  There is one very agreeable bar/restaurant on the ground floor and another on the top floor that opens onto a pretty spectacular rooftop terrace.  The Moorgate tube station is three blocks away offering easy access to the St. Pancras and Paddington stations.

I travel to London two or three time a year and this is sure to be my hotel from now on.",5,2017,02,17
111,Fab hotel with amazing staff!,"We booked in on 12 th Feb for a one night birthday celebration. The staff were so attentive and incredibly welcoming- from the cheery doorman ( does he ever go home?) the lovely Ivet, the staff in the Aviary, the spa ladies to the front desk.

The room was fabulous and the  bed was super comfy! 

Definitely pop up to the Aviary on the 10 th floor, the views are fab and the cocktails even better! We spent a perfect Sunday afternoon, drinking cocktails and listening to the singer!

Would we come back?   DEFINITELY",5,2017,02,15
111,Unbelievable! 5 star at its finest ,"Wow! where to start, I and my partner booked to stay at the Montcalm Royal London House-City of London, before the visit I made a call to make the stay more special as it was valentines weekend. We arrived at the hotel on time and was greeted with a generous glass of prosecco, which was brilliant. I was then told that my room had been upgraded! which was fantastic. We made our way to the room and the guest experience team had put on the most wonderful valentines display I personally have ever seen. Strawberries and chocolate, the most exquisite chocolate cupcakes with the finest bottle of prosecco and on top of that flowers and balloons and mini love hearts everywhere. 

 

We decided to visit the rooftop bar which was most pleasing and the atmosphere was amazing.

 

I myself have stayed at many hotels across the world and would say the Montcalm Royal London House-City of London is easily up there with some of the best hotels London can offer.

 

We are already planning to visit this hotel again in March for birthday celebrations, I do hope you replicate the services again.

 

So I will be recommending this hotel to all my close friends and business associates. ",5,2017,02,15
111,A Birthday Weekend,"We had a wonderful overnight stay at Royal London House, with birthday cake, Prosecco and flowers in our room giving us an instant celebratory feeling. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them. The Aviary Restaurant was located on the top floor with great views and a roof terrace which would be fun for cocktails in the summer. The food and service were both very good and the ambience was modern and lively. 

We had a sixth floor suite which was very well furnished, super comfortable bed, Egyptian cotton linen and an amazing hospitality cupboard - which even had a mini Nespresso machine. The bathroom and shower room were well designed and super luxurious. Big TV screens and access to everything we needed, all very high spec'.

Downstairs there was a relaxed and friendly bar where you can have drinks and light meals and two full size shuffle boards. We enjoyed a Sunday morning swim, steam and sauna in the Spa area, which was well appointed. 

All in all Royal London House was a perfect place to enjoy a special birthday celebration.
Highly recommended!",5,2017,02,15
111,Fantastic new hotel that has thought of everything,"Stayed at this hotel this past weekend for three nights. Service was fantastic as everyone was incredibly kind and attentive. Location is a little bit west of central and great if you want to keep some distance between yourself and the crazy crowds and noise. Right between Old Station and Moorgate station, you can reach either one in about 5-7 minutes on foot. Upstairs restaurant has a beautiful view of the city and there is also a restaurant and cafe on the ground floor. Rooms are brand new and fully automated with digital control of everything. Many coffee and breakfast shops around (Pret A Manger, EAT, etc.) if you'd like to spend a little bit less money on breakfast. We really enjoyed our time here and hope to be back soon.",5,2017,02,14
111,Great start,"I've been to this hotel on my first trip this year in London. They opened just a few weeks before it. The hotel is great, everything is new, clean and smells good. The spa is great. It didn't work one day, but I accept it as they opened it only that week. The gym is well equipped for a hotel. The staff was helpful and very polite. I was maximally satisfied.",5,2017,02,14
111,Excellent Hotel! 5 stars for the cost of 2. Bargain.,"Just what you'd hope it would be; welcoming staff, beautiful rooms, beautiful roof terrace with fab views of the city and central location. I would like to say a big thankyou to Krisztina on the front desk who went out of her way to look after us - most appreciated! xx",5,2017,02,14
111,Fab Hotel,"We stayed at your hotel for two nights and thought it was great.  The staff were helpful, spa facilities really good and was also in a really convenient location. 

We ate in the restaurant and thought the food was lovely. It was too cold to sit on the terrace but we went out to have a look and it was great so will visit the bar in the summer. 

Would highly recommend this hotel to stay or even just for drinks.",5,2017,02,13
111,Amazing from start to finish,"I stayed for one night for a dinner and meetings the following day. I have to say from start to finish it was a really good experience. the rooms are fresh, clean with comfy beds all lighting and heating are controlled from one built in screen/ipad. the aviary bar is really cool with resident DJ on the night we attended, although not loud the music was a great backdrop to the excellent food and service. The cocktails are excellent and having tried a few I can highly recommend the pina colada.",5,2017,02,13
111,Excellent service and accommadation.,"Stayed at this hotel on Saturday 11th February 2017. the service from check in to check out was exceptional, the rooms are what you expect from a 5 star Hotel, the restaurant and bars were also very good, not excessively priced for the location of the hotel! when the receptionist asked the reason for the stay, our 10th anniversary she kindly gave us access to club lounge and facilities, a nice gesture!
we shall certainly go back and would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,02,13
111,Beautiful appointed bedroom,"We stayed one night at Montcalm Royal London and would have no hesitation in staying there again when we are next in London for the evening..
The bedroom was on the 9th floor and appointed to a very high standard. It really was a pleasure to stay.

Even having the fire alarm go off at 03:00 am because some moron decided to smoke in their bedroom did not detract too much fro our stay. At least those of us who were woken had the satisfaction of knowing the culprit was staring at a £500 fine. That's one expensive cigarette.",5,2017,02,12
111,One night ....,"We only stayed the 1 night so difficult to write about all the facilities. Our room was below ground and although there was a problem with the key card this was sorted out very quickly so I couldn't fault that. The staff on arrival were just charming and the room was quiet, luxurious and the shower was superb so an excellent place to stay near Liverpool St station (5 mins walk away).  I will be back.",4,2017,02,12
111,Wedding weekend - Fabulous Stay ,"We stayed for two nights for our wedding weekend in London. Fantastic hotel, amazing staff, best place we've ever stayed. Treated like royalty and staff put on a fabulous surprise of roses, candles, balloons etc in our room on our wedding night. Amazing roof top bar and views too. Can't thank you enough and we will definitely be recommending you and returning ourselves! 5 Stars, 10 out of 10 ! ",5,2017,02,12
111,Impeccable,"Hospitality. This is a word the staff at the Montcalm have imbibed. 

I've experienced luxurious hotels before and can testify that my stay here was one of the finest. All members of staff were cordial and the service provided was beyond what I expected. 

The important thing is that were looked after here. Many hotel staff are full-time ushers. At the Montcalm, I felt that the staff made every effort to make sure our experience was a pleasant one and it seemed they gained satisfaction from it too ! Service and hospitality are not the same thing, and the staff at Montcalm have obviously figured that out. 

Kudos to Krisztina in particular for her impeccable service. The first weekend I stayed here, she quickly corrected an error on my part (I had booked  a room on the wrong day!). She did not guilt trip me about it, nor lambast me about my supposed responsibilities. Instead, she took it upon herself to make sure that my error was resolved without hassle - this kind gesture left me extremely grateful and thoroughly impressed. It is no surprise that I returned a week later to spend another night at this amazing hotel. 

The facilities at the hotel are astounding. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and luxurious. The spa facilities are relaxing and the rooftop restaurant is exhilarating. 

10/10. Incredible service and facilities. We're planning our next trip !",5,2017,02,12
111,Surprise stay,"I booked the Montcalm Royal London House as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday and so happy I picked this hotel! When we checked in we were automatically upgraded to a Club room, we were greeted by the manager who was extremely helpful and took us up to our room. 

When we got to the room it was a lovely surprise, the customer experience team had put balloons, a cake, bottle of wine and written 'happy birthday' in petals on the bed which made the occasion even more special. Each room has its own smartphone and a tablet in the wall for under floor heating, lighting, air con etc. You can change the settings to have different mood lighting and there is a huge TV with sky channels. We forgot our swimwear but luckily the hotel is located in a great central spot close to lots of shops and restaurants so we just popped out to buy some and so glad we did. The hotel has a lovely pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. We didn't use the gym but it had everything you would need with a separate cardio area and weights section.  

We didn't have dinner in the hotel had a drink in the Aviary rooftop bar which had beautiful views! The drinks were expensive but it was worth it. I highly recommend this hotel, service was great, rooms were lovely and I will definitely be staying there again!",5,2017,02,11
111,An amazing weekend..far exceeded expectations,Travelling alone @ the age of 73 for a special  musical event...I was amazed that from the first moment at reception every part of my stay was outstanding! The special gifts in my room...the room itself...the pool and Spa.. but it was the staff that made the stay so memorable. I cannot fault it in any way in fact I am going again this weekend!,5,2017,02,10
111,Can't wait to go back already!,"Where do I even start! On arrival we were greeted with Prosecco which was a lovely warm welcome. 
We got there two hours before check in but it wasn't a problem for them they showed us to our (beautiful) room straight away. At check in the receptionist told us we had been upgraded, they even walked us up to the room to show us how to use the technology in the room. Massive bed and TV fitted with a Sky box with all the channels, you can also connect your phone via Bluetooth to the in room speakers. 
On our second day when we got back to the hotel we were greeted with cake, a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate truffles because I had mentioned to them via whatsap before arrival that we were in London for my boyfriends birthday.
I honestly can't recommend this hotel anymore, excited to visit again in the summer to have drinks on the roof top bar (we tried to brave it but it was the second weekend on Jan so freezing!)",5,2017,02,09
111,Wonderful atmosphere,"The location is on the City not far from Liverpool street, and the Hotel is completely new, with a wonderful atmosphere in the lounge bar. I orderer a nice drink well prepared by the barman. The room is fully furnished with a great plasma TV, iron, hair dryer, slippers and a comfy and relaxing bed. The staff was really friendly when I made the check in, welcoming you with smiles.",4,2017,02,09
111,Lovely hotel,"My room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. You do not need to bring an iron, robe, slippers, or hair dryer. 
The hotel provides a free smart phone that allows you to make free international phone calls. Meals were not included. I had 1 breakfast in the rooftop restaurant. About 22 pounds. That was for the full breakfast, which was delicious. 
The concierge was very helpful with getting us a taxi when needed. The hotel is within walking distance to St. Paul's cathedral, several museums, the London Wall. Alain very close to the tube. If I'm ever in London for business again, this is where I will stay. ",5,2017,02,08
111,Simply Fabulous,"Enjoyed a wonderful long weekend at the Montcalm Royal London. The staff could not have been more helpful from the initial booking (made directly with the Hotel - thanks Mandeep!) to the second we checked out.
Our family suite (Room 303) was huge, with 2 bathrooms and a nice view over the square opposite the hotel. 
The beds are super comfy and the other amenities (robe, slippers, bottled water, tea/coffee) in the room are of the high quality you would expect.  
Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant which manages to be bright and airy even on a dull February day.  The choice for breakfast was great with all the usual cooked items and a good selection of cheese, cold meats, cereal and fruit juice.
There is a small pool/sauna/steam room on the lower floor which we enjoyed very much (there was a gym too).
Our booking gave us access to the club lounge which was a lovely bonus after a busy day having fun.  
It may not appear to be the most central location, and as its mainly offices nearby it can be oddly quiet at the weekend.  It is however only 5 minutes walk to Liverpool St or Moorgate tube and the hotels own bars and restaurants are great!",5,2017,02,08
111,Beautiful Hotel,"Great night spent here with my partner for his birthday, from the moment we arrived the service was outstanding. Great Location, amazing roof top bar and the room was beautiful. Will be returning without a doubt.  ",5,2017,02,07
111,Very good ,Excellent facilities here with rooms that are of a very high standard. Staff throughout were very polite and helpful with great views from the restaurant on the top floor. Only a short walk from Old St tube and well placed. Would stay again.,4,2017,02,06
111,Best overall stay I have had in the area,"I come to London 2-3 times a year for work and always stay in the area as my office is nearby. Given this Montcalm is a bit newer, it was my first time I have staying. Let's say I am glad I did and I have my new go-to for sure. 

Upon arrival after an insanely long day of travel, the staff was friendly, welcoming, and helpful with everything I needed. They were thorough in their explanations of the hotel and were more than happy to help me with all bags I had. The room was as good as I have stayed in, with good, updated technology, excellent design, and comfortable all around. I ordered room service quite late but the food arrived quite promptly and was delicious. 

Everything about my experience, from the friendly staff to the room setup was superb and I would highly recommend.",5,2017,02,06
111,Great find,"Just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. The hotel is new ,fresh opulent but not stuffy in any way. 
We were dealt with quickly and efficiently at check in and our room was large and spacious although it looked straight into an office block. 
There was considerable noise up until 5:30 pm with drilling in the next building.. fortunately it stopped and calm was resumed. Hopefully this is just a short term piece of work bring carried out. 
The rooms were very well equipped and operated by an interactive pad on the wall. The bed was huge and super comfy. 
The bathroom was beautiful and luxurious as were the Hermes toiletries. Slippers were provided however there were no dressing gowns. These would have been helpful for use in the spa. ...Which incidentally was fab. !
The 10th floor restaurant and bar was lovely and views were tremendous however it was very very rowdy for most of the evening.. that said it was a Friday night but if your looking for somewhere to eat and chill this is definitely not the place. 
I would recommend this hotel and will definitely return. 
The proximity to Liverpool station is another asset. ",4,2017,02,05
111,Business people only,"I stayed here in December with my partner and we chose this hotel because we had previously stayed in the M by Montcalm and that was perfect so we jumped at the chance of being in the newer hotel, however we were left very disappointed. When we arrived the greeting was great, we did have to wait a short while for our room but we were offered drinks while we waited. 

I couldn't fault the room it looked great just like the one we stayed in at the M by Montcalm. However over the next few days you really can't predict when the room was going to be cleaned one day the cleaner would knock really early and wake you up or other days the room wouldn't be cleaned until after 7pm. 

We paid for breakfast everyday, I wouldn't pay extra for this, it wasn't anything to shout about. 

The thing that let this hotel down so much is on our first night when we came back in from a little shop around 9pm we walked through the doors and then the door man followed behind us and stopped us, asked us what we were doing here, I have never been so offended by this, I apologised to this man and I said sorry we are actually staying here but I apologise you didn't know that because we aren't wearing a suit or a dress and heels.

Very disappointed will not be returning in the near future, staff should be made aware to respect all guests.",2,2017,02,05
111,Birthday treat,"We stayed for 2 nights as first part of a birthday celebration. The hotel knew it was a birthday and we given an upgrade plus cake, fruit and wine in the room - plus a hand written birthday card. This made a fantastic start to our weekend. 

The bed was very comfortable and shower was efficient. Hermes products. 

We were eating out and there are a good range of dining and drinking options within 10 minutes walk. 

We visited the Aviary rooftop bar on Friday evening and it was too busy for us with the after work crowd. We returned end of the evening on Saturday and it was very nice. Well made cocktails. ",5,2017,02,05
111,Let down at breakfast but otherwise a great stay ,"Having previously stayed at the two nearby Montcalm hotels we were pleased to find this new hotel from the same chain offering such good prices for a weekend stay. Check in was efficient and pleasant, we were a little early but our room was ready without any fuss. The room itself was fine, very comfortable bed and a nice quiet sleep. The shower looked more powerful than it was, would have preferred better pressure and more heat but it was nothing to complain about. The room was fine but not exceptional however I think we had just a standard double. There was only a view of the electrical and AC units which wasn't very inspiring.
We had an evening dinner in the Avairy restaurant which was very good, all courses were delicious and great service, would return for this alone.
Breakfast was another story, complete chaos and the hot buffet was running empty, little choice on the buffet and ordering a la carte took an age, however the lady supervising breakfast did all she could to apologise and speed things up for us, she was very efficient. Breakfast could be much improved compared to the great dinner service in the same venue.
Over all we were pleased with the stay, the location works for us and the bar is nice and a quiet nights sleep was had by both of us so we would consider returning when in the area for work or pleasure. ",4,2017,02,05
111,Very nice new hotel ,We stayed here in October 2016 after it had just opened. There were some teething problems but we tried it again and stayed for one night in February. Some of those problems have now been sorted. The rooftop bar is a nice place for a drink before dinner. The rooms are well furnished and it is a comfortable place to stay. We also used the spa facilities which were good. My only negative point is that breakfast is a little chaotic even though there weren't many guests. Coffee wasn't topped up and we had to try and get the waiters attention quite a few times. The food also kept running out and wasn't replenished quick enough. ,4,2017,02,05
111,Perfect stay!,"Stayed here on a Friday night to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend and it was absolutely perfect.
The staff were so friendly and helpful and gave us a free upgrade to a junior suite with champagne and cakes when they realised we were staying for a special occasion! The hotel has lovely bars and restaurants, it was absolutely spotless and the club lounge was also a nice touch.
Spa and gym facilities were 5* and although it was raining when we stayed the rooftop bar looked great.
Easy to find and a good base for exploring London - we will definitely be returning!!",5,2017,02,04
111,"""Amazing service!""","Just spent two nights at The Royal London celebrating my daughters 30th birthday. From the moment we stepped into this very moden hotel the staff fell over themselves to make us welcome! My eldest daughter had been in consent touch by email with Tania, the entertainments manager. A very lively, professional and caring young lady that nothing was to much trouble. All the staff made us very welcome . We had arranged for the chef to make us a birthday cake and what a cake!! Best I've ever tasted! Exactly what we asked for..... well done chef! The junior suite was contemporary and spacious with all the up to date technology. All three of us travelled into the west end , (a short distance in a cab ) for some retail therapy ! Then Saturday night straight down to the hotel bar for a surprise get together with 15 of my daughters closest friends! Wow the bar staff really went all out for us and made it a 'party atmosphere '.... thanks to the boys working that night. The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars was because the 'spa' area let it down. No where near enough sun lounges by the pool. Only 2!!!! And there were 6 people all trying to place towels and belongings on two sun beds! Having said that the staff certainly made up for that. Can't wait to return.",4,2017,02,04
111,Almost great,"Nice new hotel near Moorgate tube, quiet location if you need to be on that side of town. We had a Club room (so not the most basic) which was large and well equipped only real complaint - the bed was small - well it was probably King size but most hotels (even Premier Inn) have a Super King Bed these days. Hotel does seem to have a few teething problems, it was very hot, needed air conditioning on all night which is bad enough in the summer but horrible and surely unnecessary  in the winter when its freezing outside. The Aviary bar is very nice but chaotic, felt like they had only just opened instead of 4 months ago, we didn't eat in the restaurant as we had other engagements. But overall a nice hotel.",4,2017,02,02
111,Great service,"I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. The staff was welcoming and polite and always interested in helping out.
The breakfast in the aviary was very good and the service was great.

I didn’t have a chance to visit the spa or gym, but maybe next time. I can certainly recommend this hotel to any one that are traveling to London.",5,2017,02,02
111,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Spent a night here during a weekend away in london with my boyfriend. Booked this hotel on a whim, knew it was only recently opened and didn't have great expectations. prices were reasonable so we though why not!

It was a bit tricky to find, walked around Finsbury square for ages but eventually found it. Greeted by the doormen who were polite and ushered us through to reception. Staff at reception were polite and friendly and even offered us glasses of Prosecco! 

We were shown to our room and were very impressed! Spacious for a London hotel, absolutely spotless, mood lighting, heated bathroom floors and a very comfortable bed! 

There was a bit of a mix up with the room as we had complimentary birthday cake and a bottle of wine waiting for us and it wasn't anyones birthday! Phoned reception and they immediately sent a manager up to the room who apologised and said to enjoy the mix up!

We ended the day by having drinks at the Aviary roof top bar-great views! We got there quite late so didn't stay long(shuts at midnight which is a shame!) 

Overall, fantastic stay, we will definitely be returning!!",5,2017,02,01
111,Fantastic ,"Stayed for one evening, completely beautiful, we had an absolutely lovely time. The room was perfect and the staff were so helpful and friendly! The aviary was definitely the panicle of the hotel! Absolutely perfect ",5,2017,02,01
111,wonderful weekend,"Just back from a great weekend at this gorgeous hotel.
We booked a club room which was not huge, but very lovely with a great bathroom. This also entitled us to complimentary snacks and drinks ( inc prosecco and beer) in the club lounge which was a lovely touch.
The Aviary bar on the top floor has fantastic views across the city skyline.
All the staff were great and the location is fantastci for exploring Shoreditch, hoxton, Brick Lane etc as we did.Will definitely return!",5,2017,01,31
111,A pleasant stay,"The room was nice and comfortable. Complimentary water and fruit were nice addition. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I have also took advantage of gym facilities, which are good size and decently equipped.  The only negative was lack of fresh fruit a the breakfast bar, but it was a pleasant stay after all.",5,2017,01,31
111,"EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT, 10 POINTS!","Montcalm Royal London hotel was PERFECT 5 STAR HOTEL, CLEAN and NEW! When we arrived, check-in was very smooth and Ivet told us to go to Club Lounge drink (coffee, beer, limonades, juices and evening time alcohol drinks) and eat snacks while they prepare our room, Club Lounge was more than nice after long flight! We had Club room and it was so nice and clean with huge bed and big tv on the wall! There was also bottle of wine and cake waiting in the room because it was my girlfriend birthday! So nice! Spa was quiet and relaxing with sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and pool! (There is also good gym!) At the rooftop is bar with a nice view! All the people working in the hotel was super nice and friendly! Definetely we are going back!
There was also smartphone with simcard and internet in room what you can take with you when you go to explore the city!

Special thanks to Ivet! ",5,2017,01,31
111,Very good experience,"This is a relatively new hotel and had a one night stay in Jan.  Its the first hotel experience I have encountered with touch screen controls in the room for everything. Its fairly straight forward but you should familiarise yourself with the screen controls before you try to workout how to switch on/off the room lights. 

A bit disappointing there was no bath.  The primary asset ( apart from the good service from the staff ) is the roof top open terrace with stunning views towards the Gerkin and the Shard

There was an issue with the quality of the ribeye steak in the Aviary restaurant but that was resolved by the waiter adjusting the bill accordingly.",4,2017,01,31
111,Amazing!!,"I was very impressed from start to finish.   The lovely doorman was helpful regarding parking my car, I was upgraded to a Junior Suite (the beds are amazing!!).  I was personally so thankful for the little thoughtful touches like having plug sockets available for US as well as UK devices, and the lovely underground heating in the bathroom!
 
One other thing - there's parking availability across the street, and the hotel has a 50% discounted rate at the NCP.  Having a car in London is such a pain, so I generally don't expect parking availability at a hotel, but it's nice to know it's there they've managed to keep the pricing reasonable for an overnight stay. 
 
I will definitely be visiting again!!!",5,2017,01,31
111,NIGHT OUT IN LONDON / GOOD LOCATION,"Having stayed at many of the Montcalms I booked the royal london house  due to a day / night out in the city.
Once arrived from start to finish everything  5 start, very well treated, very polite staff and nothing false with them trying to help you and making your stay welcome.
The location is great, touching distance and walking from  Shoreditch / Liverpool street and only a taxi fair from SoHo (£10 approx.)
The hotel was furnished to a high standard and the rooms were as well, I also slept very well as the rooms were quite.
I stay at the Mont calms a lot as I know the service you get there is excellent , and if I was in the area again id stay at the royal london house.",5,2017,01,31
111,5 star ,"Everything at the hotel was 5 star. The staff, the room , the food, absolutely everything.
I would highly recommend this hotel. 
Rooms are top quality everything you would need and so much more.
The spa was so relaxing and all staff were so helpful. Will definitely be back soon 
Adam ",5,2017,01,30
111,Very enjoyable stay,Amazing hotel. The staff is lovely and made us feel very welcome. Very nice room as well. Couldn't ask for anything more. Will definitely return and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.,5,2017,01,29
111,Birthday Visit,"Stayed for a one night stay on a Friday. Had communicated with hotel via WhatsApp prior to our stay. We had requested to drop our bags off at 12 noon as we knew check in wasn't until 1400 hours. However, when we arrived at hotel we were told we had been upgraded (as wife's birthday) and the room was ready.  The lady on reception was excellent and check in was easy.
The hotel was easy to find and was situated between Moorgate and Old Street Tube stations. Moorgate slightly closer and about a 5 minute walk. It is within a grand old building that used to be the Royal Mail Headquarters. It overlooks a pleasant green square area. 
The room was well furnished and full of all mod cons and large TV (with all Sky Channels). Nice bathroom with large shower and good mood lighting in room. Nice to find complimentary cake in the room aswell and a handwritten card wishing us a good stay. Room also had robes and slippers and a Nespresso machine. All Good.
We visited the spa which has a pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room. Only downside was there were no locker facilities so we had to give a member of staff our clothes which was a bit odd. Glad I had my posh pants on lol. I noticed most people seemed to come down from rooms in dressing gowns and slippers (we know for next time). Didn't use the gym but looked like some good Cardio Equipment in there.
Prior to going out on the night we used the Aviary Bar on 10th floor for drinks. Very busy and great views across London to The Shard and The Gherkin. Went out onto the Terrace, but there was a lack of heaters so soon back inside.
We also used the bar on the ground floor. Also busy and good atmosphere. Drink prices were what you would expect in London. There were two Shuffleboard games in the bar. What a great game!!
As it is in The City of London, the area around the hotel was very busy on Friday. Not noisy in the room. However, on Saturday it was the complete opposite. Most shops closed. However, this doesn't matter as everywhere very accessible from the tube. We did Camden, Oxford Circus and Covent Garden whilst there. None took more than 15 mins from hotel with excellent Tube Service. As our train didn't leave until 1600 hours on Saturday we left our luggage after checking out and went and got it on the way back to the station. 
All of the staff we encountered were very professional and a credit to the hotel. 
Would definitely recommend and would stay again. 

",5,2017,01,29
111,"2nd visit, twice as good!","2nd time staying here at Royal London and again the staff here smashed it and i had an amazing stay!

Rooms are beautiful and they have everything you need and the most comfortable bed imaginable! The hotel is super clean and staff are just to welo trained and professional, but not robotic! Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and antisipated all our needs. 

Breakfast as a delight and the views from the roof top restaurant were fantastic.

I will be back soon",5,2017,01,29
111,Amazing hotel.,"Service is fantastic - great staff! Walkable to all major landmarks, 5min walk from underground and train station. Check in process was very smooth and everyone was very helpful. Rooms are very technologically advanced.",5,2017,01,29
111,Amazing hotel and great staff,"My partner booked a surprise night stay for my birthday. When we arrived we were escorted to our room where they have laid rose petals on the bed in heart shapes which was a lovely touch!

The room was immaculate and beautifully modern.

We paid for an upgrade to the club package which included access to the club lounge - unlimited beverages and canapés. A continental breakfast was also served in the club room which was all fresh and plenty of variety. 

In the evening we ventured to The Aviary, roof top bar, with its stunning views of the city. The bar itself was very busy with dj music being played which wasn't what we were expecting so after admiring the views we went to the Burdock, the other bar in the hotel. This was bustling but not too busy. We played a game of shuffleboard and enjoyed a meal which was delicious. I would highly recommend the freakshakes too! 

The morning of our stay we used the spa facilities. All very clean and relaxing environment. The spa (swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna) fairly small so in peak times may get cramped but it was perfect when we stayed. 

We explored the city on our last day and didn't want to take our luggage gear around with us so the hotel were happy to store it for us until we collected. 

All staff were extremely accommodating and couldn't do enough to for us. 

Thank you for a lovely stay and we hope to return later on in the year. ",5,2017,01,29
111,Fairly new but not quite there yet.,"Approximately 5 minutes walk from Moorgate Underground Station.  There are plenty of shops near by (Boots for toiletries, Starbuck for coffee, Tesco for snack and many restaurants.)  There are many inconsistencies within the hotel with respect to the staff.  The welcome greeting was rather overpowering and suffocating where staff were trying far too hard and then you find staff who make no effort to say 'afternoon' etc.  The room was wonderful, great facilities but not sound proof.  I was staying on Friday night so many weekenders who had a little to drink were rather noisy in rooms and in corridors which happens.  My biggest complaint and surprise was, by day and afternoon the hotel lobby and reception is quite tranquil, a different story in the evening.  There isa bar in the reception areas and this became incredible noisy with raucous behaviour,  Drinkers obstructed the entrance and made it difficult leaving and returning to the hotel.  There was a rotund doorman who was more interested in listening to the drinkers conversations rather than opening the door for me or other guests. Unfortunately the downstairs bar has put me off staying in this hotel again.  You will note from my comment earlier that the room I was staying in certainly was NOT sound proof.  If you are a deep sleeper then this may be for you but if like me, a light sleeper, definitely not the hotel for you.  Breakfast is not included in the rate - gym is not 24 hours either.  There is no business centre at this hotel for printing/email.",3,2017,01,29
111,Birthday stay,Lovely hotel in a great location and really friendly and helpful staff. Just a shame most of the shops are closed on weekends. We stayed for my birthday and enjoyed every moment of it.it was also nice to enjoy the spa and relax. Shame it's winter otherwise we could have stayed on the roof terrace for alot longer.,5,2017,01,28
111,Excellent one night stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay at this new hotel.
Excellent customer service
Very clean
Beautiful decor
We stayed to celebrate our anniversary and received complimentary cake and Prosecco via Room Service
Beautiful rooftop restaurant and open lounge.
We would love to stay again",5,2017,01,28
111,Amazing contemporary hotel with excellent service,"Stayed on the night of my wife's Birthday and felt the hotel made a special effort. We were upgraded to a suite and they provided cake in the room. 
We have stayed in other Montcalm hotels previously and I felt the level of luxury and attention to detail and service we have received in the past was equalled by this hotel and the staff.",5,2017,01,27
111,"wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","We celebrated my wife's birthday here. 
This is a simply great hotel with wonderful staff. Newly opened in October 2016, we found that the teething problems of any new property had been overcome. Situated in the financial district and 2 minutes walk to Moorgate Underground with some excellent restaurants nearby. (Ottolenghi, Cinnamon plus the usual range of chain restaurants). The rooms are well proportioned with all the room facilities a traveller would expect from a 5* hotel. Great roof top restaurant and bar. The Club Is a little austere and the snacks on offer are limited but the range of alcoholic drinks was excellent. Staff are attentive and Claudia on the front desk was friendly but courteous, attentive and helpful. Great ambassador for the hotel! 
Great stay. Highly recommended.",5,2017,01,27
111,Fantastic stylish hotel with exceptional staff,"I don't normally take the time to give a review, but in this case thought I should.

I recently stayed at the Royal London Montcalm whilst staying in London on business. I normally stay at the South Place Hotel (another 5* hotel five minutes away), but thought id like to try out this new boutique offering.
When I arrived I found the staff to be incredibly friendly,and the check in was both quick and easy.
The hotel in general was kitted out superbly, and we ended up spending the entire evening in the roof top bar.
When I did get back to my room, I found I'd received a complimentary upgrade and was also given a complimentary later check out till 2pm.
I would also like to mention that the website really doesn't do the rooms justice.
I will be re-booking when im next in the city.",5,2017,01,27
111,Best Montcalm in City of London,I have stayed at the Brewery and at the M (Old Street) - all are fantastic but the Royal London House is my favorite. Friendly staff most of whom have served in the other Montcalm and bring the same charm. Our company uses these three hotels exclusively and we love their service. Christina is the best front of house person I have dealt with in years - she is a rock star. Stay here and you will not be disappointed.,5,2017,01,26
111,Fabulous service - lovely hotel,"We stayed at Montcalm having been relocated by our online booking company so we were unsure what to expect. However, we needn't have worried since the Montcalm is a fabulous hotel with the most attentive staff I have ever encountered. We were greeted by Adrian at the door who was charming and escorted us to reception whilst chatting with us. We had arrived a little early for check in but there was no problem. The reception looked after our bags and allowed us to enjoy a drink in the bar whilst we waited. When we checked in and went to our room, our bags had been taken up for us. There was a small hiccup with the room but as soon as the issue was raised Ivet and the team at reception remedied the situation swiftly, professionally and appropriately. Our bags were moved to the new room for us and the room was lovely, calm, warm (it was freezing outside!) and relaxing. the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and fresh with a lovely shower. We enjoyed a drink in the roof top bar - which is stunning, with amazing views - and again the service was second to none. On returning to our room, Ivet had left a note for us apologising for the mix up with room and had left us a bottle of wine and some chocolates. This was entirely unexpected and much appreciated. Clearly customer satisfaction is the absolute top priority at Montcalm Royal London House. Raymond kindly ordered us a taxi in the evening for our night out and ensured we had everything we needed - the staff even walked us to the taxi and opened the door for us. 

Although not included in our room rate, we decided to have breakfast in the hotel in the morning and enjoyed a selection from the menu. Everything was cooked perfectly and the food was of a high quality. The staff (again) were fabulously attentive and made us feel welcome. We spent a little while in the cafe downstairs before we left the hotel and were able to use the wifi. The chap in the bar (with the shuffleboards) kindly offered us some water and periodly checked that we were ok and had everything we needed. 

We have very much enjoyed our stay at Montcalm and are delighted that our original booking had been relocated! I am confident in saying that I have never experienced such exceptional customer service as we had at Montcalm and I would highly recommend this hotel. Well done team.",5,2017,01,26
111,Very nice Old Modern Hotel,"Central Location, close to Moorgate Tube/Train station, easy to go around with tube.
Located about 1 hour from Heathrow Airport by Tube or by taxi, Express tube takes about 30 minutes.
Expensive hotel but very nice interior, rooms, gym, swimming pool. All looks like newly renovated. Very modern.",4,2017,01,25
111,Lovely hotel with fabulous service ,Really enjoyed my stay.  The staff couldn't have been more friendly.  The rooms are very comfy with great beds and huge flat screen easy to use TVs.  Small but very good pool and jacuzzi and extremely clean.  I'm going back again tomorrow!  ,5,2017,01,24
111,Felt like royalty on our honeymoon,"This is the best hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying at. From the moment you arrive, you are treated like a VIP. The doorman carried our bags and asked how our journey was then walked us to the stunning reception area. We were welcomed by the lovely Juliana. She seemlessly arranged a suprise in our room whilst entertaining us with champage and cakes in the lounge. The room was amazing! Even down the the fragrance gizmo that scents the room. It smelt like a relaxing spa. The staff are exeptional and the hotel is pure luxury. We cant wait to stay again soon, i didnt want to leave. Thank you montcalm for giving us a beautiful honeymoon weekend. Mr & Mrs Hawksley x",5,2017,01,24
111,"Amazing room, amazing service","The staff absolutely make the hotel, and the staff at this hotel were so friendly, welcoming and accomodating. We arrived 15 minutes before check-in, but they still allowed us to check-in, and even gave us a complimentary upgrade!
The room was very stylish, very comfortable and well equipped. The bed was so comfortable, the lighting options made for a very relaxed and cosy atmosphere.
The shower was so amazing we didn't want to get out of it!! We didn't use all the facilities provided in the room as we were only there for one night, but it was good to see how well Montcalm provides for its guests.
When we checked out the next day, the reception staff even offered the concierge service of storing our luggage so we didn't have to lug it around London, as we wanted to do some shopping before catching our late train home.
What made this entire experience even more remarkable was the fact that we paid a very cheap price for this room through Booking.com, and the staff treated us with just as much care and respect. It is this level of service that will have us looking at returning here for our future trips to the Capital.",5,2017,01,24
111,Fabulous location for a weekend break or city business trip,"We thought the hotel was situated well and has clearly been upgraded to a high standard. The rooms were clean, quiet and sumptuous. We had complimentary fizz on arrival, an upgrade and the Red Velvet cake in the room (we had birthdays to  celebrate). 

We loved the views from floor 10 and found the leisure spa very easy to use; small but relaxing. 

We found all staff to be attentive and helpful.",5,2017,01,23
111,Birthday bliss in central London,"Spent 3 nights here to celebrate a big birthday - had a wonderful time. Great room, comfy bed, yummy biscuits. Interesting control panel for lights which caused moments of no lights to all lights.. roof top bar is amazing with stunning views and a decent gin menu - take out a mortgage if you are having more than one drink! The Spa - visited twice after long days walking and visiting the sights. Swim against the current, simmer in the jacuzzi or boil gently in the steam room. The gym remained unvisited but looked fine! We would def come back here, the staff are friendly and very efficient.",5,2017,01,23
111,"Shiny new hotel, friendly staff and a lovely room","I chose this hotel initially because it was well-priced, however I think I may have found a new favourite place to stay.

The hotel is well-presented, the welcome hosts on the doors are a nice addition and very friendly throughout. Upon check-in, I'd discovered that I'd been upgraded to a club room automatically, which was a nice surprise.

The room was a good size for sure, well-equipped (Sky TV, mini-bar with snacks, tea/coffee facilities, fresh fruit and truffles on arrival) and very comfortable. There were however, some niggles. I was awoken to workmen outside at 07:30, but the hotel staff were quick to ensure I was compensated for the inconvenience. I found the bathroom cold and there was no heating other than the underfloor heating, which didn't seem to work. The bath took a long time to fill. The ironing board put my non-stick pans to shame, meaning clothes would slip off of it way too easily. The Nespresso machine in the room was terrible, producing slightly-coloured water (no fault of the hotel). Also, I found the room was difficult to get warm, but it wasn't cold by any means.

The room had a touch-screen control panel including a means of setting the room to 'do not disturb' with the touch of a button, changing the lights outside the front door (loved that!). Also, having Sky with movies and sports was a bonus, not something always experience in a hotel, plus it was on, what I believe to be about a 50"" TV, all very nice.

I went down to the bar, had a drink or two, plus a really nice burger and ice cream. The staff were friendly as ever and though there by myself, was really a enjoyable evening.

I would love (and hope) to go here again soon. Staying there was an experience, and a great one at that. I'm hoping next time I can try the restaurant with the view!",5,2017,01,22
111,Complimentary ,"We received complimentary first class rail tickets with virgin trains , let go to London! Booked Montcalm Royal London House 👍

Service was excellent as was bar drinks waiter service 👍 we pointed out the bed on checking out and staff made notes and was very apologetic , we were happy with that. Room was £144.00 per night👍 was good value and we will stay again. NCP Car parking is discounted if ever go by car £25 per 24 hours. Should be £50 and it is opposite the hotel underground,",5,2017,01,22
111," Birthday werkend","Just got home from a lovely weekend at the Montcalm. Arrived Friday evening to a lovely member of door staff taking my heavy suitcase through to reception for me. The place was buzzing, and lots of customers filling the bar downstairs. 
At reception they told me we had been upgraded which was really lovely of them. 
A lady showed us up to our room and helped us to get to understand the electronic mod cons which was really cool! 
The hotel had put some cake and macaroons as it was my birthday which was a really nice touch!
The bed was amazing, and we didn't want to get up in the mornings. 
The underfloor heating in the bathroom was lovely once you get out the shower - which was spacious and warm.
The pool and jacuzzi area we used one morning was lovely and relaxing.
We had a drink in the sky bar one evening, lovely cocktail but a bit pricy (what you expect in London I suppose). We enjoyed these with a lovely view of the sky line. 
We had room service one evening because we couldn't be bothered to stay out in London. It was prompt and delicious.
The staff are amazing here, and will do anything to make your stay better. We needed more pillows and they happily brought them up to us even though it was 12pm! 
I cannot wait to return to London and stay at the hotel again.
Thank you so much Montcalm for making my birthday so perfect!",5,2017,01,22
111,Top class 5 star PERFECTION xx ,"Well where do I start this hotel
Is by far the best hotel we have EVER stayed in! From the staff, to the rooms, the price, the quality, the service! I can not fault it! 
We arrived to check in, the staff on reception top class Khristina booking us in, she was so friendly and welcoming! Upgrading us for my birthday to an amazing room! Offering us a complimentary breakfast or use of lounge, we chose the breakfast. 
Glass of prosecco as we walked through the door! 
The room was huge beautiful decor immaculately clean, everything you could possible need. The bed was so comfy! Pitch black with curtains close as we like! Lighting was perfect! The shower was huge and warm and immaculate! 
The spa was beautiful free use! So quiet too! Pool was a dream! 
The roof top bar was stunning, lovely drinks and friendly staff and views to die for! 
Breakfast did not disappoint quality of food and ingredients 10/10 ! Nothing could be improved! 
We received a phone call just before checking out at 11am to apologise for our key initially not working! My god who cares you rectified it immediately and did not affect us but how lovely to receive a courtesy  call! 
 Check out was easy smooth and all staff showed complete respect and looked like they really cared! Please don't change the way you are all of you are a credit to this hotel! 
Sinnitta thank you from myself and my husband the best birthday and mainly down to your hotel! Xx ",5,2017,01,22
111,"Excellent staff, but overcomplicated technology in rooms","The hotel is very nice and in a great location, the room was spacious and comfortable, but there were a few issues with the room caused by the digital room control panel. On arrival the room was freezing cold and a technician had to come to resolve the issue. We were very cold from our trip as it was the coldest day of the year and it took a good two hours for the room to warm up. There was no hot water in the morning and we had to call someone again. The tv sound wouldn't work and we would have to call again. The air-con heating system was quite noisy throughout the night. I would have preferred just simple radiators and actual light switches instead of the confusing digital control panel which didn't fully function. 
With all that said, the staff at the hotel were exceptional. First class customer service, everything was followed through and eventually resolved. We were even offered complimentary cocktails in the top bar which was very nice. We were assured that the problems we encountered were unusual, therefore we would consider staying again.",4,2017,01,22
111,The Alternative to M by Montcalm!,"A lovely new hotel, with a few teething - or teeth-brushing  ** - problems.  Everything was very fine, including the complimentary meal in compensation for not getting the hotel we had booked [M by Montcalm, Shoreditch].

** See further comments. . . . 

If you need the bathroom basin to have a proper 'pop-up waste' there's a problem!   Ours was NOT a proper one - risking loss of a very expensive contact lens.",5,2017,01,20
111,Trouble free overnight stay!,"I booked into the Montcalm RL due the hotel being close to my office. I have had visited the other Montcalm hotels in London and had varied experiences, but my stay in the Royal London was very positive. Room was great (large bed, desk, storage, Ironing board and a modern bathroom/shower that was a good size. The room was modern with a wide selection of IT gadgets and impressive entertainment options (Sky sports and movies). I visited the gym which had a limited number of exercise machines, but they were new and I had no issues getting access. There were numerous weights machines which was also useful. Had breakfast the next day, which offered a great selection (Continental or English Breakfast) and the service was great. I received an e-mail follow up from the client experience team at the hotel to check my stay was ok and for me to provide feedback, which was good. Overall, very positive experience and will definitely be back.",5,2017,01,19
111,Perfect hotel stay! ,"Myself and partner had a fantastic time celebrating his birthday at the Montcalm! The hotel is situated in a great location and very close to London Liverpool Street station. Rooms were lovely and clean and bed very comfortable! We were very pleased to find a birthday surprise of cake waiting for us in the room. The only thing I was disappointed with was not hearing back from a WhatsApp message I had sent  prior to our stay. Although for this we were offered great apologies from the staff and an upgraded room which was very much appreciated. Overall we had a brilliant time with you and will definitely be returning in the future! 
",5,2017,01,19
111,luxury at its best,"Amazing room, excellent customer care service! excellent location 8city centre). very good food (breakfast and dinner), awesome sky bar 360º. loveable staff always ready to help. dind't use it but i'm sure the spa is very good as well",5,2017,01,19
111,High class service at a reasonable price,"We visited London on Friday and Saturday night to go to the opera. Rather than get the train home and then back up we wanted to book a reasonably priced hotel for the night. We usually use a budget hotel, such as Z-hotel - after all, we just want a place to sleep for one night, so luxury isn't high priority.

On this occasion we were swayed by a recommendation that my partner got via work - an hotel with an excellent roof-top bar with terrace.

We booked one night for £113 for the room. When we arrived a liveried doorman greeted us, the Reception staff were courteous and efficient and we received an upgrade too!

Our room, on the second floor was large, with a Queen-sized bed, nicely appointed, plenty of storage for clothing, hot drink making facilities, snacks and mini-bar out of site in one of the three 'wardrobes', bath robes, slippers and Hermes toiletries, plus a fruit bowl. Definitely a cut above our usual overnight accommodation. Other standards included a huge wall mounted television with i-player, a hand held gizmo which helped plan your stay, a great in-room guest book with lots of local restaurants recommended - at all price levels! mood lighting . I could go on, but hope you will discover for yourselves!

We visited the Sky bar and were impressed. There is also a spa and swimming pool in the basement, plus onsite restaurant(s).

Booking gave us the option of selecting the sort of room fragrance, pillow etc, which was a nice touch - as was the text we received after checking out hoping out homeward journey was a pleasant one.

Situated close to Liverpool Street Station it is ideal for us as we travel out to Essex, but it is close enough to more central London for people to use as a base when exploring (especially if you like walking and have a London Walks guidebook with you. The three we had all had walks starting in the vicinity of the hotel).

We had an excellent night's sleep, check out is not until noon and so we had a leisurely start to our day.

This is a brilliant find and we would whole-heartedly recommend it to travellers. I jet hope that the room rates remain competitively low so that people are encouraged to revisit this wonderful hotel.

We look forward to staying there again.",5,2017,01,18
111,Amazing stay!,"Loved this hotel, amazing staff and the facilities are really neat. The products are from Hermes and the room is spacious and well cleaned. 
A big plus is the smartphone that had free 4G internet and I could use Google Maps with it.
Thank you for the warm welcome!
My stay was amazing, for sure I will be coming back!",5,2017,01,18
111,Almost 5 star,"Almost a 5-star hotel, but missing the fine touches that make it truly a luxury experience. Shuffleboard in the lobby bar is £10 per 30 min. The elevators aren't linked, so you have to press the up button separately to summon the elevators or else choose wisely. Hermes branded toiletries, but they only give you the shower gel and conditioner. The bathrobe was missing from my room. 

If you can look beyond lots of small things, it's a comfortable stay.",5,2017,01,18
111,Perfect place,"The hotel is certainly the perfect place to stay. Its new and just in two steps from metro, but the best thing is you feel like at home thanks to very informative and profesional staff,
Max in the reception was really kind and friendly. I enjoyed lovely interiors, as well as rooftop bar with awsome views!!!
The SPA is really confortable place to relax^!",5,2017,01,17
111,Great Find,"This hotel was fantastic. Lovely comfy beds, spotless modern bathroom and we didn't hear a sound from other room/the corridor. We had a great deal with it being January and it's a shame we weren't there longer as we only stayed overnight. Normally we stay in the West End when going to a show but the hotel was only a 15 min cab ride into the centre and was perfect for our return journey from Liverpool Street. Would certainly stay here again. The staff were efficient, friendly and helpful. The atrium bar had fantastic views of London at night and served a great range of gin and cocktails. We visited it again in the morning for a quality cooked breakfast. Will certainly stay again.",5,2017,01,15
111,Faultless,"A fantastic and luxurious hotel. The staff were very kind and helpful upon arrival. The rooms were very clean, cosy, modern and hi-tech. Spent a night up on the rooftop bar which was very nice. Will definitely stay here when I am back in London. Faultless.",5,2017,01,15
111,Superb Hotel!,"Kristina on reception arranged a fantastic deal for us as a last minute booking for me and my husband whilst having a night out with friends. There was plenty of staff, the rooms were spacious with many gadgets to play with including underfloor heating, mood lighting and we were even given a mobile phone to use during our stay. The location was fantastic with Flight Club just around the corner. The delicious breakfast the next morning was on the 10th floor with views of the London skyline.  Thank you Kristina for making our stay very special. Lucy ",5,2017,01,14
111,Comprehensive and Meticulous ,"I stayed at this hotel a few months ago and was very impressed by the service. Not being a massive fan of booking online, I contacted them again to see if they could help with my nephew's honeymoon. He was severely injured several years ago and recently got married to a wonderful girl.

The hotel staff have all been amazing in looking after their needs and have made the stay extra special. 

Thank you to all the staff for providing a wonderful experience for them both.

I'm actually scared to say you are too good in case you don't have any rooms left when I book next time. I don't know what better compliment I can give.

",5,2017,01,13
111,"Perfect Modern Hotel, Excellent Facilities.","Great room, modern touch lighting, brand new bathroom, all newly refurbished, a real pleasure to stay here. We took advantage of the rooftop bar which was still warmly heated on a chilly December evening by outdoor heaters & with blankets provided in all seating areas; had delicious cocktails & nibbles overlooking a foggy & beautifully atmospheric City skyline. We didn't eat in the restaurant (also up on the roof) as we were meeting friends elsewhere, but it looked great & staff seemed super friendly. There's also a great Spa on the lower ground floor which we didn't have time to sample but, again, really great facilities. Montcalm Royal London House is a great hotel & we really enjoyed our stay. My only quibble would be the location... situated on Finsbury Square at the back of Liverpool Street, it seemed a little bit out of the way for me, but it would depend on the reason for your trip; it's pretty much perfect for City of London-based stays but perhaps not if you're looking to be more central for the West End. Having said that, I'd like to stay again & try out their beautiful Spa... ooooooh, is that another girlie trip coming on!!! Go try it for yourself, it's a lovely place to stay.",5,2017,01,13
111,Just back home and recommending the hotel to all my friends and people I meet with.,"My husband and me stayed for more than ten days and we could say we felt ver comfortable! The location is great: at a corner of nice Finsbury Sq. so near of City Road, Old St Station, Moorgate station, everything and everywhere seems to be at hand. The hotel is wonderful, we noticed that everything has an special touch, at the same time it is very ellegant and cozy . Everything has a distinctive touch.  The  welcome we received at the front door continued along the way to reception where the staff is great! lovely and very kind! Always ready to help, to guide and to share their time always with a smile ( in English, Italian, Spanish, etc)  The Staff at lounge and living room wonderful too, very nice and attentive since breakfast and at every moment during the day. The room was amazing, the size, the comfort and the  supplied  amenities, and no noice ! The bathroom as new! All comfort, well lighted, huge and with the most  modern design. The Aviary restaurant at the top roof is amazing! The terrace even to enjoy at a very cold night is great!  The Burdock bar, where we spent a nice time playing at the shuffle board is cozy too and has a ver good menu...I could keep writing on and on but, I'll keep on doing what I've said before: recommend it!     Nancy.   Mrs. Rene Manceda.",5,2017,01,12
111,Outstanding,"Everything you could want for in a hotel plus an amazing rooftop terrace with views across the city! 
Ideal location in the City around a 5-10 minute walk from Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Old Street stations. Check-in was swift - the staff really friendly and happy to help with anything. The room itself was large and clean with fantastically comfortable beds. Included all the mod-cons (underfloor heating, aircon, Sky, cityguide) also a large modern bathroom as well as plenty of storage space and free WiFi which worked perfectly throughout. 
The only downside was the locking mechanism on my door failed and so the keycards didn't work but this happened at the very end of the night for me and so didn't really affect the stay. 
In short I'd have no hesitation in recommending a stay here and would happily return. Thanks.",5,2017,01,12
111,Wonderful stay!,"My girlfriend and I stayed here just after Christmas and we had such an amazing stay! From the moment we arrived we were very warmly greeted by the doorman and our suitcase was immediately taken from us by a member of staff. After checking in we were shown to our room by a member of the guest experience team and our suitcase arrived moments later. 

Due to a special occasion we were given a free bottle of Prosecco and the bed was covered in rose petals. It was such a lovely touch! 

We stayed in room 304 which had a lovely view of the square. The room was very spacious and quiet. The bed was incredibly comfortable and very big! The underfloor heating in the bathroom was amazing and the shower was wonderful. 

Unfortunately we did not get to try the spa or pool but we will definitely make sure to try them next time we stay!

We went to the Aviary rooftop bar on our second night and the views certainly did not disappoint! Our drinks were also great.

The hotel is very close to Moorgate, Old Street and Liverpool Street stations. There are also several buses available from Finsbury Square. 

Overall we had a wonderful stay and we will definitely be staying again in the future, possibly even as soon as next month! Everything was absolutely perfect, right down to the doorman remembering us from 2 days before and wishing us a lovely day.",5,2017,01,11
111,Fantastic,"Went for a one night stay in mid October, was treated beautifully by the staff. The hotel had just opened so the staff were all still learning, but were doing a fantastic job!! Had a lovely room, very spacious and a huge bed! The bathroom was amazing, the best shower I have ever had, and they had a wonderful mirror perfectly lighting for make up. The hotel was in great location with easy access to tube stations, but far enough away from the busy city centre. Overall I had a lovely stay, and will definitely be staying there in the future!",5,2017,01,11
111,Nice dinner ,"As it was my birthday me and my partner wanted something special.A good friend recommended to go to dine in roof top bar In Montcalm Royal London house.This hotel it's just amazing,all stuff and the ambience made our night fantastic.From the moment We enter the hotel there was the porter opening the door for us and holding an umbrella as it was raining.On the corridor was Dado,receptionist in the hotel what escort us up to aviary bar and introduce us to her colleges which were really making sure our night will be amazing.Thank you all Montcalm team specially Dado,Simon and Monica for making my birthday unforgettable!Next step is booking a night in the hotel and trying the new spa.",5,2017,01,10
111,Birthday suprise,"We stayed at the royal London house Montcalm hotel for my girlfriends 25th birthday and me proposing to her also. Right from the moment we walked in we were looked after with swift and a classy service from the doormen to the reception desk. Had booked a junior suit for us to stay in and it didn't disappoint. The room was spacious and modern and stylish. Bed was huge and very comfy. Shower and bath were amazing! The staff put out a bottle of prosseco  and velvet cake with the words happy birthday on the bed in rose petals. There was also a lovely greeting card in the room too. My girlfriend loved it!! We went out that evening for a meal and tried out the aviary rooftop bar first which was absolutely stunning! The views were unreal of the London skyline, very romantic with sofas heaters and blankets available. Cocktails were also amazing. I then proposed to my girlfriend that evening (she said yes) and when we arrived back in our room the staff had put a heart in rose petals on the bed with some chocolate truffles and a bottle of red wine for us to congratulate us! Amazing service. 
The spa and pool was also very luxurious and relaxing, make sure you use this as is complimentary. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel as made a special moment in my life just that little bit more special. Will definitely be coming back here. Thanks Montcalm ",5,2017,01,09
111,Luxury hotel at reasonable rate.,Our second stay at the new Montcalm in Finsbury Square. From the courtesy glass of prosecco at reception through to the constant desire of all staff to please and help thus is the best hotel we have stayed in while visiting London for many a year. Now our regular choice. The beds especially are a delight. We slept till 11 o'clock today.,5,2017,01,09
111,Most welcoming hotel,"Just stayed one night here as a surprise birthday present.
Staff were very friendly and always helpful what ever we requested.
Very beautiful hotel with lovely surroundings, would recommend this to anyone.",5,2017,01,09
111,Amazing hotel,"Room: the room was very nice, with a beautiful view on the park nerby and on the towers of the City. Everything was clean, big screen TV, wonderful bed. 

Location: Very close to Moorgate and Old street, it's a few minutes walk to shoreditch, spitefields market... And the hotel is just over a park, very calm and beautiful location!

Amenities: probably one of the best city rooftop in Europe. The view is breathtaking, the cocktails are quite good and not very expensive for London. The complimentary SPA, downstair, with a nice pool, sauna, hammam and a little but well equiped sport room, is amazing, a very quiet place in such a busy city.",5,2017,01,09
111,Fantastic Hotel,"We recently booked an overnight stay here on the first week of opening.  We found the hotel to be very modern and immaculate.  No teething problems at all.  All the staff were very helpful and polite especially our friends in the club lounge.

Rooftop terrace bar great and an excellent feature. 

Unfortunately did not get time to try out the leisure facilities but will definitely be back again to do this.

Rooms are excellent and loved the Hermes toiletries.",5,2017,01,09
111,Weekend in London,"Great location - Moorgate tube is a couple of minutes away and Spitalfields about 10 mins walk. Great rooms, quiet & well equipped - comfortable beds and decent space.

111,birthday surprise,"stayed at this hotel for two nights with my partner(28-30th December 2016). the whole staff went beyond to make this birthday special to my partner that was a surprise. they placed all his presents in room and wrote happy birthday in rose petals on the bed. also leaving us with a bottle and red velvet cake just made it perfect. they even sorted out our dinner reservation, to make our stay a stress free stay. the hotel overall is amazing and the spa was lovely especially when it was quiet  unfortunately the treatments had not yet open but I'll be back to test that out too. location is amazing too 5mins walk to Liverpool Street station and if you have forgotten anything like I did tesco is around the corner. want to say a massive thank you to Daisy, Raymond, sunita and cheyanne- my surprise would not of run smoothly without them and they took the stress away from me to make it a special stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel and if planning to stay 100% ask for the people I've mentioned theirs nothing they will not do for their guest. I will test out the rest of their sister hotels this year. and the montcalm marble arch is amazing too. Rooftop restaurent/bar is lovely too and if sitting outside enjoying the views theirs blankets so the weather is not an issue. once again thank you to everyone and hopefully I'll be visiting again in a few months time.

111,A very nice modern hotel with outstanding staff,"My wife and I stayed at the M by Montcalm Royal London house on the 29th December.  We arrived at 07.30 am due to travelling down on the caledonian sleeper train.  Frevor (forgive me for the probable misspelling) was extremely friendly and professional!  He was able to find us a room immediately which was a godsend having arrived so early.  We used the spa facilities, the club room and the beautiful rooftop bar, all of which are to a very high standard!  The room was lovely and the large bed fantastic.  I must say that every member of staff that we encountered were exceptionally friendly and efficient.  We visit London on average twice a year and this is as good as any hotel we have stayed in.",5,2017,01,08
111,Great stay!,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in late December and loved it. We went to London to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and when I informed the hotel of same, we received a complimentary room upgrade, bottle of prosecco, cake, balloons, heart-shaped petals on our bed and a plate of fruit - I thought this was a really lovely touch and was very much appreciated by us. This hotel is pristine clean, has a very good location (few mins walk from Moorgate tube station) and is served by excellent staff, one nicer and more helpful than the next. We look forward to staying with ye again at some stage!",5,2017,01,08
111,Great hotel - highly recommend it!,"My wife and I stayed here over Christmas.  The hotel was excellent, with great facilities, ideal location and super freindly and helpful staff.

Tube station is just a short 8 minute walk.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,08
111,Lovely hotel in the nook of London ,"We had a very pleasant stay at The Montcalm after an initial hiccup when the club room we had been upgraded to had a foul smell but Frevor at reception moved us to another more spacious room and threw in breakfast as a nice gesture.
Nice new hotel, simple but tasty breakfast and nice rooms
Lovely customer service ",5,2017,01,08
111,Fabulous Hotel,"I travel a lot and have the pleasure in staying in some very nice hotels around the world. This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in for a very long time. The room was superbly appointed, the bed was very good and the staff were extremely nice. When asked by the team if there was any thing they could do better, I genuinely could not think of anything. ",5,2017,01,07
111,Always outstanding,"With great help from the House Manager, Daisy; my stay was perfect. She always goes above and beyond to help accommodate our needs and as a result, our stay is always 5 star worthy. She arranged a great room and even added a bottle of champagne & cake to congratulate me and my fiancee on our engagement. 

Many new hotels tend to have teething problems however the service, quality and maintenance at this hotel is second to none. 

The spa was kept extremely clean and the service at both restaurants on the roof top and downstairs were impeccable. 

Will always return to the hotel! :)",5,2017,01,06
111,Hotel for 21st birthday ,"Lovely hotel in London, stayed here for my 21st birthday night on the Saturday, before hand had stayed elsewhere as we had been down since the Thursday for a concert. The hotel was incredible, the panel to light the room, access the heating, and turn the air con on was awesome! The nespresso machine was fantastic for the morning after! The staff were helpful and attentive.. but slow start as my dads room had not been sorted out yet, so me and my girlfriend had a room my mum and her boyfriend had theirs but my dad was a Lone Ranger for an hour or so. However, went up to the top floor for a drink at the bar and they sorted the situation. The rooms themselves were nice and clean, bathroom was lovely with a waterfall shower, the bed a king size went down a treat! As did the TV With all the sky channels so 'goals on sunday' first thing in the morning before check out was just perfect!! Check out not till 12 either!! so perfect timing to have a coffee, get ready and watch the football without no rush! Will definitely stay again if we come down to London! So thank you all. 
",5,2017,01,06
111,Fabulous,"Cracking hotel with smart, friendly staff. Most comfortable bed i have slept in a hotel. Great roof top bar and terrace. Rooms were modern and had everything I could have wished for. Touch screen control for room was a little annoying at first but got used to it for turning the bathroom light on. Mood lighting is a very nice touch and the and decorated very well.",5,2017,01,06
111,Top class modern and beautiful 5* hotel with great service and friendly staff :-),"Fabulous, brand new, modern 5 ***** hotel with amazing views from the rooftop bar, located in the City of London just next to the buses and not far from the underground station which makes it easy to plan sightseeing the capitol, not wasting time and money for looking for a parking.

I have stayed with my husband and two kids in a lovely family suit for two nights. 
We were greeted and checked-in with smile and high class standards. How wonderful surprise was to find in our room a welcome tray with fruits, colourful macaroons, sides of popcorn and 2 pretty troll-toys (from the new “Trolls” movie) for our both children.
Our rooms were interconnected, very spacious with a large king size bed. The rooms were beyond what we expected, there was a simple use touch screen tablet to control the bathroom light, under floor heating, air con, an intelligent mood light... everything was completely modern and very stylish. Additionally our both rooms were fitted with very good size smart LED TVs with various Sky channels and unlimited channels especially for entertainment of our kids to enjoy their favourite animation movies. 
The spa facilities were superb - pleasant and relaxing, there was beautifully decorated not too busy pool with dimmed and colour changing lights in the evening, shiny jacuzzi  and a well-equipped gym.
We had a fantastic stay there, the staff were excellent and incredibly friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Tania (FOH Manager), Elyes (Night Manager), Daniel (Night Concierge) and Lubo (the SPA ""coordinator"") as they have offered us a brilliant stay – we felt like V.I.P.-s :-) . Thank you.
We are certainly planning a future return soon to this amazing 5* hotel, especially our kids – they did not want to leave at all, loved it there and keep asking when we could have longer stay next time. :-)  Well done The Montcalm!",5,2017,01,04
111,Amazing hotel with a view,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at in London.  We got the sleeper train down from Scotland so were at the hotel by 8am in the morning.  Staff quickly checked us in and we were very pleased when they advised they had a room available.  We were also given compliment access to the Club Room which had a great selection of drinks and canapés in the evening and a continental breakfast in the morning.

We were on the basement level so had no view - this did not bother us as the hotel room was luxury with heavy curtains over the windows.  Room was very quiet and would be happy to stay in same room again.

Praise should be given to the staff at Royal London House - every member of staff we had contact with were top class.  

Lastly - please make time to visit the roof tap bar in the evening - the view will not disappoint.  We look forward to visiting this hotel in the future.",5,2017,01,04
111,Excellent accommodation! ,"I spent a delightful time in this hotel between the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017. Very good location, close to Underground station, large rooms, wonderful services, kind and professional personnel. ",5,2017,01,04
111,"Modern, chique, with impeccable service! (rooftop bar has amazing views!)","I stayed here right before NYE and had a perfect experience. Rooftop bar/restaurant was busy and had a great vibe - definitely people from inside and outside the hotel which was cool. Bartender had a great personality and certainly enhanced the experience, old fashioned and espresso martini were both on point. Room was very modern with computerized lighting and heated floor. Overall they did a great job with the modern look and feel, while still keeping the lobby bar and cafe a bit rustic. Baristas at the cafe were very professional and took the time to give us numerous recommendations. Had a great experience and would absolutely return.",5,2017,01,03
111,Amazing 2 night stay! ,Me and my friend stayed at this hotel from New Year's Eve for 2 nights. We originally booked the London city suites but were offered this hotel as an upgrade on arrival and via whatsapp. We were offered transport to the hotel and on arrival were greeted by lovely hotel staff specially Gabby. We got macaroons while we were getting checked in. The room was lovely. Breakfast was awesome with lovely views from the top floor. Again this was complimentary. On the 1st we were given complimentary champagne truffles which were delicious! On the 2nd there was a little mix up with top floor not knowing that breakfast was extended to 11am. We went to Gabby in reception and she quickly sorted this out and spoke to the staff who had declined us breakfast. All in all what an amazing hotel and exceptionally professional hotel staff. It's all the little attention to detail that make a difference! ,5,2017,01,03
111,Absolute amazing. 5 star experience ,"On arrival we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and chocolates, we were then walked to our room by a member of staff who showed us how to use all the amenities. The room was amazing we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely, this gave us access to the club lounge which had complimentary drinks and canapés (unfortunately we forgot about this so didn't take advantage). The hotel room had heated flooring and an amazing shower! The TV had Sky!!! Including Sky movies! Which my partner was over the moon about! We then had macaroons and chocolates delivered to our room complimentary which was a lovely touch, then we had a lovely phone call to check we were settled in okay and if we required anything further. The service was incredible. The room was amazing I have absolutely no complaints. Thank you for the stay I have already started recommending this to everyone. 
Lastly, we did check out the rooftop bar as well which was a new thing, the drinks were very reasonably priced and the atmosphere was lovely. ",5,2017,01,03
111,"High standard, convenient location, good value","A family of older teenagers to grandparents had a great stay in this hotel.A high standard of finish, friendly staff, convenient location, good value between Christmas & New Year for a city break. Rooftop bar with great views, complimentary coffee in reception while waiting for group to congregate. Some issues with keys not working due to glitches in high level of technology.",5,2017,01,03
111,"Wonderful newly converted hotel, in excellent location on Finsbury Square, with fantastic rooftop bar/terrace","My family and I stayed in this amazing hotel just after Christmas 2016, and my only regret is that we didn't stay longer!  A converted office building, on the top corner of Finsbury Square in the heart of the City of London, this won't be a location which suits everyone, but if you want a slightly calmer London experience than the West End has to offer, with all the amenity, and an extremely accessible and yet quiet location, then this is the hotel for you!  With a fantastic rooftop bar/restaurant and terrace, a slightly ""quirky"" layout, and a very well-trained and hospitable staff, this newly-opened hotel was perfect for our one night family treat.  The experience started before we even arrived with a welcome email from Juliana, the Guest Experience Executive ensuring they had all the details needed to ensure a wonderful stay.  We will certainly be back!",5,2017,01,03
111,"Beautiful rooms, fantastic customer service","Myself and my partner stayed at the Montcalm on it's first week of opening, just before Christmas. 
When we first arrived (before checking in time), there was a very friendly and helpful concierge, along with lovely reception staff that looked after our bags whilst we went to enjoy our day, and on returning our bags were waiting in our room for us. Not only this, but my partner had asked if the hotel could make our stay extra special and they had gone above and beyond to ensure this for us!
They upgraded our room for free and waiting for us was a bottle of wine and some lovely fruit and macaroons, and the room was absolutely wonderful!
The mood lighting above the bed was both interesting and fantastic, and we had a really great time using the spa in the evening.
There are only two small things we would recommend, these being we only found one bathrobe in our room and that the continental breakfast was lovely but we would have liked some fresh fruit to be included.
All in all, a really beautiful hotel and exceptional staff!",5,2017,01,03
111,Professional and personal at the same time.,"We have arrived around midnight few days before the New Years Eve and stayed at the Montcalm Royal London House. Originally, we have booked Montcalm at the Brewery, but in the last minute (literally when we were about to take off to London!) I have received an e-mail that they have cancelled my booking! A tad irritated, I called booking.com and demanded a room, as we were to be airborn in a few minutes. They said they could provide a room at Montcalm RLH, Luxury Twin Room at the same price. We took it, and were not disappointed!

The room was HUGE, with a spacious bathroom, a kitchenette and a bed that I will not forget! Largest bed possible, with fluffiest covers. I did want to, in fact, ask at the reception, what bed/mattress it was, as it was heavenly! ;-)
The room was cleaned twice daily, with complimentary tea/coffee. Location of the hotel is more than perfect, with immediate prximity to Moorgate Underground, and numerous bus stops just outside the hotel. From the hotel, you can easily take a walk down to the Thames, to St. Paul's etc. There are two grocery stores, plus a Marks and Spencer in short distance.
All this made our stay more than pleasant. The staff was always there to advice, wish a nice day, and borrow an umbrella (which we needed at the last day at our stay). My ONLY regret is that we have not had a chance to try out the Roof Top Bar - but not for the lack of trying! It seemed that is was perpetually full-booked! Understandably, as there were New Year's Eve celebrations ahead. Also, there is a SPA in the lowest floor. Thanks for a nice stay!",5,2017,01,02
111,Gem!,"Beautiful modern five star hotel, great spot and fabulous staff and service. The rooftop bar is gorgeous. This place is a great find and outstanding value. I wish I was staying longer...Easy access to all the sights. Definitely book this one!",5,2017,01,02
111,"Pitch perfect, personalized experience.","Me and my girlfriend stayed in this brand new hotel for a romantic New Year's Eve, and it was absolutely amazing. From the bubbles in the lobby to the rose petals on the bed, Juliana and the Guest Experience Team made sure it was a pitch perfect, personalized experience. Oh and the spa is just too good, so don't go here if you want to see anything of the city, because you won't want to leave the hotel. 10/10, would definitely recommend and will most certainly stay here again soon!",5,2017,01,02
111,Stunning!,"Everything about this hotel was amazing, the food, staff, rooms, everything!

We arrived in London at 11 but were unable to check in to the hotel until 2 but they were happy to keep our luggage so we didn't have to carry it round London which was great.

When we got back to check in they had upgraded our room as it was my partners 21st new years day! The room was beautiful, so clean and modern!

They brought up some prosecco and cake which was lush to celebrate to new year and my partners birthday, I couldn't find a bad word to say about this hotel even if i tried!

Thanks to the staff for making our trip to London amazing!",5,2017,01,02
111,New hotel needs improvement,"We have booked 5 nights at this hotel for New Years and took a bet at the hotel quality knowing as it was relatively new and unproven. Although the location and facilities were good, the way operations run is closer to a three star establishment than a luxury hotel.

The best part of this hotel was its location. It's situated centrally and most tourist attractions are walking distance. You won't need to rent a car or Uber in and out - just walk to the subway station or in 15-20 minutes you're at St. Paul's Cathedral.

Hotel didn't go above average. I can count numerous incidents of how the reception was supposed to inform us of the (already approved) early check in but didn't call us, how we found half-full water bottles (wasn't ours!) in the bathroom after the cleaning service left the room, how room service just walked into our room without knocking because they think left their key in the room, or how a ""we will deliver it to your room in 10 minutes"" actually took over an hour. Though I'm OK with such incidents when I travel for work, it's a deal breaker for a couple on vacation.

Overall - hotel is well located with good rooms, but the way it is run makes it a no go for a second visit.",3,2016,12,31
111,Beautiful NEW Hotel in Finsbury Sqaure London - 5* Gem!,"The Montcalm Royal London House hotel is beautiful and we feel very fortunate to have stayed at this new London hotel.
Great location on Finsbury Square, close to St Paul's Cathedral and Barbarian Center.
The staff were happy and extremely helpful. 
Our room (418) was lovely, huge SMART TV and a really comfortable bed. Lovely bathroom fittings with underfloor heating.
We ate lunch in The Burdock, food was delicious and tasty.
A fantastic choice of food at Breakfast in the rooftop restaurant, views were amazing. Plenty of bars and comfortable seating area's.
The hotel also has a pool, spa and gym which is open until 11 pm, definitely a 5* hotel.",5,2016,12,30
111,exquisite experience,"Arrived on Christmas evening, due to this day , the restaurant was not open.  As compensation we got free access to the lounge and we got breakfast included during the whole stay.  This is super service. Very kind staff, the restarant on rooftop is very nice with a great view over the city.  Rooms are perfect, the intelligent light and heating system may be a bit complicated for elderly people. ",5,2016,12,30
111,Amazing staff and customer service.,"The amazing, helpful staff make this hotel.

The first night's sleep in room 412 was not good. The noise outside was very loud because of some fans.  I need to have some air when I sleep and this was not possible with the noise outside. 

Asked this morning to be moved, which was done immediately to room 406 which faced the square and was lovely.  When checking out the manager at the front desk and the main manager apologised about the first night. Such a lovely thing to do.  It is the wonderful staff that make this place a gem.

The shower in the room could be hotter. The beautiful pool is now open with but could do with more than only 2 sun loungers.

The cake and fruit we were left all tasted divine. The Waldorf salmon salad is like nothing I have ever tasted.

A lovely stay .",4,2016,12,29
111,Good for business trip,"When staying in London for a business trip this is one of the better places to be. It's location and service is nice, but its not cheap for sure. Enjoy the bar crew, they are nice and sweet. I love to walk around in that part of London, the hotel is in the middle of all.",4,2016,12,29
111,Truly a 5* hotel and service ,"This hotel exceeds the 5* rating it has. It is very clean and modern and still has the shiny new hotel look to it which I have every faith it always will have. The in room technology is very easy to use on the touch screen control panel. The bed is extremely comfortable as was the whole room. 
The best thing about this hotel is the staff as they are the ones who have made it exceed the 5* rating. From the doormen, porters, concierge they are all exceptional. All very immaculately dressed polite and do everything possible to make your stay a truly memorable and enjoyable experience. They are all a credit to this hotel. In my opinion this is by far the best hotel in London. Ideally located in central London yet it is not at all noisy. 
I must also add that the hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Nice little touches like that make it so much difference. ",5,2016,12,29
111,Great new hotel with the luxurious feel,"This new hotel has a great location, no more than five minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station and surrounded by key parts of the City there’s plenty of restaurants and bars within just a few moments walk. A welcoming entranceway was staffed continuously during the stay with a doorman who was as equally friendly as he was well dressed. First impressions count and this ensured they would always be great! Upon arrival on a Friday evening bags were instantly taken care of and greeted at the desk further down the hallway. Plenty of staff ensured there was no wait but there’s plenty of seating available should you want to take more time.

Check in was pretty painless and the option was given to be shown around the room. All the communal areas were spotlessly clean and well decorated; it was clear that the hotel was new. Our room, a standard offering, was on the seventh of nine floors. An impressive modern doorway revealed an equally contemporary room with all the features you’d expect of a five star hotel - coffee machine, slippers and gowns, digital safe, hairdryer etc. However beyond that it was nice for such a large TV to be provided, complete with external interfaces and Bluetooth connectivity for portable music devices. The aroma box was a nice touch and there were plenty of settings with the colourful mood lights, as well as night lights around the room and fully dimmable main lights. The air conditioning, do not disturb sign and bathroom light was all controlled by a touch screen in the hallway area. This also was supposed to activate the under floor heating in the bathroom although unfortunately didn’t appear to work and using the screen was also rather painful due to the lag it had.

The bathroom, like the main bedroom area was really spacious and modern. Unfortunately there was no bath, but the great size of the shower made up for it and the toiletries provided were high quality. There were plenty of large towels and all the amenities needed to make even a long stay very comfortable.

The bed was huge and really comfortable. Plugs on both side was a delight and there were plenty of additional cushions in the wardrobe. The view over the adjacent building wasn’t great but fortunately the room was nice enough to not realise, and the armchair and mini bar were nice enough to welcome you back to the room. The addition of some hot chocolate to the drinks options, rather than just tea and coffee, would be a real nice touch though!

The top floor of the hotel houses a wonderful roof top bar. On a Friday evening it was busy but fortunately there were enough bar staff to keep the queues down. The outdoor area was spacious with lots of seating and outdoor heaters, and the view towards the Shard was lovely. However it was a great shame that it seems to close early, and at 10pm we were asked to return inside as drinks aren’t allowed outside so late. For such a central hotel this was disappointing.

I can’t comment for the gym or pool facilities, nor any of the dining options in the hotel. Unfortunately I wasn’t there for long enough to sample them but I would happily return in the future to try them out. It was a brilliant room and being a new hotel meant it was great for everything to be clean and spotless, just a shame not all the functionality was as easy and seamless to use as intended. Typical Montcalm luxury though and I for sure would return in the future.",4,2016,12,28
111,Fab city stay! ,"Had an excellent night here with my husband. Spa and pool were very relaxing, staff in spa very helpful and attentive. Rooftop bar was incredible. Wide selection of drinks and delicious food. Room was good size and well equipped bathroom. Staff were very quick to assist us with the touch screen built in tablet to control the heating and lights! Only things missing were hair conditioner (very minor I know) and bigger cups for the tea and coffee machine would be appreciated (again very minor). All in all a wonderful stay and we'd definitely recommend and return! Thank you for a great stay Montcalm! ",5,2016,12,28
111,"Hotel lovely, a long way to go with the service!!","Currently staying at the Montcalm Royal London House hotel. Checked in for a short stay as a break between Christmas and New Year. The hotel itself is lovely, very modern with nice comfy beds and quite high tech rooms. The service however is shocking and needs a lot of work. At check in they got our room wrong twice and we had to wait for nearly an hour for it to be sorted. Breakfast is the worst breakfast I have ever experienced and I stay in hotels practically every day Monday-Friday with work. The room for breakfast is too small, the selection is terrible and the staff are hopeless. I am putting it down to teething problems for a relatively new hotel but it needs to be sorted quickly as the hotel will not get repeat custom. Enjoy the hotel as it is nice but Montcalm get the service sorted ASAP. ",3,2016,12,28
111,The Great Hotel Experience,"I've stayed in a few luxury hotels and this is one of those that I can rave about. From the courteous staff who would run a mile to get what suits you, the amenities that is just close to perfection, to the first rate service. I came from an intense and sprightly week before and having a good nights rest really helped. Thanks to the superb pillows and the mattress they have. It was just a heavenly experience. Definitely will recommend this hotel if you want comfort beyond style.",5,2016,12,26
111,My stay at montecalm,"montecalm, extremely pleased with my stay. everyone was very friendly and very helpful. They went out of their way to get me some antiperspirant and toothbrush . would defenately be returning with some1 special to share the experience.",5,2016,12,26

111,"Contemporary, high tech but grounded","This was not only our first experience of the new Finsbury Square hotel but also of the Montcalm brand also ,  having been very close to booking with your Marble Arch sister-hotel several times in the past.
I must say that we had a lovely, if short, stay. The rooms were very contemporary, with extremely modern tech features; the selection and design of bars was impressive for a modestly-sized hotel but the most striking thing was the welcome we received off a myriad of staff members (with accompanying champagne) on arrival.",5,2016,12,22
111,Haphazard service ,"Room is comfortable but the service is haphazard though. 

Laundry bag was missing on at least two occasions. Tea bags were not replenished once. Housekeeping came into my room once while I was still in the room. I was charged extra for chip for a cheese burger meal even though the menu indicates onion rings are included. I also got charged an additional GBP20 after I left the hotel - I'll need to sort this out with them. 

Gym is quite small. You will inevitably bump into fellow guests at the weights station. 

Location is near to the business district and Moorgate station. Uber from Heathrow Airport costs GBP38. ",3,2016,12,20
111,Wunderful stay,"Great experience at this great place! Really nice staff, great breakfast and nice rooms. Perfect for private and business trips.

Very new hotel in a good place. Great wellness and gym and modern stylish interieur.",5,2016,12,20
111,Fantastic weekend break,"Me and my boyfriend have just returned from 2 nights in this beautiful hotel! It is definitely 5*. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble for them. The rooms and facilities were modern, luxurious and relaxing. The roof top bar and spa were great added bonuses and we enjoyed these greatly. I will definitely stay at this hotel again on my return to London and have recommended it to family and friends. ",5,2016,12,20
111,Superb Hotel. Highly Recommended,We were absolutely delighted with the whole experience of staying at Montcalm Royal London House. From the moment we walked in the staff were excellent and incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and we slept brilliantly as the bed was so big and comfortable. We would highly recommend this hotel and we look forward to staying in it again in the near future. Thank you for everything.,5,2016,12,19
111,Beautiful brand new hotel close to the city.,"The hotel is less than six months old and is highly . Stayed there for three nights and was very impressed with the rooms and the bars. The rooftop bar has a spectacular view of the city and the Shard. The rooms are great; lots of electronics and lovely lighting. Very high end finishing in the bathrooms.

Service is very good, and although staff still finding their feet a little, they are good.",4,2016,12,19
111,Excellent hotel,"Although it was short, we loved our stay. We had an issue with the credit card but the staff was really quick, nice and helpful, it was solved immediately. If we come back to London, be assured that we would stay there again.",5,2016,12,19
111,excellent new hotel,"just a lovely 5 star hotel less than 5 mins walk from Moorgate Tube station in Finsbury Square so great location, very nice room, nice spa, nice bar nice everything really - I would recommend to any and all for business or pleasure",5,2016,12,19
111,Great modern hotel with great weekend prices,"I booked 3 rooms for a Saturday night, this is a 5 star hotel and we booked Montcalm club rooms which come with access to the club lounge with free beer, soft drinks and continental breakfast and all for not much more than we paid for a London Premier Inn a few months back. 
The hotel is in the financial district so no doubt cheaper at a weekend so just a few extra pounds on a taxi makes it a great deal.
The staff were all very good and we had no issues with key cards or the technology.
The only negatives I would say are that the wall tablets light the room up at night (we have no street lights where we live so are used to total blackness at night) our minibar was only half stocked, plus one of the 3 rooms seemed quite small so beware that the basic rooms must be quite small, so spend just a little more and get the bigger ones.
We are lunch in the rooftop bar, The Aviary and the food quality was really good.
I will stay there again especially while the prices are so cheap for this standard of hotel, I expect they will increase once it has been established a bit longer.",5,2016,12,19
111,First time 5* London,"It was definitely a jump up from the 4*hotels I've stayed in before. The staff couldn't do enough for you, and the hotel itself was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The room had endless gadgets including a scent machine, panel controls for the bathroom lights, underfloor heating, maid service, mood lighting etc. The TV was huge with Sky TV and on demand tv. Evening turndown service included, as was welcome fruit and water, and a lovely touch of petals on the bed (spelling 'Merry Christmas' which made us laugh). 
The only confusion was over the leisure facilities. Booking.com said the pool was opening in November 2016, but Montcalm website seemed to say Jan 2017 - so I didn't pack any swim clothes. I was in fact open, but we didn't get to use it.
Will pay more to stay here in the future.",5,2016,12,19
111,Great Customer Service,"My Hotel Montcalm Royal London stay was just right.  There was confusion regarding my reservation.  While the front desk looked for a resolution, we were served tea and chocolate cake.  My room was nicely decorated, the bed was comfortable, and the electronic touch pads for the lighting were easy to understand.  The breakfast and the drinks and hors d’oeuvres in the lounge were tasty and plentiful.  I did appreciate the hotel accommodating the evening happy hour on the 8th floor when the downstairs lounge was booked for a private party.  We had dinner one night in the upstairs restaurant.  The food was excellent.

The staff is the best part of the hotel.  Everyone was well trained, and very attentive.  Each person was more than ready to answer my questions, take care of any request, or just engage in conversation.  I truly felt that my well being was paramount to them.

I am glad that I stayed at the Hotel Montcalm.",5,2016,12,18
111,Perfect,"Couldn't put 1 fault on this hotel! The staff, the facilities, the room and the over all feel was impeccable. We were made to feel so welcome and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay. Without a doubt would return and recommend it to all!",5,2016,12,18
111,Great weekend,Great service and lovely modern and new hotel for a reasonable price. Nice little touches from the staff. Didn't try the pool due to time constraints but would love to next time. Good area and easy for underground. ,5,2016,12,18
111,Amazing ,"Stayed for one night with my two daughters. Could not have been looked after better. Goodies in the room for the girls and wine for me!!!
Make sure you bring your swimmies the spa is not to be missed. Can't wait to come back in the summer to make use of the rooftop bar.",5,2016,12,18
111,A charming new hotel with a remarkable rooftop View,"Only 5 minutes away from both Moorgate and Old street station, this hotel offers a unique night-stay whether you're on holiday or away from home for business. The staff were very attentive to our requirements and the size of the room was impressive.  The room had a large television with sky channels so we could watch a current film before bed. I was most impressed with the aesthetics of not just the room but the hotel in general which is simply superlative. We had dinner at the aviary on the 10th floor which was lovely and the view from the Rooftop is a must see. It's hard to believe that the Aviary has only been open a short while as it was full most of the night. All in all it was a memorable 5 star break and I look forward to returning.",5,2016,12,17
111,Great new hotel,"Stayed for one night and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the hotel is gorgeous and staff were so friendly and helpful, great atmosphere in the bar area and will definitely try the rooftop restaurant next time. Great location too.",5,2016,12,17
111,Aviary Bar at the Montcalm,"Had drinks in Aviary, the most amazing roof top bar last night.  Views of London spectacular.  Staff were exceptionally accommodating and a great time had by all
This is exactly what the City of London has been crying out for.  I can see that this is going to be a regular haunt",5,2016,12,15
111,Fabulous birthday trip,"My boyfriend booked the Montcalm for my 21st birthday trip for the two of us. When arriving at our room, we found rose petals on the bed, cake and a mini bottle of fizz complementary due to my birthday! I thought this was a great touch. The rooms were spacious and very modern. 
The bar on the top floor is great with an amazing view over London on the terrace. Inside the bar, the vibe is great and relaxed which is perfect for couples too. 
The staff are unbelievably welcoming and attentive. We were given complimentary drinks on 2 occasions whilst waiting for our room (as we arrived earlier than we said) and after checking out.
The only slight hick up we had was with the room's control panel (which controls the lights, heating, air con etc) as it kept freezing. But as soon as we told someone about this, it was seen to straight away.
Overall a perfect trip made very special by the Montcalm. Would definitely recommend the hotel! Definitely 5 star.
",5,2016,12,14
111,Wonderful 5+ star experience,"I felt very welcomed on arrival in this beautiful hotel right on Finsbury Square. Unfortunately I wasn't feeling very well on arrival and the staff were very sympathetic towards me. The girl who took me up to my room organised for hot water, lemon and honey to be brought up to my room within minutes of arriving in my room. This was just the best service I could have expected! And made me feel so much better... The following morning on check-out, the same staff were at reception who kindly asked me how I was feeling. The door man assisted me with my taxi. The rooms are very modern and equipped with all the luxury you'd expect. I highly recommend this hotel as the rate is very competitive for such a luxurious hotel in London. Easy to get to from City Airport and St Pancras International Station. Oh... and the bed is just awesome!!",5,2016,12,14
111,Amazing luxury hotel,"You can tell this is a new hotel because they do things differently. Imagine an environment with no pressure that is the Montcalm. That have the word 'calm' in their name. It is a super cool, super laid-back modern hotel with huge ambition. The rooms are excellent with big comfy beds and so many gadgets you want for nothing. The roof top bar and restaurant is amazing. Staff can't do enough for you. I spent the evening here with my wife and we had a great time and really felt at home. If you are a fan of detailed environments then check out the finishes as they are perfect. After just one night we love the Montcalm Royal London House and will return very soon. We often stay in the Savoy, Shard and others but this hotel has a unique vibe all of its own. Congratulations Montcalm on creating a real gem.",5,2016,12,13
111,"Super, modern hotel in a great location","My fiance and I stayed during a weekend in December to celebrate his Birthday.  The Montcalm asked if it was a special occasion, and on arriving into the room we found a small bottle of wine, a card and two enormous slices of red velvet cake with macarons.  The cake was superb and such a nice touch.  The room itself was modern with a fantastically comfortable bed, mood lighting and an enormous TV with access to all the Sky channels.  The bathroom again was clean and modern.  

We ate in the Aviary restaurant and had a lovely meal - there was a great atmosphere due to lots of Christmas parties and couples out for drinks.  We didn't venture onto the roof terrace due to the rain, but it looked to have excellent views.  The food was great - can highly recommend the pulled beef which was incredible - and the desserts too were excellent.  

The continental breakfast was a little simple but did the job, and the breakfast room was laid out very nicely.  Overall a great hotel and would highly recommend to others looking for a bit of luxury during their stay in London.",5,2016,12,13
111,"Nice hotel, needs to pick up the service points for truly 5 star","The Montcalm is a very pretty hotel through and through, comfy but trendy downstairs bar and the roof bar and terrace is spectacular, even in the freezing cold. However, they do have to pick up on small service points to get full marks as a 5 star hotel. The points below are small niggles and I will stay at the Montcalme again, it is conveniently located with good tube links from Moorgate not far away and plenty of convenient shops and restaurants nearby. However, it cannot advertise itself as a luxury 5 star hotel and get simple points like this incorrect: 

There was miscommunication on arrival, I was on a pre-paid rate but the receptionist then asks me to pay. Apparently no payment was taken originally and I was asked to pay again.  To be clear they did not charge me twice but had in fact never taken the original payment. This is just poor communication and disconcerting for the guest. 

In the roof terrace, two nights in a row, I could not suss out if there was any table service of any kind, (only restaurant service) and had to sit at the bar to order direct with the barman to get anything to drink. For 5 star, you need to do table service. 

I stayed two nights and on return to my room after a long day out on the second day, the Nespresso pods had not been refilled nor my dirty mug from the morning taken away. I think they had not even checked it at all. This is simple housekeeping checklist stuff. 

On both nights I stayed, on the 9th floor, I was woken in the early hours by the loud sound of furniture being moved. I assumed this was furniture on the roof terrace being moved around for whatever reason, tidying or closing up. On checking out, the night manager said I should have rung down to let them know and I agree I should have done that. On the second night this lasted nearly 30 minutes. 

I agree with other reviewers that the key cards are very difficult to work, it takes a lot of tries waving it around in different directions in front of the sensor pad to get into your room. At least twice, I thought I wasn't going to get in at all it took so long to make it work. 

Spa treatments were still not available when I stayed on the first weekend in December despite having advertised a ""mid-November"" opening on the website for months. It was one of the attractions of booking this hotel so that was disappointing. Maybe next time but if the hotel is still experiencing service niggles probably the spa will need time to bed down as well. 

Positive points: Bed was very large and comfy, bathroom shower was also large rain shower, strong flow with good hot water. All staff in person were very friendly and attentive.",4,2016,12,12
111,Wonderful hotel with rooftop views,"We had a fabulous stay here and we were very pleased with the service along with the customer care given in making us feel valued. We were able to check in early to our room as requested which was appreciated due to needing to change for attending a wedding in the afternoon. This made our stay more personal to us and the hotel staff came across as caring to our requirements. Lovely spa facilities whilst staying too which was very much needed & enjoyed in the morning! Would recommend to anyone visiting the area and we hope to stay again in the future.
",5,2016,12,12
111,"A pleasant, modern, easy place to stay","The Montcalm Hotel is a prize. A hotel to come back to. Modern design combined with personal attention. Everything is of high quality - the room, the bed, the bathroom. And the rooftop Lounge Bar-Restaurant would be one of my favourite places if I lived in London. I will come back.",5,2016,12,12
111,Excellent hotel in the City!,"So we spent a week in London and stayed at several places, in part because our meetings were in different parts of London.  We chose the Montcalm Royal for the weekend because it offered much better value than anything in the more touristy areas.  It turned out to be a fantastic decision - at under half the price of our (unnamed) Knightsbridge hotel, it was 10 times better.  Brand new rooms, very modern, excellent service, the most comfortable beds, a great rooftop bar with good views of the City skyline...the list goes on.  Getting around is fairly easy since its walking distance to both Liverpool Street and Moorgate stations but if you're planning to be spending your time on Oxford Street or the West End then this is not the most convenient.  I imagine the price we paid (GBP130 per night) was an introductory offer since this is a new hotel (opened Oct 2016) and will soon rise...but even at GBP200 I'd still stay here again.",5,2016,12,12
111,Wedding Anniversary,"Stayed in a club room for two nights and absolutely excellent, the staff could not do enough for you they were all excellent. We had wine and cake in the room offered free of charge to celebrate our wedding anniversary The hotel has just recently opened but we both had no issues. Its 10 mins walk from Moorgate tube but we walked down to the Thames both days and it took about 25 to 30 mins. Used the indoor pool, steam room and sauna and as we were in a club room there is a free club room bar and canapés each evening that more than makes up for the additional price of the room. A very nice bar on the 10th floor overlooking London but unfortunately at 10:00 PM each evening you are restricted from going outside as some of the ""local"" neighbours have complained about the music which to be honest was not a problem. London can be very expensive for hotels but we both felt the Montcalm offered very good value in comparison to other hotels I have stayed at and we will return. The only reason for a 4 on the room was there was not a bath just a very good shower.",5,2016,12,12
111,Fantastic Festive London Weekender,"My husband and I stayed one night at the Montcalm on the 3rd of December and were very impressed. 
The hotel is located within easy walking distance of Liverpool Street Station and underground stations and we felt very welcome the moment we walked in.
We arrived a little early to check into our room and enjoyed a coffee in the bar area whilst we waited, which was nice as it gave us a chance to chill out, relax and plan our day before we headed out into the festive madness at Winter Wonderland!! 
The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and had a lovely atmosphere. We didn't eat at the hotel or use the spa but we did take advantage of the rooftop terrace for a late night coffee and I can imagine it will be a perfect place to chill out in the summer. 
The hotel room was very plush and a good size and the bed was so comfortable and we would have had a perfect night's sleep if the fire alarm hadn't gone off at 4am (apparently caused by a hotel guest lighting up a cigarette in their room - grrr!). It went off just briefly but there was no doubt that it worked! 
As many reviews have already mentioned the room is packed with nice touches and technology to control the lights, etc. The Hermes toiletries were great and even the hairdryer had its own plush velvet bag! We didn't take up the offer at check in to be shown to our room and kind of wish we had even just to get some instructions on how to use certain gadgets - although we did locate the source we never did work out how to change the aroma in the room! 
That being said we very much look forward to having the chance to try again - Montcalm Royal London House we will be back one day! ",5,2016,12,12
111,Birthday Stay,"Brilliant new hotel! I took my partner here for the night for her birthday, she loved it and so did i! Brilliant location and so many places nearby for food and drink!

Staff are so helpful and even decorated our room for my partners birthday. Rose petals, 2 big slices of cake and a small bottle of prosseco were put in our room.

So what if this place has a few problems! It is new after all! It doesnt have that severe of problems thats worthy of a ruined stay.

Will def be staying here again!

Thank you for a great stay.

",5,2016,12,11
111,Excellent ,"
The hotel is on Finsbury Square, away from the main road, and so a short walk from Old Street and Moorgate underground stations. 

It is clearly fairly new and so still in great condition. The bedroom was just big enough and as well as the usual (safe, mini bar, desk, AC etc) had a huge TV, with what appeared to be the full range of terrestrial and satellite channels, and an array of lighting options, including a mood light. 

The bathroom was spacious, equipped with Elemis toiletries and the shower (choice of rainforest and hose sprays) big enough for two. 

Nice ground floor bar (I didn't make it to the rooftop bar) with excellent range of spirits. The breakfast buffet, although not the most extensive I've ever seen, was very good and would satisfy most tastes. ",5,2016,12,11
111,Very Impressed,"Having stayed at a number of hotels in this area and nearby, this is by far the best one I have seen so far. Great room, staff and superb rooftop bar and restaurant. Will be staying there again without a doubt!",5,2016,12,08
111,High Class,"Lovely and luxurious hotel.
Very comfy bed and a delightful bathroom.
Only 5 minutes walk from Moorgate undeground station.
Quiet surroundings, at least during the night, so I slept like a prince.
Thank you for a wonderful weekend.",5,2016,12,07
111,A stylish new addition to the Montcalm Family ,"We had a very enjoyable one night stay at this newly opened hotel. We arrived a little ahead of check in time and as our room wasn't quite ready we passed an enjoyable hour away in the Burdock bar. Front desk service was friendly and efficient and when we finally checked in , we were presented with a complimentary glass of fizz before being taken to our room for a quick run through the high tech controls for lighting etc. Spacious bathroom and shower with some very nice toiletries etc. We had a very comfortable night's sleep before heading off the next day. We used the Finsbury Square NCP car park which is very handy and secure - it cost £49 for a 24 hour stay. 
We've stayed at one of the sister hotels ; Montcalm at the Brewery which isn't far from this hotel and we weren't disappointed ... and would definitely stay here again. Look forward to being able to try out the roof top bar which wasn't open at the time of our visit as it wasn't due to open until early December. ",5,2016,12,07
111,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here as a group of 5 ladies in 3 rooms.  The hotel couldn't have been better, from the great service as soon as the door is opened for you at the entrance to the hotel right through to the amazing rooms with so many extra features than other hotels.  All the staff are so polite and helpful.  We enjoyed our stay so much we are thinking of returning in the new year.",5,2016,12,07
111,Complicated,"Booked a room at the Montcalm at the Brewery. Was ""upgraded"" to the Montcalm Royal House. Paid for the night at the former then walked to the latter then 10-mute second check-in. In-room dining required a second visit for a credit card that did not work, so third visit. Then drink at the rooftop bar that could not charge to room. In short, how to make it as difficult as possible to ensure that I won't stay again...",2,2016,12,06
111,High expectations exceeded,"We had a perfect stay that went all too quickly. The room, staff, spa facilities, club lounge and bars were all superb.  The panoramic view from the rooftop bar at night overlooking the city is stunning. 

It was a special occasion and the cake, wine and hand-written card supplied by the hotel to commemorate our stay was a wonderful gesture.

A few teething troubles with leisure facilities, but we expected that given everything has just opened.

This really is a fantastic place and great value for luxury accommodation. Thoroughly recommended. Congratulations to all involved and thanks to the hard working staff.",5,2016,12,06
111,Excellent brand new facilities and great service with minor errors,"Brand new facilities, very nice rooms, excellent pool & fitness & outstanding roof terrace with bar and a magnificent view of London.

We booked a family suite with two adjacent rooms including lounge access and english breakfast. A lot of nice service included ! The staff was very helpful and serviceminded. Great Value for money !

There were minor errors in these very new locations, however, they were corrected very fast and apologized by the staff !

",5,2016,12,05
111,Excellent new hotel at Finsbury square,There are not too many good hotels in the Barbican/Liverpool street area. The Montcalm Royal is certainly the best in price/performance. My colleagues and I like the pub very much and know the barmen already very well.  Staff is very friendly and always helpful. we will return.,5,2016,12,05
111,Really nice hotel,"Thanks was a great stay and lovely hotel

Really nice staff, amazing breakfast in bed

Lovely bar on floor 10 and cool views around London

Guy on the front door was really friendly

Would definitely go back again",5,2016,12,05
111,night in london,"lovely hotel, excellent service. staff very attentive, nothing too much of a problem. room very clean, only dislike was bed too soft but that's just a personal choice. overall would definitely go back again.",4,2016,12,04
111,Lovely time,The hotel staff was marvelous- attentive and helpful. The accommodations were so comfortable I didn't want to go home! Made my business trip that much easier on me. There is wifi and a restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Good location too.,5,2016,12,04
111,"Wonderful Hotel Despite A Few ""Beginner's Slips""","A very nice hotel with a tasteful decor from the brewery inspired, modern front pub area to the creative interpretation of a luxury hotel in the actual hotel. 
The staff is helpful, charming and always smiling.
The hotel offers a good breakfast menu and a delicious lunch menu, although one could have hoped for a selection of organic dishes, or at least that the majority of ingredients and produce had been organic.
The hotel had just opened and was clean and -obviously-well maintained. However, we did experience a few minor technical ""slips"". 
The fire alarm went off twice during our stay, apparently for no reason, when we first got there and once at 4 am causing me to wake up with a shock. 
Also, the key cards didn't work properly. I had to go the reception to have it reread once but two of my friends had to go down daily to get new cards.
I consider these incidents beginner's slips and therefore recommend this place for a pleasant stay. 
Please be aware though that it is not located downtown London but you have several tube stations located only a five minute walk from the hotel. ",4,2016,12,04
111,Highly recommended ,"Lovely hotel, recently refurbished to an extremely high standard. The rooms are excellent with large screen TV (all Sky channels available) and hi-tech touch screen room control panel (which might not suit everyone).
The rooftop bar is also just opened and allows great views including a partial view of the Gerkin tower.
The staff were friendly and attentive.
The location is great if you want to be just outside the central tourist area but with Moorgate tube station only a 5 minute walk past Finsbury Square, it is easy to reach anywhere in the city.
All in all, for our weekend break, there were no complaints.",5,2016,12,04
111,Just Perfect in every way,"Stayed here for the night and I cannot complain about one thing! (And I am a very picky about hotels). We checked in an were asked what had brought us to London. After advising them this was a trip for my 30th birthday they upgraded us to a superior room. The hotel is beautiful, the room very big, and the bed is huge! Very large TV in rooms with full sky package, free wi fi, and lots of gadgets in the room too. Beautiful bathroom with double shower, expensive toiletries, and robe and slippers. This hotel is very luxurious and the staff cannot do enough for you, the customer service is fab! I had forgotten my hairbrush so called up reception to see if they could help me, and less than 5 minutes later there was a knock at the room door and as if by magic I was provided with a hotel branded large comb in a box. Cannot say anything bad about this place, defiantly a 5 star hotel and worth the price. Will definitely be returning. ",5,2016,12,04
111,Excellent new hotel,"I loved the space and the design of the bedroom, all the hi-tech stuff (electronic control of lights, underfloor heating, choose your own room scent etc) and the particularly good quality cotton bed-wear.
The breakfast was also excellent – very good quality produce and a great choice. It is exceptionally rare to get scrambled eggs at breakfast that are not overcooked – the eggs I had for breakfast were still creamy and moist.",5,2016,12,02
111,A very good hotel with great customer service,"My partner and I stayed there for two nights in November. I was impressed with the customer service, even before arriving to the hotel. A welcome card, together with a bottle of wine and box of chocolate was waiting for us in the room.
The hotel is still under renovation, so there are few things that need an improvement e.g. our doors were not locking up. They need to work on some ""finishing touches"" too, such as more towels in the bathroom, and replace complimentary bottled water every day (because that is what I expect from a 5* hotel). Overall, we had a great time and we will definitely stay there again. Location couldn't be better.",4,2016,12,01
111,"Lovely hotel, excellent service.","Just opened, so still very shiny and a few bits of work in progress you need to overlook.  Rooms a good size, well laid out.  They thought about the fittings - plugs by the mirrors so you can plug in a hairdryer; coathangers that assume you will not steal so you can get them out of the wardrobe; great showers and quick heat up; and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was lovely.
Staff excellent - very attentive and helpful.  
Really liked it - would definitely stay again.",5,2016,11,30
111,Good Hotel!,"Stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend. The hotel and our room were immaculate, the staff were very polite and always around if you had any questions. Good hotel but probably a 4 star rather than a 5. 

The air con didn't seem to be very cold at all and our room was very warm for all of our stay. The rooftop bar which was due to open mid November still hadn't opened the very last weekend of November and was one of the reasons I booked the hotel in the first place. The bathroom underfloor heating didn't work either.

Would I stay here again? Yes - I'd just expect a little less.",4,2016,11,29
111,REALLLLY HAPPY,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my Boyfriend for his birthday. Before I even got there I got a personal email from the hotel team asking me if there was a special occasion and them informing me that unfortunately the spa facilities were not available for my stay as it was a new hotel. Whilst I wasn’t happy about the spa the hotel suggested that we can use the sister hotels spa facilities and that they would arrange my transportation as I wasn’t happy to walk after relaxing. The lady was very accommodating (and I do tend to be high maintenance). When I arrived to the room we had plenty of surprises, the staff had placed rose petals on the bed spelling ‘Happy Birthday’ and also put 2 huge slices of cake on the table which looked very nice with strawberries. I didn’t request any of this but it literally was a fabulous complimentary gesture. They even went to the detail of using heart shaped confetti to help make the room look more personal to the occasion. The lady then asked me if we drink and then one I confirmed, she also provided a bottle and 2 glasses. Again, this was not requested, just brilliant service! The rooms are very modern, and use technology for small things like ‘the do not disturb sign’ which is literally a button inside the room which is displayed outside to hotel staff. They have underfloor heating in the bathroom and brilliant lighting. The room I booked also had ELEMIS essentials which I was very happy about. Generally I would say this is a lovely hotel, but the staff and the service made it worth it. VERY happy with my stay and would recommend it to everyone.",5,2016,11,29
111,Not quite got its act together yet,"Only recently opened and still not fully functional. Roof top bar and restaurant not yet open (told it opens this week). Nice internal décor and high tec specification but should have spent some of the money on things that actually matter like a good nights sleep. Some of the rooms (10 -15?) overlook an internal atrium full of air con and large generator which give off an audible hum in the rooms - maybe some of the money should have been spent on upgrading the glazing. Fair play to the hotel we were immediately moved to a room facing the square although this had an adjoining door which again had not been acoustically rated so you could hear even the quietest conversation from the next room let alone the TV and the late night after party - luckily had the ear plugs. We stayed as part of a very large group attending Xmas function close by. Big disappointment for lots of people as the bar shut at midnight - so can't claim 5*'s yet (almost a riot but fortunately local knowledge came into play and the Queen of Hoxton's takings increased dramatically ). Breakfast was chaotic to say the least as currently served in the small coffee shop/lounge and bar in the hotel entrance foyer. Staff had no idea how to manage the waiting clientele and people were getting parked at he bar and then forgotten about. On the plus side staff were helpful and polite, hotel is located conveniently for the City and I'm sure once the hotel and staff are bedded in then it will become a nice convenient place to stay.",3,2016,11,28
111,Not quite there yet- a shame!,"We booked a long weekend away in the city originally in the Suites with a kitchenette in the Brewrey (London City Suites by Montcalm) but on check in were informed that we had been upgraded to the 'new hotel' a 5 minute walk away. The upgrade wasn't to an apartment style suite, but a hotel room.
On arrival the staff were very helpful and we were shown all of the gadgets in the room which are controlled by a fixed screen iPad like device on the wall. We later discovered that the heated floor doesn't work in the bathroom and the AC seemed to control its self. A very comfy bed and large bathroom with nice toiletries. The first morning's breakfast which was a Sunday was absolute chaos. We were there at 9:30, peak-time.There was clearly no organisation and having waited for 20 minutes and seeing at least three couples get taken to a table first when they arrived after us, we had clearly been forgotten about. So, hacked-off, we decided to leave and eat out instead. Having returned from a long day out in the city at around 5pm the room hadn't been made up (despite activating the 'service room' button on the iPad), we had to therefore call down for coffee and tea etc. The staff are very helpful, and promptly provided more coffee and tea and did offer to make-up the room immediately. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. Hopefully these few minor points can be addressed to ensure a luxurious stay in a good location, but they need some kind of queue-ing system for providing breakfast!",4,2016,11,27
111,Ok hotel with teething probs and far from 5 star,"A new hotel that has a lot of teething problems. 

Firstly, getting into the room using the key cards was almost impossible - they failed numerous times. The high tech gizmos to control the lighting and aircon are all very good if they work properly. Heating came on for just a few minutes before switching itself over to cooling. The room suffered a lot from outside traffic noise.  

On the plus side the staff were friendly a very welcoming. The overall room experience was ok. 

A good start but a long way to go before the teething problems are resolved.",3,2016,11,27
111,Amazing Hotel,"Great experience at this hotel, it is clean and modern with very friendly attentive staff. Rooms have great lighting choices which along with the heating and cooling is controlled via a touchscreen. Hotel is immaculate throughout, has great facilities and is conveniently located for public transport.",5,2016,11,27
111,Luxury hotel ,This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very sleek with nice feature . The nespresso coffee machine was a nice touch. The club lounge had a good choice of drinks and was fairly quiet for a Saturday. All in all a nice place. ,4,2016,11,27
111,"Noisy room, terrible night's sleep","It's pretty much like the other Montcalms, rooms are almost identical to the Tech city, pointless amount of technical - especially the bathroom light switch, which, for some reason, is a virtual switch on a kind of iPad fastened to the wall outside the bathroom (about where any sensible person would have put a light switch).

After figuring out finally how to turn off the air conditioning there was still a loud buzzing noise which after phoning reception and getting a promise it would be switched off then it continuing and finally finding out it wasn't the airco but a fresh air pump, because the windows are sealed. Got some earplugs, but they didn't help much. 

A couple of other niggles: If you come in at night you have to run the cancer gauntlet of smokers right outside the main entrance, the greasy spoon van right outside doesn't help either with taxi drivers and bus drivers having a smoke and a brew too.

Given that they've gone for high tech, it's bizarre that they can't seem to have one button for two adjacent lifts - almost every building with two lifts  has them wired up so the nearest one will come to you.

I'm sure the spa will be lovely when it's finished, but despite being advertised as ready it wasn't yet open, so you have to get a taxi to the Old St Montcalm which is lovely, good sized, well equipped gym and beautiful pool and hot steam room and sauna. 

The breakfast was good, decent sausages and bacon, yoghurts and fruit and nuts, and a reasonable selection of toasty stuff. Coffee was terrible though, weak and bitter.",3,2016,11,25
111,Great experience,"Firstly I must say I loved the place, the allocation and the room.
When I arrived I was a bit worried since there was some kind of party o celebratiin and thought it would be a long noisy night, but no noise...incredible.
It took me a while to get connected to the rooms service, but I was served quickly.
The technology in the room is much appreciated.
Just 3 things to improve from my mind:
-Water tap with noise (I guess it is for water saving, but I dont like it).
-Include ear buds for cleaning.
-There is a little bit of noise from the HVAC system, even when its off.

Globally, I'll be back soon. I like it. 9/10.

111,Good Quality Hotel,"I stayed at the hotel for one night and it was very comfortable, rooms were excellent size, bar area was busy and a great atmosphere with the shuffle board activity. The location is brilliant, short walk from Moorgate Tube station. Will definitely stay again",5,2016,11,25
111,"Lovely hotel, fantastic service","I visited the Montcalm 2 weeks after it had opened. The hotel itself was lovely, modern, and spacious. The people all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful, which was especially noticeable when a few things went slightly wrong with the room and the lights (teething problems for a new hotel). 

The manager Remus and all the staff were so helpful and kind that I had no hesitation in booking again - and when I returned I was treated like royalty.

Thanks to everyone at Montcalm for making it such a pleasure to stay at your hotel.",5,2016,11,25
111,Could be the most amazing hotel once they sort out the teething problems,"My husband booked me a night in this hotel for my birthday. The check in was very smooth and the receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our room as on 5th floor and i was really nice room, the room was very good size, super clean, had all the extras you can think of: free water, nice teas and coffees , biscuits, nice fruit platter, Hermes washing products, a mobile phone etc. The bed was was massive and very comfortable. the room was actually perfect everything you can expect from 5 star hotel. As it was my birthday by husband had emailed guest relation team and they sent back an email saying that they will send some special birthday amenities to our room. This did not happen and there was no mention of my of my birthday whatsoever. Slightly disappointing as they promised to do that.  We had a slight problem with getting into our room, they key card only work if you hold it certain way and i always struggled to get into the room. In the morning none of our lights weren`t coming on so they set someone up to reset the electricity system and then they started working. The breakfasts was really tasty and nice but it was a bit disorganised, no one advised how the breakfasts works, is it only buffet or we can also order from a la carte menu. The buffet was small but very tasty. I later saw that some people ordered omelets and other things that i would have love to have but no one advised us. Also i didn't see any juices and when i asked for one, i was brought this tiny very small glass of orange juice and  no one topped it up , tried to get their attention to ask where are all juices but it was impossible to get someones attention so i left very thirsty. I really like the hotel and the rooms were fantastic, if they could sort out their miscommunication issues i will definitely stay again.",4,2016,11,21
111,An amazing stay made even more special,"The room was very nice with some nice touches such as a touchscreen to control lights/temperature (although not sure if a button would have just been easier).

With Montcalm being our hotel of choice in London we were keen to give this new hotel a try. Everything was really nice and modern and as clean as you would expect a high end hotel to be.

The staff were very supportive with it being a special occasion for me and my girlfriend and made sure our stay was very special.

The only downside I would say is that the breakfast was a little lacking for a top end hotel and with only cold food options we did have to eat elsewhere after checking out.

All in all, a well recommended hotel and another great Montcalm!",5,2016,11,20
111,Great location; disorganized but friendly; nice rooms,"From check in to the 3 times I had to replace the card key and more, this is not run as well as the Montcalm Marble Arch location (recommended) although there's no shortage of staff.  Breakfast was good (except the overly salty eggs).  Rooms are very good with great features...the lighting controls were a bit gimmicky.  Decent bar.  Would go back to give them second chance.",3,2016,11,20
111,Great new luxury hotel,"Hotel just opened.  Stayed for work.  Great new luxury hotel in the area. 
Comfortable bed and knows how to cater to both business and tourists. Hope they can keep it that way.  Have seen other hotel in the area start off catering to business  and then turning into loud party hotel. Balance will be important moving forward.
Rooms are spacious (bathrooms in standards are a little small and odd placement of toilet behind the door but all liveable for a short stay!)
Overall great experience and great staff.",5,2016,11,20
111,Misunderstood luxury?,"This hotel was a strange experience. The struggle to meet the misunderstood ""expectiations"" of a luxury hotel using deprecated standards not relevant for 2016.  

When on business travel: Sleep quality is important! This hotel managed to destroy this by littering the room with unessacary technical devices in the room.

The worst thing: The room had some kind of ""stinking device"" with perfume pellets and a fan. At first sight this looked like a radio. The smell was overwhelming when entering the room. Smelling like an old lady's perfume. During the night the fan started several times times waking me up and filled the room with a near womit experience smell. I unplugged the device in the morning and left a note about the stinking smell. When i got back - the device was plugged back in providing me with ""fresh"" air once more....

In addition some kind of smartphone-looking device called ""handy"" was located near the bed. The device was claiming to be a ""free travel companion"". The not-so-handy thing about it was that the alarm was set on 06:00 waking me up again....

Other strange stuff:
- Even though the bathroom was large and nice, the toilet was placed so close to the sink that i had to sit sideways not to bump me knees in it. 
- Lots of soap provided - no toothpaste (not unique for this hotel - but why this priority?)
- Fancy shower - but very low water pressure. 
- No gym or pool

Otherwise. New hotel and fresh location. Very nice bed. Classical english breakfast. Helpful employees.",2,2016,11,17
111,Excellent Stay,I had a lovely stay at The Montcalm Royal London House and look forward to staying with The Royal London House the next time I visit London. My colleagues and I travel to London quite often and I plan on personally recommending it for their next trip to London.,5,2016,11,17
111,Excellent Hotel,"My partner and I stayed during the 'soft opening' of the hotel. The room was excellent and included a comfy bed, mood lighting, a huge TV with most channels including sports and movies. We had lunch in the restaurant area, which we also enjoyed. I recommend the berry health shake as it was delicious. 

The decor of the hotel was modern and tasteful and the staff were very welcoming and friendly - always providing a smile when walking past. I'd definitely stay here again and wish the hotel luck with its official opening.",5,2016,11,17
111,Short but very pleasant stay,I only stayed for one night but wasn't missing one single thing. Staff very friendly and helpful and the room was very nice furnished and had a lot of little extras I personally like: Nespresso coffee machine (with sufficient capsules!!) and the bath accessoires are high quality. Will be back for my next stop over in London.,5,2016,11,17
111,New hotel! ,"Great new hotel in the heart of the city, so a great location for everything and only a couple of stops from London Bridge! Friendly welcome and that new hotel smell.   We were upgraded to a club room which was nicely decorated and full of the amenities you'd expect from a central hotel. Great bathroom and products and lovely room! If I had to complain it would be the dust in the room but I'm guessing this is from the recent renovation and the zip and link bed we slept in made you roll towards the middle where it met. Ideally a thicker mattress topper would solve this. Didn't try the bar or restaurant but looked a great concept. ",4,2016,11,15
111,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here twice in 3 days. The hotel is in a soft opening phase. The rooftop restaurant isn't available and the spa has yet to open.

But as a hotel it ticks all the boxes.

The Montcalm Group really get there staff to work hard at delighting customers and it shows in a perfect attitude towards guests.

The rooms are nice. Big beds. Lovely linen. Lovely bathrooms with fantastic showers.

If you get the chance book a Club Room and enjoy the Club lounge service. On Saturday this include unlimited Prosecco which was a really good touch.

",4,2016,11,14
111,Excellent hotel,"We had a lovely two night stay. Welcomed with a bowl of fruit and chocolates and the lady in charge of housekeeping telling us she wasn't happy that the room was prepared  to her standards. She apologised profusely and when we returned later the room was perfect and we had been left a complimentary bottle  of wine!
Great view of the Shard from our window, convenient location, very good shower, loved the choice of mood lighting! Xx",5,2016,11,14
111,Exceptional stay.,"I was more than pleasently suprised by the finish of this hotel upon arrival. Everything was finihsed to an aexceptionally high standard for what I deemed a reasonable cost. The Service was also very good, they really couldnt do enough for me. I would certainly recommend to anyone traveling to London or wanting somewhere with an impressive edge.",5,2016,11,14
111,Better by far than other well known 5 star Hotels in London,"Beautiful Hotel, really nicely decorated. Rooms were of a very high standard, beds and bedding were very comfortable. Rain showers in the bathroom were amazing, and the view from the 7th floor overlooking Finsbury Square and beyond was wonderful. The best thing about this Hotel though was the staff. Polite, friendly, extremely helpful and even remembered me by name. I was allocated a different room type to what I had booked on check in, but it was sorted (with an upgrade) within an hour, and I was given complimentary prosecco while I waited. After staying in two other 5 star Hotels on the Hyde Park side of London this year I would choose to stay here again in a heartbeat. ",5,2016,11,13
111,A promising start,"I stayed here in October 2016, a week or so after it opened.  My room was nice, reasonably spacious with a very comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom with underfloor heating.  I was particularly pleased to be able to get a bathroom with a bath, which I understand doesn't come as standard with all the rooms.  Because the hotel was so new there were a couple of things missing (ie, information about hotel, etc), but nothing that was a particular problem.  It was good to be able to use the executive lounge to grab a quick breakfast, and frankly it was much more plentiful than i had expected it to be.  Staff were all friendly and helpful.  All in all I'd certainly stay here again.",4,2016,11,13
111,"Stains on towel, smell, freezing, no robe, no gym, no info, miscues, etc... No thanks","I stayed here for two nights for business. I have no desire to stay here again. Not 5*.

By accident, I went to the a nearby Montcalm (brewery) thinking that I was booked In there. While it is absolutely my fault that I was at the wrong Montcalm and didn't have my booking number handy, it would have been 5* star service to let me know that perhaps I was staying down the road at the other Montcalm instead of saying that there was no reservation and perhaps I was at the wrong hotel... Even after I said that I was quite sure I was staying at a Montcalm in this area. If I was the receptionist, I would have put two and two together and called the other Montcalm, provided the guest's details, confirmed that this was the case and sent me on my way.

Upon checking in at the right Montcalm, I was taken to and given keys to someone's else's room. There was an unpleasant sewer smell coming from the bathroom and I was just about to call down to reception to ask about it when I received a phone call that I had been taken to someone else's room by accident and staff would be coming up shortly to collect me and take me to the right room.

Once in my right room... there was no robe, there was a stain on one of my bath towels (the hotel is supposed to be new?), my room was quite cold/would not heat up even using 26 degrees on the control panel, the underfloor heating was quite weak in the bathroom/almost no point in having it on, the vanity kit had very low quality cotton buds, etc., the hotel book had no information about the hotel and its services in it/just things about the area, there was no gym (can arrange complimentary taxi to sister hotel but highly inconvenient), the phone didn't appear to work... I couldn't wait to check out. The reception staff were fine but not 5* quality and the doormen seemed uninterested half the time. 

Room size is ok, location is ok, stairway still being painted, bar area seemed nice but the location of the breakfast area right near the front door makes it a bit of a train station upon entry. Appreciated that the check out process was swift.

Management left me some truffles to apologize for some of the inconvenience which I returned as this wasn't helpful/the right response and to be fair I didn't tell them about all of the issues/how much I wasn't enjoying my stay because I was just focused on moving on/my very busy schedule. As I was waiting for my taxi (no one asked if I needed transport/I had to prompt), the manager came up and asked about my stay and that is when I quickly mentioned most of the above. The manager mentioned my next visit but unfortunately I had to inform him that in my case there wouldn't be a next visit.

Needs a lot of improvement in my view.",2,2016,11,12
111,Lovely London hotel with good size rooms,"I stay in London a lot and often cannot believe what hotels get away with. I was going to stay at the holiday inn express in old st for 171pn but got this for just under 250. I was supposed to be at Montcalm brewery but got bumped to this one as they were full. Bit annoying but was very happy here.

It had just opened when I stayed so quite a few teething problems. Lifts slow, room not made up, music from bar playing into night but staff sorted all this out quickly and politely.

Room nice size, nice bathroom and bath.

Bar downstairs nice. Didn't go to the standard breakfast place as there was a bit of a mixup but the one by the front door was delicious.

Rack rate is about 450 which is well above my price range but definitely worth staying if you can get a good price ",4,2016,11,11
111,Excellent staff!,"Fantastic hotel in great location. Staff are definitely an asset in this hotel. Well trained and professional, courteous and genuinely friendly. Makes such a difference and a great first impression.Breakfast staff are lovely. I think this hotel will go from strength to strength. Got everything right so far.",5,2016,11,10
111,The good surprise..,"A very good address in London, with a very good ratio price/quality. rooms are spacey, and the satff is very courteous and available. I ended here following a resale of my room in another hotel (park grand hotel, kensington you v-can avoid anyway, the place doesn't look very neat), due to late arrival. too bad I had to leave just a few hours after, I would have liked to stay longer.",4,2016,11,10
111,"Cannot wait to return, love the interior design throughout!","This was the most amazing hotel I have stayed in so far - from the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the stunning entrance and decor, as well as attentive and welcoming staff. All staff we encountered took genuine interest in engaging with us and we were accompanied to our room which was a nice touch. On arrival there was a bottle of wine and a gorgeous red velvet cake waiting since it was my birthday - such a lovely and warming addition that was unexpected and really made my day. The rooms, including the bathrooms, are beautiful, spacious and clean. I was impressed with the touch panel for lighting and underfloor heating, as well as the super cool multicoloured mood-lighting options! Not a bad word to say about this hotel - it's also in a great location situated in short walking distance of several tube stations as well as the Shoreditch area which is great for evenings. The only drawback would be that one of the reasons I booked the hotel was for its rooftop bar which I learned on arrival was not yet open since the hotel only opened in October. However staff did advise we were more than welcome to use the facilities at their sister hotel 5 mins away. Nevertheless I will definitely be returning the next time we stay over in London - the hotel delivered in so many other ways!!! Big thank you to all at Montcalm Royal London House for a marvellous stay, especially Cyn Ann for my birthday cake and bottle!",5,2016,11,08
111,A Fabulous Weekend Away,"What an incredible experience. Upon arrival my partner and I were greeted by a lovely door man who held the door open for us, our bags were then offered to be carried by another member of staff and then provided with a glass of prosecco each whilst we checked in. (This tasted delicious by the way) The check in staff were so friendly and we were also escorted to our room. The room was gorgeous and so clean. We were given free champagne and cake with it being a special occasion - We were not expecting this at all and it was such a lovely gesture. The bed was so comfy I felt like I was sleeping in a giant marshmallow- Seriously need to get those pillows for home
We were allowed to leave all our bags with the reception staff after our check out time whilst we continued to explore London. I just can't tell you all how incredibly helpful and lovely all the staff are it made it such a wonderful stay.
Always asking how we are doing, holding doors for  us and all of them genuinely smiling and polite. 
In regards to the roof top bar/spa we were advised via the website, booking.com and email that these facilities would not be available on our visiting date- this was not a problem as they kept us informed. Anyone who had an issue with this really had ought to check their emails and their website before booking or arriving.

Didn't have breakfast here as I felt £25 each was a little over the top for just our breakfast therefore we chose to go without and cannot give a review.

Big Thumbs up- definitely hoping to stay again for my birthday in February!!",5,2016,11,08
111,Amazing service,"I stayed here as a treat for my girlfriend's birthday, as soon as we arrived we were greeted by all the staff and they even set up complimentary birthday cake and wine in our room as a birthday treat. Amazing room and great location, we will definitely be back!",5,2016,11,08
111,Absolutely Top Notch with very kind staff,"New hotel! Braced for glitches but there were NONE!! Staff even went to M&S because I forgot face wash, they were so kind!  Staff remembered my name, entertained small children with care and sincerity! Breakfast buffet was great.  Hotel is chic & homey!  Their gym and health center will be open in December.  REALLY looking forward to going back again!",5,2016,11,07
111,A New Experience.,"My Partner and I stayed at the new Montcalm Royal London House hotel Finsbury Square on 6th October. The hotel is in a fantastic location and looks beautiful with a stunning entrance. From the moment we were welcomed to the hotel the staff were attentive and could not do enough for us. 
We have stayed at the Montcalm at the Brewery many times from when they first opened, and also stayed at the Marble Arch Montcalm. Each time we cannot fault welcome and the service we have received, the staff are a real credit to the hotel. Unfortunately the same cannot be said the the barman who served us at the Royal London House Montcalm. The drink I ordered was flat and warm, when I mentioned  this to him he was quite put out, but he did change the drink. The second drink was the same again.  This time his response was dismissive and he just shrugged his shoulders, he said he didn't have room in the fridge. 
This is not the service and attitude we are used to from staff at the Montcalm. 

The hotel had only been open for a few days so we expected teething problems.  We were told by the staff they were having a soft opening and would welcome our feedback. The hotel still had building work going on, but apart from some building noises, the work did not cause a problem. We experienced a few issues but would like to stay at the hotel again when it is finished.  The room had a lovely aroma and the bathroom was bright but quite compact.  The air conditioning was easy to use with the control pad.  A great nights sleep in an extremely comfortable bed. 
We were told they had a Spa and swimming pool opening, this will be a wonderful asset to the hotel, one which I look forward to using. The hotel is beautiful and luxurious, I would recommend it to others.",5,2016,11,07
111,Saturday get away,"This is a stunning hotel, and you can park on single yellows on the weekend which is great. We received prosecco on entry, which was a great touch but ruined because it was warm. The check in took far too long although the lady was lovely she escorted us to the room, which was very big and lovely decor. The tv is huge and has sky which is usual for a hotel room, plus the shower was lovely and bed comfy. Improvements to the room, would be a bin in the actual room and to ensure all surfaces are dusted as the shelves were filthy. The bar area was great and a lovely setting, with great cocktails. Breakfast there wasn't a form that you usually fill out and put on the door, to order room service breakfast and I couldn't find one on the TV guest information which was slightly disappointing. We brought our gym and swim gear to find out it hadn't been built yet. The roof terrace also hadn't been built yet, these were the two main reasons for us actually booking this site. I think its false advertisement and even the guest information says so.

Id like to be invited to come again once its actually completed.",3,2016,11,06
111,On top of their game!,"I stayed at this hotel with my colleague.
I have to say that I was completely impressed with the staff attention to guest needs and genuine high levels of interest and interaction with me.
The hotel itself is really excellent and welcoming , with every need catered for. The rooms are top rated with nice touches which you would expect of such an establishment.
A real find and I will be back !",5,2016,11,04
111,Lovely Hotel - wonderfully helpful staff - excellent service!,"I stay at the hotel quite often and I'm always treated with a friendly smile and happy people - and I can see that it's the same with other customers.  The rooms are luxurious and quiet, the bathrooms just as they should be. Really close to the city and Liverpool Street train station. Top notch hotel!",5,2016,11,04
111,New Hotel - very impressed,"I stayed in the new MontCalm in finsbury square recently for a conference. As with any new hotel there were tiny teething issues (nothing even approaching a problem). Overall I was VERY satisfied with my stay. The rooms were excellent, spacious and well made up. The free WIFI was amazingly fast (100-200 mb/s up and down) and the inroom TV setup was great. They have an on premises bar and restaurant and both were great value - the cheese burger was particularly great :)",5,2016,11,02
111,1st year Anniversary stay,"Absolutely brilliant hotel. Easy to get to from Euston as its a 2 minute walk from Moorgate. Also straight forward to get to Wembley as we did to see the NFL. Hotel was really modern, beautiful instead and was perfect for our weekend. The rooms have lovely modern features including a touch screen where you can put underfloor heating on and control the lighting. Location was brilliant just five minutes away from shoreditch which was amazing at night lots of trendy places to eat and drink and also only 15/20 minute walk from London central as we walked to London Bridge to there phobophobia being Halloween weekend. Staff were very helpful on arrival, absolutely no complaints at all! Will definitely be staying here again on our next trip into the capital ",5,2016,11,01
111,Fantastic stay. Excellent service.,"We were four friends celebrating 50s birthday for two of us, Our request for adjacent rooms were fulfilled; the staff had decorated the beds With 'happy birthday', beautiful and delicious cakes and Prosecco just made the entrance a fantastic experience. Nice and clean rooms (junior suites), the hotel has just opened, everything was fresh and comfortable. Very nice bar, such friendly staff. Doorman always at alert, willing to find us taxi's at a second. Breakfast was lovely. We had a splendid stay and can highly recommend this hotel. One remark: Rooms facing the park are preferable. All facilities will be available when the hotel is fully done, like the spa.",5,2016,11,01
111,weekend for my daughters Birthday,"This is a fantastic hotel, we were greeted by a fantastic bunch of staff who couldn't do enough for us.  After finding out it was my little ones 6th Birthday and that we were going to the Lion king, they surprised Lily with a box of chocolates.  in the morning at Breakfast they then surprised her again with two little lion king teddies.  And if that wasn't enough they also on our return from the show, had surprise balloons and a freshly baked cake sitting in our room.  Overall the visit was first class and the hospitality was second to none.  Thanks to all the staff and we will be using the services again in the near future.  Regards, Barry Minor",5,2016,11,01
111,Burdock Bar,"I didn't stay at the hotel but instead reserved an area in the Burdock bar for work drinks. I'm an events organiser and it can always be a little worrying when you use a new venue, especially for a large group however right from arranging the booking with Gintare to quality of food and service on the night I couldn't wished for a better quality of service. We also ordered various food platters staggered during the night, these were outstanding and incredibly tasty.  Thank you Gintare and team for a great evening, we will be back!",5,2016,10,31
111,Nice hotel. Service left a little to be desired.,"This is a very new hotel. It’s all shiny and clean. It has lots of tech. The lighting alone offers you loads of options controlled either by a touch screen by the bathroom door or a bank of touch switches by the bed. The problem with all those switches, and the inability to see them in the dark in the middle of the night, is that it wasn’t very dark for very long when I needed to get up in the night. I pressed every switch in turn…. 
However, a very clean room and very modern.

I booked through Booking.com and had printed out the reservation and kept it with me – and rather a good job too. When checking in I was informed that my reservation was for 2 nights and not the one I had evidence of. 
It was a pity I was kept waiting by the desk whilst the receptionist called someone, I presume central booking, to check and amend the booking – I suppose I could have helped by showing the printed confirmation that I had a few minutes earlier, perhaps. 

Anyway, after around 10 minutes we finally got a key card and access to our room.

We had a meal planned elsewhere and honestly thought £25 per head was a bit steep for breakfast – so we didn’t actually eat at the hotel so can’t make any comment about the food or ambiance of the bar or restaurant. Looked nice from a distance though.

However, we did decide to have a night cap of a gin and tonic from the minibar (not a ridiculous price). Opening the gin was no issue as it was a screw top – but the tonic required a bottle opener.

No bottle opener! Looked in all the obvious places to confirm – but no, there wasn’t one.

Phoned down to say we needed one. Promised one in a few minutes.

We waited. However, necessity is the mother of invention (and so is the desperate need for a G&T) so I got the top off using the buckle of my belt. 

Twenty minutes later the phone rang. “There should be a bottle opener in the cupboard above the mini bar” the voice said at the other end. I suggested that there wasn’t – and it was unlikely I would have phoned for one had there been. I didn’t mention that it was too late now anyway.

Now, if I owned a 5 star hotel and you called me telling me that there was no bottle opener or one couldn’t be found, I’d have one with you within minutes. It seems like a sensible thing to do rather than wait for 20 minutes before phoning to say it should be there. But I don’t run a 5 star hotel so perhaps I don’t know best practice (mind you, I’ve stayed in a few).

Well a further 20 minutes passed and there was a knock at the door and a man with a bottle opener was there. I have to say I dismissed him – gin and tonic long gone and no need for another. To be fair I didn’t pay for it in the end when I mentioned this on check out – so all’s well that ends well.

I suppose these are minor issues but I am not entirely convinced that having a nice new hotel with irritating elements of service is the way to keep people coming back. 

The price suggested 5 star but it needs to be 5 star all the way – and I don’t think it was.",3,2016,10,31
111,Beautiful Hotel! ,"Had an absolutely amazing stay at this hotel. We were upgraded to the business suite which was lovely and so spacious! All the staff were brilliant, really helpful and friendly! 

With it being a brand new hotel some things weren't open yet like the rooftop bar or the spa facilities but they did offer you the option to use the sister hotel up the road. The heated flooring in the bathroom also didn't work but again it's a new hotel so I'm sure they will have everything up and running soon! 

I stayed for two nights for my birthday and wish I would have booked longer! I would definitely recommend this hotel by far my favourite that I have stayed in London so far and will be returning soon! 

Oh and the little birthday treat was so cute! Thanks for all the staff that made it a birthday to remember x

111,Wonderful Hotel!,"My husband and I are very impressed with the hotel and the service provided to us.
We had a very nice experience from the moment we entered the hotel until we left. 

The check-in was quick and welcoming.
The room was impeccable and we could celebrate an unforgettable 16th anniversary.

The bed, the pillows, the fragrance of the room, the room service were perfect!
The breakfast was delicious!

Anyway, we had an excellent time!

We really recommend the Montcalm Royal London House and we hope to come back soon.",5,2016,10,31
111,Impeccable,"I have stayed in a number of the montcalm hotels in london and this didn't disappoint.
The staff were as friendly and helpful as ever and the hotel finishes for a brand new hotel were impeccable.
I look forward to staying here again very soon.",5,2016,10,30
111,Perfect Hotel,"The service could not have been better, fantastic room and a great location, close to Liverpool street station.
The staff could not do enough for us. The room was one of the best we have stayed in. Would recommend to anyone. And will come back again.",5,2016,10,30
111,"Fantastic Hotel, staff superb ","Booked this hotel as it was on a deal, tube within walking distance. The rooftop bar wasn't ready when we we're there but was offered an alternative. We spent our last night in the hotel bar. We were not disappointed, Peter, Neil and Seny offered us superb hospitality while we sat at the bar sampling their cocktails, attention to detail with every drink was outstanding. We will definitely be staying here next time were in London and look forward to sampling and enjoying the cocktails at the hotel bar again. ",5,2016,10,30
111,Beautiful New 5* Hotel in the city,"I have stayed at Montcalm Hotels previously and love the attention to detail all the properties go to in making people feeling welcome.

Upon check in I received a room upgrade with a lovely view over the city and a complimentary Bottle of wine and some lovely fruit.

This is a brand new property, therefore the sheen and smell of newness was faultless and I had a thoroughly wonderful stay in a lovely big and comfy room! 

I highly recommend for business and leisure in the city of London",5,2016,10,30
111,The Cream of Montcalm,"Having stayed at the Sister properties at Brerery and M by Montcalm i think i have found my favorite.

A truely beautiful hotel with comfortable contemporary rooms, a fantastic bed and the best nights sleep ive ever had in a hotel. Rooms have all you need, water and fruit was included and the Rooms are spotless ans very well presented, as was every inch of the hotel and public spaces. Kudos to the Housekeepers.

Of course the staff are the cream of the crop. I hear they have taken the best people from other Montcalms and put them all here and it shows as service and staff engagement was second to none. Everyone looked happy to be there and everyone, even staff on the floor cleaning engaged with me, i felt special! 

Check i  was faultless, my room was ready and i was wowed to be offered a chilled glass of prosseco! I will return again and again",5,2016,10,28
111,Excellent business hotel with some flaws,"This is a new hotel that's in a great location close to the City of London. The Montcalm group has several other hotels in the area and this is the best of the bunch. It's new and the fittings are top-notch, particularly the bathroom. Good big bed too and free (and reliable wi-fi). The flaws are an interesting bunch. First, not having meeting rooms available for short-term hire is not good for a hotel that wants to attract business guests. We were directed to the lounge (for STG35 each for the day), so that didn't happen. Second, you might spend more time than you'd like waiting for lifts to arrive. Third, the electronic control panel for the room lights doesn't dim after a time and can be very distracting at night. In my case, I had to tape some paper over the panel to stop the light, especially as it faced a mirror that threw the light straight into my eyes when lying down on the bed. I heard another couple of guests protesting about the same flaw when I was checking out, so it seems like a design issue in the room. Overall, a very nice hotel.",4,2016,10,26
111,The one to beat,"Me and my girlfriend have stayed in a few hotels around London and this is certainly the best of the bunch. 

The lobby is huge with a marble finish and had a feel of luxury about it. Whilst we didn't try anything from the restaurant, the menu looked delicious. The room was the show stopper. Equipped with a king sized bed and adjacent to that was a huge flat screen TV which came with all Sky TV channels free of charge. It also had mood lights, floor lights and underfloor heating all controlled by a nifty tablet on the wall. The bathroom was a great size with the biggest shower I have seen in a hotel.

Being a new hotel, I'm sure it wont stay at this cheap rate forever, so get in whilst you can.",5,2016,10,26
111,Stayed there the night it opened,"I stayed in this hotel the night it opened, i got upgraded to there from their sister hotel. As you can expect on opening night, there was a number of things that did not work perfectly. What was excellent was that at no point did the staff behave like this was the fault of the customer and worked really hard to make it as seamless as possible. The rooms were great and a special mention to Daisy the manager on the night for dealing with everything in a very friendly customer-centric way. Would definitely return",5,2016,10,25
111,great weekend stay,"We enjoyed our stay, lovely staff,they found out it was our anniversary so we had lots of extra treats. we were upgraded.to a larger room, lots of technology and superb beds. The cooked breakfast was the best we have had. The hotel is very central for getting round London.So thanks once again for a lovely stay. C&M Murphy",5,2016,10,25
111,Excellent New Hotel,"Excellent stay here at the Montcalm Royal London Suites.
Very friendly and helpful staff. We celebrated a special birthday and they surprised us with cake and champagne.  Hotel room was lovely very clean and with lovely mood lighting.  Would recommend this hotel highly.  😁",5,2016,10,24
111,Large Group Booking Flawlessly handled! Excellent !,"I had arranged a large booking for this hotel and every room given was amazing, they had also upgraded the VIP to a club suite which was amazing and treated them to fruit and champayne.  All staff were amazing and really nice.
Every guest commented on how great the hotel was !! Would definitely recommend and will go back again! Thanks to the staff they made our stay memorable.",5,2016,10,24
111,Great hotel,We stayed here for one night. The staff were amazing and went above and beyond for us. The hotel is stunning and the room (and views) are really nice too - there's not a bad word to say. Everything was clean and tidy. Would definitely return here - great value for money.,5,2016,10,24
111,Could not fault!,"I had the pleasure of a stay in the Montcalm Royal London House whilst in London on business last week. Whilst we weren't able to check into the room until later than we expected due to work commitments, the time spent at the hotel was faultless. 

A brand new hotel with absolutely no issues encountered over my stay. Staff were friendly with door staff taking our bags whilst we checked in, all the way through to a short room tour by a member of staff from reception who explained all of the fancy touch screen controls and how everything worked/was located. Rooms were extremely clean as well.

I would happily book this hotel again in future! Central London but set back on a square so traffic noise is next to none.",5,2016,10,24
111,Excellent,"Had an awesome time at the hotel. Soon as we arrived into our room overlooking London, we received a phone call just to make sure everything was okay. Every single person was welcoming and the service was next to none, just perfect. ",5,2016,10,23
111,Lovely hotel with great staff,"Stayed here for a night and couldn't fault the hotel or its staff. From the doormen that greeted us as we arrived, to the fantastic receptionist that checked us in, the experience was outstanding. 

The room was luxurious but relaxing and absolutely spotless and the bed was amazingly comfortable. 

We didn't eat here but went to the bar after our night out and am so glad we did. Again, great, friendly staff, with a good selection of gins for me and ales for my husband, topped off by relaxed, comfortable surroundings. 

Will definitely be returning!! 

",5,2016,10,23
111,AMAZING!!!,Just returned from a most fabulous stay at the new Montcalm Royal London House hotel. We have stayed at two other Montcalm hotels before (which we loved) so were keen to try this one out. The hotel itself is beautiful. Yes there is still work going on but I have to stay I didn't really notice it at all when we were there. We opted for the special package which included a bottle of prosecco and cake in our room and breakfast. Little did I know that there was a reason why my parter booked this special package as he proposed during our stay. The staff could not have been more accommodating and helped to make our stay so very special during this occasion. We had breakfast in the Burdock restaurant and it was delicious. Once again the staff here could not have been better There is no doubt we will be returning here! Thank you for a truly amazing stay 😀,5,2016,10,23
111,Over night stay,"Stayed 21 oct for one night. Great hotel.  Some hiccups, very high tech and software crashed . Lights failed and ditto phone.  Might need to be techy oriented as took a while to figure out controls.  Spa not available as yet but complimentary use of sister facilities with return transport. Great location and nice staff. Would recommend club room .  Booked deluxe double but wld  bk club next time. ",4,2016,10,23
111,Perfect!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Montcalm Royal London. The service was absolutely excellent - the staff are enthusiastic, friendly and keen to help. We were amazed at all the little details in the room, the Montcalm have thought of everything which made our stay even better. The location is great, within easy reach of transport links and the river. Although the hotel is not yet fully open everything ran smoothly. We didn't want to leave and will definitely be back.",5,2016,10,20
111,Amazing!,"Class value for a class experience!
With the hotel being open only a few days prior to our visit we expected there to be a few minor hiccups and teething problems. This was not the case! The hotel was awesome, sophisticated and modern; the staff were all exceptional (especially the doormen) and my friend and I had a pleasant stay! Will definitely be returning to this hotel on our next visit to London and look forward to it massively! ",5,2016,10,19
111,"Beautiful luxury hotel, will stay again!","I stayed at the Montcalm Royal London for just one night while in the city for work, I had no idea it was their first day/night of opening after three years of building and development.  As such I was greeted with a huge welcome and a glass of champaign which was a lovely surprise and a really nice touch by the Manager.

As it was the first day of opening there were a few last minute touches being made in the reception area and a few minor teething problems (we had a short power cut in the afternoon), but things were quickly rectified - however this also meant everything in the hotel was brand new and sparkling!

I don't always sleep that well when away from home but I slept sooo well, like a baby! Considering the hotel is in central London, it's on a quiet square so no outside noise, plus the bed is AMAZING!! Super luxurious and comfortable you just sink right into it.  Best nights sleep in ages.

The other big plus was the fantastic shower, plenty of hot water with lovely Elemis toiletries. I liked the electronic lighting controls so you can have just the right amount of light when relaxing at night and watching the huge tv which has Sky channels too.   

There were lots of staff on hand around the reception area to help with bags, directions, taxi's etc and I found them very helpful and smiley.

I didn't use the bar or restaurant as I was up and out very early the next day, but the bar area was large and beautifully decorated.

Hotel is in a very safe area, it's the financial district so not much hustle and bustle at night but livelier places are close by if that is what you are after.  There are a few shops, bars and places to eat (Leon and Itsu that kind of thing) within couple of minutes walk and the Tube station is also a short walk.

Overall a fantastic hotel, highly recommend and looking forward to my next visit!",5,2016,10,15
111,"Beautiful property, amazing place to stay!","I have almost finished a week staying at the hotel and its a fantastic place to stay. I much prefer it to the sister hotel M by Montcalm which is just up the road at Old Street. There is a really nice bar and lobby here, a place you would be happy to spend a night out in. It all feels like they have spent a fortune on developing the property and its absolute luxury. My first room was very nice and faced Finsbury Square, they are in soft opening mode so there was some drilling. After an overnight flight form the US this was the last thing I needed when trying to snooze in the afternoon so they happily moved me to a quieter room that was also an upgrade. It's a really huge room facing Worship Street, twice the size of the first room and even the bathroom is about the size of my bedroom back in New York! The bed is super comfortable. There is a slight issue that the control panel on the wall does not go dim enough so it is like a night light when the full lights are out. I will mention that because the first room was not like this, sure they will fix it. The staff is great and all super friendly I have only had one issue. On Monday night I was having drinks with a friend in the bar, I signed for the drinks with one barman but then the other barman chased us asking how we were planning to settle the bill. In that position he should have really checked with the other barman first rather than making me feel like really uncomfortable like I was sneaking out! I really hope to stay here on my next trip in a couple of months. Right now it is very affordable but sure the prices will rise soon.",5,2016,10,12
111,Great new place. Will stay here again!,"I picked this place mostly because it was so close to my office in London and I was here for a 2 week trip. Hotel is very nice, its new so that is to be expected. Being that this place literally opened the day before I checked in, there are things that need to be ironed out but for the most part its a great hotel in a great location if you need to be in this area of London. 

The area itself is mostly banking / business so on the weekend its quiet, but I kind of like that. Its super easy to hop on transit and get to the more busy areas if you want and Uber is super convenient as well. 

For me the menu was a bit different but everything I tried was delicious.

I think if you were to hold a gun to my head and force me to come up with something to criticize this place for it would be the view out my window, I look directly into the next door office building which was a bit weird when I failed to close the shades before bed and then overslept waking up to people in meetings and clacking away on their computers. But I am sure they have other rooms with different views so totally not a big deal to me. 

I think the thing that sold me the most about this hotel is the service. Everyone I have interacted with was very friendly and willing to help with whatever. I will definitely stay here every time I am in London on business.",4,2016,10,11
111,Great new hotel in the City,"The hotel is having its soft open at the moment. I think there is a good market for a business hotel in the heart of the City. I come to the City for 3-5 nights per month and have tried many hotels. For me, this offering is perfect. The hotel has a very convenient location, good standard rooms and a great restaurant. Service seems good and the staff go the extra mile to keep guests happy. The manager personally greeted me and I got a nice upgrade. I think they are off to a good start and I aim to start using the hotel for my future business visits",5,2016,10,11
111,Faultless.,"Unbelievable service, fantastic room and a great location. 

The staff are super helpful and friendly and made me and my partner feel very comfortable. 

HIGHLY recommended. We will be staying again in the very near future. Pure class.

Thank you Montcalm Royal London!",5,2016,10,10
111,It was a dream,"For my mother's birthday I gave her the so-called London surprise this weekend. The hotel is unique. The rooms very nice and noble, the food excellent and special to mention is the staff. Everyone is extremely nice and accommodating. Especially the Head Concierge Daniel is fantastic. He is extremely accommodating and very attentive. We feel very comfortable and every wish is fulfilled with a smile. If we come back to London, we will definitely come back here.",5,2024,10,12
111,Super recommended,"Excellent stay, staff always available, friendly and ready to every request and above all to provide valuable advice to live and visit the city at its best. 
Welcoming, clean and attentive to the needs of guests. 
Recommended for a trip to remember!",5,2024,09,10
111,Not 5 stars,"The room was worn out, the toilet was constantly flushing, the towel was dirty. The A/C cannot be adjusted manually because the control panel has been removed. Only the caretaker can adjust it. So it is either too cold during the day or too warm at night. The light switch for the bathroom is completely illogically next to the bed.

For the second night, I was given a different room because of my complaint, with an option to adjust the A/C. It was better, but by no means 5 stars. Apparently the room was intended for someone else, there was a card there addressed to someone else.

The location was good, the room was quiet. But that was it. The price/performance ratio is not right.",3,2024,06,20
111,Hotel with a panoramic breakfast view but some things could be improved.,"Greatly improve the cleanliness of the rooms.
Improve the intercontinental breakfast.
Avoid the path of guests wearing bathrobes in front of the reception, waiting room and bar.
Since there is no bidet, add at least a toilet brush for cleaning the toilet.
Also improve the cleanliness of the rooms and the disabled bathroom, which has unclean accessories.
Improve the supply of shower gel, which happens to leave the room without shower gel, even though the staff saw the container empty because it had been removed from the container holder (placed empty, without filling it).
Unacceptable in a hotel of this category.
Lighting and air conditioning control tablet, malfunctioning.
Cleanliness of the room and bathroom needs improvement.",4,2024,05,13
111,Advised,"Excellent hotel in an area not very central from a tourist point of view but quiet and well served by buses and metro. Staff at reception very friendly and helpful. Fairly large and quiet room, comfortable beds, spacious bathroom, nice shower.
Good breakfast, but not very organised. Evening aperitif offered.
Correct prices for London and for the class of the hotel.",4,2024,05,13
111,Stunning hotel,"Beautiful hotel and very kind and professional staff, thanks to january for the availability and the surprise of leaving the balloons in the bed to surprise my daughter for her birthday! Unique view and excellent breakfast! SPA wow! Aperitif offered by the hotel from 5.30 pm onwards! We had a great time! Friendly staff in the breakfast room!",5,2024,04,26
111,Crazy!,"Very knowledgeable, helpful and kind staff, they knew it was my birthday and prepared a wonderful surprise for me. A real Montcalm Experience. Place that deserves five stars, special thanks to Mr Daniel Todorov. Hotel very close to Liverpool Street station and full of activity in the area. The Roof Restaurant where we had lunch for my birthday is also beautiful. Vera hosts high level English!
Highly recommended.",5,2024,03,29
111,Absolutely okay,"I stay here regularly when I'm in London on business. Location-wise it's ideal for me. For business trips it completely serves its purpose. Privately, with the family, I would rather not stay here; in my opinion there are better options (Cheval, Sofitel, etc).

The service is friendly, although a little complicated at times. The rooms are fine and very clean, but nothing particularly special. The breakfast is a bit narrow. The rooftop bar is great. What really bothers me (but that's a general criterion for me) is the dim lighting throughout the hotel, especially in the room.

All in all a (very) good business hotel. Personally, not for me. Four points trending towards three.",4,2024,03,22
111,Good hotel and best staff,"The hotel is wonderful but the experience has been improved by the treatment of the staff. Hotels in London usually have small rooms and they are spacious rooms. Especially, review Daniela's treatment because it makes your trip special. We are delighted. The bed is perfect even if you have back problems.",5,2024,01,19
111,"Excellent hotel, excellent welcome, clean, soundproof rooms","Central location easily reachable by public transport. Located in an ancient building, the structure is a little dated and well maintained. The welcome is truly excellent, thanks also to the Italian manager Alberto who upgraded the room for us for free. the rooms are large clean we slept really well. The wellness area, however, needs to be cleaned better and refreshed because it is very dated and a little neglected, not up to the standard of the prestigious structure. Excellent experience in every sense anyway!",5,2023,12,27
111,Super experience!,"Very nice hotel, well served by public transport, convenient for those arriving from Heathrow.
The rooms are quite spacious by London standards, very clean, well soundproofed.
Very comfortable mattress, nice shower.
Roof top restaurant.
Welcoming, kind and smiling staff.
I particularly thank Daniel T. For his welcome and kindness.
Goodbye ☺️

111,A perfect short trip!!,"A perfect short trip!! The hotel is close to Moorgate station, easy to reach on foot. Very friendly staff, Amy at reception gave us a really nice welcome, we immediately felt very comfortable! Good breakfast above the rooftops of London. Unfortunately we couldn't use the beautiful rooftop bar because of the weather... We would definitely want to stay here again👍",5,2023,11,08
111,Amy really nice,"Amy, who is at the reception, welcomed us politely and made our stay here in the hotel more pleasant. She is very nice. Thanks to Amy's good recommendation, we also had very good food, drinks and shopping. Our stay in the hotel was very nice.",5,2023,11,06
111,Lovely place,"The location is not very convenient for getting around London but this hotel has an extraordinary rooftop of astonishing beauty. The rooms are equipped with all comforts, including an iron in the room and much more. We had dinner in the room one evening and it was all excellent. We had breakfast in a bar opposite in the park and it was all delicious. If I really have to find a flaw, no Italian at the reception. I highly recommend it.",4,2023,10,29
111,Great Hotel!,"Excellent location in central London, 5 minutes from Liverpool Street station. Prestigious hotel, spacious and very clean rooms, exceptional staff. On the top floor Bar for classy aperitif. Recommended for business trips (rates quite high but average for London)",5,2023,10,28

111,Ottima scelta,"Hotel che può soddisfare le esigenze di ogni tipo: comfort, location, gentilezza del personale, attento a ogni richiesta. La colazione variegata, abbondante con prodotti di ottima qualità. Il pub del piano terra ottimo con atmosfera rilassante adatto a tutti. Un caloroso saluto a Claudia,John e al manager on duty  Alberto che hanno saputo cogliere con professionalità e prontezza ogni richiesta. Non da meno anche Ksenia che ci ha accolte e Vlad che con pazienza ci ha dato le indicazioni giuste per poterci godere al massimo la vacanza a Londra.  
Si potrebbe curare un pochino di più visto le 5 stelle la biancheria nella camera e un occhio più attento alla pulizia. La camera è stata silenziosa e il letto confortevole.  Grazie.  Monica e Lorenza ",4,2023,07,29

Zimmer sind von der Größe ok, Fenster konnte man leider nur kippen, dazu Geruch von der Küche, welche vermutlich unten gelegen ist (wir waren im 10. Stock). Klimatisierung/Belüftung über die Anlage im Zimmer sonst gut. Sauberkeit gut. Frühstück ok, relativ überschaubar von der Auswahl. Tolle Dachterrasse mit Bar/Restaurant.

111,TUTTO PERFETTO,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo splendido hotel per celebrare il nostro anniversario. 

Inizio col dire che la pozione è ottima, vicina alla stazione di Liverpool street.

Per quanto riguarda la struttura si vede che è stata struttura con particolare attenzione, di fatti le stanze si presentano pulite e ben curate.

Ultimo punto ma non per questo meno importante è il personale, sono stati veramente professionali e cordiali lungo tutto il soggiorno senza mai farci mancare nulla (visto che era il nostro anniversario, Mary ci ha fatto trovare la stanza addobbata per l’occasione).

Consiglio vivamente questa struttura per le vostre vacanze londinesi.",5,2023,03,05

111,"Nettes 4 Sterne Hotel, bequeme Betten, Laute Klimaanlage draußen vor Fenster","Was sehr positiv auffällt ist das sehr nette und aufmerksame Personal. Das ist der beste Punkt an dem Hotel. Die Einrichtung in den Zimmern ist geschmackvoll zusammengestellt und die Betten sind sehr bequem.
Was sehr unangenehm ist, ist das laute Surren der Klimaanlage im Innenhof und das trotzt dicker Fenster. Da muss man zum Schlafen schon Ohrenstöpsel anziehen.",3,2022,09,05
111,Kein echtes Highlight,"Ich war schon in einigen 5 Sterne Hotels, aber ich habe keine Idee, wie das Montcalm zu dieser Kategorie gekommen ist.
Es befindet sich fussläufig 5 Minuten von Liverpool-Street entfernt. 
 Das Personal war freundlich- nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Das Frühstück zur Selbstbedienung auf dem Rooftop besteht aus Kaffee aus der Kanne, 2 Fruchtsäften aus der Tüte, Tee nach Wahl , einem Obstsalat aus Äpfeln, Orangen und ein paar Bananenstücken, Joghurt, Cerealien , 2 verschiedenen Süssgebäcken , 3 Sorten Wurstaufschnitt aus dem Supermarkt, 3 Sorten Käse , Rührei, Bohnen, gegrillten Tomaten, Schinkenspeck und Würstchen. Man darf sich zwischen Toast oder glutenfeiem aufgeschnittenem Brot entscheiden- thats it- Cafe Costa um die Ecke hat dagegen ein opulentes Frühstücksangebot für ein Fünftel des Preises und odentlichen Kaffee! 
Die Rooftop -Bar war um 23.00 Uhr geschlossen. 
Die Zimmer sind in Ordnung ohne erwähnenswerte Extras. 
Vielleicht hatte ich aufgrund des exorbitanten Zimmerpreises aber auch etwas Anderes erwartet .",3,2022,07,04

111,"Awesome, as usual","Seconda volta al Montcalm di Finsbury Sq. La prima in settembre è stata quasi perfetta, avevo fatto due appunti, tra cui la mancanza della vasca in camera. Questa volta direi perfetta: la camera era ancora più bella con la vasca e una vista bellissima. Ho prenotato sul sito e ho trovato prezzi più convenienti (nonostante il sito non sia velocissimo e abbia avuto problemi con il pagamento, inconveniente risolto velocemente con 2 mail). Il personale sempre estremamente gentile e accomodante, in particolare la cara Mary e la mia bellissima connazionale Arianna. Consiglio a tutti il Montcalm per la qualità e non un ultimo il miglior rapporto qualità/prezzo di Londra. Tornerò sicuramente molto presto

Second time at Montcalm in Finsbury Sq. The first in September was almost perfect, I had made two notes, including the lack of the tub. This time it was perfect: the room was even more beautiful with the tub and a beautiful view. I booked on the site and I found the most affordable prices (although the site is not too quick and had problems with payment, quickly resolved with 2 emails). The staff is always extremely kind and accommodating, especially the fantastic Mary and my beautiful compatriot Arianna. I recommend Montcalm to everyone for the quality and not least the best quality/price ratio. I will definitely be returning very soon",5,2020,02,16
111,Esperienza molto negativa,"Ho una certa esperienza di hotel, compresi i 5 stelle lusso, e questo per me si dovrebbe posizionare in una categoria molto inferiore. Non capisco i giudizi entusiastici degli utenti che purtroppo hanno condizionato la mia scelta. La posizione è discreta, a 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata Moorgate e poco più da Liverpool Street. La struttura è organizzata in modo curioso,  occorre passare attraverso un pub per arrivare alla reception e agli ascensori. Alla reception, spesso affollata al mattino,  accoglienza professionale ma senza grandi sorrisi. Ci viene detto che la richiesta (scritta e fatta molti giorni prima) di avere stanze con vista non poteva essere esaudita. Prendo l'ascensore e noto un agghiacciante scotch tape per tenere attaccato alla parete il rivestimento in pezzi! In stanza trovo un bel biglietto di benvenuto, peccato che era diretto a un signore russo di nome Ivan. Stanza ampia, macchina del caffè e frigo nell'armadio, moquette a terra, nessuna presa elettrica europea ma solo britannica e usb. Ma collegando il device a quella usb, accade anche che il tv si imposta per ricevere dati! Bagno con doccia ma senza finestra, senza bidet e senza spazzolone (non trovo altro termine) per il wc. Dotazione di kit al minimo per un hotel di questa categoria. Qualità e profumazione di shampoo e bagnoschiuma però non gradevole, ma può essere questione di gusti. Illuminazione della stanza affidata a un sistema comandato da un touch screen. Apparentemente simpatico, peccato che la terza sera alle 23.30, mentre dormivamo, tutte le luci si sono accese all'improvviso svegliandoci con tanto di strani rumori provenienti dal tv. Da quel momento il display è andato in tilt con le luci del bagno che non si spegnevano più. Televisore grande ma con menu poco chiaro e informazioni insufficienti. Molti canali internazionali, nessuno italiano visibile. Le lenzuola e i cuscini presentavano macchie non ben identificate. Una volta nel letto scopriamo di avere sopra al materasso matrimoniale due materassini più morbidi, stretti e pieni di fossette. Scomodissimi e girandosi su un fianco si scivolava sul materasso grande sottostante. Dopo una notte quasi insonne la mattina chiedo la rimozione dei due materassini, peraltro presenti solo nella mia stanza e non in quella dei figli. La signorina alla reception si scusa ma la sera seguente ritroviamo di nuovo i materassini sul letto. Altra notte insonne e al mattino seguente aspetto il room service, parlante uno stentato inglese, per far rimuovere davanti ai miei occhi i materassini. La colazione, avendo scelto la formula club, era nella club lounge al piano terra: continentale e inclusa nel prezzo. Per avere una colazione completa all'ultimo piano, al chiuso, avrei dovuto spendere 25 sterline a persona. Personale della lounge disattento e poco preparato. Solo per fare un esempio abbiamo atteso invano un tè per poi sentirci dire se ne volevamo dell'altro! Orari di chiusura della sala al mattino variabili tra le 10.30 e le 11. Un vantaggio la possibilità di bere e fare uno spuntino al rientro nel pomeriggio. Wifi incluso ma senza riconnessione automatica e con qualche down. Abbiamo provato anche la piscina ma i teli non sono forniti e vanno portati dalla stanza. 
Due note positive: la terrazza con vista sui grattacieli della City e con igloo trasparenti ma dove non è possibile fare colazione. E Arianna, professionale, gentile e disponibile. Al check out avrei voluto parlare con la dirigenza ma era impegnata in riunione. Solo una mail giorni dopo, troppo tardi.",1,2020,01,08
111,Wunderschönes Hotel und super Personal,"Mein Freund und ich sind in diesem Hotel für 3 Nächte geblieben und haben es geliebt. Noch nie zuvor hatten wir das Vergnügen so ein zuvorkommendes und nettes Personal kennenzulernen wie in diesem Hotel. Uns wurde jeder Wunsch erfüllt und wir hatten einen super Service. Insbesondere einer der Hotel Manager namens Michael hat uns gezeigt wie schön es ist, Gast dieses Hotels zu sein und uns immer wieder eine Freude bereitet. Zusätzlich war der SPA Bereich sehr schön, sowie die Zimmer mit den äußerst bequemen Betten. Der Ausblick vom Rooftop war nicht zu übertreffen. 
Wir freuen uns schon auf unseren nächsten Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel.

111,Tolles Hotel- Nettes Personal- Schönes Rooftop,"Die Lage des Hotels ist perfekt, wenn man das East End erkunden möchte - Liverpool Street Station, Brick Lane, Old Spitalfields Market sind fußläufig schnell zu erreichen.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit - wir reisten mit kleinen Kindern an und es wurde uns sofort Saft und Popcorn für die Kids aufs Zimmer geschickt. :)

Das Rooftop mit Bar und Indoor Restaurant war großartig - besonders zum Sonnenuntergang. Gleich angeschlossen ist unten ein Pub, in dem man den Abend ""leger"" ausklingen lassen kann.

Die Zimmer (wir hatten ein Deluxe Double - bekamen ein kleines ""Upgrade"" auf ein größeres Zimmer, allerdings mit ""acessible"" Bad, d.h. es handelte sich um ein behindertengerechtes Badezimmer, das etwas größer ausfiel als normal, dafür aber eine Dusche ohne Abtrennung hatte, was uns aber nichts ausmachte - waren sauber und schön ausgestattet - Nespresso Maschine, Safe, Föhn, Schlappen, Bademantel, etc. so wie man es aus einschlägigen 5-Sterne- Häusern auch erwartet. Die Lage (8. Stock) war mit schöner Aussicht und sehr ruhig.

Den Spa und Poolbereich haben wir nicht ausprobiert, sah aber von außen gut (wenn auch etwas klein) aus.

Insgesamt ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs- Verhältnis und wir würden es auf jeden Fall nochmals wählen.",5,2019,07,23

Il rapporto qualità / prezzo è davvero notevole.
La nostra camera (721) era spaziosa e accogliente con macchina Nespresso per il caffè e bollitore per il te. Il bagno era grande il letto enorme e comodissimo.

Il bar in terrazza e la piscina coperta sono un plus che potrebbe diventare irrinunciabile per i prossimi soggiorni!

Ultimo ma non ultimo, il personale veramente cortese e attento!

Come detto all’inizio: un hotel che mi sento di consigliare senza indugio!",5,2019,06,13

Location molto bella ed in buona posizione!
Camera belle, grandi e pulite!
Terrazza all’ultimo piano per un aperitivo serale molto carina e suggestiva.
In questo Hotel non ci si fa mancare nulla!
C’è anche un’area benessere con piscina, ma non ho avuto modo di provarla.
Rapporto prezzo qualità, adeguato.
Che dire, provate a fare una “tappa”, merita e non resterete delusi!

111,Top! Super Stadthotel mit tollem Service,"Wir (zwei Kinder, zwei Erwachsene) waren 3 Nächte in diesem wunderbaren 5-Sterne Hotel. Top Service, von A-Z, speziell danken wir Michael an der Reception... er hat uns jeden Wunsch von den Augen abgelesen. Die Zimmer waren geräumig und immer tiptop sauber. Wenn möglich die Lounge dazubuchen, es lohnt sich! Die Rooftop-Bar/Restaurant ist wirklich wunderschön, wird auch von den Locals als Ausgangsort am Wochenende genutzt, daher unbedingt reservieren bei schönem Wetter. Der Spa war ok, das Wasser viel zu chlorhaltig und recht kalt. Die Lage ist sehr gut, Moorgate Underground und Liverpool Station in unmittelbarer Nähe. Vorallem die Liverpool Station ist toll und der Weg dorthin ebenfalls sehr spannend. Wir können das Hotel uneingeschränkt empfehlen!

111,"Schönes Hotel, mit ansprechenden Zimmern, mit sehr gutem Service, relativ zentral gelegen. Alles in allem 5/5! ","Besonders hervorheben möchte ich zu aller erst den exzellenten Service! Von der Rezeptionistin, über den Kellner, bis hin zum Roomservice waren alle Angestellten außerordentlich freundlich, höflich und zuvorkommend! Vor allem Guest-Relationsmanagerin Dado hat uns hervorragend in Empfang genommen und uns unsere Wünsche sozusagen von den Lippen abgelesen! 
Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber und geräumig. Als besondere Überraschung aufgrund des Geburtstags meiner Freundin haben wir ein kostenloses Upgrade in eine Junior Suite und zudem Pralinen und Obst erhalten. Einziges Manko waren die etwas zu lauten Geräusche der Belüftungsanlage im Innenhof des Hotels. 
Zudem war es etwas beirrend, dass man beim Eintritt in das Hotel erstmal durch eine Bar geleitet wird. Aber das war nicht weiter störend!
Das Essen können wir nicht wirklich bewerten, wir haben lediglich den Roomservice zum Frühstück genutzt. Dieses war sehr schmackhaft und schön angerichtet! 
Das Restaurant und die Iglus am rooftop des Hotels sind super schön und gewähren einen sehr schönen Blick auf die City!
Ansonsten sprechen die Fotos für sich! 
Wir kommen auf jeden Fall gerne wieder! 5/5! 👍🏻",5,2018,12,29
111,Excelente hotel,"Excelente hotel, muy moderna toda su decoración y muy silencioso. Las habitaciones son amplias, cómodas y confortables. Ubicación cercana a estaciones de metro y hay varios restaurantes cerca. La piscina es pequeña, pero agradable para ir a descansar luego de un día de caminar por la ciudad.",5,2018,12,12
111,Non all’altezza delle aspettative,Appena arrivati ci hanno assegnato una camera non pronta e ci hanno fatto spostare senza neanche proporre un upgrade. 5 minuti dopo arriva ancora un ragazzo a controllare il minibar che non era rifornito.. la spa è deludente e la colazione deluxe nulla di particolare. Salvo la vista dall’attico molto bella. Per un hotel da 400€ anotte il rapporto qualità prezzo è molto basso.,3,2018,12,11
111,OTTIMO,"Un vero hotel di qualità con camere eleganti e ipertecnologiche.
Noi ci siamo stati il weekend per la prima volta ed è stato piacevole scoprire anche la ottima ubicazione a poche stazioni di metro da qualsiasi attrazione",5,2018,11,21
111,Un cinque stelle accessibile,"Il Montcalm Royal London House si trova in un buona posizione, a cinque minuti a piedi dalla fermata della metro ""Moorgate"". La hall è molto bella. Siamo stati in una camera al settimo piano, abbastanza spaziosa, considerando gli standard di Londra. Una particolarità è che è tutto gestibile unicamente da un display: aria condizionata, luci, riscaldamento ecc. Anche di notte rimangono delle lucette, la camera non è mai perfettamente al buio. Forse ad alcuni può dare fastidio.
Il personale è cortese, ma si nota che è costituito in parte da professionisti esperti (un ringraziamento speciale ad Alex, il Duty Manager) e in parte da ragazzi alle prime esperienze.
Nel prezzo della stanza è compreso l'accesso alla spa e alla palestra, nelle quali però non siamo stati.
Nel complesso un'esperienza positiva, ad un prezzo comunque accessibile, visto che altri cinque stelle a Londra costano almeno 500euro in più.",4,2018,11,20

111,Bello,"Siamo stati una notte al Montcalm. Bellissima camera, confortevole e con una enorme vetrata. Letto comodo. Bagno abbastanza spazioso. Moltissime cortesie (set cucito, set cotone e Lima per unghie, set per le scarpe, ferro e asse da stiro, asciugacapelli, adattatori prese, shampoo BALSAMO e bagnoschiuma, ciabattine). Ci è piaciuto molto. 

Poca flessibilità alla maniera inglese: siamo scesi 10 minuti prima che la colazione finisse e ci è stato detto: ok, fate pure colazione ma io caffè ve lo serviremo comunque entro i prossimi 9 minuti e non oltre. 

Aria condizionata alla maniera inglese: la stanza sembrava un congelatore ma è stato molto semplice rimediare.

A parte questo tutto perfetto. ",4,2018,06,07
111,I felt like Queen! TOLLES Hotel,"Ich hatte schon einige Male Pech mit Hots, aber das hat alles rausgerissen. Ich hatte einen echten Luxusaufenthalt. Ich war an meinem Geburtstag dort und kam schon morgens um 9 Uhr an. Ich durfte trotzdem schon mein Zimmer beziehen und bekam oben drauf ein Upgrade.Ich  bekam ein Zimmer im 8. Stock und hatte eine unglaublich schöne Sicht auf die Wolkenkratzer von London.Von Decke bis Boden durchgehende Fenster. Ich habe noch lange mit offenen Vorhängen vom Bett aus rausgesehen.Es war herrlich! Das Zimmer war riesig.Hoher Komfort. Touchscreen um mehrere verschiedene Lichter und die Klimaanlage zu steuern. Der TV ließ sich idiotensicher mit meinem Handy verbinden und ich hab meine eigene  Musik Hören können. Eine Regendusche,herrliche Bademäntel, selbst auf dem Teppich lief ich wie auf Wolken. Eine echte Orchidee, frisches Obst, eine Flasche stilles Wasser, ein Wasserkocher und eine Espressomaschine, eine liebevoll bestückte minibar. Als ich am Abend zurück kam hat man für mich die Tagesdecken beiseite gelegt und mir Pralinen und eine wirklich nett geschrieben Karte mit Geburtstagsgrüßen hingestellt. Das Frühstück war sehr gut. Das Personal war sehr freundlich, zuvorkommend und schneller um mein Wohl sorgend als ich selber. Der Frühstücksraum und die eine Bar sind oben auf dem Dach mit herrlichem Blick. Die 5 Sterne sind absolut zutreffend. Mein Koffer wurde am Abreisetag nach Checkout freundlich und sicher verwahrt. Der Liverpool Bahnhof mit Metrostation ca 5min entfernt. Der Weg ist gut machbar. Eine andere Metrostation ist noch näher, aber der Weg zur Liverpoolstation hat mir so gut gefallen, dass mich das gar nicht mehr interessiert hat. Direkt vor der Tür sind zwei Bushaltestellen.Ich war wirklich über die Maße zufrieden. Mir wird der Aufenthalt dort immer in Erinnerung bleiben. Vielen Dank für einen sehr sehr schönen Geburtstag. Danke!",5,2018,06,03
111,Gutes 5* Stadthotel,"Wir waren für 3 Tage im Rahmen eines City-Tripe zu Gast im Montcalm Royal London House.
Die Lage des Hotels ist gut.
Bus und U-Bahn Stationen befinden sich in der Nähe.
Auch die Lage am Finsbury Square scheint vorteilhaft. Scheint diese doch für die quirrlige und lebhafte Stadt etwas beruhigt.

Der Empfang im Hotel war sehr freundlich. Sowohl Portier als auch Front-Desk Mitarbeiter waren sehr zuvorkommend und aufmerksam.

Das uns zugewiesene Club-Zimmer war für Londoner Verhältnisse sehr groß.
Auch die Einrichtung gefällt wie das Design im gesamten Haus sehr gut.
Die Betten sind äußerst bequem.
Auch der sehr große Fernseher mit einem sehr breiten internationalen Angebot passt zum sehr guten Eindruck.

Lediglich die Sauberkeit der täglichen Reinigung fällt etwas hinter den sonstigen hohen Standard zurück.
Leider war diese nicht gänzlich zufriedenstellend.

Den Spa Bereich und das Restaurant bzw. die Bar haben wir nicht genutzt.

Das Haus ist jedenfalls sehr zu empfehlen.
",5,2018,04,11
111,Für ein 5-Sterne Haus mehr erwartet,"Am Wochenende vom 09. März bis 11.03. war ich mit meiner Familie (2 Kinder im Alter von 5 und 7) in London.
Wir haben das Montcalm Royal London House ausgewählt, da es sehr gut bewertet war und sich in einer sehr
guten zentralen Lage befindet und dennoch sehr ruhig ist. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend,
die Zimmer modern gestaltet und die Betten sehr bequem.

Die Bäder wirken meines Erachtens nach etwas kühl. Aufgrund der Kinder hatten wir extra eine Familien-Suit gebucht, in
diesem Fall waren das 2 miteinander verbundene Zimmer. Die Kinder mussten auf einer Schlafcouch übernachten, welche
nur mit einer Decke eingedeckt war (nicht King Size). Auf Nachfrage haben wir dann eine 2. Decke erhalten. Pro Person hatte
es einen Bademantel für den Spa-Bereich, jedoch mussten die Kinder Bademäntel für Erwachsene tragen, Kinderbademäntel
Waren nicht vorhanden.Das Frühstück war ok, jedoch konnte man weder gekochte Eier noch Rührei bestellen. Die Tische sind
für ein Frühstück mit der Familie eher etwas knapp bemessen. Um in die Zimmer zu kommen, musste man nur in den Aufzug
benutzen, d.h. ohne zuvor mit der Hotelkarte den Lift freizuschalten. Somit kann jeder in die Etagen der Zimmer gelangen.
Aus meiner Sicht ein Sicherheitsmanko, welches heutzutage mit einfachen Standards behoben werden kann.

Bei einem Preis pro Nacht von ca. CHF 350.- und einen 5-Sterne-Haus hätte ich einen besseren Fokus bei den kleinen Details 
Erwartet.",3,2018,03,12
111,"Gute Lage, guter Service ","Ich war alleine ein paar Tage in London unterwegs und habe deshalb ein hübsches, gut eingerichtetes Hotel in einer gut gelegenen Umgebung gewählt. Die Lage des Hotels ist absolut ideal. In einem - für eine allein reisende Frau - sehr sicheren Quartier. Shops, Bars, Marks&Spencer sind in nächster Nähe. Die Liverpool Station ist 6 min. zu Fuss entfernt. 

Das Hotel überzeugt mit einem sehr freundlichen Personal, Service und Flexibilität. 
Der Eingangsbereich ist hübsch, aber von der Struktur, Grösse und Ambiente her nicht 5* Standard. Allerdings erhält man bei An-und Abreise ein offeriertes Getränk, was sehr angenehm ist. Der Cappuccino war sehr lecker.
Besonders hervorzuheben ist die ausserordentlich freundliche Reception.

Das Double Deluxe Zimmer war sehr angenehm, ruhig gelegen. Die Steuerung der Lichtanlage war neben dem Bett und beinhaltet ein paar hübsche Details wie z.b. Moodlight, Floorlight.
Ab und zu ist die Steuerung des Eingangspanels ausgestiegen, eine Webbasierte Anwendung über touchscreen. Also eigentlich eine coole Idee, aber sie sollte schon funktionieren. 
Das Badezimmer ist hübsch und sehr geräumig , die Toilettenartikel aber eher 4*. 

Insgesamt ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis für die Gegend und für London.

Den Wellnessbereich habe ich nicht besucht.

Ich würde das Hotel empfehlen und ich werde ganz bestimmt wieder kommen.",4,2018,01,30

Dazu eine Top Lage mit 3 U-Bahn Stationen, darunter Liverpool Street Station, in kürzester Gehdistanz. Ferner ist die Roof-Top-Bar mit Blick über die Stadt ein absolutes Muss. Ich habe das Hotel als Hotel mit meinen Kollegen für Geschäftsreisen in die City entdeckt, aber auch mehrmals am Wochenende privat verlängert. 
Das Hotel verfügt ebenfalls über einen neuen Wellness Bereich mit kleinem Pool und Sauna. Mein Fazit ist, dass es als Stadthotel ideal ist. Das Personal am Empfang ist extrem nett und zuvorkommend.",5,2018,01,02

111,Stupendo!,"Io e il mio ragazzo abbiamo passato tre notti in questo magnifico hotel. La camera è bellissima e il personale è molto gentile.
L’hotel è posizionato proprio davanti ad una fermata dell’autobus ed è a pochi passi dalle due metropolitane Liverpool Street e Moorgate. Personalmente vi consiglio di scaricare CityMapper per poter gestire i vostri spostamenti in maniera molto veloce grazie ai percorsi suggeriti. 
Sempre a pochi passi dall’hotel, troverete un paio di Starbucks se deciderete di fare colazione fuori ed una pizzeria napoletana per una ottima cena. Ma questi sono solo dei piccoli consigli che mi sento di dare in modo extra alla recensione. 
In conclusione, se ci fosse di nuovo l’occasione di tornare a Londra, io e il mio ragazzo ci ritorneremmo sicuramente. 
Ancora grazie a tutti! ",5,2017,09,28
111,La scelta migliore,"Per staccare un po' dalla routine quotidiana abbiamo deciso di concederci qualche giorno a Londra come turisti. Abbiamo scelto l'hotel in base al prezzo ed alla posizione, non volevamo spendere un capitale ed avere una buona qualità. La posizione ""fuori dal centro"" ci è apparsa una scelta vincente in quanto non volevamo essere disturbati tutta la notte da schiamazzi molesti.
Inizio subito con dire che l'hotel non è solo di buona qualità, ma di ottima qualità. Ci siamo trovati talmente bene che siamo certi di pernottare li ogni volta che saremo a Londra. 

Il personale è estremamente cordiale e disponibile, il rapporto qualità prezzo è ottimo.
L'albergo è situato in una zona molto tranquilla ma piena di vita, vicino ai trasporti pubblici nel centro della City.

Per il nostro soggiorno abbiamo scelto di prendere il pacchetto ""club"" così da avere accesso al Lounge situato al pian terreno dove potevamo fare colazione e disporre di aperitivi e stuzzichini durante il giorno.

Sul tetto, al decimo piano è presente un bar ed un ristorante molto suggestivi ma anche molto sopravvalutati (recensiti separatamente).

Nella struttura è presente anche un centro Wellness, piscina, idromassaggio, sauna e bagno turco, piccolino ma molto pulito e funzionale.

La qualità del sonno è ottima.

Super consigliato.",5,2017,08,06

111,Excelente hotel en la City,"Muy buena situación en la City, buenas habitaciones, trato muy amable, cafetería con ambiente en el hall y una terraza con vistas a las distintas torres. Con buen ambiente para comer y cenar. El sábado a mediodía música en vivo.",5,2017,05,26
111,Non posso non consigliarlo,"Inizialmente ero titubante: posizionato nella zona nord est di Londra, addirittura sopra la fermata di Liverpool street, mi sembrava un po' fuori dal raggio di azione di un normale turista.
Poi sono arrivato a Londra e mi sono completamente ricreduto.
Si trova a metà strada fra due fermate di metro (vabbè, è un po' così per tutta Londra...), molto vivo nei giorni feriali, un paio di Starbucks dove poter fare colazione la mattina a due passi: insomma, la posizione non si è rivelata un problema.
L'albergo ha un ingresso un po' anonimo ma non appena entrati l'impressione cambia radicalmente: ""pub"" (tra virgolette perchè non è proprio un pub) e giochi nella hall, personale gentile, sensazione di pulito e moderno.
Dieci piani, la nostra stanza era all'ottavo (non la standard ma la club): abbastanza grande, dotata di tutti i comfort attesi.
Un televisore Lcd da 55"", assenza di interruttori (al loro posto un pannello touch con il quale selezionare l'accesione e lo spegnimento della luce del bagno, la richiesta di pulizia della camera o la richiesta di privacy, l'accesione o lo spegnimento dell'impianto di aerazione), letto grande e comodo, addirittura un telefono cellulare con chiamate ed internet illimitati da poter prendere ed utilizzare durante il soggiorno...
Il bagno grande e pulito, molto bella la doccia.
All'ultimo piano c'è il luogo dove mangiare con vista su Londra: non posso però dare giudizi visto che non ci sono praticamente mai stato.
Non è un albergo di extra lusso ma merita di essere provato... e vi posso assicurare che non sono assolutamente di gusti facili in tema...",5,2017,05,01
111,¡Maravilloso!,"El hotel está muy bien situado a escasos 5 minutos de la estación de Liverpool Street con estupendas conexiones. El personal es súper amable, nos atendió Decio que fue encantador y servicial. El hotel está impecable, nuevo, limpísimo, las habitaciones están genial, las camas comodísimas, sencillamente inmejorable. El desayuno fue muy completo en un comedor con unas vistas de la City estupendas, muy muy agradable empezar así el día para disfrutar de esta maravillosa ciudad. ",5,2017,04,30
111,Comfort e accoglienza a Londra,"Accogliente ospitale elegante e confortevole. Personale giovane e disponibile e struttura impeccabile ... letto comodo e pieno di cuscini , camera piena di comfort e tecnologia , bagno di design e funzionale ... direi che manca solo il bidet!  Ideale per un soggiorno a Londra , ottima la posizione .",5,2017,03,22
111,Schickes Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Das Hotel ist zentral gelegen, die Zimmer modern eingerichtet, Badezimmer sehr stylisch und auf dem neuesten Stand. Betten sehr bequem. Frühstück im 10. Stock mit Blick über London und sehr gute Auswahl.

Mich hat gestört, dass man direkt auf das gegenüberliegende Gebäude schaut und abends bei Licht alle Vorhänge zumachen muss - ansonsten sutzt man auf dem Präsentierteller. Ebenso hat gestört, dass die Klimageräte ausserhalb des Hotels auch bei geschlossenmen Fenster deutlich hörbar waren.",4,2017,03,16
111,Una buena experiencia,"Encontre este hotel de casualidad cuabdo buscaba hoteles al lado de mi oficina y la verdad que me quede muy impresionado aparte de su magnifica localizacion es un hotel moderno y agradable.
Ademas el servicio al cliente es bueno especilmente del recepcionista español que me ayudo con todo lo que pudo.
En resumidas cuentas un hotel excepcional.",5,2017,02,18
111,Bellissimo hotel - buona posizione - unico neo...,"Ho soggiornato con il mio fidanzato 3 notti. È un hotel nuovissimo e molto molto bello. Ottima pulizia , staff gentile , disponibile verso tutte le esigenze. Posizione buona , a 5 min a piedi dalla stazione di Liverpool street e anche da quella di Old street . Abbiamo avuto un problema con la camera, affacciava su un atrio interno dove c'erano tutte le ventole dei condizionatori e il rumore ANche di notte era fastidiosissimo. Appena fatto presente ci hanno dato un'altra stanza , silenziosa senza alcun problema . Infine devo segnalare che avevamo prenotato tramite booking ad un determinato prezzo e invece all'arrivo ci hanno fatto pagare un prezzo superiore alla prenotazione pur non avendo scelto servizi aggiuntivi. Nel complesso consigliato. Ci ritornerei .",4,2017,02,13
111,Hotel bellissimo nuovo con bella vista sulla City,"Ho soggiornato 9 gironi,e devo ritenermi molto soddisfatto, grazie a Claudia, ragazza italiana responsabile alla Reception.I primi 2 gironi ho avuto continui problemi con il TABLET in camera,che per un'anomalia non dava la possibiltà di riordinare la camera, e dava problemi di accesso.Revisionato il TABLET, grazie a Caudia, sono stato cullato per tutto il soggiorno,con una colazione gratuita ( non era contemplata nella prenotazione),cioccolattini, una bottiglia di vino,e tanta premura....!
Un grazie a Claudia,continua cosi' che farai molta strada,e sei l'orgoglio Italiano, grazie, un 'abbraccio.",5,2017,02,11
111,wunderbarer tag in london  - a place to be.......,"ich bin mehr als angetan von diesem wunderbaren neuen Luxus - Hotel. 
Da ich per Auto nach London reiste, war mir eine etwas ""bessere"" Herberge wichtig. 
Der Preis war top und ich wurde positiv überrascht, bekam sogar 1 upgrade für ein grösseres Zimmer.... Lage, Zimmergrösse, Sauberkeit, Ausstattung, und das aufmerksame und hilfreiche Personal - es stimmt einfach alles. 
Das Hotel ist noch recht neu - und das merkt man auch....... habe mich selten so wohl gefühlt wie hier - komme sicher wieder....... absolut empfehlenswert...... !!!",5,2017,01,17
111,Ottimo hotel!,"Ottima posizione, comodo alla metropolitana, ma anche per muoversi a piedi.
Lo staff è abbondante e molto professionale.
La stanza è ampia, silenziosa e ricca di ogni confort. Il benvenuto è composto da una bottiglia di acqua naturale, un piatto di frutta fresca e una bottiglia di vino rosso, caffè Nespresso e biscotti per il tè. 
Il letto è un comodissimo king size. Nel bagno, di dimensioni generose, non manca nulla.
Riscaldamento e luci, con effetti multicolore selezionabili, sono comandati da pannelli domotici.
La pulizia della stanza è buona, un po' di polvere in eccesso, ma giustificabile dalla presenza della moquette per terra. L'igiene del bagno invece è perfetta.
A disposizione degli ospiti, con libera entrata, c'è un'area benessere con Spa.",5,2017,01,02
111,Eines der besten Hotels in der Square Mile,"Ich war jetzt drei Mal in diesem neu eroeffneten Hotel. Jedes Mal habe ich mich pudelwohl gefuehlt. Die Zimmer sind gross uns super chic und mit jeder Menge Technik ausgestattet. Das Ambiente gefaellt und es gibt eine Bar unten, die zumindest am Donnerstag abend mit DJ ausgestattet war und wo recht viel los war. Dazu noch eine Rooftop Bar, auch sehr schoen. Insgesamt chic, etwas dunkel, herausragender Serice.
Das Fruehstueck gefaellt ebenfalls. Preis / Leistung ist sensationell !!!",5,2016,12,12
111,Vacanza ponte 1°novembre,"Avevano prenotato presso altro albergo, ma al nostro arrivo ci hanno comunicato l'overbooking e ci hanno trasferito al Montcalm Royal London House. 
Aperto da solo due settimane, albergo di alto livello. Tutti molto cordiali e servizio impeccabile.
Purtroppo pero' al nostro ritorno in Italia, ci viene comunicato via mail che ci trattenevano l'acconto della carta di credito per consumi del frigobar, mai effettuati. Ho risposto alla mail comunicando l'errore, ma mai nessuno ha risposto e trattenendo l'acconto senza restituirlo. Credo questo sia poco chiaro e di sicuro non un buon servizio al cliente!!!",4,2016,12,10
111,Fin de semana en Londres,"Nos alojamos en este establecimiento por casualidad, pues hubo un problema al ser cancelada la habitación en London City Suites. A pesar del problema recibimos una excelente atención en dicho hotel y al no disponer de habitaciones suficientes fuimos alojados en el Royal London Hotel, de la misma cadena hotelera. El hotel está magníficamente decorado, el desayuno increíble y las habitaciones estupendas, aunque hay que familiarizarse con la omnipresente domótica.",5,2016,11,13
