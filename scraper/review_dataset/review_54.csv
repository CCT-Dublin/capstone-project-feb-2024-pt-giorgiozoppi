54,Uncomfortable but excellent location,"Although this 2 bedroom apartment is in a great location and has a well-equipped kitchen, the suite is very spartan with a dining table that seats only 4 (that was fine for our group but may not work for others). The living area has a pullout sofa that is uncomfortable for sitting and only one side chair that is extremely small and uncomfortable with a slip cover that slid off every time we sat on it. 
The second bedroom should accommodate 2 people. When we set up the second bed (easy to do) we had to push the beds together right against the wall or we couldn’t open the door or the closet doors. No room for suitcases (had to keep them in the living room on the side tables we pulled out of the bedroom); there was a large closet in that room to unpack - but again, we couldn’t fully open the doors unless the beds were against the far wall. 
The main bathroom had peeling surfaces on the sink cabinet. 
The beds were rather uncomfortable throughout . 
We contacted the manager about a master bathroom shower not draining and the toaster not staying down but no one responded or attended to the issues.
Also we were asked to take our garbage to the street upon leaving “for environmental reasons” - I work for an environmental organization and can assure you that there is no justification for that request other than the owners are not willing to pay the cleaning staff to do that job. In fact, since visitors don’t know exactly how to recycle in this community or even exactly which bins to use, the chance of being environmentally harmful is increased this way.
We wouldn’t recommend this unit. The building was well kept snd the location was wonderful- perhaps the other units are in better shape.",2,2023,10,10
54,Great location! Nice property!,"I rated our stay a 4/5 (it's a high 4) due to the fact that we couldn't check in as arranged: the keys were not left in the box. After an hour wait outside, after a long day of travel, were we able to gain access to our rental.  The rep on call, Victor, did a fantastic job tracking down the keys. 
We rented the 2bd/2ba ""executive"" in the Pedrera building.  It was actually quite nice.  A view of Tibidabo was a nice bonus. The location was great: steps from the metro, and a short walk away from Casa Mila and la Rambla de Catalunya (fantastic paseo & restaurants)
If I were managing this property, I would include extra TP & garbage bags *and* clear instructions on how to use the washer/dryer combo.  
Other than that, we would stay again.

54,Excelente Departamento con Vista Privilegiada,"Estuvimos en un departamento para 3 personas muy bien equipado y con amplio espacio. La ubicación en pleno Paseo de Gracia, con estacion de metro Diagonal a la puerta y la estación Passeig de Gracia a 4 cuadras es inmejorable. Teniamos una terraza desde donde se podía ver La Pedrera (Casa Mila) y mas lejos las torres de la Sagrada Familia. La atencion a la llegada fue muy buena. Creo que este departamento tiene una relacion precio-calidad muy buena. Recuerden que se debe pagar un suplemento por el aseo de la habitación. Lo recomiendo.",5,2020,01,31
