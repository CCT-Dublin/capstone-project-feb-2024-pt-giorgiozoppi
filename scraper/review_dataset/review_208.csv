208,Gem of a Hotel,"This hotel is just the right size and in the right place.  Not too big, but big enough to have a great bar and restaurant, and located near Baggot Street that takes you a lot Dublin treasures, the National Museum, Trinity University, the Archeology Museum, etc.   Baggot Street also has some good restaurants.  The Dylan staff is uniformly competent, friendly and charming.  On our taxi ride from the airport, our driver, a woman in her 60's pointed out a building a block away and said that it was The Royal City of Dublin Hospital, a ""baby hospital,"" where she had been born and where she had delivered her children.  The Dylan Hotel served as the dormitory of its nurses for a time.  Both the Hotel and the Hospital remain the piece de resistance of Dublin architect Albert Edward Murray.  Their distinctive redbrick accented by yellow terra cotta show off in the accompanying photos.",5,2024,10,17
208,Luxe Boutique at its BEST!,"This boutique hotel has so many characters that will fascinate you when you walk in and walk around. You see a combination of so many styles I that would not imagine to put together but it does look good. 
The attention to detail to give you the best experience possible. With us, they made our anniversary extra special by upgrading our room and delivered us a nice array of dessert. Kudos to the management and staff.",4,2024,10,15
208,An amazing week!,The Dylan was an absolutely amazing experience.  My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and every single one was better than before! We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and they made sure to make us feel like we were not only family but royalty.  The food is beyond reproach and the staff were just as amazing.  Thank you all for being great and congrats again on the Michelin Key!,5,2024,10,13
208,Touch of Class,"Thankyou so much to The Team @ The Fabulous Dylan Hotel !

Special Thanks to Andy , Vidas and Patrick for all TLC on our visit. Honestly this Hotel will not disappoint, it‚Äôs totally luxurious inside just touch of class about everything!

208,"Party of 80 , family and friends","The booking process was cold and transactional but the service and facilities , food and beverage , were excellent on the day supervised by Viadus who was unfailingly gracious and charming and who simply and happily fulfilled all the needs of the party",4,2024,09,30
208,So friendly,"We brought my mum for Brunch yesterday. The staff, the food, so impressive, so friendly. Love this hotel! We also had our dog with us that they made feel so welcome. We have been going to the Dylan for years and honestly can‚Äôt ever remember being anything less than impressed.",5,2024,09,22
208,The Dylan Hotel is a must-stay experience!,"My husband, best friends and I had the pleasure of staying at the Dylan for 4 nights in August. From the amazing service to the luxurious rooms to the fabulous restaurant, we felt lucky to get to stay at the Dylan. The rooms were spacious and simply lovely. The bathrooms had heated floors and towel warmers and a decadent rainfall shower. Each morning, we dined on the patio, and every afternoon (and post evening activities) enjoyed delicious cocktails in their bar. One night we even were able to get late night snacks delivered to our room. The most impressive thing was the level or service. Every morning, exit and entrance for the day and meander through the lobby, we were greeted with smiles and sincere acknowledgement. It was a treat and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.

I will say, the Dylan is out of the craziness of ""downtown"" Dublin. We took 15-minute Uber's to Grafton street/Jameson/Guiness (the more touristy locales), just for efficiency, but walking wasn't out of the question. We did walk most of the time. We loved the location because it was so quiet and peaceful and the walk into town was absolutely lovely. There are great bars and restaurants nearby - that we frequented often.",5,2024,09,16
208,Great stay - would recommend for a break to Dublin,"We stayed for 3 nights at the end of August. Just off Baggot Street which is good for restaurants, bars and public transport.  Had a great stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Cocktails and dinner were great too. It is a dog friendly hotel, which we don't mind at all as we have a dog in our family. However, we noted one guest had their dog on the sofa/soft seating which we didn't agree with. It did have a blanket to lie on, but we feel it wasn't appropriate.",4,2024,09,10
208,Fabulous first impression in Ireland!,Stayed here for two nights upon our arrival into Dublin Ireland. From our first front desk check in I knew it was going to be a home run. The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating. I would stay here again in a heart beat if I am Luckey enough to do so. Restaurant staff was excellent as was the food. Awesome breakfast!üòÅüòÅ,5,2024,09,08
208,Delightful Stay,"We choose the Dylan to not be in the noisy hubbub of the Temple Bar area. It was quiet and well designed. 
It was a 30 minute walk to Temple Bar pubs and restaurants where we met up with family & friends. 
Definitely a good value and a perfect fit!  
We would highly recommend!",5,2024,08,31
208,Thank you all!,"The company I worked for during the American football game, booked a space to assist our customers ( staying  at the hotel) 
The Dylan team prepared our space on arrival and they took care of me for the whole time. 
I want to thank reception team who's been so kind and organised providing me with the daily information and updates of our customers.  The porters who helped with the luggage and the questions our customers had. 
A big shout to  Raul , the concierge who's been so kind and supportive, helped our guests with all their queries and has been great company while being proactive and professional. 
A special thank you to the breakfast team and especially Patrick the F&B manager, who's  been so sweet and took care of me daily, he provided me with delicious breakfast, coffee and tea and ensure I am comfortable while on duty. 

I want to thank the Dylan Hotel team for recieving me and for taking care of our guests,which were very happy with the quality of their service, the beautiful design, amenities and location of the hotel. (10 minutes walk from Aviva stadium)",5,2024,08,25
208,Great hotel in Dublin,"Wonderful staff and service.

208,Special and Pampered!,"Great place!  Quiet and safe location!  Within a reasonable distance to tourist locations. You feel special and pampered.  Staff is friendly, the food was the best, the rooms and the entire hotel is clean.  You feel like a VIP!  Thank you for the best start of a two week vacation in Ireland!",5,2024,08,19
208,Charming hotel with excellent food,Lovely and charming hotel with excellent food and a friendly and efficient staff.  We will definitely be staying again.  Also had a lovely view from our room of a courtyard across the way. My daughter and I shared a couple of entrees and the kitchen split them for us which is always nice.  Everything we had was delicious especially the gnocchi.,5,2024,08,18
208,Amazing Hospitality!,"From the moment my husband and I arrived at The Dylan Hotel we were greeted with warm smiles and amazing service. Even though we arrived early, the staff made sure that we could check in to our room after our long flight. When we were leaving to travel to Killarney, the front desk went above and beyond to print out an ‚Äúon the way‚Äù itinerary and gave us waters for the drive. We stayed there another night for our last night in Ireland and they upgraded our room since it was our honeymoon. It was a fabulous surprise and the room was gorgeous. We would absolutely stay at this hotel again :) it is within fantastic walking distance as well to lots of great restaurants and pubs.",5,2024,08,02
208,"perfect location, perfect hotel","amazing hotel close to Dublin's city center located in a quiet street! the rooms are modern, very elegant, spacious and they offer extreme confortable beds. The breakfast is amazing: served at the table it fulfills all possible wishes, and can be taken inside or even outside on the terrasse. The concierges are very kind and helpful and a great help to discover the city. We have been enjoying a fantastic time in Dublin thanks to Dylan hotel!",5,2024,08,01
208,City Break,A beautiful hotel situated in a lovely neighbourhood. It‚Äôs a pleasant twenty minute walk into the city . The hotel has a charm of its own and staff were very attentive and accommodating. The breakfast was first class and gluten free options available.,5,2024,07,27
208,Amazing Stay!,"Stayed here for one night in June 2024 while attending the P!nk concert at Aviva Stadium. Nothing but fantastic things to say about this hotel. We stayed here our first night arriving in Dublin from the USA and we had the concert that night so of course worried jet lag would be an issue. We ordered the early checkin at 11AM, and sure enough we arrived even before 11 and they had our room ready. We were able to crash for a few hours in the room before getting ready for the concert on our first day in Europe. We are already talking about making this our ""layover hotel"" everytime we fly to Europe haha. The location was great - like a 1 5 minute walk to the stadium and a 5 minute walk to Pembroke Road which had a bunch of restaurants. We stayed in the Premium King room which had plenty of room for everything plus a nice sitting area and a wonderful bathroom. The air conditioning A/C was robust - nice and cool. The hotel bar was open until about midnight with a great drink selection. My only regret was that we didn't stay here for our entire Dublin stay. One tip - if attending an event at Aviva - plan to eat somewhere away from it. The restaurants near the stadium were slammed and the food at the stadium was awful!",5,2024,07,14
208,Hidden gem in Dublin!,"Fantastic hotel- hidden gem in Dublin!
Everything was perfect, except shower pressure so so weak, which was surprising given the standard of everything else!!
The staff were so very helpful, the lounge area quiet & intimate. A friend was meeting us in the foyer & was asked if they wanted a cup of tea while waiting! Loved the attention to detail",5,2024,07,10
208,Classy Dublin hotel,Highly recommend the Dylan hotel-it‚Äôs is a charming hotel with super friendly staff. Very comfortable room. Excellent breakfast. Great location in a quiet corner but short walk to Grafton street and Stephen‚Äôs green in the heart of the city.,5,2024,06,22
208,Our special place,"We have been coming to The Dylan Hotel for many years and I would like to say a massive Thank you to all the Staff working in The Dylan Hotel for yet another fabulous stay. 
The friendless and professionalism of the team super exceeds expectations !!! A five star hotel with five star service cannot wait to return !! Thank you for always making our trip away special x",5,2024,06,22
208,Superb luxury hotel in Dublin,"The Dylan is an elegant, classy hotel located at the end of a cul de sac (and across from a small neighborhood park), making it a quiet oasis. Yet, it is just a 15 minute walk to St. Stephens Park and roughly 35 to the Temple Bar district.  The staff is very welcoming and helpful (the concierge spent 20 minutes helping us buy tickets to a soccer match at the nearby Aviva Stadium).  Our room was very comfortable and nicely decorated, easily up to a 5 star standard. As noted above, it was very quiet at night. The Dylan ranks high on our list of smaller world class hotels providing a personal touch and a first rate experience.",5,2024,06,14
208,Start your vacation here.,"An excellent start to one‚Äôs visit to Dublin. We were three adults who experienced superior service and one of the most accommodating hotel staffs in years.  
Room was beautifully done, comfortable and relaxing. The restaurant team was on their game and their menu choices will satisfy any taste.  Recommend booking your stay with breakfast. Not only delicious and well prepared, it was so convenient before heading out each day.",5,2024,06,13
208,Tucked Away Hotel,The Dylan Hotel is awesome. The staff is very helpful and friendly. It is close to restaurants and shops. Breakfast was delicious. If we need a taxi the hotel would arrange it. The decor of the hotel was very nice. Just a great hotel tucked away within Dublin.,5,2024,06,10
208,A true 5 star experience,We have stayed many times in this hotel and it always lives up to the standard of a super friendly 5 star hotel. We had a lovely lunch on the front terrace on one of the days and it was hard to believe we were only a 20 minute stroll into the city centre as it was so peaceful. The staff go the extra mile for you and we are always made feel so welcome. The Dylan breakfasts are epic! I‚Äôd travel just for that experience alone. Well done once again to all who make this hotel standout!,5,2024,06,10
208,Exceptional introduction to Ireland,"First time in Ireland and stayed for 2 nights at the Dylan Hotel. We felt like royalty!! The reception staff go above and beyond to make you comfortable and assist you in any way they can. We arrived early and they stored our luggage so we could get to our tour on time. We returned in the evening to a gorgeous, large room with our luggage right there. The room was immaculately clean, the bed was the most comfortable in all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland, bathroom had heated towels and full assortment of bathing products.  Breakfast was such a serene experience with top notch food, relaxing music, and such attentive staff.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely to return in the future!!",5,2024,05,31
208,"Go here, if you can","This expensive hotel is totally worth it.  
The alert staff, the sensational room, and the wonderful location made the three day stay feel too short.
For me, this hotel defined a good  boutique hotel experience- small but not tiny, attentive, not fussy.",5,2024,05,30
208,Fabulous Hotel,"Can‚Äôt rate The Dylan Dublin highly enough!!           Had a fantastic 2 nights stay for my husband birthday at start of May and had the most fabulous time ! The staff from the minute you arrive guys on reception were so welcoming and always take time to truly welcome you . We have been coming to The Dylan for while now and I can honestly say I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Dublin , it‚Äôs right up there as one of the best !! Amazing personal touches make it stand out from the rest , we had beautiful hand made chocolates and fruit in our beautiful room which had had a makeover from last time , very tastefully decorated this boutique hotel has such a relaxing feel , with plenty of areas to eat or just enjoy cocktails and watch works go by , location is fab walking distance into Grafton street.  Staff are amazing nothing is to much trouble they even give my husband a birthday card and lovely gift on checking out for his birthday just so special! Thanks again to everyone on The Dylan Team !! We hope to visit very soon just love it .",5,2024,05,30
208,The perfect place to land!!,"We loved everything about our stay! The room was spacious, the staff was always very helpful, breakfast was great and the hotel itself is lovely. We enjoyed the location...we had a car and parked for free on the street over the weekend, and used a parking app for the weekday we were there.  Very easy to get to.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,05,23
208,Dylan,"The staff was wonderful.  The breakfasts were wonderful, the bar was very nice.  The location was great because we like to walk and it was within walking distance of a nice park, the Temple Bar area, and pubs.  The room was very spacious and quiet.",5,2024,05,23
208,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"One of the nicest hotel experiences in a long time. The hotel room was large with a sitting area and comfy bed. There were many other areas inside and out for reading and resting when done with a long day of exploring. The included breakfast was convenient and delicious. Front desk staff was super helpful with dinner recommendations. The hotel is conveniently located on a quiet street with a great pub, train station and Starbucks nearby. Highly recommend.",5,2024,05,13
208,Super friendly!,"This has to be one of the most friendly hotels where I have ever stayed.  From the moment we walked through the front door, at the reception, in the bar, in the restaurant, the staff were so helpful and always with a smile.  Impeccably clean throughout.  Bed was super comfortable with lovely pillows.  We stayed there for a wedding reception - quite how the chef and kitchen were able to serve a sit-down dinner of that quality to so many people beggars believe.  If I have one small criticism, the water pressure in our bathroom was very disappointing - when you are paying that much for a room, you kind of expect that you can enjoy a decent shower.",4,2024,05,06
208,Top class Hotel with the most pleasant staff.,Stayed in The Dylan hotel for a night as we were coming up to look at wedding rings in Dublin. We have never received such top class service in any other hotel and we are very fond on traveling. From the second we arrived we were greeted with 3 friendly receptionists that checked us in even though we were 4 hours early and took our bags to our room and took our keys to park the car (vallet service). We had to be at the Guinness factory for a tour so they quickly rang us a taxi and it was there within 2 mins. When we came back we were greeted with a lovely card and plate with desserts and a Happy Birthday note in chocolate as my birthday is in a few days. The next morning we went for breakfast and they had our bags brought out to the car and the car parked waiting at the front door for us. After I ordered breakfast i realised our appointment was half an hour early so told them we would leave the breakfast and they insisted to have it ready for us asap. Within minutes they had a beautiful breakfast sitting in front of us. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for top quality service and not to mention how beautiful this boutique hotel is and how close it is in a taxi to all popular tourist spots.,5,2024,05,04
208,Perfect spot,"This was our first time in Dublin. We were traveling with friends who had stayed here before and recommended the spot. It's a lovely small hotel, beautifully finished.. Its a bit off a main street which we liked. The staff was five star--all of them. The breakfasts were fantastic, served in a cheery sunlight room. Hats off to Diego, Marcella and Thomas!",5,2024,04,29
208,The Dylan is the Go-To Hotel for American Tourists,"This boutique hotel was amazing.  The staff goes out of their way to make you feel like royalty.  They are incredibly accommodating.  A special shout out to Patrick, who was the restaurant manager.  He regaled us with interesting facts about Dublin and gave us great advice on where to go and what to see.  He took such good care of us whether is was breakfast, drinks or dinner.  He was a gem.",5,2024,04,27
208,Great hotel in Dublin Ireland,"Great location to n a quiet street. They made our anniversary trip special with hand-written welcome cards, chocolates and small dessert bites. The included breakfast as very nice and they were easy to make modifications. We visited this hotel at the start of our trip and the final night. They welcomed us back on our second check-in and let us know they were happy to do anything we needed.",5,2024,04,18
208,Great friendly and attentive service.,"Diego and Raol at the front desk were very attentive and friendly guys...Great insights on how to visit the sites and restaurant recommendations around the city. 
 Food was great as well.  Bar was very comfortable and great drinks.  
 Will visit again.",5,2024,04,06
208,great stay,"Easily located, clean, elegant, comfortable.  Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.  Walkable to certain parts of Dublin, and easy to get a cab.
Amenities were wonderful and would staff there again!",5,2024,04,02
208,Great hotel in Dublin,"Love staying at the Dylan; always my first choice! The team are welcoming and polite. The food and breakfast are brilliant.
The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathrooms have great underfloor heating which is perfect for the cold January mornings 
Thank you for another wonderful stay",5,2024,01,31
208,New Years Break,"Stayed at the Dublin Hotel for four nights between Christmas and New Years and had an amazing time. My plane landed early from the U.S. and when I arrived at the Dublin, Belen, the front desk manager, was able to find a fantastic room so I could check in early, leave my luggage and start exploring Dublin. Belen and the whole staff were excellent and i cannot wait for my next visit to the Dylan and Dublin.",5,2024,01,15
208,Excellent,"My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights and we LOVED every moment. 

To start the communication via email before arrival was prompt then as soon as you walk in you are welcomed with a smile and the hotel was beautifully decorated with Christmas trees. The team every go one step further and bring chocolates up to your room, they were a treat. 

We also had breakfast included in our stay and that did not disappoint, the homemade pastries we great but the banana muffin was delightful. 

The team were extremely helpful if you needed directions or any ideas as to what to do while you were in Dublin (we had everything planned but heard them making suggestions to other guests) So I can confirm all guest are treated with the same attentiveness. 

Our room was clean and the bathroom had a heated floor (Love). The turn down service each night was lovely coming back to. 

We had a few nightcaps in the cocktail bar, the whisky sours were perfect!  We also order a late night cheese toasty via room service... was delicious and just what we needed. 

I must admit I was slight concerned as I read a few bad review but please do not listen the hotel is perfect for a weekend break. Close to the train station if you fancy heading to the coast for a day and a 20/30 walk or taxi into the town (we enjoy a walk) so was perfect. 

Unfortunately, we were to busy enjoying ourselves so we don't have any photos to add.  10/10 and we would stay again and recommend.",5,2024,01,09
208,A remarkable 5-star hotel experience!,"We booked our 4-night stay at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin as part of a 2 city trip (we started with 4 days in London) through Costco travel (great pricing!), and were absolutely delighted with our visit.

After a short hop on British Airways, we landed in Dublin, grabbed our bags, and cleared customs very quickly.

Our driver from Devine Chauffeurs (part of the package) was there to meet us and we promptly departed for the hotel, about a 6 mile journey.

Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted curbside by 2 people from the front desk staff, who ushered us in to complete a seamless check-in process while they transported our luggage to our room.

Notes on the room:

1. We stayed in a luxury suite on the first floor (which is actually the 2nd floor).  Our room had a nice king-sized bed, and two comfortable chairs at the food of the bed with a nice view of the TV on the wall, and a small table between them.  In addition, there was a small desk for working, along with another smaller padded chair to use here.  

On the wall to the left of the bed was a 2 door wardrobe with ample hangars, places for your shoes and other clothing items (which could also be placed in the drawers of the low boy under the TV), a safe to store your valuables (we left our passports and extra cash in here), and 2 lovely Terry cloth bathrobes with matching slippers for our use.  The TV has built in apps for YouTube and Netflix, although as Americans, our Netflix logon will not work in Europe.  There are also about 20 local channels available, but of course we did not come to Ireland to watch TV!

The bed was just the right combination of firm and plush, included 4 king-sized pillows of varying firmness, and a lovely down comforter which was just the right weight.  You also have access to set the climate control in the room.  This was helpful as we like to sleep in a cool room in both summer and winter.  Finally, the windows were huge and let in ample light, but also had black out curtains and shears for adjusting how much light you wish to let in.

2.  There was plenty of lighting, including ceiling lights by the door, lamps on each nightstand, and a floor lamp next to the wet bar/coffee set up.  There are multiple wall switches throughout the room.  There were also plenty of electrical outlets, and USB charging ports built into the light switches next to the nightstands.  (These were USB C ports, BTW, so fast charging of cell phones!).  Since Europe runs on 220/240V, we had bought an inexpensive voltage transformer on Amazon which worked perfectly with our laptop computer.

3.  The bathroom was larger than the typical European hotel bathroom, so my wife and could be in there together without running into each other, and included a toilet and sink (no bidet), a long narrow bathtub and shower combo, and a rainfall overhead shower.  Hot water and water pressure were ample, although I did miss the handheld shower which we had in London.  And for the life of me, I cannot figure out why European hotels use the half-glass shower door.  So much water ends up on the floor that you go through a lot more towels just wiping up the excess water.  The bathroom also had a towel warmer, great for drying off wet towels and wrapping yourself in the soft heat after bathing.  It was a bit tricky, but we finally figured out there is a separate switch on the wall outside the bathroom near the floor that you must hit to turn on the towel warmer, the temperature of which can then be adjusted on the rack itself.

Overall, the room was quiet (although we were there during the off-season in November and can't speak to what it is like when the hotel is full), the housekeeping is prompt and responsive, and turn down service is provided each evening.  The entire hotel is nicely modern and appointed, and truly beautiful.  We slept like rocks after each busy day of touring Ireland!

Notes on Food service:

1. After checking in, we promptly headed down to the Eddison Bar off the lobby to grab our first ever pint of Guinness in Ireland, and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere.  There were ample beers on tap, and a vast selection of wines and liquors.  The bar has seating for about 8 at the bar itself, and numerous cocktail rounds and comfortable chairs surrounding a central fireplace.  We saw quite a few people conducting business and relaxing on vacation here.  Service was prompt and courteous, and a free copy of the Irish Times newspaper was provided each morning (I'm old school, so this was an unexpected and pleasant surprise!).  

2.  Breakfast each morning was included with our package, and we enjoyed a wide selection of traditional and Irish breakfast items each morning in the Eddison restaurant, located behind the bar.  Table service was provided, so no standing in line at a buffet was necessary.  All items were made to order, the coffee was piping hot, and the food delicious and served at the correct temperature.

3.  On Tuesday afternoon, we had a reservation for High Tea in the Ruby Room.  This is a very cozy and quite elegant room just off the Eddison Bar area.  They serve craft cocktails in a luxuriously appointed room each evening.  Our tea service did not disappoint.  It is really a feast fit for a king.  There are ample tea options available (I had the Gunpowder and Mango option), and the tea sandwiches and various pastries and desserts were magnificent.  We added a bottle of Merlot as well, and it was just a spectacular meal, and we had to work to finish all the food!

4. On our final night, we had booked dinner in the Eddison restaurant, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  The filet I had was perfectly cooked and came with a lovely red wine reduction sauce.  My wife and father in law enjoyed one last night of fish and chips which were piping hot and delicious.  and my mother in law enjoyed the salmon.  We had also shared a bread selection and baked Brie appetizer that was lovely.  A great bottle of Merlot accompanied our meal, which we topped off by sharing a warm brownie with vanilla ice cream.  Note:  There is also a lovely outdoor patio on which to dine during the warmer weather periods.

As we were enjoying our dessert, Patrick, the Food and Beverage GM/Sommelier/everything man (who we are convinced works 24/7/365!) stopped by our table to chat for a few minutes.  We told him how much we had enjoyed our stay, the food, and the top-notch professional hospitality from every single member of the team at the Dylan.  He was very gracious, shared some war stories of his many years in the Food Service and Hospitality industries, and thanked us numerous times for staying.  When we mentioned that we had a 5:30 AM pickup for the airport in the morning, he immediately offered to have coffee and pastries available for us even though breakfast was not served until 6:30.  We politely declined, but were again blown away by this example of the way 5-star hotels should treat their guests.  To Patrick and your team, we say a hardy thank you for such excellent service by you and your team, and can say that whatever they are paying you, it is not enough!

Notes on location:

1. The Dylan is located in a quiet cul-de-sac, a short walk to an area that is mixed use  business, residential, and retail/restaurants.  As this is Dublin, there are some 700 pubs to choose from, so it's easy to run into both tourists and locals wherever you choose to eat and drink.  I won't review those establishments here, but will summarize by saying we were never disappointed regardless of our choice.  
It's a safe and secure area, and we enjoyed nightly strolls through the various streets trying to walk off our meals.  We even got caught up in the huge swarm of humanity who were walking to the stadium one evening to see the Irish National Football team play a friendly vs. New Zealand.  European football fandom is every bit as zealous as that for American Football in the states, I can tell you that!

2.  We bought a 24-hour pass on the Big Bus Hop on, Hop off tourist vehicle.  The nearest stop was about a 20 minute walk from our hotel which was quite pleasant.  The full loop takes you through all the major tourist attractions, and takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes to complete.  It's a great starting point to get the lay of the land, and then plan out your visits.  We took it to the Guinness plant at St. James Gate, and then rode it back to the National Art Gallery Stop and walked home after visiting the museum.  The next few days, it was actually more affordable and faster to take an Uber/Taxi to our destinations and then walk to nearby attractions.  

Conclusion:

We highly recommend the Dylan hotel.  It is a beautiful place, filled with beautiful people in a beautiful city in a beautiful country.  To the staff at the Dylan:  thank you so much for making our stay so magnificent.  Every 5 years we celebrate our milestone wedding anniversaries with a big trip.  For our 10th, we went to Oahu for a week.  For our 15th, we spent 8 days in Rome and Florence.  Our 20th was this trip to London and Dublin, and we were not disappointed.  While London definitely has a big city vibe, Dublin, being much smaller, felt like home to us.  Our taxi driver, born and raised in Dublin said: ""We like our police, we like our government, and we like to drink.  It makes it a great place to live.""  It also makes it a great place to visit!

We will be back to Dublin sooner than later, and will definitely be staying at the Dylan next time.

P.S.  While I did not include photos in this review (my wife took all of those!), I can tell you that those I have seen online posted by the hotel on its website and by other reviewers are accurate.

208,Lovely Hotel with great Staff,"This is such a lovely Hotel, quiet and relaxing. The decor is stylish and contemporary.
The Dylan staff are so helpful and friendly. 
We Loved it and will be back.
Highly recommended and is in a very convenient location, central and close to all the sights.

208,Fabulous stay,"We had an amazing stay celebrating our son's birthday. 
Rooms are beautifully appointed, newly refurbished and with colorful selected item and tones which brighten up the space. Spotlessly cleaned.
The toiletries are also amazing. 
Delighted to see Emma in the restaurant.  She is so welcoming. 
Breakfast the following morning was just divine. Excellent service and very good coffee.

208,The best...ever?,"Our stay at the Dylan was more than we could have imagined, and an experience we‚Äôll remember forever. The rooms here are perfection ‚Äî beautifully designed with such attention to detail it had us wowed at every new discovery. And the staff? Perfection again! Gracious and professional, exceedingly accommodating, and genuinely happy to help and make sure we were happy with our stay, our meals, our experience. We especially loved Patrick, the food/beverage manager, and the stunningly beautiful hidden gem called the Ruby Room. Patrick was like a long lost friend, genuinely happy to see us and joyfully share his encyclopedic knowledge of whiskeys, wine and countless other things, including great coastal towns to visit! The meals were fantastic, from my fianc√©‚Äôs ‚Äúbest fish and chips I‚Äôve ever had in my life‚Äù to the (again perfect) filet and beef cheeks, to the boeuf bourguignon (yay for chef Paul Quinn and executive chef Mark Bodie!) ‚Äî all delivered with exceptional service. We were very well taken care of here. The Dylan is a rare find, and a very hard place to leave. But we‚Äôll be back soon‚Ä¶that‚Äôs for sure!

208,I recommend the Dylan.,"Exceptional staff, first rate service and care.  Beautiful hotel about a 20 minute walk to the main sites to see.  Top notch room service and an exquisite lounge with a first rate bar staff.   

The only things that cost them a star were really sub par service and food from the hotel restaurant (I feel there was maybe a language barrier issue, and they were deeply apologetic), and the lighting in the bathroom was very dim.  No grab bars in the shower made me very nervous walking out of it on wet tile.  Absolutely nothing to grab if you slip.",4,2023,10,23
208,A Gem of a Hotel in superb location,"I stayed at the Dylan for a weekend to celebrate a friends 50th birthday. From the moment I arrived, I stepped into an oasis of luxury set in a stunning building. I was a step away from the heart of Dublin in this gem of a hotel.  From valet parking to a welcoming, easy and quick check in. My room was so comfortable with beautiful furnishings, a gorgeous balcony and a splendid bathroom. Breakfast was delicious and the outdoor terrace area was a haven to catch up with friends. The staff were so warm and welcoming, assisting in every way possible to ensure our weekend was one to remember. I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning. ",5,2023,10,16
208,AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This hotel had expert customer service! Any recommendation, attention to detail was stupendous. Location was great too! Highly recommend. If you like to be secluded from the party but close to it, stay here!",5,2023,10,16
208,Best Hotel in Dublin. Hands Down.,"Blown away by the genuine kindness of the staff. Every moment get as if they were pleased to do anything for us. We arrived at 6am from the US & the let us take a 4 hour nap in their library , tip-toeing in and to not disturb us. We never felt more at home. We stayed 2 nights our first stay and 1 night. Both rooms were impeccable. The beds comfy, the food good. We will be back. Easily the best hotel in Dublin!",5,2023,10,13
208,Amazing Hotel with brilliant staff,"We recently had a small family wedding reception at the beautiful Dylan Hotel. From the time we met with Vicky (Sales and Events Executive) we knew we had made the right decision in choosing the hotel. All the staff were so accommodating. The meal was delicious and the wine just beautiful. Some friends came to join us in the evening in the Ruby room bar, again the staff were so helpful. It‚Äôs location is ideal, as we are both from Dublin it was important to us to have our reception in such a historical part of Dublin, the canal setting was perfect for pictures. We would highly recommend The Dylan Hotel. ",5,2023,10,12
208,The Dylan is a great hotel!,"I stayed at the Dylan for 4 nights at the end of September for my 50th birthday with some friends of mine.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The hotel was impeccably clean, the staff were so helpful and friendly.  They really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was enjoyable.  The room was so nice.  We had breakfast at the hotel every day and it was wonderful.  So many choices and it was very fresh.  I loved all the different lounge areas you could sit in and enjoy as you really felt as if you were hanging out in a friends living room.   I highly recommend the Dylan and will go back with out hesitation.",5,2023,10,10
208,A haven in Dublin City ,"Amazing stay with a group of friends for a 50th. Rooms were gorgeous and perfect for sharing and the hotel is such a haven in Dublin with so many nice spaces to enjoy outside. 
Breakfast was incredible and the service at breakfast was such a treat with nothing too much trouble.
I love this hotel as you can do all the things Dublin has to offer and completely relax and chill in this space after a day out. ",5,2023,10,09
208,FAULTLESS,"My best friend & I stayed at The Dylan this weekend & I honestly cannot fault anything about the hotel or it‚Äôs staff.

Greeted by warm & friendly reception staff, entrance to the hotel is stunning, toilets & interior design is immaculate.

Firstly the hotel is stunning, decorated to the highest of standards and the rooms are beautiful, complimentary bath robes, soft bath sheets, beds are gorgeously comfortable and the pillows are fantastic quality, spacious bathroom with fabulous bath & shower.

Room service food was IMMACULATE can highly recommend the Steak Sandwich with parmesan fries (to die for) & the beef stew & the champ mash‚Ä¶UNREAL. steak cooked to perfection, nothing was too much trouble.

The staff here are honestly some of the nicest most genuine people I‚Äôve had the pleasure of meeting, kind & knowledgeable and willing to help, Patrick who we saw at breakfast was AMAZING such a warm & interesting man who shared his stories with us over what i can only describe as the breakfast of dreams, the quality is unbeatable & service is 10/10 - the chef cooked everything to perfection & the portion sizes were so generous, we even had complimentary eggs royal and avocado to try as a treat - so appreciated it was delicious.

We cannot wait to return The Dylan is 100% my go-to hotel now when we stay in Dublin, you will be hard pushed to find anywhere else that ticks every single box & i literally cannot say one bad thing about this place & its staff you guys are doing a fantastic job - thank you so much for making our stay just perfect‚ú®",5,2023,10,09

208,Nice boutique hotel,"Very nice stay, position is quiet and silent. Very good shower and huge comfortable bed. Breakfast enjoyable and plenty of choices. Gentle and nice staff. The restaurant is a little noisy, but food is great. ",4,2023,09,13
208,Good location for us,"A lovely boutique hotel (in my newly acquired Irish accent). The rooms are decorated very modern and so comfortable. There is the marble tiled bathroom with huge soft towels, a big wooden armoire, the Nespresso machine, the table and chairs, the super comfortable bed, to name a few things on the the plus side about the room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast was delicious and the bar was well stocked and reasonably priced. The location was great for us, located on a quiet cul-de-sac in a upscale neighborhood, allowed us to open a window and enjoy the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù Irish air at night. The proximity to Aviva Stadium and Merrion Square, where we caught the hop-on hop-off bus, was only a 15 minute walk. And, of course, just around the corner there were local pubs. The down sides were that the bathroom was small with no place to even lay out you toothbrush on the sink countertop. Plus, if you intentions are to hang out in Temple Bar, it‚Äôs a 15 Euro taxi cab away. But we really enjoyed our stay here and recommend the place. Tip: the rooms very widely, Queen, king even what I would call a suite. Some have AC, some do not. So ask for a room to fit your needs and have them show it to you before you unpack.",5,2023,09,02
208,Absolutely great hotel,"It was our first stay in Dublin to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary.
This is truly a boutique hotel with lovely furnishings with helpful and friendly staff- Patrick in the restaurant has such a positive attitude and took time to recommend places we could visit.
The hotel has a lovely main bar, 2nd cosy bar, library, restaurant and small lobby area.
Luckily we were allocated a bedroom in the older part of the hotel , which was simply stunning- a lovely colour scheme with everything you need.
The breakfast was freshly cooked and delicious and the bar food was reasonably priced for the quality.
We were due home on bank holiday Monday and sadly our flight was cancelled- we therefore came back to the hotel for another 2 nights before our flight home. This time we were allocated a room in the newer part of the hotel which whilst a lovely size for us it was not as nice as the first room.
It‚Äôs about a 10 min taxi ride into the centre of Dublin- located in a very quiet part of town which leads to a very relaxed stay.
Would definitely recommend if you are looking for somewhere special.",5,2023,08,31
208,Very good but some improvements are needed to move to excellent,"Counting among the happy few traveling a lot and being used to high standard hotel, we can only recommend the Dylan, though some improvements would be needed. The service, the kindness of everyone, the food, the bar, the bedroom are definitely the good points even if the toilets are located in the bathroom. The breakfast is far below average, disappointing and not up to the standard of a 5*. The service ‚Äú √† la carte‚Äù is not impressive, the choice limited and the quality of the pastries is bad. Such a breakfast for the price we paid is just unacceptable. A bad mark needs to be given to the absence of any sustainability policy compared to other 5* hotels where we usually stay. In those times of climate change, hotels need to be transparent and announce a clear statement. Small plastic packaging for bathroom amenities need to be replaced by small containers, house keeping should not let the lights on after cleaning up, towels don‚Äôt need to be replaced every day, etc ‚Ä¶
For those visiting the city, the hotel is not located in the center but buses stops are located within 5 minutes walking",4,2023,08,11
208,"Great food, wonderful staff, perfect bar!","It was our first time in Dylan Bar and we were amazed! Bar might be the best cocktail bar in Dublin. The staff was so friendly and food was great. Special shot to Umit, he is a perfect mixologist and he has some signature cocktails on the cocktail menu. Highly recommended!!",5,2023,07,19
208,Disappointing room,"We have returned to The Dylan on many occasions, but this time we were disappointed.  We stayed in a Luxury Queen room and on the basis of the website description we were expecting a front facing room with heritage features. We were given a gloomy room facing a brick wall and the  only heritage feature we saw was a sash window through which we could look at the brick wall. Breakfast was lovely. We also had dinner in the hotel and the risotto was good though the fish and chips meal was disappointing. Restaurant staff would have benefitted from additional training in bringing the food and drinks to the correct tables.  On checkout the staff at reception assured us that the misleading room description on the hotel‚Äôs website would be sorted, but I notice 3 weeks later that the Luxury Queen rooms are still described as front facing with enviable neighbourhood views. Ours was not a 5 star experience.",2,2023,07,12
208,Great hotel in an out-of-the-way location,"The accommodations were wonderful and the staff very helpful.  Especially enjoyed the little tray of pastries and yogurts with breakfast.  The location is a bit of a walk from anything tourist related but was actually an easy walk to 3Arena (which was the main point of our visit.)  However, one of the fringe benefits of its location was that we got to wander through St. Stephen's Green a couple of times which was a lovely stroll with all of the lush greenery.",5,2023,06,22
208,A gem in Dublin,"What a wonderful hotel in a beautiful neighborhood. Check in was a breeze; staff was extremely friendly and efficient.  Dining (we only ate breakfast) was lovely as well.  Again, everyone we encountered was just delightful. Our room was spacious and well appointed. Bed was extremely comfortable. Cannot say enough good things about the Dylan. Hope to visit again soon. ",5,2023,06,20
208,5-Star Staff,"To be honest I am not sure how the Dylan garnered a 5-star rating.  If you notice, the rate is substantially less than other 5-star properties even in Dublin.  I think the hotel would be better served with a lower rating so expectations are not set at a level that's impossible to meet. I just don't think this is a 5-star property.

That said, I rated our stay as excellent because I  raised a number of issues by writing an email when we were still in the room summarizing my concerns.  We had only been there for 5-hours (we we staying only one night after a two-week trip).  Diego made adjustments to our bill when we checked out and Belen made additional adjustments after we had returned home.

The staff in general was quite friendly and helpful.

I would definitely consider staying at the Dylan in Dublin again but, if you are looking for a 5-star property and are willing to pay for it, I'm not sure this is the place.,",5,2023,06,11
208,Best hotel in Ireland!,"Best hotel ever. The Irish people are so kind, it‚Äôs hard to believe how lovely and helpful they are. The hotel staff was really one of a kind. Amazing people, ready to help us with everything, always smiling and kind - unbelievable. The most amazing person was Patrick. If you want to spend some time in Ireland, be sure to go to the Dylan and meet Patrick. He knows so much about everything, and willing to help with everything you might need! We‚Äôll definitely revisit there!!!",5,2023,06,10
208,Nice boutique hotel ,"We stayed here only for 1 night when we just arrived. The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood. I don't think it's very near to city center compares to Conrad Hilton which we moved to and stayed for 3 nights. The room is quite spacious. Breakfast was probably the best in the 2 weeks we're in Ireland. Staff were friendly.  There's a welcome plate of chocolate and fruits when we arrived which was very nice. Even though the hotel was fully booked but we did not feel that it's crowded at breakfast room.  There's air conditioning in the room so it's not stuffy. Shower only which we preferred.  The room is a bit on the dark side.... not enough lights for us but maybe okay for others.  Mini refrigerator, Nespresso coffee machine, and free Wi-fi. ",4,2023,06,01
208,Weekend treat,"Stayed in the Dylan Hotel on the May bank holiday weekend and it was just an amazing experience from check in to check out!

Valet parking was excellent and lovely welcome on arrival, room was very decent size and very clean and comfortable. 

Breakfast was absolutely amazing and would go back at any time - all the breakfast restaurant staff was very attentive, friendly and really made us to feel even more special.

Had a very smooth check out and our car was right out side.

An absolutely treat for the weekend staying at the Dylan.

Thank you to all at the Dylan Hotel for making us feel special and for a memorable stay

208,Jackhammer Noise AWFUL,Was called ‚ÄúThe American‚Äù by the front desk staff while dealing with a jackhammer that was going on and all the noise . Was advised they were ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù and all rooms affected . They refused to give me a refund . Will deal with that after I get back to the US  . Stayed at The Mont‚Äîmuch better!,2,2023,05,15
208,Fabulous stay and incredibly responsive staff.,"We had a lovely stay! We had an issue with our room when we arrived late on our first night. Even though the hotel was full, the staff was incredibly helpful and responsive, in helping us to solve our issue. Plus, the breakfasts were incredible!",5,2023,04,20
208,Not a five star experience,"This is not a five star hotel by any means. We checked in and the computer system was down (see this in so many reviews). So we waited twenty minutes, after confirming we had two beds. Got to room, one bed. 

Tv was broken. Bathtub drain was broken so couldn‚Äôt take a bath, my robe was dirty and ripped, mirror in bathroom was dirty and cracked, there was no room for suitcases once the bed had been separated into two. Breakfast was just so-so. The hotel is very pretty, but ridiculous issues and not one apology. Save your money.",2,2023,04,16
208,The only bad in an otherwise awesome vacation,"Let me start by saying that this is a hotel to be avoided, if you have a choice. We had a one night stay booked at the Dylan hotel as part of a Costco travel package. While the hotel itself is in a good location and the room was comfortable,  the service and hospitality of the staff is greatly wanting, especially if you consider they are billed as a 5 star hotel. Right from the early check -in that was provided like a huge bonus, the attitude of the staff was in stark contrast to the warmth and hospitality we received on the rest of our vacation. Even if one were to overlook attitude, which can be subjective, there was a mistake in the final invoice that I noticed after our return and emailed them about.  The response correcting the error was amazingly patronizing, given the error was on their part and went to the extent  of suggesting that I was complaining about a missing amenity plate that was actually sent. In short, our  stay at The Dylan hotel was the only part of our  holiday in Ireland  that I would change if we were to repeat the experience. ",2,2023,04,03
208,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff","We got such warm, attentive service at this beautiful hotel. Everything was perfect. Our room was so lovely and so comfortable. The staff were incredible, especially the lovely lady at reception, who was very kind to my little daughter. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,03,26
208,"Beautiful, fun, timeless, accommodating ","The Dylan Hotel exceeded our expectations! The room, food, service, staff were all superb. The room was magical, bathroom was beautiful, and the hotel as a whole was gorgeous. The hotel as a whole was quite cozy yet chic and modern. I love the multiple rooms in the lobby to be able to relax or do work if needed. The location of the Dylan hotel is amazing. About a 10-15 minute Uber ride to any major touristy places or shops. Great restaurants within walking distance. The staff are top tier!! They were there to offer recommendations, checking to see if we‚Äôre well and taken care of, they were a pleasure to say the least. ",5,2023,03,12
208,"If you are used to 5 star international hotels, don't stay here","So I read the reviews and booked 5 nights at the Dylan, upon arrival they had not received my booking so while the team at the front desk tried to sort this out they told me to wait at the bar. When I came back they'd sorted my room and made a scene like they did me a favour (I was paying over ¬£3,000 for the short stay).

Fine so I went up to the room and I couldn't believe it, the room was dirty, like it hadn't been cleaned and it overlooked a neighbouring pubs beer garden. I asked to be moved, which they did efficiently but by this stage I'd been in the hotel for two hours and still hadn't settled in, the next room, while large was decorated in what can only be described as ""Celtic Tiger Chic' thoroughly dated golds on gold on beige. I was starting to think that this was hilarious now and when I saw the tiny tiny bathroom attached to the room I rang down and cancelled the rest of my stay - where I booked a superior hotel.

As the title says, if you travel a lot and are used to and enjoy 5 star hotels - you will be disappointed.",2,2023,03,07
208,Fabulous staff. Charming hotel.,"The staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. They were friendly and helpful. The food was good and the hotel is full of charm. The location was great for us. Easy to get to ucd, where our daughter was studying and to the city center. The view from our room was pretty, the bed was very comfy, and our room was a good size and VERY quiet. We will return!",5,2023,02,21
208,Special occasion,"We recently had an amazing stay at The Dylan Hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They were so warm and welcoming right from the time we arrived. Our room was so clean. The Decor was exceptionally nice. It was the best hotel room we have ever stayed in . This hotel is exceptional the attention to every detail was amazing. The bed was so comfortable as for the linen it was so clean and crisp. Your bed is turned down at night for you and water and a sweet left beside your bed. Breakfast was fabulous again attention to detail catered for all tastes . It was unique way to serve breakfast a bit like afternoon tea . Newspapers there to read too. The food was delicious.I went for pancakes they were delicious. I would certainly have no hesitation going to stay there again . I would have loved to stay longer. I look forward to my next visit at the Dylan hotel. 10/10 for friendly and helpful staff, food ,cleanliness , the room the amenities the areas inside and outside, the bar etc we had an amazing stay . Such a wonderful atmosphere in the hotel. Fabulous hotel.",5,2023,02,18
208,Dylans Birthday at the Dylan,Just wanted to say a big thank you to all of the Dylan team who looked after us yesterday evening. We had a an amazing experience in the Ruby Room with some delicious cocktails for our friends birthday. It was very special and we really appreciate it! Cant wait to visit again!,5,2023,02,17
208,Top class!,"Lovely boutique hotel,close to city center, Very nice room.excellent service all round.great location.highly recommend. Lovely library ,restaurant, lobby area.reception staff exceptional,very friendly and welcoming.top class!",5,2023,02,06
208,"Lovely, elegant, and warm - fantastic location and welcoming, memorable staff","We had an amazing stay at the Dylan Hotel - the entire staff was so generous with our family, befriending my two boys and turning our two nights into Dublin into a highlight of the trip. They were wonderfully cheerful and kind - bright lights who made you want to bask in their glow. (And my boys did, hovering around them, finding excuses to visit and chat with Ines and Emilly, writing them notes, etc. And they wrote us a goodbye note!) When we were leaving another member of the staff (her name is escaping me!) gave my boys glass bottle Fantas, which blew my kids' minds. The hotel itself is elegant and pretty, with lovely small details - like candlelit lanterns in the entryway and board games in the library. It‚Äôs in an elegant, pretty part of town with wonderful restaurants and pubs. Just enough outside of the tourist attractions to feel like you are seeing the Dublin the locals appreciate, while still being only a pleasant walk away from Trinity College, Dublin Castle, etc. ",5,2023,01,23
208,Beautiful hotel,"What a nice hotel! The food was great, the bar was even better. We loved the atmosphere and the decor. It‚Äôs in the perfect location. Everyone is quite accommodating! I highly recommend staying at this hotel. We were guests at a wedding and the whole wedding party stayed here. It was perfect.",5,2022,12,28
208,Fabulous bar!!,"We just popped into the bar and had a seat. We didn‚Äôt expect such an incredible atmosphere and cocktails! Umit is the best mixologist I‚Äôve ever seen. He has an enormous knowledge of wines and cocktails. Umit, If you notice this review thank you for the best bar experience we ever had. Highly recommended!! ",5,2022,12,13
208,Dylan in Dublin,"Had a great stay at the Dylan. The staff were always incredibly friendly and helpful. They gave the hotel a very warm, personal feel that you don't often get when traveling. 

We entered our room to a handwritten note and a plate full of tasty desserts. Definitely a nice way to end a long day of traveling. 

The rooms themselves were large in size and very comfortable. The beds were cloudlike. 

The only thing to note would be the wifi. It was a little hit or miss depending on the time. Other than that, we had the perfect experience.",5,2022,11,12
208,Awesome Hotel,"This boutique hotel passed all my expectations and then some.  The decor throughout the hotel and in the rooms is beautiful and designed well.  In addition, the staff is incredibly helpful in the dining room and at the front desk.  The food is fantastic and the breakfast, included in the room price if you choose, is a must and is delicious.
Not too far of a walk to the center of town or an easy cab ride.  I enjoyed much more than the fancy, large hotels.",5,2022,10,31
208,"C√©ad M√≠le F√°ilte (""One hundred thousand welcomes"")","When you stay at the Dylan, you'll understand firsthand the meaning of C√©ad M√≠le F√°ilte--the common Irish Gaelic greeting or salute.  My wife and I absolutely loved this hotel, and our three nights stay there.  The staff were so welcoming, so hospitable--especially Sanda (hope I didn't misspell her name).  The included hot breakfasts were superb.  I'm a big fan of the traditional Irish breakfast but the menu had something for the most discriminating of palates.  For most hotels, their complimentary Wi-Fi is notoriously bad but not at the Dylan--it's excellent and very reliable.  Multiple pubs and restaurants are close by (as in walking distance, ~5 minutes).  Access to public transportation (city buses) and all of Dublin is a very short walk from the hotel's front door.  The bus system is very clean and very efficient.  We used the public transpiration feature in the Google Maps app which lets you know bus numbers and schedules in real time.  Try it once and you'll be an expert.  Amazing!  If you prefer to just walk, you're only about a 20-30 minutes' walk to the heart of the city.  I would definitely want to stay at this hotel on a return trip to Dublin.  Now a word about the ATMs in Ireland.  When we travel, we always like to get local currency from ATMs rather than go to a bank cashier or foreign currency exchange vendor.  In Ireland, if you use the kind of ATMs you find at the airport or in convenience stores around town, expect to pay a very hefty transaction fee (8 - 10%) if you're using a U.S. bank card.  Instead, go to a bank ATM--like the Bank of Ireland, or Ulster or AIB. We found a Bank of Ireland ATM close to the hotel (about 10-minute walk) but if you're just out and about seeing the sights, you'll run across these types of ATMs.  You'll find their transaction fees are minimal.",5,2022,10,25
208,"Dylan Hotel, Dublin, Ireland did not disappoint!","The Dylan Hotel and its staff exceeded my expectations.  Being greeted by Sanda and her staff was a breath of fresh air from checking in to checking out.  This amazing lady was a ray of sunshine and has the kind of personality and customer service that will satisfy any visitor.  Our three nights there could not have been any better, the room, food, and pampering we received from the staff were all impeccable. Giselle who was in training, under Sanda, was also wonderful.  Thank you, all, for such a lovely stay.",5,2022,10,22
208,Excellent service!,"Just had lunch here. All the staff were so extremely helpful when I explained I was time restricted as I was meeting my daughter on her lunch break from work. We enjoyed two delicious meals here with no time delays. Staff were all lovely and happy, in fact I'd come back again for the service alone...so obvious they enjoy working here. Dining room is cheerful, comfortable & beautifully decorated. ",5,2022,10,20
208,Great experience at The Dylan ,The Dylan exceeded my expectations from the moment we checked into the hotel. From checking in to breakfast and visits to the bar. Umit and the rest of the staff exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended ,5,2022,10,13
208,What a fabulous Hotel,"Where do I start ! What another amazing weekend @ The Dylan Hotel honestly this hotel is just fabulous!!! We have now become firm regular visitors to this stunning boutique hotel as we can‚Äôt recall anywhere where we get such spoiling and attention to detail on every visit.

Not many hotels give this personal touch , the Dylan treat there guests so special!!!! Our suite was stunning and every room has its own individual style!

Massive Thankyou to lovely Sanda at front dest , on checkout she give myself and my daughter a gift voucher for afternoon tea on our next visit !! How amazing is this ! 5 stars is not enough!!!! Thankyou to everyone @ The Dylan you are the best team !!",5,2022,10,08
208,Meh - trying too hard,"Stayed 3 nights for work - high-end hotel and room, very old-school layout between old and new buildings. Trendy look - 5 star vibe, but service was off, and main issue was with room. Incredibly well appointed but very noisy as overlooked gardens of nearby pubs - had to use calm noise machine to cancel out the noise as the aircon was not loud.

Breakfast was shambles - just had weetabix and yoghurt and took 20 mins to come, no idea why. Staff were friendly but useless (didn't have sugar for cereal on table - tok 5 mins to get from downstairs!).

Gym facilities are odd - basically in nearby building in PT gym, run down and not to the standard you would expect of a 5* hotel. It did mean there was a full squat rack, but as there was a PT session in next room it was basically just me on own in large space and if anyone else wanted to use facilities would be odd.

Staff on reception were constantly chatting to each other, maintenace staff etc - every time I walked down the corridor approaching reception you could hear them talking - and at times was 4+ milling around the tiny reception which was awkard.

On check out my bill from one guiness at bar had not bee settled properly and had random other bill on - they sorted, but was not a great experience.

Overall I don't think I would want to stay again if given the choice - despite this being a corporate hotel and paying ‚Ç¨300+ per night, and close to office.",2,2022,10,06
208,"Very cool place, with a lot of style","First rate experience here, the best stay in our three country short trip to Europe. Very walkable to everything, excellent restaurant. Generous sized room, mini bar was full, TV actually worked (unlike some other hotels on our trip!). Would stay here again for sure.",5,2022,10,02
208,HOTEL DYLAN - GREAT VALUE AND SERVICE,"My wife and I stayed at the Dylan for 3 nights when visiting Dublin and have nothing but high marks for this boutique hotel.  It exceeded our expectations in all areas.  The service at the checkin (tea while we waited for our turn in lineup), rooms were clean and comfortable,  staff were always welcoming and courteous as we came and went (here is water and snack and can we help with maps), two excellent bars - exceptional bar food and dinner menu.  We are very happy to highly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2022,09,24
208,Wonderful hotel,"My partner and I stayed at the Dylan in June as we were going to a concert at the 3 arena and visiting friends. The Dylan is in a great location if going to the 3 arena. You can easily walk there in a leisurely 30 minute stroll. The girlroom was luxurious and so snuggly and comfortable, however its the staff there that make the hotel standout from the others. Shauna made sure our stay amazing. She was always on hand to answer any queries we had but was so sincere and unobstrusive. If Shauna was not around then she was ably assisted by Sandra who also had a huge influence on our wonderful stay. Breakfast is a must and most mornings we were greeted by Patrick who is a wonderful host and quite the conversationist. The only down side we experienced at breakfast was at the weekend when we both decided to have a 3 egg omelette with the same filling. What arrived was probably a 6 egg omelette cut in half, half each for both of us. Nowhere near as tasty as my previous omelettes... While having a coffee or something stronger in the front and back terraces we often spoke with the maintenance guy Philip who was very charming and amusing. It was a really lovely experience at the Dylan. Thank you again to all the staff for a wonderful stay and my sincere apologies for the delay with the time for my review.",5,2022,09,06
208,Fabulous Hotel.... Great Location ,"Fabulous Hotel in a great location, 15/20 min walk to RDS, Aviva & Stephens Green/Grafton Street..... staff so friendly and helpful, fabulous food, lovely decor and a welcome, cosy feeling.... this is our second stay and we look forward to returning!",5,2022,08,22
208,Great Place to stay,"Dear Grainne 
I would like to take this time to thank you for this opportunity that you provide us and make our stay in Ireland achievable and pleasant in many ways. First thing was nice to be back as a guest and being so well looked after, myself and my family we are thankful for the lovely stay. All staff were very attentive and helpful since we arrived late on the evening at the Hotel. We had breakfast on the bedroom what was lovely.  Also, are a few lovely touches like the coffee and tea facilities, very handy. 
The interconnect bedrooms were perfect for all of us. We spent most of the time out and about, the weather was perfect for walk and enjoy the surroundings. Also I have the chance to meet some personnel staff that I worked with few years ago like Philip a great asset for the Hotel. Also, the girl on the late service Mira and Djamal, regardless the sympathy of all new Hotel Team that makes this place so specially unique. Is great to known the Hotel history by the great Team. Overall great family experience and will be happy to stay herein my next returned Ireland... Thank you so much...Great Place.",5,2022,08,19
208,Expensive but not worth it,"Initial experience on arriving a delight, great welcome, lovely initial decor. But thereafter some very disappointing aspects of a supposedly higher class hotel. Maintenance in the room, particularly the bathroom clearly not a priority, very loose fittings,  door handles almost falling off, very amateurish sealing around bath, all contributed to a shoddy and very second rate feel. Then to the bed, we travel a lot and a nice hotel is great but a good bed is better and our king sized bed was not top hotel standard , we both slept very poorly. And then go the worst breakfast experience we have ever had at any hotel anywhere. Despite the maitre‚Äôd‚Äôs best efforts the breakfast orders at our table of six were almost all wrong when delivered to the table and the omelette was inedible and sent back. All this for a nightly price that is not competitive with much much better hotels. If you are coming to Dublin chose another hotel.",2,2022,08,14
208,Amazing Hotel and Staff,"The Dylan Hotel is one of the best we have stayed at! From the front desk to the breakfast staff there wasn‚Äôt anything to find fault with. Housekeeping was excellent. Rooms were always cleaned perfectly. 

We want to thank Sanda who took care of us from check in to check out! She has such a wonderful personality and optimistic attitude. We loved starting our day with her. She always wanted to know our plans and then how they went. 

The ‚Äúnight girls‚Äù as we called them were a delight when we returned in the evening. The 3 of them listened to our days events and laughed with us. 

The breakfast staff was awesome. They were so friendly and always inquired how we were and our plans for the day as well. This groups works well together and we‚Äôre always checking on our needs!

Rooms were well equipped with everything we needed. They brought water and candy to the room each evening. 

We just can‚Äôt say enough good things about the Dylan.

My only suggestion is for name tags. I would have mentioned more if I knew their specific names! 

We hope to return soon! The crazy Americans!",5,2022,08,12
208,Nearly but not quite‚Ä¶,"The rooms in this hotel are superbly appointed and the beds are super-comfortable. The hotel staff are efficient but their service level is not quite at the luxury end of the market. The detail paid to room servicing is just not there. The restaurant and bar service is close to chaotic and highly variable. At this price point and the average age of the clientele, I would expect it all to be a bit more on-point. The good news is that these things are all within reach with relatively modest effort on behalf of management. It‚Äôs a very very good 4 stars but not 5.",4,2022,08,11
208,Perfect boutique hotel,"This is a gorgeous boutique hotel with all the amenities you need. The staff went really out of their way to ensure we had a good stay, including writing a birthday card for my husband! We were there off season so it was very quiet and we had the restaurant to ourselves on Sunday night. A gorgeous restaurant though! ",4,2022,07,23
208,Great hotel and staff,"We stayed three days at the Dylan Dublin and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  The room was very roomy and comfortable, well appointed and with good amenities.  The staff was very friendly, especially in the restaurant.  Definitely would go back again!",5,2022,07,16
208,Beautiful hotel in glorious Dublin!,"An absolutely amazing hotel! The entite hotel oozes class and elegance! The decor is stunning; the staff attentive, polite, efficient, helpful and friendly. The food (albeit breakfast lunch or dinner) was utterly delicious! An awesome experience all round!",5,2022,07,11
208,Beautiful property but it's the staff that makes it amazing!,"The hotel is beautiful. The level of detail in the design of common areas is special, and while you feel like you're tucked into a residential neighborhood there are shops and restaurants just around the corner.  It's an easy walk through a lovely park to get to Trinity College and other Dublin landmarks.

While you expect those things of a five-star hotel, one thing that you unfortunately can't be certain of these days is a terrific staff experience (due to staffing issues across the globe).  That is not the case here -  it's the staff that makes the hotel truly special. Unfortunately, after I arrived I became sick with a severe case of bronchitis and was stuck in my room for 3 days.  The housekeeping staff made sure I had what I needed and the room service staff were always very friendly when they brought my meals.  Because I couldn't fly I had to extend my stay by three nights (for a total of five) and the reservation staff moved some things around so I could keep my same room, which was such a gift.  When I was able to eat in the restaurant the staff was more than accommodating and always approached me with a smile.  Employees come from many different cultures and I enjoyed getting to know them. 

I do need to mention one employee in particular.  Sandra, at the front desk, was so kind and when I became sick she went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and had what I needed.  Every employee I interacted with was great, but I felt that Sandra made it her mission to make sure I was taken care of.  When you're sick and can't be in your own bed it's comforting to feel like you're being looked after.

I will certainly stay at the Dylan next time I'm in Dublin.  I hope I won't get sick again, but if I do I know I will be well taken care of. I commend management for doing such a great job in hiring a special staff.",5,2022,06,27
208,Wonderful Birthday Treat,"As a gift for my partner , we booked a night in the Dylan Hotel , I informed them it was Orlas birthday and they took out all the stops , the room had a birthday card and a tray of treats. The room was immaculate and the staff were so accommodating. 
We went into the City for Drinks and a meal in the Ivy and came back to the hotel to chill in a very comfortable terrace with some good music being played by a female DJ.   The breakfast the following morning was perfect and Orla had an omelette which  she really enjoyed. 

Overall the Hotel was the perfect location for a bank holiday break. It was ideally located in Dublin City and I will definitely be back",5,2022,06,14
208,Weekend Brunch in Dublin ,We called in without reservations. We had a wonderful brunch at the  Edison in the Dylan Hotel. We sat out on the very pleasant terrace. Patrick Sheehan and his staff looked after us really well we great food excellent coffee and will definitely be back.,5,2022,06,11
208,Another memorable stay,Had all my family and friend staying here for what was an amazing time. So well looked after and all the little touches in our room were amazing! The breakfast team were superb and really made sure everything was seamless. Cannot recommend highly enough for lovely leisure time.,5,2022,06,07
208,I would definitely go back!,This was an outstanding hotel. From the minute we arrived they paid close attention to our needs. We stayed 2 nights and Sandro at the front desk took care of our every request without hesitation. We arrived in Dublin  early in the am and she was able to get us our room long before our actual checkin. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs  in a beautiful neighbourhood with lots of great restaurants. Only a 25 minute walk to Grafton Street as well.,5,2022,06,06
208,"Really nice boutique hotel, just out of town, but not quite ""first class""","The Dylan is a really nice boutique hotel, and I don't think it pretends to be more. In a converted Victorian building, the layout is a little like a rabbit warren, with narrow corridors, small lifts, etc. That said, the room was spacious, and very nicely decorated. The bathroom was nicely appointed, but tiny, as is typical for converted old properties like this. Unfortunately, it had a recurring and lingering smell of sewer (which others here have reported). Limited on premise facilities - e.g., no gym, but access to one around the block outside.

Service was good, eager, but didn't always hit the mark. Meals in the restaurant were delicious. Everyone was trying hard to do a terrific job. But  sometimes it felt like despite good intentions, it just missed the mark. Breakfast order that disappeared until reminded (for example).

But overall, a very happy stay - with a hotel that does a great job in its class, a little short of the best (but that is a very high bar).

[I am a global traveller, frequent flyer, hotel snob]",4,2022,06,03
208,Fantastic Service,We came in a day late due to delayed international travel and the staff and management worked with us to get us the best possible stay!! They took great care of us until  the check-in was resolved! Thank you Shonda and the rest of the staff for what felt like miracle work! Highly recommend!!,5,2022,05,29
208,Very Good Hotel,Fantastic service and very friendly staff we would stay at this hotel again and the breakfast is to die for 5/5* very handy for the Rugby if you are going to Dublin as it was in walking distance but a bit out of town for shopping so you will need to use acTaxi to get in to town.,5,2022,05,28
208,Excellent,"Stayed with my family and extended family for an event in the Aviva. 
   Kristine on the desk was outstanding in how she looked after us, we had a difficulty with our booking and she went way above and beyond to accomodate us and make us as comfortable as possible.  We ate in the bar with drinks after and enjoyed the whole nights stay, we will definately be returning again.",5,2022,05,22
208,Wonderful stay!,"This was a lovely hotel to stay at, with wonderful staff! The rooms were really spacious and the hotel overall was uniquely and tastefully decorated. The breakfast was so delicious (especially the scones!). The staff were definitely the best part of staying here though. Everyone was incredibly helpful and kind. The front desk staff helped us figure out how to get our required COVID testing done before flying home. And, one morning we were heading out for a tour before breakfast started. I called down to ask if we might be able to just grab some fruit or something easy on our way out, but instead they went above and beyond expectations. We were able to eat plenty of food and have our coffee and tea, which really made the start of a long day great. 
I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin, and if I'm able to go back I would definitely stay here again!",5,2022,05,16
208,Perfection!,Hands-down the best hotel I have ever stayed in Dublin. The hotel is so beautiful and in a great location- really quiet but still so close to bars and restaurants. The staff could not have been more helpful. I cannot wait to go back!,5,2022,05,16
208,Great place,We chose here as it was just outside the town centre and had everything we needed. We first got our room and had paid extra for a balcony but never got one. We spoke to reception and sanda offered us another room we just stuck with our room but to be honest sanda couldn‚Äôt have been more willing to help. This was a total credit to the hotel. She brought us a couple of cocktails to the room which was a great touch. The room was big and airy and very comfortable. To be honest the whole experience of this hotel was totally great. Every single staff member we spoke to was really professional and ready to do anything. This now would be the very first place on my list to stay when I go back. Really is money well spent.,5,2022,05,16

Good size rooms with very comfortable King Size beds - once we had the hang of the modern digital light system all was good! 

Breakfast each morning was first class, with very attentive senior manager there every morning.

Made use of the bar area, but had no other meals in the Hotel.",5,2022,05,04
208,"10/10, please visit!","I‚Äôm almost a bit emotional writing about our lovely weekend visit at Dylan. Everythong was top notch. Food, bar, housekeeping, staff -unbelievable. So helpful and professional, but friendly and funny at all times. THANK YOU! Especially Sandra, you‚Äôre a shining star, your passion for service and people is heart warming. We will be back soon. /Emma and Jake",5,2022,05,03
208,Excellent,"Superb!
The welcome we received was so nice. All staff we met were so friendly and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and we loved the location. Quiet and a lovely walk into the city. Really nice atmosphere in the hotel. We loved our bar food and breakfast was fantastic. We found it hard to leave and are looking forward to coming back!
Thank you

208,Amazing stay!!,"The staff was great, especially Sandra. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.

The breakfast is absolutely delicious as well as the coffee. My wife had like seven latte‚Äôs.

Perfect location as it‚Äôs near the city but far enough away to be quaint and quiet.",5,2022,04,22
208,"Great location and very unique, fun hotel","Staff was exceptionally helpful, Sanda (or Sandra :) went above and beyond to make our trip and stay wonderful. She was exceedingly helpful in getting us COVID tests at the last minute when our originally booked ones did not work. Can't thank her enough! The outdoor terrace is great for drinks, very beautiful. Service here was absolutely amazing.",5,2022,04,20
208,One of the best hotel experiences,"The title says it all! This truly was one of the best hotel experiences that I have ever had! All of the hotel staff is so friendly and welcoming. They really make you feel at home and you enjoy your time there. I would like to highlight Patrick who really made our stay there so special. We arrived in Ireland after flying for 10 hours and Patrick greeted us with a warm welcome. He brought us pastries and coffee and he started providing us with recommendations on places to go to. We felt so welcomed after that and the rest of our stay there was so nice. Patrick greeted us every morning and brought pastries and coffee to our tables. He was so friendly every day and we would go over our itinerary for the day with him. In the evenings, Andy was there to help us and he was great as well. He would remember our drink orders and helped us with anything that we needed. 

The staff and service at this hotel is truly special and I would give the hotel more stars if I could. Thank you to all of the staff at the Dylan Hotel, in particular Patrick and Andy, for making our stay there so special!!",5,2022,04,20
208,Our Dublin Stay,"There are a lot of reasons to stay at the Dylan but if I had to summarize our stay in 1 word it would be - Patrick! He made our trip absolutely amazing. He had fantastic recommendations, insight and fun history and facts around Dublin. He made our entire stay 6 stars. We will come back 1000% because of him (strongly recommend giving him a raise). Thank you Patrick for making our first trip to Dublin so unforgettable!",5,2022,04,19
208,Travelling from Heuston,"Hiya, 
I couldn‚Äôt find a proper answer somewhere so I just thought it might be a good idea to ask here. What would be the best and fastest way to reach the hotel with public transport? I‚Äòm arriving at Heuston and want to come there as fast as and cheap as possible 
Many thanks",5,2022,04,18
208,I wish I could give this hotel and the staff 100 stars,"What a beautiful boutique hotel.  I had the opportunity to stay in this perfect place for 11 nights total.  The staff is extremely wonderful, they really do treat you like family.  I was able to try several items on the restaurant (Eddison) menu. All the food I tried was fabulous with the Truffled Chicken being my favorite. I want to thank Sanda, Luis,  Shauna, Nicola, Juliana, Lucio, Adrien, Christina and everyone else at the front desk and restaurant and everyone who works so hard at keeping the hotel beautiful, you all made my stay perfect. Love you guys!

208,Recharged and revived after a stay at The Dylan,"I had a beautiful night's stay at The Dylan with a friend of mine this weekend. 
The calm and relaxing atmosphere made for a peaceful stay. 
Staff were attentive from the moment we walked in and met Sanda the lovely receptionist to the staff that served us breakfast before we left. 

Location is convenient with Grafton St and lovely restaurants only walking distance away.  Can't wait to return on my  next trip to Dublin",5,2022,04,03
208,Last Leg of Honeymoon and so worth it,"We spent our last 3 nights of our honeymoon at the Dylan in Dublin. From service to the Edison restauran on site, the hotel is amazing. Room was beautiful and spacious, and the neighborhood has such variety where you could very easily just walk around at night and avoid the more congested areas. I would certainly recommend.",5,2022,03,27
208,Exceptional hotel! The staff makes you feel like family!,"My wife and I spent part of our honeymoon in Dublin, and this hotel made our experience so much better. From the moment we walked in, Sanda at the front desk made us feel so welcome. When she found out it was our honeymoon, she immediately had the kitchen prepare us champagne to toast as we checked in. 
Our room was clean, spacious, and the bed was very comfortable! The towel warmer in the bathroom was also a nice perk. 
Whenever we left in the morning, Sanda made sure to get us some water or coffee to take before our adventure in the city. 
Also, the restaurant downstairs was amazing, and the breakfast was always so fresh and delicious. Patrick, the restaurant manager, was also very helpful in making sure we were fed well, and even drew up maps and gave us recommendations on what to do and see in Ireland. 
I'd also like to recognize the waitress and host who helped us every morning. 
My wife and I agree, hands down, the Dylan Hotel is the BEST hotel experience we've ever had!",5,2022,03,25
208,It‚Äôs all about quality of service - The staff at the Dylan are phenomenal!,"The Dylan is a lovely boutique hotel.  My room was cozy, bed was super comfortable and I loved the heated floors in the bathroom. What sets the Dylan apart from most hotels I‚Äôve stayed in is the staff and level of service. Truly five star worthy!!",5,2022,03,18
208,Feels like home away from home,"Our second (but certainly not our last) visit to this unique, lovely little hotel.  Sandra at the front desk not only remembered us, but made us feel special once again.  Patrick Sheehan, the dining room manager also made a point to make us feel welcome (and made a pretty amazing French 75!)  The rooms are lovely, the food delicious, the atmosphere warm and homey.",5,2022,03,15
208,Great experience,The bar in The Dylan was a relaxing place for our group to have food and drinks. The cocktails were fantastic and our waiter Tirnan was so welcoming and attentive to us throughout. Will be back to The Dylan!,5,2022,03,07
208,A perfect stay!,"To say the Dylan Hotel is excellent seems a bit of an understatement. I had stayed before and was pleasantly surprised to see a few minor changes which improved the hotel overall. A new layout to the reception area and bar made the use of space more sensible, but it was great to see that the rooms were still contemporary, luxurious, functional and comfortable.
The staff were superb! the elegant Adrian, dapper Andy and Vidas in the Eddison Restaurant, and the talented Mon Li in the bar are all worthy of special mention, providing a genuinely warm and professional service. The small complimentary gift to our room was very much appreciated and a nice touch.
The food in the Eddison Restaurant is to die for! The menu reads beautifully,  the quality, taste and presentation were perfection. For me, possibly the best Irish hotel restaurant I've eaten in. It was so good, we ate in there on our second night as well!
In the bar you have to try the Emerald Isle and Black Diamond cocktails. Ours were made by Mon Li, and my better half and I relished them. You should treat yo' self to one from the menu.
All in all, it was a perfect stay. The hotel is well located and within a short walking distance of the city centre and the Aviva stadium. It's a quiet neighbourhood just around the corner of the lively Searsons pub. It is steeped in history and well worth a visit. I for one cannot wait to return for the comfortable feel, relaxed atmosphere and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. Highly recommended!",5,2022,03,05
208,Excellent place/ Hidden Gem,"Great people, Great food and excellent rooms.  It's in residential neighborhood, felt a bit different. once checked in, felt valued by friendly staff.  Food is so good, beats fine dining places. Heard they have a very high rated chef, can feel with each bite.",5,2022,03,04
208,Valentines at Dylan,"From arrival to departure our stay in The Dylan for Valentines weekend was amazing!!
We arrived and my car was valet parked. The receptionist‚Äôs Nicola and Sandra were very friendly and helpful, our baggage was carried to our room by a lovely young man. Our room was beautifully decorated with rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart plus chocolates plus a bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate strawberries!!!!
We had a lovely meal in The Edison restaurant and enjoyed there cocktail menu. 
Breakfast was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had in a Hotel (the sausages and Pudding  were amazing where can I buy them)
When we arrived at reception to checkout my car was parked at the front door waiting for us!!
Hats off to all the staff at The Dylan you are all brilliant at your jobs",5,2022,02,15
208,Fabulous hotel and staff!,"My husband and I had the loveliest stay in the Dylan last night. They were so unbelievably helpful and kind. Sandra at the front desk was so lovely and looked after us. We had a bag left down at reception and when they brought it up they came with a desert plate. When we were checking out this morning they offered us a coffee to go and bottles of water on the house. 
Our room was in the new part of the hotel and was beautiful and comfortable. Would highly recommend and also a great location to walk into town! Will definitely be back!! Thanks Sandra for being so great!! An asset to the Dylan hotel!!",5,2022,02,13
208,Best Christmas break ever,"I had the most wonderful Christmas in Dylan from the 24th till the 27th of December. It was beautiful from start to finish. Came to Dylan on the 24th afternoon with my 5years old daughter and partner. Straight away was greeted at the door by a friendly concierge, helping me with my luggages. Then checked in pretty quickly at the reception with a warm welcome from the staff. The hotel was beautiful decorated. Entering the room was magical. The room was big and beautiful. They went above and beyond to make it special for my daughter. A bag of surprises was left from Santa for her under a little Christmas tree. She was so happy. I was greeted by a welcome plate of cheese and crackers which was delicious. For the next few days I had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The staff was so accommodating and super professional. Was served always with a smile. The food was super delicious. Christmas Day dinner in the restaurant was beautiful. They have a great menu. It was truly a great experience. I would highly recommend.",5,2022,01,09
208,Fabulous Xmas break @The Dylan,"Just home from a 3 day stay between Xmas and the new year ! Honestly we can‚Äôt rave enough about this hotel from the stunning property n a prime location 15 min stroll into Grafton street to the comfort and ambiance it was just perfect! We travel with our daughter and our dog ! It‚Äôs a üíØ dog friendly anyone thinking of bringing there dog this is the hotel to go to !!

208,Nice Short Trip,"Nice little trip for 2 days. Great Location right in the city center. Lovley staff , everyone was very welcoming and friendly. Rooms are very clean and they really make sure you feel safe with Covid 19.
We will be back for sure !!",5,2021,12,30
208,The best hotel stay in Dublin,"This is a step above anywhere else we‚Äôve stayed in Dublin and it‚Äôs mainly down to the staff.
The hotel has such a warm & welcoming feeling.
The staff are exceptional from Adrienne on the front desk to Patrick in the restaurant - they truly made our stay special.
Food was amazing in the restaurant Saturday night (which you don‚Äôt always get in an hotel restaurant). We were so glad we didnt book dinner outside the hotel. There was also a really great singer playing in the restaurant which created a gorgeous vibe but not too over powering either. (Would recommend the restaurant for dinner even if you‚Äôre not staying in the hotel) 
Couldn‚Äôt fault our stay and we‚Äôll be back for sure‚Ä¶",5,2021,12,12
208,Breakfast team were poorly organised and so we never got to eat,The rooms were lovely but too warm - easily adjusted however. The main issue was breakfast - we arrived and eventually we were asked about tea/coffee that never arrived even after 45 mins.  Our food order was taken and 30 mins later still nothing even after a prompt reminder.  There was enough staff but extremely badly organised.  2 very busy managers and not co-ordinating the work at all. The matradee did recommend I speak to a manager  and then he said he was to busy to her and I had to wait. A poor response and so I will never return. It‚Äôs a pity as they could improve this instantly.,2,2021,11,30
208,Outstanding,Our favourite hotel in Dublin. Far superior to the Merrion. Friendly staff. Great breakfast. Fun bar. Really nice rooms. Can‚Äôt fault it really. Why would you stay anywhere else? A little bit of a walk from the city centre but a lovely area,5,2021,11,27
208,Wedding weekend,The service in this hotel was second to none. All staff were so friendly and welcoming and nothing was a problem. Special mention for Sanda and Adrien at reception. They were so helpful with a request for a late checkout and also facilitated us with very late checkout for our car which was parked at the hotel.,5,2021,11,17
208,Lovely experience,"We stayed at the Dylan twice over the course of a week for work. it was a wonderful hotel and the staff, especially Sanda was so welcoming and made us feel so at home. She looked after us and welcomed us back and made our time there a really lovely experience. the breakfast was lovely and the location and rooms were great.",5,2021,11,13
208,Stylish hotel. ,"Stayed in this beautiful hotel a few days ago , from the moment I arrived the staff were so attentive and friendly. 
The room was spacious and comfortable. 
The breakfast was excellent with a wide variety on menu. 
I definitely would stay here in this hotel .",5,2021,11,03
208,Good Experience in The End,an amazing looking hotel with great looking lobby and rooms looking really well. we stayed there during the summer for a girls trip. there was some confusion over our dinner table but a solution was found to resolve as we ended up sitting in the restaurant but was meant to be outside. the manager kindly reviewed our bill at the end as a result of this. also a small note on allergens as im allergic to gluten for breakfast there wasnt full knowledge of this by the service team,3,2021,10,31
208,Great staff and property,"This is an amazing hotel with an amazing staff. Sandra at the front desk was incredible and made our trip feel very special. The rooms are spacious and very nice.

The hotel is around a couple good restaurants and we walked 10 mins to a train station. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2021,10,30
208,Excellent Stay,"Great couple of nights staying at the Dylan hotel (22&23 Oct 21). Room was great, the staff were EXCELLENT, helpful, friendly; nothing was too much trouble and they really went the extra mile to make sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. A really positive and welcoming approach from all the staff we encountered guarantees we‚Äôll be staying at the Dylan next time we‚Äôre in Dublin.

The location is great, too, with a pleasant stroll into the heart of town.",5,2021,10,27
208,Amazing stay!,"I have stayed for 2 weeks at the dylan, whilst moving to Ireland and i would like to thank everyone that made my stay as memorable as it was. Special thanks to Sanda and Nicola, for the ‚Äòwelcome to Ireland‚Äô gift! And a big thank you to the housekeeping team for the endless supply of tea!

208,What a lovely gem,"We usually stay at The Merrion when we are in Dublin but decided to switch it up a bit this time.  What a beautiful little hotel located on a quiet street.  We were upgraded to a lovely room with a small balcony‚Ä¶front desk staff was amazing.  Special shout out to Sandra who arranged for my husband to get a haircut and gave us some little books about Ireland to take home.

Patrick Sheehan is their exemplary food and beverage director and he made us feel very special whether we were dining on the terrace, having a cocktail in the lounge or enjoying breakfast (scones are wonderful).

We will definitely return",5,2021,10,20
208,Extremely nice staff with great food.,"Within 5 minutes of stepping in the door, my wife and I had glasses of champagne in our hands while one of the staff (Sanda) was taking our picture for us. We came to Ireland for our honeymoon and this was one of our favorite places to stay. Sanda was so friendly, the room was really nice and the hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood. 
When the heater stopped working in our room they had us moved to another within 15 minutes. Plus the connected bar/restaurant provides great food, breakfast was fabulous üëå 
Btw, the tall french guy at the front desk is great, too. Sorry I forgot your name, you rock!",5,2021,10,05
208,Wonderful Hotel,"When we arrived at the hotel the staff was very quick to come help us with our luggage and it just got better from there. The staff was wonderful and accommodating. The room was great with very nice amenities. The bed was super comfy and the shower was great. We did not get to eat the breakfast as we had to leave too early. The staff was great bringing us a dish of desserts and water to our door. Very very nice stay, wish it was longer. We stayed at 5 different hotels through our stay in Ireland and this was one of the nicest.",5,2021,10,04
208,Boutique at its finest,We‚Äôve stayed here twice now with in the last few weeks. I can‚Äôt fault the staff at The Dylan always friendly and welcoming. The room we have booked was the experience suite on the ground floor. It was stunning and very well decorated. The only thing I would say for the size of the rooms I would have expected a larger TV screen there was two TVs but both very small for the room size. Portable Bose speaker which is a good touch. Bed extremely comfortable. Breakfast was lovely the on-site restaurant was amazing. The terrace is also a really nice touch comfy big chairs and heated and covered for all year round dining. Another point I would consider more than one PC for checking out is slow I tried to do express checkout but it wouldn‚Äôt work. Great experience overall as a regular Westin stayer I will now switch to the Dylan as it‚Äôs service and style is very good. See you again soon Dylan,5,2021,08,09
208,Fanastic Stay Again,"My Wife and I stayed there 11/6/2021 just after the lock down and we really enjoyed our stay ,what a treat. Everyone was just great. All staff were so good , it really was a memorable stay 
Thank you to all the staff, we cant wait to go back",5,2021,08,04
208,Wedding,"We recently had our wedding at The Dylan and we couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience. The whole team were excellent, in particular Monika & Bernardo. The food was fantastic & the service was polished throughout. Our private dining experience was faultless. Thank you for making the day so special",5,2021,08,04
208,Not for what you pay  for SLOW service,"Positives; 
Rooms
Staff
Location

Negatives:
Breakfast shocking slow
Valet/Reception interaction substandard

Breakfast: Went down with my wife and son and we waited a long time to get served. While there we observed another gentleman getting rather irate and he went up and obviously complained to the maitre d - did not obviously get the interactions but by his demeanour he was not best pleased. So we were not the only one's who felt the sluggishness
Valet/Reception : On departure I asked first for the car to be brought around - as this takes the longest time, however the receptionist continued to check me out first, pay , everything all right etc etc and then informed Valet of my car request. Needless to say it took 10 minutes for the car to arrive . I have no problem with the 10 minutes as sometimes other cars have to be moved but if she requested it first then the time lag would not have been so pronounced .
Needless to say none of these incidents would really have mattered if our trip was purely for leisure but it was not as we had to be at a certain time at a certain place and unforeseen delays at breakfast and checkout did not help our state of mind and of concerns about being late for our appointments.",3,2021,08,03
208,Needed a break,"Stayed at the Dylan in June and it was such a lavish stay. Such a stunning boutique hotel with lovely touches. The bed so comfortable, the shower refreshing. The bath was smaller than what you would normally find but we were still able to take a relaxing soak. What sets the hotel apart is the staff. From arriving we were welcomed by  Shauna who checked us in and escorted us to our room. She showed us a couple of the features in the room but didn't over stay her welcome. Over our entire stay Shauna, seemed to be everywhere at reception, in the bar, in the breakfast room the following morning. Does this young lady actually get a day off? I'm not surprised if she doesn't...Before arriving we were assisted by Alan from reservations who set everything in motion for us. We encountered other amazing staff during our stay. Sanda, also at reception, so helpful. We required an iron and board, available on request and delivered so presonably by Dina. In the bar we were assisted by several people but the stand out was Inma who again was so helpful and smiley. We had a small problem with the pop up waste on the basin and before I could put the phone down maintenance had knocked on the door and Phil had it fixed and draining properly in no time at all, and extremely charming with it. All in all an amazing stay in an amazing hotel with amazing staff. Thank you too all and my sincere appologies of I got any names sorely incorrectly. Seriously, stay here if you want to be pampered.",5,2021,07,10
208,Wedding for 25 - Incredible service from start to finish,"Cannot praise this hotel enough - from the initial contact with Bernardo, and Alan, and every other staff member who helped along the way, the level of professionalism and warmth was outstanding. Prior to arriving & on the day, it was perfect.
Every single guest at our wedding was blown away by how helpful, welcoming & friendly ALL the staff were - the food was amazing, service amazing and whole experience flawless.
Thank you all for a fabulous experience.",5,2021,07,06
208,"Went after a wedding, lovely!","We went for a wedding dinner.
Food was absolutely lovely, all 3 courses.
We were service great wine and beautiful sparkling wine.
After dinner at the beautiful restaurant we were sent to a private bar, very cozy.
Great beer from the tap, lovely staff.
There's a lovely beer garden and also an external area at the restaurant where you can have your meal. Comfortable chairs, smoking area, very complete hotel",5,2021,07,01
208,Wedding at the Dylan,"We had our wedding in the Dylan Friday 25th June 2021.  Everything was prefect, food, staff, bedrooms.   Everyone at the Dylan went above &
Beyond for myself & guests.  All our guests commented on how great the food was and how nice the hotel is.  

Well worth a visit! 

The hotel was quite busy both Friday & Saturday which was lovely to see post lockdown.  We will definitely be returning.",5,2021,06,28
208,Wonderful stay.,"Loved everything about the Dylan hotel, the food was great and the cocktails are amazing and lovely big bedrooms. The staff were so accommodating. Alan in Reservations and Sandra in Reception were so helpful. 
Looking forward to staying again in the near future.",5,2021,06,21
208,Very disappointing customer service ,"I am not one to write negative comments easily but I felt I had to write this. We rang the Dylan Hotel to book a stay in April (on the utmost hope that a trip to Dublin will be possible at that point). Having looked at various search engines online for the Dylan that showed that a room for 3 adults was possible, we wanted to make a reservation. We found the response from the reservations team extremely unhelpful. We were told it was never possible to host 3 adults in one room unless it was a child. We said that we would be happy with an additional temporary bed and were told this was not possible. It appeared that the  individual wanted us off the phone. Various booking engines seem to show that it is possible so it would be worth the Dylan Hotel speaking with them. While I feel for all businesses at this time, I think it is now more important than ever for Hotels to be accommodating and grateful for business and at the very least polite and courteous. We will be taking all our future business elsewhere. ",1,2021,01,30
208,Very nice evening away from home!,"This is a beautiful hotel with lovely features. 

The espresso machine in my room needed servicing, which the desk staff told me was just the need of water! It was not! They did however bring me a kettle, but i missed my coffee!

I had dinner in the Eddison, and was very grateful to receive a bay window seat all to myself which helped me feel safe given circulating coronavirus. Such a shame that members of the wait staff do not wear their masks properly. Three different members in the Eddison wore theirs under their nose!!!! 
The cheeseboard dessert is very carb heavy and light on the cheese so be careful if choosing this as a low carb need.

The room was lovely and perfect for a luxury get away. Clean and nicely decorated!",4,2021,01,05
208,The Dylan hotel,The hotel was exceptional from start to finish. The room design was fascinating and the service we received was amazing. A big thank you to the staff and krish from reception who was very helpful . Amazing stay,5,2020,12,24
208,Not a 5 star hotel,"Restaurant food is mediocre at best and the room lacks any ambience

Rooms are OK, like the restaurant however they are not 5 star standard imho

Unfortunately I couldn't consider this place more than a 3.5 star hotel   

There is certainly much better hotels at the same price",2,2020,12,22
208,Outstanding!,"My friend and I stayed for a night as a antidote to the Coronavirus misery and had an absolutely wonderful time. 
The staff are so friendly and cheery, despite being very busy. The hotel hygiene standards left us feeling very reassured. 
We had a delicious meal in the restaurant and enjoyed drinks on the terrace.
A small incident in our room was dealt with the utmost tact and class. I think this is where you can really tell a 5* establishment by how they deal with the unforeseen.
All in all, a fabulous stay that managed to take us away from what has been a trying year. 
We are already planning our next stay.",5,2020,12,20
208,Wedding and stay,"
Our wedding was hosted in the Dylan and we stayed over too.

We had a brilliant day and everything went so smoothly ‚Äì we really appreciated the care that the following people helped with:
-¬†¬†Bernardo ‚Äì was always available on the day; looked after us in the Ruby Room and the Library ‚Äì his waiting staff were so attentive; something not that easy when the hotel was so busy.
-¬†¬†¬†Shauna ‚Äì was so calm and helpful on the day and day after
-¬†¬†¬†Lily ‚Äì was so easy to deal with in advance of the big day particularly with reservations.
¬†
Special thanks to the kitchen too ‚Äì the food was amazing, particularly the dessert.

Thank you also to Conor and Monika for everything they did for us also.

Great comfortable rooms too.

Thank you again for helping make our special day so amazing.

208,Excellent 5 Stars,Excellent stay for a weekend break. Fabulous rooms and excellent customer service. Ideal city location. Reception staff very warm and welcoming. From start to finishing our stay it‚Äôs  5 stars! Will be returning again.,5,2020,11,24
208,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed at the Dylan before the Covid restrictions and couldn't fault our stay. Staff were so friendly and welcoming on arrival, without the usual stuffiness of a 5* hotel. 

Our Deluxe room was very spacious and immaculately clean. Large king size bed with superb linen and super comfy pillows. Room had everything we needed for our short stay and the extra touches of complimentary water and nespresso machine were much appreciated. 

The food was as of equally good standard with breakfast served piping hot and a huge selection. Didn't have the opportunity to dine in the hotel bar or restaurant on this occasion but the menu had a decent offering and very reasonably priced. 

We have already booked in for a family festive afternoon tea and look forward to another great stay in the new year. 

Amazing hotel - keep up the good work!",5,2020,11,24
208,Favourite Dublin getaway,"We loved this hotel! Quick and easy check in, the staff was really nice and got us our room much earlier than we thought. 

Dinner was fantastic and felt there was adequate spacing ( I‚Äôm not over lay cautious but the atmosphere was great ) 

Couldn‚Äôt fault a thing and we have already booked for December! Definitely the best Dublin getaway we have had in a while. ",5,2020,10,24
208,Stunning afternoon tea,My partner and I made a reservation for afternoon tea in the outdoor seating area and were extremely pleased with out visit. The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious - probably the best scone I have ever had. The ambience on the terrace was stunning and the lavatory facilities were immaculate. Can only recommend.,5,2020,10,19
208,Perfect Stay,Myself and my girlfriend recently spent a night in The Dylan. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who was extremely helpful during our stay. The room was spotless and had probably the most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. We had both dinner and breakfast in the hotel and the food was excellent (in particular the fillet steak). I would be more than happy to return to The Dylan and I will be highly recommending it going forward.,5,2020,10,18
208,You get what you pay for!,"From the moment we walked it to the moment we left, it was a 5 star experience. From the arrival, to the room, to the dinner, to the cocktails and finally the breakfast, I honestly can‚Äôt rate it higher.

The staff could not do enough for us and made this one of the best experience in a hotel I have ever had and really took our minds off the madness in the world at the moment.

If that wasn‚Äôt enough, you have everything you could want as soon as you step out of the hotel, shops and restaurants fill the streets until you get to Grafton street which is a 5 minute walk away.

I just want to say a massive thank you to all the staff for making this such an amazing trip and we will see you again very soon.",5,2020,10,18
208,Lovely,We stayed here last Wednesday and I would very much recommend it.Every member of staff was really friendly and the room was lovely.We had a very nice meal and the breakfast was excellent.After that we had a very pleasant walk in Herbert Park which is quite near.,4,2020,10,11
208,Mini Staycation,"My husband and I are just back  from our mini Staycation at the Dylan,, we stayed for two nights  & I would highly  recommend this hotel for it location to the city & it's staff so friendly  & professional at all times. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely receptionist who was so friendly &  put us at ease straight away . Our room was  very spacious & decorated  to a high standard. We had decided to eat dinner at the hotel  for both evenings due to the current covid restrictions in restaurants, I have to say we're were not disappointed in our dining experience the quality presentation & flavour of our food was exceptional the staff were very attentive & professional & wore masks / visors at all times.  We also had breakfast served to our room which did not disappoint either the choice was excellent  &  it was so relaxing to have that option . Overall we had a very enjoyable & relaxing stay at the Dylan . Will definitely be back.",5,2020,09,08
208,What a WONDERFUL holiday!! Thank you :),"Ah! I am so grateful to the staff at the Dylan hotel for facilitating SUCH a wonderful stay. In fact, we had such a positive experience, we extended our initial week long stay with them another week :) Everyone at the front desk was so happy and easy to work with; they were prompt in answering requests, helping us with a LOT of luggage, giving us great local tips on activities, excursions, restaurants, sightseeing, etc.  I'm sorry I don't remember everyone's name, but the tall gentleman who first greeted us on our first night of arrival was beyond helpful and speedy at getting us checked in after a VERY long travel day from overseas. I do remember Lily's name, as she was so super sweet to my boyfriend and me, and also was quite fond of our 2 dogs we had with us :)  If you do bring a do with you on your holiday, this is the perfect place to stay. When we checked in, they had a fluffy dog bed, treats, and food/ water bowls ready to go so our pets felt right at home. Also, there is a really nice inner courtyard and front terrace where they allow you to have your dog with you during your morning coffee or later for a glass of wine at happy hour ;) There's also a very lovely park across the street which makes for a great play area.
As for the room, OMG the blackout shades and super comfy bed made it VERY easy for us to sleep soundly and adjust to the time change rapidly :) The bathroom is super nice, and the entire hotel is quiet and small, so you feel very well taken care of. Oh, and thank you to the housekeeping team, because my boyfriend can be quite the slob, and they made the room look pristine each day when we returned from our activities.   
We indulged in room service quite a bit, and everything was really delicious and always quick to be delivered to the room. The hamburger, sweet potato fries, and sorbet were some of our favorite treats from the menu. Thank you to the chef and entire kitchen and wait staff!
All in all, we had a very positive experience staying at the dylan hotel, and we will absolutely plan to stay there when we return to dublin. Thanks again to you all! You're amazing and contributed to the highlight of our year! Cheers!",5,2020,09,03
208,Wonderful city break at the Dylan Hotel,"We brought the children to Dublin for a break during the pandemic. We had two large double connecting rooms which the kids loved. The bathrooms were STUNNING. The kids really enjoyed the games in the library, which was a nice area to chill out in away from the main bar. The staff were excellent not to mention the fabulous breakfast. We felt comfortable and safe throughout our stay despite the covid restrictions. The hotel are handling the guidelines very well. A great get away, perfectly situated for exploring Dublin.",5,2020,08,26
208,Fantastic hotel,"Just stayed at this lovely hotel for 2 nights.   We had our 3 dog's with us. A room with a balcony for them to sit out in.  Lovely dog bed in room..
The breakfast and dinners were delicious. The staff in the restaurant could not do enough for you.
All the staff in this hotel we're great and always ready to greet and help you. Attention to detail at aƒ∫l times. Can't wait to visit again.",5,2020,08,20
208,Relaxing stay,"We really enjoyed our stay for the weekend in the Dylan Hotel. It was our first time staying here and the staff were very welcoming and helped to make our stay relaxing.
The food was lovely as we enjoyed two nice breakfasts on the terrace.
The area is so quiet and yet close to lovely bars and restaurants. It is in within walking distance of the city also.",5,2020,08,19
208,A wonderful experience,"Myself and my sister recently stayed at the Dylan and we would highly recommend a visit. The hotel is beautiful with stylish terraces to the front and back. Our room was luxurious, with lovely touches like a fruit platter on arrival and chocolate by our bed at night. But it was the staff that sets the Dylan apart. From the lovely Lily on reception to the waiters and bar staff, the service was warm, professional and attentive. Treat yourself to a visit here, it is a lovely place to stay. We will definetly be returning.",5,2020,08,09
208,Jane,"Don‚Äôt even think twice about it, if you‚Äôre looking for a perfect stay as a couple this is your place. The staff, food and bedroom were second to none. We were celebrating our anniversary and they really treated us with an upgrade and treats in our room and at dinner. It was quiet which we didn‚Äôt mind at all but the city is quiet in general atm. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book and it was great value. Thank you so much to the Dylan Hotel staff. ",5,2020,08,07

208,A great place to stay,A lovely hotel to stay in. The staff are extremely attentive. Breakfast each morning was wonderful. A ten minute walk from Grafton Street. Charming. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for excellent service in a stylish setting.,5,2020,07,18
208,Five star city visit with dogs Dylan H√¥tel Dublin,"Stayed in this fabulous hotel for one night and what a find! I rarely bring the dog a Yorkshire terrier with me however on this occasion I did! I booked a twin room and was so happy to hear they took dogs as finding luxury hotels that do this is rare.The room  was great with a little patio complete with dog bed treats and dog bowl! Staff were very attentive and no request was too much. The hotel was age and highly Covid aware. Lily took my reservation and was also on reception the day we arrived. She provided  a lovely welcome and fussed over the dog! In fact congratulations to the GM for hiring the super staff at this hotel. The professionalism is clear and their smiles help to make you feel special and happy.  Was great to see other guests sitting out on the terrace having breakfast with their dogs at their feet or in the main bar at night. (Can‚Äôt do this many places). There are a few quaint little areas to relax such as the library room and Ruby‚Äôs which is a stunning cocktail bar at the back of the hotel. Definitely recommend a visit there before you leave. Valet parking is available however we parked on street and were lucky to park right outside the front of the hotel. This was free at the weekend. Right across the road from this hotel which is nestled  safely in a cul de sac, is a small beautiful  garden belonging to the church which welcomes visitors and dogs. So handy for the last morning and evening doggy walk. Located in Ballsbridge it is only 10-15 mins walk straight into Stephens Green. We will surely be back and will stay longer to enjoy more of this hotel and the five star service from all of the staff.",5,2020,07,14
208,Superb stay!,"I will return to this hotel in the future - really great staff, personable and welcoming. Breakfast was awesome, room was quiet and quite comfortable. The small number of rooms makes the place feel much more personal than some of the larger hotels in the area. Really happy I chose this!",5,2020,03,24
208,Stay at the Dylan Hotel,We had a great time staying at the Dylan! hotel staff was very polite and accommodating for our first trip to Ireland. They were very helpful with telling us how to use nearby public transit. Breakfast was amazing every morning!,5,2020,03,17
208,Kind staff,"We were treated so well during our stay - the hotel kindly upgraded our room and left a card and brownies for my partner's birthday.  Just a few things -  Along with card and brownies there was a box of snacks (popcorn, chocolate, crisps , etc) we weren't sure if these were complimentary or not as there was no price list or note but we did not touch them due to fear of an expensive add on! The mini fridge was well stocked but again this had no price list so we were better safe than sorry. The turn down service was a little early as we were still in our room getting ready for dinner so didn't get to fully avail of this however the staff member handed me some water and chocolates at the door. Our room was on the first floor (room 109) and the foyer to the lift on this floor had a bad smell (like sick) . Overall it was a great trip and I would stay again if a good deal came up as I really liked location. Staff were polite, room was very spacious and clean.",4,2020,03,11
208,Lovely hotel in a beautiful and quiet part of Dublin,"The hotel was perfect for a weekend stay as a couple. Really friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. The room was spacious and a very comfortable bed. The only thing that could have been better was the breakfast. It was included in our room, but if we had had to pay full price for it, we would have been a bit disappointed with the Dylan Breakfast - which the first day only came out with one of everything. Otherwise our stay was delightful and we will definitely be coming back again.",5,2020,03,10
208,Very nice hotel,"I stayed at this hotel while on a long work trip throughout Europe. The rooms were nice though somewhat dated and some hallways in the hotel smelled like very strong mildew. My room had a balcony which would have been great had it been a little bit warmer.

We had a wonderful dinner in the restaurant- the food and the staff there were delightful. The late night room service menu was lacking for a five star hotel. 

The gym was kind of bizarre- located outside of the hotel and very cold inside. Walked in and then right back out.

Overall would recommend this hotel, though it did not compare to the other five star properties I stayed at throughout this trip.",4,2020,03,05
208,Will return!,Beautiful Boutique Hotel. Couldn‚Äôt fault anything. Attended a private birthday party where service was 5 star. Lovely relaxing breakfast room. Will being staying here again especially for any games at the Aviva. ,5,2020,03,04
208,Nice place to stay,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at the Dylan Hotel.  It was a comfortable place to stay and the staff were excellent.

208,Excellent stay,"Wonderful visit from start to finish, warm welcome upon arrival. The bedroom was spotless with possibly the most comfortable bed in Dublin. Only disappointment was the television in the bathroom did not work. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel",5,2020,02,26
208,Wonderful get away,Lovely quiet location yet very central. Bed was amazingly comfortable- such a good night‚Äôs sleep. Very welcoming & friendly staff. Short walk from desk to room as it‚Äôs a compact hotel. Lovely ambience. ,5,2020,02,19
208,Gal squad afternoon tea delight,"Just experienced the most fine dining treat with friends at the weekend. Selection of delights, crockery and of course bottles of bubbly. We were treated so well by staff. Would absolute reccomend for afternoon tea.",5,2020,02,17
208,Birthday Treat ,"Excellent hotel and very friendly staff. Room was beautiful and quiet.  Just a few small items that need to be done, window's need a clean as the low sunlight showed it up.  Wires behind the TV were hanging down and could be tidied up.  A welcome birthday card was requested but did not arrive but the hotel did make a deduction from the bill.  Otherwise an excellent visit. ",4,2020,02,14
208,Once again a Wonderful experience!,"I have been using The Dylan Hotel for about 4 years to host events, Dinners and also staying there when I am in Dublin.

The service is impeccable and everything they do has such a wonderful attention to detail. I want to say a huge *Thank you* to Vedrana who helped co-ordinate all of the details for the gathering at the Dylan on the 7th of February- she was absolutely incredible and such a credit to the team at the hotel.

Extra info:
The rooms are plush and comfortable (we had 3 booked for the team) and they were perfectly appointed.

The Canapes were delicious as was the breakfast.

This hotel has charm yet with all of the modern touches you would want!

We will definitely continue using The Dylan for all of our visits to Dublin in the future.",5,2020,02,11

Breakfast, which was included for us, was also very good.",5,2020,01,23
208,Nice hotel but rooms were dated and disappointing,"We stayed for 1 night in a flying visit. The hotel was very nice and well located in a nice part of Dublin from which we walked to the main shopping street and Temple Bars. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful giving us recommendations of what to do and see in our limited time there. 

The downstairs bar, lounge and restaurant area is very nicely decorated and the food at breakfast was very good.

The main downside for me was that the quality upstairs did not match that of the downstairs. I thought the corridors were odd, illuminated in a red light that looked like something out of 50 Shades of Grey. I also thought the bedrooms and bathrooms were quite disappointing, they were spacious and the bed was comfortable but both looked like they had not been refurbished in many years and could do with updating.",3,2020,01,06
208,"Loved our stay, Dog friendly, amazing & attentive staff","From the moment we arrived the staff were nothing but friendly & attentive. We also brought a small dog with us, the hotel provides a dog bed, two bowls and a treat for your dog on arrival. 
This is one of the best places i have stayed in Ireland and this is completely down to the staff, they really made our stay. 
We ate in the restaurant on site and the food was delicious. The restaurant manager was excellent, very friendly and even gave our dog sausages during the meal! The staff really went above and beyond and were so attentive. 

The rooms were very spacious and they leave complimentary water and chocolates on your pillow. We were also with someone in a wheelchair, the beds were quite high for a wheelchair friendly/accessible room which can be hard to manoeuvre in and out of but other than that we really enjoyed our stay.",5,2020,01,05
208,A genuine boutique hotel,"The Dylan is a genuine boutique hotel, where you have the service and facilities of a big hotel chain mixed with the personal touch and friendless of a B&B. The location is great for walking and lots of local restaurant options. Breakfast is excellent. ",5,2020,01,05
208,We love it loved it loved it,"My daughter and I had the most wonderful  Christmas Day and night in super surroundings, with amazing staff and scrumptious food. Overall the best Christmas present we gave to ourselves, I'll be back..",5,2020,01,04
208,Anniversary at the Dylan,"A Wonderful stay at the Dylan, when they found it was our anniversary they treated us to an upgraded room and breakfast, and were really lovely to deal with. The room was fabulous, and sparkling clean, Breakfast was amazing. A perfect stay.",5,2019,12,30
208,Fabulous Christmas Stay at the Dylan,"The Dylan is a beautiful, stylish hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The staff are warm and welcoming and the facilities are good. I particularly enjoyed breakfast which was excellent. We also had Christmas Day dinner which was good fun. The atmosphere was lively and the food was excellent. My pudding was not good. I ordered the trifle and it was as dry as a bone and mostly inedible. I think that whoever made it had forgotten to add liquor at an earlier stage.  As the meal was ‚Ç¨180 per person, every course should be exquisite. ",5,2019,12,28
208,LUXURIOUS HOTEL WITH EXCELLENT SERVICE,A lovely hotel situate in a busy area of Dublin. Really handy for Aviva Stadium and plenty of bars and restaurants close by. Excellent service. Fantastic rooms and a great hotel for a short break or longer. Very quiet rooms did not hear anyone else even though it was close to Xmas. ,5,2019,12,17
208,Great stay!,"We stayed for one night, this hotel does exactly what is says, its boutique and well worth a visit, the attention to detail in the rooms and throughout the hotel make it a very enjoyable stay!! We'll be back soon!!",5,2019,12,10

208,Classic boutique hotel,A great boutique hotel in a great location. Good service in the restaurant and a couple of great bars. The rooms are nicely decorated although my bathroom was tired and in need of an update. Overall a very nice and comfortable boutique hotel in Dublin. ,4,2019,11,14

208,Ok but not brilliant," The Hotel was in a great location and the bar was comfortable . The food in the restaurant was great .
However the room was small and really ,although the decor was flash it was not sufficient to charge ¬£ 200 per night . The breakfast was expensive and not included in the price . 
No amenities so a bit pricey for what it offered ,

208,Comfortable stay,"I had an overnight stay with a friend on business.The location was superb for Simmonscourt.We had a very large and very comfortable bedroom.We dined in the restaurant,food was delicious!!The staff were very attentitive and kind.Breakfast was very relaxing and delicious also!!We will both return again I hope....in the near future!!",5,2019,11,11
208,Beautiful and Comfortable,"The Dylan Hotel is a welcoming, friendly and comfortable hotel. The room we had was quite spacious. It is an easy walk to Aviva Stadium and is located nearby to several good pubs and restaurants. The staff is friendly and very helpful.",5,2019,11,08
208,Beautiful Hotel,"The Dylan is a beautiful hotel. I was there for a business meeting and lunch recently and I was very impressed. The hotel is beautifully laid out and the staff were friendly and efficient.
Definitely worth a visit.",5,2019,11,06
208,Lovely hotel,"The hotel was very quiet and in a good location, though not in the center of the city.  We ate breakfast there several times and enjoyed the food as well as the dining room staff.  Everyone was so polite and helpful. ",5,2019,11,05
208,Fabulous,"Lovely hotel, great staff, lovely breakfast (lots of choice, everything you could want) with Prosecco, lovely cocktails, can‚Äôt fault it. Maybe avoid rooms at the back which face a bar especially at weekends. ",5,2019,11,05
208,Disappointing,"Lovely hotel but unfortunately reception staff were unhelpful and disinterested. Check in was very poor. Beautiful room, excellent restaurant but the unbelievable noise from a nearby pub resulted in very little sleep on Saturday night. Our stay could and should have been a much nicer experience! Sadly the hotel did not live up to expectations",3,2019,11,05
208,Wonderful,Was a really great experience and staff were all very nice and friendly fantastic service. Every room has their own WiFi which is pretty unique and the breakfast area was really awesome with an amazing assortment of options to eat,5,2019,11,04
208,"Five star hotel - Four star experience - Two star breakfast 
Room 306","We are world travellers who regularly stay in five star hotels.  

Positives
Very friendly welcome by both Irish  Receptionists.  Helpful with booking taxis and directions.  Room well appointed, nicely designed, quiet , elegant, bed very comfortable.  
All staff in the hotel polite and friendly.  Public areas small but tastefully furnished.  

Ate in restaurant one evening.  Food was surprisingly good (a different chef from breakfast??) and service friendly and timely.  Restaurant was quiet that evening,  so lacked a little atmosphere,  but the quality of the food was imaginative  and well cooked.  Had an excellent bottle of  wine.  

Negatives 
Hose on shower needed  replacing,  as when switched on it sprayed all over the bathroom.   Informed receptionist that afternoon,  but had to ask again the next day,  as not dealt with.  Also informed that shower tray filled up with water so had to switch it off and let it drain halfway though shower. 
Housekeeping  was at reception the second time and dealt with the hose quickly,  but not the shower drainage problem.  
Loo seat was  wonky and unsafe. 
Noticed that rooms are  ‚Äústyled by housekeeping ‚Äú and not serviced.  Interesting choice of words.  Could explain why our room hadn‚Äôt been hoovered for the three day stay (we dropped crumbs on the carpet and they never disappeared),  but bed was made and towels straightened. 
Breakfast was not up to five star standard, I‚Äôm afraid. .  
Ordered ‚Äúscrambled egg on toast‚Äù.  Got the toast ten minutes before the scrambled egg! Toast was stone cold by then.  Unusual for those to be served separately.  Eggs hot but rubbery and slightly burned.  Left nearly all of it.  Had fruit and tea.  Tea was served without milk.  Had to ask for it.  Informed restaurant staff and reception. Had breakfast out the following day, but tried the restaurant again on the last morning.  Restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy,  but we waited for 15 mins for someone to take our cooked order then a further 25 for our cooked breakfast.  Fried eggs were over cooked and solid, food tepid - even the potatoes, and they keep heat well, either the food was put on cold plates or waiting staff hadn‚Äôt delivered it on time.  Quality of sausage not good. So disappointing.   Staff in restaurant very friendly and did apologise for the wait. 

This has all been  discussed with Luke,  the Front office manager.  Even though we couldn‚Äôt eat our cooked breakfast the first day, didn‚Äôt have breakfast the second day (because it was so bad) and had a pretty disappointing breakfast the third day , none of these costs were refunded!  Money isn‚Äôt the issue here , but the offer to refund should have been there. When we were picked when we left, the taxi driver asked us how breakfast was.  When we told him , he said he‚Äôd heard it many times before  from other guests.",3,2019,10,22
208,Superb service and fabulous location,"The staff went above and beyond to ensure my husband and I had a wonderful stay.  First class hotel, first class service.  We had previously been Shelbourne devotees but based on this stay, we would select The Dylan for our next stay.",5,2019,10,21
208,Dylan experience,"Everything about our first room for three nights was great except that it fronted the side lane opposite the rear of Searsons hotel which at various times during the night the staff dumped empty bottles into a large recycling bin. Final dump was three lots of bottles at 3am which were then collected by a front loading recycling truck at 5 am
",4,2019,10,21
208,Great boutique hotel,We stayed at the Dylan for three nights at the beginning of our vacation.  The hotel was really well located and is very well appointed.  Loved the bar area-nice and cozy for a after dinner drink or coffee in the morning.  Staff was great!  Would definitely return.  ,5,2019,10,20
208,Amazing hotel ,"Wonderful surprise - come away for Hubbies 40th birthday- booked on the internet so not to sure what to expect. But pleasant surprise- staff were very helpful friendly and full of local information. Cocktails were fab, bar staff were great. Reception staff very helpful with regards to restaurant reservations and things to do. Great hotel ",5,2019,10,19
208,Enjoyable stay,"Quiet, pleasant large room, friendly staff and great breakfast with fresh juice. Staff helped out with information when asked. The hotel was in a great location, we were able to walk to nearby hotels and restaurants. ",5,2019,10,16
208,Dylan Hotel Dublin,"Great place to stay.  Lovely neighborhood, friendly staff and a the room was very nice.  Unfortunately I didn't get to get breakfast beyond tea and a croissant as I had to dash to work.  The meals at dinner were good.  I highly recommend the hotel.",5,2019,10,14
208,Great place to stay,"We stayed twice, two nights at the beginning of a two week tour of Ireland and one night at the end. Lovely comfortable rooms. Good location with good eating establishments in the neighbourhood and comfortable walk to Trinity area. And very congenial and helpful staff. ",5,2019,10,14
208,Honeymooners,I stayed at the Dylan for the last two nights of my honeymoon and it was perfect. The staff was friendly and very attentive. They gave suggestions on where to go for the best dining experiences. The room was great as well. ,5,2019,10,14
208,Out of the croud,"I have spent my birthday at Dylan Hotel in Dublin last year (all by myself) and I had an amazing time. Great concierge service, modern installations with amazing textures in their fabrics - every place you look was just elegant and perfect.  Super friendly/helpful staff.",5,2019,10,14
208,Lovely hotel on quiet street in Dublin.,"We loved the Dylan!.  Elegant, comfortable room; attentive, helpful and friendly staff; multiple, delightful areas to have a drink, read, or relax.  It's a bit of a walk to the main attractions of Dublin, but the street is quiet and residential, yet within a block of places to eat and it's easy to get a bus or cab.  A charming spot.  We will return if we are in Dublin again. ",5,2019,10,08
208,Nearly perfect,"The Dylan is still my favourite hotel in Dublin. The staff are wonderful and the refurbishment has freshened up the lobby and bar area. The breakfast was ok, this was the only minor gripe. The presentation and content was somewhat underwhelming. Other than that, everything was provided on request (as usual I forgot to bring most things required for a Black Tie do). Highly recommended otherwise",5,2019,10,08
208,Nice hotel but,"This is a nice hotel, its in a good location and the decor is lovely, however for the price i was expecting a little bit more. It was also a little bit annoying as i rang a few days before to enquire if they had options for people with allergies at breakfast time,  as my boyfriend is allergic to wheat and dairy, was told there was and that there was no need to bring anything. However on the morning we doscovered that there wasn't anyting. The Granola had wheat in it, no dairy free yoghurts or a wheat free cooked breakfast option. My boyfriend ate what he could and then we stoped for something more on our way into town. It was anooying as i had rang to enquire and would have brought food with us to cover him  ",4,2019,10,08
208,Overpriced,"The room was clean and a good size, a little dated but the corridors were quiet grim, red and black with red lights and tacky chandeliers. The polar opposite from 
the beautiful bespoke and newly refurbed ground floor. Checking in the the member of staff was not interested at all. And for ¬£440 for a night it was disappointing, and I still got charge ¬£20 for parking. I travel every week for work and travel the world. I love Dublin but the Shelbourne service is impeccable as a comparison. At breakfast the juice had run out, berries, the staff were run off their feet... it was a stressful breakfast not a relaxing one.",3,2019,10,08
208,Business trip,Nice place to stay for business trip. Very quiet rooms. The staff is always welcoming and helping. Pretty good restaurant and nice lounge. The recent refurbishement is quite nice. Location may be a little far aways from business district but this is manageable.,5,2019,10,08
208,Recent Stay,"This was my first business trip to Dublin from Charlotte, NC (USA). Colleagues recommended me to consider the Dylan Hotel in my travel plans and I was not disappointed. Excellent boutique hotel, clean rooms,great restaurant, and very convenient location. The staff were very polite, friendly, and made me not only feel comfortable  but safe visiting a new city. .",5,2019,10,07
208,Best Hotel during our Ireland Trip,"We were in Ireland for roughly 7 nights. This hotel was our favorite during our trip. Great location, beautiful setting, and the most helpful and accommodating staff. We knew we had made a great choice when our taxi driver described the Dylan as the best hotel in Dublin that is relatively still undiscovered by outsiders. He was surprised we found it, and we were delighted that we choose it. We will stay here again without hesitation if our travels ever take us back. ",5,2019,10,07
208,"Great boutique, 10 min walk from downtown Dublin","Really enjoyed this hotel. Great staff and service. Especially loved the heated bathroom floors and delicious chocolate at turn-down. The location is central, but not in the center, which I prefer. A nice 10 min walk to get to downtown Dublin and its attractions. 

Seamore‚Äôs pub around the corner was also delicious for both food and drink.",5,2019,10,06
208,Not impressed with the boutique hotel.,"Our first night's stay was very nice, the room was comfortable. When we returned 12 days later for two  night's stay we were put in a tiny room right down the back of the building.  We only had a small door to a balcony, no windows and we could smell the kithchen and rubbish wafting through the room if the door was open. For the price we paid, we could have enjoyed a nicer room with a view and more space but no other rooms were available.   ???  The room was so tiny, the door to the wardrobe which held the fridge could not be opened wide enough to get to the drinks in the fridge because the bed was too close.",3,2019,09,30
208,Wonderful welcome to Ireland,"Simply put - a wonderful experience and a warm welcome to Dublin.  The hotel is very convenient to everything but is a block off the main street, and thus feels very quiet and residential.  The entire staff go out of their way to make you welcome.  Even though this is a small hotel their service is the equal of five star hotels around the world.  Very accommodating for all requests.  The rooms were unique and very comfortable. Clean, great shower with lots of hot water, good air-conditioning for warm nights, good beds, and excellent amenities.  The wi-fi was fast and worked like a charm.  The restaurant was really good and the staff, especially Imma from northern Spain, were wonderful.  And the bar - just a lot of good Irish humor and excellently prepared drinks from Dan, Ugo, and Andi.  They set the standard for the rest of my travels on the Emerald Isle.  Stayed a total of six nights as this was my first and last hotel on my trip to Ireland. Wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2019,09,29
208,Bummer Experience,"The positive:  beautiful boutique-ish hotel in walking distance to many great landmarks, museums, and parks.  The entire staff was extremely friendly at every turn.  I think Ireland is the friendliest country in the world.  It‚Äôs certainly the friendliest I‚Äôve ever visited!

Now the negative:  I would have loved to have given this hotel 5 stars.  Unfortunately I have to give it three stars because the air conditioning and fan didn‚Äôt work in our room (room 302) and the air got very warm and stagnant as a result.  I brought it to the attention of the front desk on the first day (they said they‚Äôd take care of it; but nothing changed).  I asked our room attendant the second day if someone could fix it and she cheerfully said ‚Äúyes of course‚Äù (Again, it wasn‚Äôt fixed and nobody gave us an update).  On the third day I again advised the front desk and asked them to fix it because we were burning up at night and because of the rain couldn‚Äôt leave the window open without allowing water to get into the room (they said they‚Äôd fix it - and again it was not fixed and nobody told us anything).  All three times the employees I advised said they would make sure it was taken care of - but it never was.  My room was a suite and not particularly inexpensive.  If someone had just communicated they were trying to fix it or offered to move us to a different room or even brought in a fan or cooler of some sort, I could have given it 4 stars and wouldn‚Äôt be as disappointed as I am.  Based on this experience, I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel.  This was my experience.",3,2019,09,22
208,Can not wait to go back! Should have stayed longer!!,"This little hotel was fabulous!! The staff was so welcoming and very funny! We were sad to have only stayed one night!! Big mistake on our part! We arrived tired and jet lagged but had luckily made the right decision to have tea! The champagne tea was excellent. Every scone we had for the rest of our 10 days in Ireland, didn‚Äôt hold a candle to their scones!! The next morning‚Äôs breakfast was equally tasty. Our room was lovely-cozy but not at all cramped. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,2019,09,22
208,We had a better offer and won‚Äôt honor your reservation,"We reserved our stay in the Dylan Hotel months in advance because it was a unique boutique hotel and within walking distance of the city center.  Upon arrival we were asked to wait for the manager.  Luke, the disingenuous manager, came out 20 to 30 minutes later and explained their computer system had crashed over the weekend and they accidentally gave our room to another party.  When I asked why the first reservation wasn‚Äôt honored Luke explained the second reservation was part of a tour group that had to stay together and the truth came out.  The Dylan had given up our reservation for a better offer.  

Luke explained it was a good news bad news bad news scenario.  The good news was we could move to the Dylan for the second night and they had reserved a room for us at another top hotel.  Luke had wasted enough time of our short stay in Dublin and I didn‚Äôt want to waste more time packing up and moving hotels on day two so Luke agreed to make our alternate hotel reservation for two nights.  When we got to the alternate hotel, a first class hotel but part of a big chain, (not a boutique) and two miles further from city center (not within walking distance of the city center) we found our reservation had not been made and had to wait another half hour while that was straightened out.  So between the time waiting for Luke and the cab, and the cab ride, and the confusion at the second hotel,  it took an hour and a half to get into our room.  The Dylan looked like a wonderful place to stay but they are not good for their word.",1,2019,09,16
208,Marvelous,I liked that The Dylan is off the beaten path and close to a park. The dinner and breakfasts we ate there were tasty! The rooms are on the small side but that is to be expected in a large city hotel. Highly recommended.,5,2019,09,11
208,Great Hotel,"This is a great upscale hotel. Service is top notch. There is a bar, restaurant, gym located off site, and access to a pool. Located in the heart of dublin, it provided us access to everything we had planned. Right around to corner of the famous Searsons pub. You cant find a better hotel in dublin.",5,2019,09,06
208,Friendly staff,Nice place and not too far away from the city centre.  We had a lovely girl serving us in the bar - she was so lovely and friendly and helped us enjoy our 'night in'. Loved the breakfasts too - quite a good variety!,5,2019,09,02
208,Great Dublin hotel,We stayed here before our Ireland tour and the 2 nights after.   Had a great experience and would definitely stay again. We had to stay an extra day due to an airline issue and they were extremely helpful ,5,2019,09,02
208,Dylan,"The Dylan was a fantastic place to spend our last night in Ireland. We arrived worn out from the last place we had stayed, and the wonderful staff made us feel welcome and let us check into our King suite early. They also gave us great advice about nearby businesses for our evening, and arranged a car for our ride to the airport.",5,2019,08,27
208,Nice but left feeling underwhelmed,"Choose this hotel to finish off a short trip to Ireland, hoping it would bring much need relaxation and luxury. The prices are what you would expect for a 5 star hotel but we felt overall the hotel is getting away with a 5 star rating and falls more in line with a 4 star hotel when compared with other hotel 5 star stays we have experienced.  

The decor is quirky and interesting, though we found our bedroom dark with the only window weirdly placed high up to the right hand side of the bedroom, so there was no view or nice light vibe. The bed is small. In hindsight we didn't pay enough attention when booking the room. It was described as luxury so we didn't think this would include a Queen sized bed. The mini bar is very well stocked with good quality items. The turn down service is a nice touch but definitely what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  On returning to our room one late afternoon, we found the room service had left a bag of laundry in our serviced room.  Just a mistake and doesn't cause any problem, but just another example of how service levels are perhaps not quite up to scratch.  

The breakfast was nice but service is lacking as it depends on who is working. At times, it felt (and could be seen) that the staff were more interested in fixing themselves their own breakfast than tending to the limited guests. When being seated, you are asked too keenly for your order before you have had a chance to consider the menu. In addition, we found it weird to be asked what we wanted to order from the hot selection whilst we were trying to enjoy the continental selection.  Breakfasts at 5 star hotels should be leisurely and lazy, taking as much time as required. The quality of the ingredients were good but again, the staff were not up to scratch. On each occasion, I specifically asked for hot milk for my coffee but it was never forthcoming. They shook their head to say they understood but it was almost as if it was too much effort for them and you hoped you wouldn't notice. They would speed off again before you had to time to notice and so I just ended up using cold milk. Also, not having loose leaf tea is disappointing. 
The staff throughout hotel could benefit with some 5 star training and then this hotel may punch its weight!",4,2019,08,27
208,Second visit to the Dylan,"Second time visiting this lovely hotel. The staff were once again very accommodating and helpful.
This is a delightful hotel in a quiet location within a 20 min walk from the main Dublin city centre.
The rooms are very stylish and the whole hotel is very tastefully decorated, accessorized with some great artwork.",5,2019,08,27
208,A real GEM,"Please do not stay in room 262...that is MY room!
No stress chilled experience. They know the meaning of QUALITY.
Good location near Baggot Street, central to all you need.
Searsons nearby good for a pint, but give the food a miss!",5,2019,08,27
208,"Lovely spot, shame about the room","The Dylan Hotel is in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood in Dublin. I booked my room using a Flight+Hotel deal via Expedia and chose the Dylan because of it's five star rating and decent price. The downstairs part of the hotel is lovely and if you have work or study to do and want a quiet and comfortable environment to do it in - this is a great spot. But when I got to my room, I was very disappointed. Had they put me in the smallest, darkest room in the hotel because I booked through Expedia and got a fairly decent price? There was a window that looked out into a concrete alcove - no greenery at all. The room was very small. So, that was my disappointment. Being there on a Monday and Tuesday night - I did not think the hotel was full - so a slightly nicer room with a little green outside the window would have made me give this place a higher rating. Also, there is no gym or pool - so it's really a work place. The location is quiet, but it's a good 25 minute walk to the more central parts of Dublin. The staff were lovely and helpful - particularly in the restaurant. ",4,2019,08,27
208,Exceptional Quality and Service,"Dylan is a wonderful and fun place to stay. The rooms are all spacious with all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. It is team that provide the ca do service at any time. The staff know what you want and do their best to ensure you receive it. 
High recommend Dylan.",5,2019,08,27
208,An absolute joy,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff, quiet  location in a beautiful building just a short walk from the centre of Dublin, rooms are beautifully decorated and spotless (cleaned twice every day), delicious breakfast, best hotel we have had on our holidays in Ireland!",5,2019,08,27
208,Dylan hotel at Dublin,This is a 5 üåü hotel and it met all our expectations. The staffs are very friendly and courteous. They offer us bottle of drinking waters upon checking in and took our luggages to our room. We enjoy eating breakfast at the hotel and the decorations are very classy. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again in our next visit at Dublin.,5,2019,08,27
208,Beautiful dog friendly hotel in Dublin,Beautiful dog friendly hotel in Dublin with fantastic location. 24 hours room service. Good food and the best mojito in Dublin. Staff all excellent and very helpful. Good value for money. I would highly recommend.,5,2019,08,26
208,Dylan rocks!,"Very cool boutique hotel. Last minute reservation and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased. Staff very friendly, professional and knowledgeable. Sent us to Bloom for dinner and it was perfect! We shall return ",5,2019,08,26
208,Not 5 star,"This was a great hotel, off the beaten path but still close to everything if you don't mind walking 15-20 minutes. we loved that part of our stay. the staff upon check in were not polite and not helpful. the amenities in the room were sub par compared to American 5 star hotels. the room was small, the bathroom shower didn't drain, nor did the sink. lastly, the room was dark and the lighting was poor. ",3,2019,08,26
208,A must !!!,"There were many options for hotels however I opted for this hotel based on what I read.
It‚Äôs in a neighborhood location amongst homes and on a smaller scale.
The service was great, the rooms were cozy and walking distance to a lot without feeling like I was in the middle of everything.
If visiting Dublin !!!
This hotel is a must ",5,2019,08,16
208,Not a five star,Rooms clean. Checkin staff friendly. Free Wifi. Service in the bar is very poor. Loads of staff but unfortunately the service is extremely slow and orders mixed up. Breakfast is average again service is very slow.,3,2019,08,06
208,Not great,We stayed one night beautiful room & entrance gorgeous outside. Lovely room. But the breakfast was soo disappointing. To get away is very rare so disappointing to sit down to a horrible breakfast. Would have expected more for the price & a 5star hotel.  It didn't blow my mind. ,2,2019,07,31
208,Excellent hotel,Fantastic hotel. Made to feel very welcoming. Service was excellent. Staff were knowledgeable and willing to help. Location very good. Breakfast was fantastic. Would recommend. Dinner in the hotel restaurant could have had more choice. ,5,2019,07,30
208,Need new beds,"Loved everything about the Dylan except the bed, which we felt should have been replaced. It sagged a fair amount to the middle. The room was quite nice and the staff were very helpful. Breakfast was exceptional. Location was good with restaurants and pubs nearby.",4,2019,07,30
208,My thoughts on Dylan Hotel,"Generally speaking, perfect. The modern decor was not my taste. Location is perfect. It's on a quite cul-de-sac but and less than a minute to the happening Pub called Season's. The rooms need a little more attention. For example the carpet. The staff is very professional and helpful. The outdoor area is great for an afternoon tea or a drink. ",5,2019,07,29
208,top quality hotel,quiet location with good facilities and very helpful staff. The room was spacious and the bed and pillows very comfortable. A little far from the centre of town if you prefer to be closer to good restaurants etc. ,5,2019,07,29
208,Wonderful stay,"We had a wonderful stay at the Dylan. The room was clean and the staff friendly. The location is about a 20-30 minute walk from the Temple Bar Area, but it was still a very pleasant area with some bars and restaurants. A little more relaxed from the crowds.",5,2019,07,29
208,Service beyond the call of duty,"Recently, visiting the lounge for a drink, one of the staff noticed that I had been caught in a heavy shower and very kindly offered me the loan of a hotel uniform shirt while my own was dried off. While I did not take him up on the offer, it was a conspicuous act of hospitality which impressed me greatly.

If this is the standard which the hotel typically offers, I can only express regret that, as a Dublin resident, I am unlikely to stay there, but I will very gladly be recommending it to friends and colleagues.",5,2019,07,27
208,"Lovely hotel, shame about the staff ","The hotel is beautiful, in a great location. Room was clean and comfortable.  However the reception staff on the front desk and at breakfast are unwelcoming, trying too hard to look cool to be helpful.  Long wait time for breakfast to be served, unhelpful on check-in.  The staff need to realise they are there to serve the customers.  ",3,2019,07,24
208,Dylan hotel is fantastic.,"The Dylan is a fantastic hotel.  The rooms are clean and modern.  The breakfast is a great and the staff are friendly and helpful.  Also, the hotel has a great location walking distance from many sights and dining.",5,2019,07,15
208,Honeymoon,"We stayed here for the beginning of our honeymoon. Room and hotel were excellent, and we had no complaints. I will note however that the Dylan was the only hotel during our honeymoon that did not make any special mention of our occasion apart from a ""congratulations"" from the concierge at check in. All other accommodations that we enjoyed during our trip made efforts to do something special for us to celebrate. I would advise that the Dylan add something of this nature to your services for guests with special occasions in future.",5,2019,07,13
208,Sophisticated and discreet,"I liked almost everything about the Dylan Hotel. In a 6 week trip to UK and Ireland, it was one of the best hotels we stayed at. The room was fresh and elegant with a big bath tub. The bedding was crisp and comfortable. The lighting in the room was recessed and bright. The room safe worked and there was plenty of wardrobe space and bathrobes. The only shortfall was the desk staff who were distant and uninterested. This was not true in the restaurant, where the waiters were efficient and friendly. We are staying there again soon and looking forward to it.",4,2019,07,12
208,Very good one,"The hotel is really good, large room, very quiet. Could be perfect besides some dust in a few places, and the smell of cigarettes coming from the pub in front was a negative for me, I hate smoking it gives me headache.",4,2019,07,11
208,Dylan in June/July,"This is an outstanding hotel in a quiet location not far from St Stephens Green and Trinity College. The staff are extremely helpful, with all aspects of the service at the highest of standards. We have travelled extensively and stayed  in many 5 star hotels. This is up with the best, with the extra advantage of smaller size and greater intimacy.
We will stay again on visiting Dublin and have already recommended it to friends and family at home and in UK as well as to our Travel Agent.",5,2019,07,10
208,The Dylan Experience,"Absolutely brilliant hotel - beautifully designed and superb service 
We use this hotel repeatedly and could not find fault with any aspect.
Food is of an extremely high quality-
The hotel has undergone an extensive refurbishment and the decor is beautiful.
Food and service are of an extremely high standard.
Staff professional and willing to help in any way required.",5,2019,07,07
208,Dublin pre tour stop,"The DYLAN is located in walking distance to all of Dublin sights. Great pubs and eatery close by. Rooms are well appointed, ours overlooked the gardens next door. Parking outside on Saturday and Sunday is free.",5,2019,06,30
208,5*,"Everything you expect it to be. It is a 30 min walk from the centre of the city but it gives you a view of an outer city Dublin. Lovely stylish property, decent breakfast options. Good pubs and a few restaurants nearby too ",5,2019,06,29
208,Does not match the price,"Average rooms compared to the price, the room was spacious though. Cleanliness was ok but there was chewing gum on top of our room door so not tip top. Service could be better. Location is far from the centre.",3,2019,06,26
208,Lovely Hotel in a Posh Neighbourhood,"Sadly I only stayed on night in this little gem of a hotel.  I very much enjoyed my stay and the little touches that made it special.  The room was a bit small but well appointed with an amazing comfortably bed, nice decor and a cool art deco style bathroom.  Check in was easy and fast and I was able to check in a bit early.  The location is awesome just off a main street where there were tons of amazing pubs and restaurants.  There was a Nespresso Machine and a bunch of awesome local snacks and drinks (for an extra charge).  Overall my stay was wonderful and would highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a luxurious stay in Dublin.",5,2019,06,24
208,Dublin Hotel Dylan,"Very satisfied although we were a bit away from the main attractions. The quality of the breakfast was great and the dinner we had was exceptionally well presented and tasty. We were not that hungry and only ordered two starters, but they were top class.",4,2019,06,24
208,Lovely hotel,Loved this unique hotel. It was quite lovely. The rooms were modern and updated. Loved everything about this place. My son said the omelet was the best he ever had. They brought birthday cake to the room for my daughters birthday which was very special for her.,5,2019,06,21
208,Convenient yet off the beaten pathe,"Accommodations were great. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Hotel is on a dead end street a block off one of the main roads so traffic noise etc is non existent yet it's in easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. Exterior of hotel is beautiful but the variety of public spaces is very nice to include several patios, a quiet bar, a good restaurant, and comfortable seating in the lobby. Dedicated taxi service insures you can get where you need to go quickly.",5,2019,06,20
208,Five star means five star,"Excellent hotel, friendly professional staff, five star experience all round from check in to check out! It is an oasis of calm with soothing decor, fantastic art with the main shopping district in Dublin just a stroll away. Highly recommended! ",5,2019,06,20
208,Hidden Gem,"My husband, son and I stayed at the Dylan hotel for a week and had a marvelous experience!  The front desk, restaurant and bar staff were friendly and professional.  Our rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated.  The food was delicious.  The Edison Restaurant offered a variety of choices for breakfast: Full Irish breakfast, French toast and freshly baked scones were some favorites. Dinner offerings were very inventive - grilled king oyster mushroom with nettle gnocchi, salt roasted cauliflower (excellent vegetarian choice!), baked Hake and an excellent elevated ‚Äúfish and chips‚Äù.  The bar was cozy and inviting and the Ruby Room was a fun choice for creative cocktails with an amazing bartender! Loved the hotel so much so that we are planning to return in the fall.  Highly recommend the Dylan to anyone who wants a beautiful hotel in a great location staffed with pleasant and professional people.  ",5,2019,06,19
208,Amazing Facility Poor Staff,"I stayed at three hotels while in Ireland. I stayed at The Twelve, The Lake and the Dylan. The Dylan was my least favorite of the three hotels. The Dylan's facility is top notch. Beautiful clean modern hotel in a great area surrounded by some amazing pubs and restaurants nearby. The friendlies person that the Dylan was a personal driver with his emasculate Mercedes who gave us a ride one night because my wife and I were a bit confused with our route planning. The staff at the Dylan were robotic and the bar and restaurant staff had no personality. It is best to go down the street and talk to some amazing bartenders and servers at the pubs around the corner.  They will be your best friend within five minutes of entering their establishment.
 
The cleaning staff threw away a set of our concert tickets right before my wife and I were heading out to the show. They were in an envelope on the desk with a battery pack resting on top and somehow they were taken. Since the tickets were worth over 500 Euro we had concerns but luckily after printing new tickets we were able to get into the concert. 

Not a big issue but the staff did forget to give us towels the same day they forgot our tickets. We placed a do not disturb sign on our door when we went to the concert and when returning there was a letter under the door stating that the staff needed to get into our room but because of their policy they couldn't enter the room because of the do not disturb sign. But once we entered the room someone had returned to put towels in our room and to place the tickets that had been thrown away on our bed. So not sure what the letter was about since they broke their own policy. 

I went to the bar after hours one night since it stays open later for staff and the bartender looks at me and declares ""We are only open for hotel guests."" He didn't state ""Hello are you a guest at the hotel"" or ""What room number will I be putting this under tonight."" It was rude and poor training/bad hire. 

The Dylan is known for their celebrity guest visits and I'm sure they will do fine if they treat some of their guests poorly since people come hoping to see a celebrity. If you are not a celebrity and just a person looking for a nice experience I advice you to find a different hotel who treats all guests equally.",2,2019,06,17
208,Great Quiet Hotel,"The Dylan Hotel is age on a quiet street, yet near restaurants and pubs. It is about a 15 minute walk from downtown. The staff is very efficient and friendly. Our room was very nice with Edwardian furnishings. the area around the hotel is charming. On our last night we ate in the restaurant and had our best meal in Dublin. The bar also has a very nice vibe.",5,2019,06,15
208,"Poop on toilet upon arrival. Old room, grossed out.","Towels old and dingy. Cleaning staff left poop or blood on the rim of our toilet upon check in.
Breakfast was a rip off and no options really for vegetarians/vegans especially meanwhile its 5 stars.... 
Felt dirty the entire time there. I even think our shower soap bottles felt used. 

Only reason for stars at all is because the staff was very nice. They felt bad about the bathroom and tried to send us away with champagne (I couldn't bring on plane) so they gave use free breakfast. Location has some cute places around it, but not worth it by any means. Go to The Alex",2,2019,06,13
208,"Great hotel, fantastic service!!","Hotel was great, and the service was fantastic! Every single staff member went above and beyond our expectations.  The hotel is off the beaten path and the location was nice.  Short walk to everything, Baggott Street right around the corner, and with a bit more walking (or taxi if you prefer) you can get right on over to the O'Connell Street area. Rooms were comfortable and very clean.   Breakfast choices were good and service in the restaurant was also great. ",5,2019,06,13
208,Shockingly bad Ribeye steak question 5 stars ,This evening my good friend whom I had not seen for my years wanted to invite me to Dylan restaurant to catch up as I am working in Dublin. We both ordered the Ribeye 28 day aged cowboy which sounded wonderful. It was so tough neither of us had the desire to continue to chew lost both our appetite. We told the waitress who offered another one or different choice. We lost our trust in the restaurant to eat anything more and decided to leave. My friend had previously been invited by a hotel guest where he had an excellent experience. If I read correctly it is a 5 star hotel incredible and they should address the problem immediately not buying low quality meat selling as high. The cook should have taken it off the menu when they looked at the quality prior to cooking. They are lucky that I am not auditing the hotel would be inadequate and will not return. My friend was very embarrassed as he wanted to do something good for my visit. ,1,2019,06,13
208,Mattress which sucks you in,"Checked into the Dylan Hotel on 5th May. We had a twin beds.  The mattress on my bed was awful.  The springs in the middle of the mattress had collapsed. I didn't realised this until it was bedtime. I kept falling into this hole in the middle of the bed. As it was a very small single bed (80cm wide) I couldn't escape it.  Eventually I slept on the floor as it was 2am when I gave up trying to get a decent night sleep on theban mattress. I woke up with a bad back. Considering the cost of the room per night, one would have thought that the mattresses would be checked regularly. Reported this to the reception as we were staying at Dylan after our tour. No apologies or anything. I told them that we were staying on 18th night and will not have the same room stuck in the back road of the hotel. I wonder if this is the case that because we were women that we got sent to the smallest room out in the sticks. On our return stay there was not even a mention or even a box of chocolates as an apology.  Poor customer care from this hotel.  Not in the least impressed",2,2019,06,12
208,Enjoyable small hotel in a good location,"The Dylan is a comfortable boutique hotel well located in Dublin. It is just far enough away from the city center to offer the peace and quiet we were seeking, but close enough to allow easy walking to restaurants and shopping. Our room was quiet and well-appointed, and the breakfast buffet provided the variety of choices we were expecting.",5,2019,06,08
208,What more could you want !,Have stayed here before and couldn't fault the hotel or the fabulous restaurant. The hotel is housed in a beautiful old building and the ground floor with Bar. Restaurant reception.libary is all very well designed and must say tasteful . The staff I have found on both visits to be professional and polite .The rooms I have had have been looking over the street which is very quite at night  and again very tasteful..Meals in the restaurant were stunning and so well executed . A joy to eat here and stay . It certainly is ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,2019,06,08
208,Enjoyable Boutique Hotel,"The Dylan is a great boutique property located a bit outside of the mainstream area of Dublin.   A great place to stay to avoid typical city noise while still very much being able to walk pretty much all of highlight areas of the city by foot.   Staff is well trained and the property‚Äôs restaurant is worthy of enjoying any meal during the day or night.   Our hotel rooms for this stay were good, though we felt they were in need of some updating.   Clean but a bit tired.  I‚Äôd definitely stay for another future visit to Dublin.  ",4,2019,06,06
208,Dylan Hotel Superb,Stayed two nights during our first visit to Dublin.   The hotel was definitely five stars in our book with ultra modern room fixtures from the impeccable bathrooms to the usb and multiple power outlets.  The staff was extremely helpful with recommendations and directions.  We had a great experience and highly recommend the Dylan. ,5,2019,05,30
208,Lovely hotel but a little out of the way,"Clean and comfortable hotel. Quiet location, a bit of a walk to Stephens green / grafton street etc. Nice bar, helpful staff. Breakfast seemed v expensive so we skipped, however, nowhere near to eat by without walking to town ... overall lovely hotel if you are prepared to compromise on location.",4,2019,05,28
208,"Overpriced, but room quality and location excellent","Great location, rooms are amazing, but hotel lacks any atmosphere, bar and restaurant both empty for our time there, when every bar and restaurant in the area was packed. Cocktail bar closed early also. Nice hotel but overpriced for what you get",3,2019,05,27
208,Ireland vacation,did not try the restaurant as we were there only 1 night. got to the hotel around noon and waited 2 hours for the room.the rooms were very modern and the bathrooms excellent. this form will not let me complete the survey unless I type in 200 words..,4,2019,05,24
208,"Style, Location, Hospitality","We loved this hotel during our honeymoon. The style of the hotel is modern and classy. The whole hotel feels very inviting and we spent more hours than we thought enjoying the different rooms and patio. The rooms themselves have plenty of usb, music, and entertainment options. And the staff was very hospitable making sure we had everything we need including letting us sit in the lounge at night and enjoying a glass of wine when the bar had closed to the public. ",5,2019,05,24
208,Perfect Dublin city location,We had a fabulous time staying at Dylan. Met friends that came across from London and enjoyed showing them our former stomping grounds. Dylan is perfectly located for walking into city center and all the sites that it includes. ,5,2019,05,22
208,Very noisy hotel; so-so WiFi,Always have noise problems when I visit this hotel. Room was over the bar area and someone had left the stereo system on all evening which woke me at 3 am. Called down to reception who assured me that the music was not on; When I insisted they check the music turned up off 2 minutes later. Intermittent Wi-Fi ruined a day working from the hotel,3,2019,05,19
208,Beautiful elegant Boutique Hotel,"Such a lovely place to stay in Dublin
Could not fault this hotel 
We had a mixup with our travel agent /tour arrangements. The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful
They went out of their way to sort out our problem ,making phone calls for us etc.
The room was lovely, the breakfast could not be faulted 
Totally recommend this hotel for a lovely relaxed stay in Dublin.",5,2019,05,18
208,Great place to stay,"Convenient place to stay, with professional staff throughout.  The room amenities affirmed that attention was given to the little details that makes a difference.  Breakfast was such that ensured that no one left hungry.",5,2019,05,17
208,A cosy yet design place,"Nice little hotel close to the center of the city especially the business area near the river
Nice amenities and comfortable, large rooms.
Ok breakfast
Gentle and helpful staff 
Historic building , nice bar ( Guinness on draft, obviously !)
Quiet and restful place",4,2019,05,16
208,Best hotel of our trip,"We were a party of 5 who chose the Dylan based on a travel agent recommendation, and backed up by TA reviews. We stayed in some nice hotels during our 8 day trip to Venice, Slovenia and Dublin,  but Dylan was the best. A beautiful room with really first rate service  in a quiet area. We're glad we chose Dylan.",5,2019,05,12
208,Very clean and nice helpful staff,Hotel was nice and clean and our room was very nice and a good size. We had a little balcony as well which was nice to sit out on in the morning with our coffee. We also had our little dog with us and he was well looked after as well. Would definitely recommend this place,5,2019,05,11
208,great place,"wonderful breakfast  will return to the Dylan.  

The hotel is great and nicely located, close to shopping, near hop on , hop off locations.
It is recommended by us , but this review requires many words. I am finished and they will not accept my good words, ",5,2019,05,09
208,Dylan Hotel,"From the moment I arrived at the Dylan my every need was catered for. The staff are friendly, smart and go above and beyond to make your stay perfect, nothing is too much trouble for them. The new cocktail lounge is an experience not to be missed. It has a Ritz feel and decor. The cocktails were delicious. I always feel totally at home and relaxed when I‚Äôm in The Dylan. You sleep well as the beds are so comfortable and the linen is white, crisp and has a  high thread count. The restaurant serves healthy and made to order breakfasts. The bar is intimate and classy, serving an impressive selection of wines, champagnes and spirits. You‚Äôll want for nothing in this hotel, only perhaps to stay longer! ",5,2019,05,07
208,The Best Place to Stay in Dublin,"We arrived at the Dylan at 7 am after an overnight overseas flight. While we were not guaranteed an early check in, upon arrival the Dylan staff made sure to find us a room so we could unpack, clean up and rest.  First impressions are everything and this was greatly appreciated.  From there things only got better.  Breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, the staff helped us find our way and made recommendations on sites, eats, bars and even events going on in town and we even enjoyed the Ruby Room bar for a great drink.  Our room was well equipped, clean and peaceful and the hotel is in a beautiful and quiet area only a short walk to ""downtown"" and some of the sites.  On my next trip to Dublin I won't even bother looking at other hotels.",5,2019,05,06
208,European Tour 2019,"great hotel, close to everything in Dublin. The heated floors in the bathroom are FANTASTIC!!! I would certainly stay there if ever in Dublin and I would recommend this property to anyone traveling to Dublin",5,2019,05,06
208,Relaxing weekend,From the moment we checked in the staff were first class. This hotel is by far the best hotel we have stayed in in Dublin. We were so impressed that we are definitely coming back. A big thank you to all the staff. ,5,2019,05,05
208,Wonderful Hotel!,The staff was very kind and helpful when we were checking in and I loved the heated floors and towel hanger in the bathroom!!  The breakfast options were great.  The location was quite nice - there were shops and pubs close by but the hotel was totally quite.,5,2019,05,05
208,Weekend visit to Dublin,"Great location, stylish and attractive decor throughout. Nice bar areas for evening drinks and good breakfast menu.
There was some confusion with the charging of items to our room but this was resolved.",4,2019,05,04
208,A hidden gem just a short walk from St Stephens Green,Lovely contemporary style boutique hotel beautiful furnishings spotlessly clean only a short walk from Grafton Street. All staff were more than helpful and I loved the beautiful flower arrangements in lobby & all the little touches like magazines in & Easter Eggs left in room for our stay . ,5,2019,05,04
208,Gem in the Heart of Dublin,"Delightful Hotel, delightful staff, beautiful room, comfortable public areas, one warning beware of parking! Got clamped, my fault not the hotel. Located perfectly near the centre but still a quiet street.",5,2019,05,04
208,Hidden gem!,"Hotel was super quiet in a terrific location- easy walking distance to the city centre.  Breakfast was exceptional, as were the cocktails in the bar.
We stayed there twice during April and the standard of service was fantastic on both occasions.",5,2019,05,04
208,Delightful Dylan ,"Situated in leafy Ballsbridge this is a superb hotel. It has recently been refurbished to a very high standard.
Customer service is superb.
I checked in early and the room understandably was not ready.
However one of the reception staff immediately upgraded me to an available suite.
The restaurant offers a great breakfast menu and dinner was superb.
My only criticism would be the poor lighting in the bathroom over the basin which needs immediate attention in room 207.
That apart a very enjoyable stay and we will return.",5,2019,05,02
208,Great hotel,"Beautifully appointed rooms; very modern and stylish. Staff were great, helpful and friendly whilst very polite and professional. Absolutely loved the hotel. Breakfast, paying option, was excellent and service superb.
Only reason i haven‚Äôt given 5 stars is that sadly they were cheaper to book on a third party site than booking directly; which I just can‚Äôt understand. I even called up to offer to book direct but they for some reason could not offer me the same rate as on the booking channel to which they have to pay commission...",4,2019,04,17
208,Great Place to Stay In Dublin,"Had a great stay at the Dylan Hotel, the staff was very courteous and attentive to my every need. The decor was fantastic as well as the location. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone I can!",5,2019,04,16
208,Below expectations for a 5 star,"When we arrived at the hotel, our room wasn‚Äôt ready for 2pm check in as we had requested.  That‚Äôs fair enough as that's not guaranteed.  However we were told to wait in the seating area behind reception and they would be with us.  No one came to us and another couple arrived and had to wait also.  Eventually we went into the bar and had a drink after 20/25 mins.  My wife went out to reception at just before 3pm and asked about the room.  The gentleman hadn‚Äôt an update and had to check and we finally got our room (so if we hadn't asked, we would have continued to wait).  In other 5 star hotels, they would have sent you to the bar and come to you when the room was ready.  That night when we back to our room -room 109- the noise outside was awful.  There was a party going on in the bar downstairs that had an outdoor area just below our room.  We rang reception to find out the time the bar would close and told them about the noise.  It wasn't due to close until 12.30.  They said they would call back.  10 mins later there was a knock on the door and the gentleman told us he would move us as he agreed that the noise was way too loud.  He showed us the room (that was melting warmüôÅ) and said we could have it.  It was much quieter.  He told us we could leave our stuff in the other room if we wanted but we said we‚Äôd prefer to have our stuff with us.  He said ok and left.  So at midnight, we were left going up and down between these rooms in bathrobes moving our luggage.  No offer of help in a 5 star hotel?!.  Breakfast was nice the following morning and the gentleman at reception didn‚Äôt charge us for drinks we had on our bill but if we hadn‚Äôt prepaid, I would have questioned paying even half of that bill as 5 star it ain‚Äôt üôÅ.  He had said someone would call us to get our feedback but a week later, no one has called.",2,2019,04,15
208,Good times !,"My wife & I enjoyed The Dylan very much & were very glad we stayed in this hotel. We were made welcome by attentive, friendly and well informed staff. We stayed in one of the larger rooms overlooking the rear of the property but with only one window the light level was a little low in the room. It was very comfortable however and had everything we needed and more. Perhaps the design could have been a bit more boutique.
The breakfast and bar service was excellent.
We will return.
",4,2019,04,15
208,Hip but slightly underwhelming,"The good: nice decor - particularly the common spaces. The Ruby Room is a chic place for a cocktail, ensconced in psychedelic designs against red velvet. Also good is the location. People complain about being away from the center, but that was a huge plus for us. Who wants to be next to hordes of tourists? 

The bad: The service, while not abysmal, was far from 5 stars. In that sense it suffers from what happens at many hip hotels where the staff are not well versed in hospitality. Our room was also not good, considering the $300 price tag. Fairly small (even though it was a premium ‚Äúking‚Äù room), with some decent furniture but overall just not impressive. The heated floors in the bathroom was nice, but the bathroom itself was not luxe at all. Even though the reception told us the new wing is just as good as the old one, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. Bed was comfortable, though. 

On balance, I‚Äôd try another hotel if I return to Dublin.",3,2019,04,13
208,R D,"Pleasant experience all round

208,One night city break,"The whole experience was amazing, the attention to detail at the Dylan was exceptional.

Wifi was strong and stable. Very easy to check-in and check-out, friendly staff. Restaurant was great. Will definitely come back.",5,2019,03,22
208,Great stay at the Dylan,Lovely hotel with huge rooms and underfloor heating in the bathroom which was a treat! The breakfast was delicious and the room it was served in was lovely and bright. It has recently been refurbished and the bar area was very tastefully done too,4,2019,03,18
208,Trip to Ireland,We stayed at the Dylan a total of 4 nights--3 during construction and 1 after construction finished (on the night of soft opening).  Staff (and construction workers) were very accommodating and helpful.  Thankfully the construction is complete!,4,2019,03,15
208,Great hotel,We had a great experience at the Dylan Hotel.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was delicious.  The location left us a bit far from certain tourist attractions but we made it work.  ,5,2019,03,07
208,Incredible Service!,"I forgot my iPad in the room, and they offered to walk it over to my office to have them keep it for me - free of charge! I also didn't pack any adaptors for US chargers, and they immediately sent some up to my room.

And the breakfast was also amazing, I can't wait to go back!",5,2019,03,03
208,Simply Stunning ,"Whilst working nearby at an event we were invited to go for some dinner. To Head Chef Paul Quinn and his team a massive huge thank you for a brilliant dining experience. Your team did an amazing job, so glad we tasted so many dishes as picking a few was a nightmare they all sounded fantastic.
I wish you, your team and the hotel a successful future. Serving food of this quality rosettes and stars will most certainly follow.
I‚Äôd also like to thank you for the guided tour of the kitchen, and how could I not forget a few beers on a night to remember with the chefs.
Kind
Regards 
Alan @ Major :-)

208,Dylan Hotel saved our family vacation!,"After a booking at a local Airbnb went horribly wrong, Dylan Hotel saved our family vacation, welcoming us with adjoining rooms and foldaway beds for the kids.  The hotel itself is physically beautiful, the rooms are very modern and comfortable, and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating.  All the things you expect at a hotel of this caliber but don't always find.  You can find them at Dylan.",5,2019,03,01
208,Business Trip in Dublin,The rooms are nice. It's in a good location. The staff are friendly enough. There's no Gym. The menu is very limited for vegetarians and next to nothing for vegans. Although they did whip me up a cheese sandwich in the end they weren't overly keen to oblige. ,3,2019,02,26
208,Not even close to a 5-stars,"I will be brief in this review. The hotel is nice, the staff was amazing, very polite and helpful and this is a big plus for this hotel, but the installations are way below a 5-stars hotel. I would say it is max a good 3-stars, just like an Ibis or similar standard of hotel.

My first room was small and AC doing a disturbing noise, then I moved to another room and realized that AC is a general issue in entire hotel, didn‚Äôt work well (temperature didn‚Äôt change if I set it in 18C or 28C) and too noisy, same situation was experienced by 2 other colleagues staying in other rooms.

Considering the high prices I didn‚Äôt see value for money in this hotel, so I would not recommend it to another person. Breakfast and menu were overpriced. 

Internet connection was very good, shower and bed comfortable and location good enough for my needs.

Next time I will be in Dublin for work I will try another hotel though.",2,2019,02,25
208,Frequent guest - home away from home!,"I have been staying at the Dylan Hotel Monday to Friday for the past few months for business purposes. I can't stress enough how brilliant my stays have been all thanks to the team of friendly and helpful staff. On arrival, the staff park my car, take my bags and always offer me early check-in on a Monday morning. The staff know me by name now and can't do enough to help, no matter the request. I am usually upgraded to a suite as I am a frequent guest and the rooms are fabulous. Rooms are elegant, spacious, extremely clean and comfortable. Breakfast has lots of choice, you get greeted every morning with a smile and can choose from a buffet style breakfast or the breakfast menu. The hotel has recently been refurbished and looks great. I would recommend this hotel for business and leisure travellers alike. I chat away to the staff, in particular,  Ruairi and Mohammad who are so helpful and professional. The Dylan is a home away from home for me! Much better than other 5* hotels in Dublin and the location is also great. 10/10 recommend. ",5,2019,02,24
208,Exceptional hotel,Exceptional luxury hotel with genuine 5 star standards. Staff are friendly professional and will  go the extra mile for you. Food was very good. Quality and professionalism. The only draw back was paying 20 euro for car parking which ought to be free or already included in room rate. I will return every time I am in Dublin!,5,2019,02,23
208,Great Cappuccino!,"The hotel is still under updating renovation, but that didn't stop the great service we received. And the cappuccino was the best I have ever had! Wonderful location far enough off the main streets for quiet, but still close enough to walk to town. ",5,2019,02,21
208,"Amazing experience, friendly staff","Dylan is one of the hotels which combines comfort, location and boutique feel in one. The staff are very friendly and the current overall improvements (new reception, bar etc), go even further. Highly recommended.",5,2019,02,15
208,perfect,Fabulous stay as always. Very friendly and helpful staff. Lovely room and breakfast. Great location. We always choose the Dylan hotel - never disappointed. Can't wait to return - hopefully very soon!Thankyou again.,5,2019,02,05
208,A little gem,"What a wonderful oasis of calm in a great location.  The refurb is going to lift The Dylan even higher in terms of the quality of the accommodation, the reception area and of course the bar and restaurant.",5,2019,02,03
208,Worst night ever,It is unbelievable that someone decided to keep the hotel open while they renovate at night. It was impossible to sleep with all the construction noise and I had to move room at 2am. I had asked for a quiet room as well and was repeatedly told the noise would stop when clearly it was going to go on all night. Just outrageous.,1,2019,02,02
208,Dylan Hotel - four night stay,"Nice hotel in a really good area, room was pretty good size and had a lot of character. This hotel has the look of a fancy boutique hotel. There are no taxis generally standing by so be sure to order one from the front desk with a few minutes notice.",5,2019,01,29
208,Quirky smart,A great boutique style hotel.  Good staff.  But.  In midst of a refurbished and no gesture made to accommodate this.  No on premises gym. The one they contract with is 20m away. So easy walk. But. That gym is very poor and not very clean. So in fact they have no gym!   ,4,2019,01,25
208,Christmas stay,"We checked in on Christmas Eve , the staff was very friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed a light dinner and live entertainment that evening. The following day was Christmas, we had a lovely dinner in the dining room.  The food was fabulous and again the staff lovely. We enjoyed breakfast in the dining room two days.  It was overall a wonderful experience and would recommend to friends and family. Hope to stay again soon!",5,2019,01,12
208,Great package,"Modern, friendly, nice bar and great dining,  about 1km walk into town but safe and good location. Plenty of bars and good eats nearby.  Would recommend for couples and friends on holidays   Staff friendly and helpful",5,2019,01,09
208,Elegant small hotel well-situated in Dublin,"The Dylan is an elegant small hotel well-situated geographically in Dublin in a quiet neighborhood. Clean, well-organized, well-managed, it offers first-class comforts including an excellent restaurant, bar, lounge and library.",5,2019,01,09
208,A gem in the heart of Dublin,"10 of us returned to the Dylan for a class reunion for afternoon tea, dinner, B&B in December 2018.  Once again, the management and staff were most helpful both in terms of final preparations and during our stay. 

Many extra little touches made such a difference and we truly felt the special welcome bestowed upon us all.

Very happy to recommend this hotel once again and look forward to returning. A special thank you to all at the Dylan from the Baggot St Hospital Nurses Class reunion. üëèüëèüëè",4,2019,01,03
208,Dylan Hotel knows how to provide those precious experiences in life,"This Christmas we decided to treat ourselves and spend Christmas Day at the beautiful Dylan Hotel being pampered instead of staying at home to prepare  and cook the turkey and ham and all the vegetable adornments that make it one of the most special meals of the year.

Sometimes a change of focus is all it takes to make us appreciate what‚Äôs good about our lives.

It was rather last minute when we made our decision but a few quick emails with Ciara ensured that our expected plan for Christmas Day would bring unexpected rewards.

We got two rooms one for the good lady and myself and one for our 20 year old happy face who likes her own space.

Not too far away from Raglan Road one of my favourite songs that conjures up the many charms of Dublin within poet Patrick Kavanagh‚Äôs magical lyrics of unrequited love this now luxurious Dylan Hotel would have been a bustling nursing home around the time it was composed.

We took a stroll after we checked in along Raglan Road and back around by the Canal and down by the side of Haddington Road Church to St Mary‚Äôs Road.

The Dylan Hotel has many enchanting features and many gifts to offer for those that visit and its staff are at the top of my list followed by its cool modern clean atmosphere. The d√©cor is superb with mirrors used to great effect to create a sense of space particularly in the lounges and restaurants.

The chemistry of appreciation is in the air and when staff convey feelings of gratitude towards guests it releases positive endorphins throughout the body creating a healthy atmosphere. It‚Äôs the things we have in common that make our relationships with people enjoyable but the Dylan has a wonderful international staff who made our experience so interesting because of their efficient team work and attention to details in the most warn and friendly ways they attended to our stay from the check in to the restaurant and lounges and the girl who left us water and chocolates and prepped our rooms for bedtime.

Our real values are expressed in the little things we do and how we do them.

Maybe it was the Christmas spirit but I just found our stay at the Dylan surrounded by like-minded families   a step beyond happiness but an atmosphere of joy that fills you with hope and faith and love especially sitting in the library randomly reading snippets from the books while relaxing in a white armchair in front of the fire with the big Christmas tree beaming with festivity.

We had opted for the 7pm Christmas Day meal sitting and as soon as we arrived we were greeted by a warm and friendly young lady in a suit taken to our table and treated to an amazing meal by a team of staff who kept a distant but watchful eye on your progress to ensure no waiting time between servings.

We could have opted for many options on the menu but we stayed with the traditional turkey and ham for the main but did experiment with satisfaction with our starters and deserts and everything was top class.

The same smartly dressed manageress was on hand early next morning with her international colleagues and provided me with a pre-breakfast pot of tea and paper before I went for a stroll around the grounds as night turned to day in the leafy suburbs of Dublin 4.

When I returned my gang were up and in form for breakfast which was just superb finishing off our experience with top marks.

Words of encouragement and appreciation like this cost nothing to give but I believe when complemented with such style and care it is important to repay the complement abundantly .

I will long treasure my Christmas Day at the Dylan Hotel.",5,2018,12,28
208,Business visit,"Very good, I can recommend. In my opinion breakfeast and snacks should be included in price per day. Price is quite high, so it should be in this option. Other things as services and rooms are excellent.",4,2018,12,26
208,A real disappointment.,"Having come highly recommended by friends and this TA site, I was very disappointed with the quality of the Dylan. The highest quality rooms were either dark and small (in the eves) or featuring box-spring-like mattresses, inoperable outlets, and poorly designed showers. The hallways were smelly and stuffy as well. Requests and complaints were handled, but there was a lot of miscommunication in the process. After several months of communication with the manager I received a 50% refund, which was kind but insufficient  given the poor quality of the stay.",2,2018,12,20
208,Excellent hotel,Really enjoyed my stay in the Dylan. Friendly and welcoming staff! The room was spacious and warm. Breakfast was amazing and had a great selection to choose from! I will be back again in the summer to take advantage of the terrace and room with the balcony!! ,5,2018,12,17
208,Absolute gem!,"Gorgeous hotel, feels v boutique and far better value when compared to the other 5 star city centre hotels. Beautiful rooms and nice touches like coffee machine and magazines in room. The staff were so helpful and flexible. Allowed us to have early check in, late check out, and helped us secure a last minute restaurant booking. Felt they really went out of their way to help, esp Ruairi behind the main desk. Would def return and recommend. ",5,2018,12,13
208,Great boutique hotel in a quiet area,"I loved the deco and the general atmosphere far from the clone 5 star hotel chains. Although I haven't tried the restaurant for dinner my bar experience was just perfect, the rooms are extremely clean and comfortable, nothing to change.",5,2018,12,09
208,Amazing time at an amazing hotel,"Such a lovely stay at the Dylan hotel, the staff were very polite and helpful. The room was clean. Couldn‚Äôt have had a better stay. The breakfast was great, variety of cooked breakfast, continental selection and yogurts. ",5,2018,12,09
208,Quick but great stay,"Me and my wife stayed at the Dylan for only one night. The staff were courteous, the room was great, the hotel was very clean and warm, and the breakfast was delicious. The only inconvenience was the parking. There was no hotel parking, but we were lucky enough to find a parking spot right outside the hotel. ",5,2018,12,05
208,Perfect place to stay,"Dublin was such a special trip and the Dylan made it all the more special. It was a gorgeous hotel which catered for all of our needs. On arrival we had been given a free upgrade to a lovely spacious room with lovely bathroom. The whole hotel was very quirky with so much to look at and notice on each room. The bar area has a real chilled atmosphere with lovely lighting and we often spent the last part of our evening having a drink there. The hotel is a 20 minute walk from the centre and is in a quiet location but close enough to some local pubs and restaurants. I would highly recommend to anybody planning a trip, such a great find :-) ",4,2018,12,03
208,HIDDEN JEWEL,"This property was a big surprise. The rooms were beautifully decorated with a modern, chic touch.The staff was always available and willing to help us throughout our stay. They recommended a private  car service for our trip to Mohr Cliffs and this gentleman was awesome. Breakfast was delicious, fresh and well presented. Waiters were charming. Five star quality hotel.",5,2018,11,29
208,"A wonderful hotel, faultless","An unassuming hotel the Dylan slightly back from the main thoroughfare of the centre of Dublin. The hotel is beautifully presented being very ornate almost to the point of gaudy.
The staff are very considerate and responsive, the rooms are clean, fresh and full of style. I ordered room service and the options were great and tasted great, other colleagues went to the restaurant and told me it was top notch.
I cannot fault it and it is my new favourite in Dublin!",5,2018,11,29
208,CMO,"Lovely hotel, fabulous staff. This was my first stay - they welcomed me with some freshly baked brownies in my room! The bathrooms were modern with great amenities, including TV above the tub. Will be back!",5,2018,11,29
208,Nice rooms in a quaint neighbourhood,"The hotel had great rooms. Loved the decor and comfort of the rooms. It is located off the city centre in a quaint neighbourhood. It still had a row of eateries nearby, especially ethos. Lovely breakfast place.",5,2018,11,29
208,Beautiful rooms,"We stayed here for two nights. This luxurious hotel was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had breakfast there one morning and it was good food and the staff was quick and friendly. It is not too far from pubs though for some reason, it was hard for some cabs to get to the hotel and they would just stop behind Searsons pub. Check-in and Check-out were efficient and quick. The receptionist was informative on great Dublin spots.",4,2018,11,28
208,Always a pleasure,"always a pleasure to return to the Dylan.  Bed is so comfortable! Staff are helpful and friendly. It‚Äôs becom our hotel of choice when visiting Dublin.  HOWEVER this time we had breakfast room service. It‚Äôs not worth the money. We actually only ate the toast! The food was cold, the vegetarian options non existent apart from 1 mushroom and 2 tomatoes. There was some kind of potato which was awful.  I ordered bacon  which was extra for my husband. But everything was cold. Including the two slices of toast (yes 2!) which came. Don‚Äôt bother just go down for breakfast.there is a much wider choice and it‚Äôll be warm.  But this won‚Äôt deter us from returning as it‚Äôs a really lovely place to stay. And you are sure to be welcomed like old friends. Tip for hotel! You need to put soft closing mechanism onto doors and they bang really loudly when closing! Which is fine until 3am ",5,2018,11,26
208,Nice stay,"Thanks for nice stay. I went for business trip with 5 months baby. Friendly staff and big rooms. Breakfast was great. Red carpets are not my taste, but in general it is good hotel which I highly recommend.",5,2018,11,26
208,"Five years later, still as lovely!","Can't believe it was five years since our last visit to the Dylan but it was just as good as I remembered. It just feels like you're tucked away from all the hubbub of the city and yet you are minutes away from pubs, caf√©s and restaurants. Rooms were very comfortable and spacious. We didn't have breakfast as we wanted to sample the local eateries but the bar was very welcoming.",5,2018,11,24
208,This Lovely Place keeps going better and better .,My Sister advice me  such lovely hotel and she was right . We call over for a weekend  with our Son and from the first step into this hotel until the last checkout was a good experience.

208,Boutique hotel,"Spent four nights at this lovely property.

Great service from reception to housekeeping and the team in the restaurant.

The hotel is located in a lovely street and is very central to all activities around Dublin. The rooms are cosy and comfortable, the bed is perfect and conducive to a good nights rest. Heated towel rail is a nice touch.
We had breakfast and one dinner in our package. The dinner was excellent we all enjoyed it very much, the restaurant staff were amazing, friendly and efficient.
Breakfast was terrific, especially the eggs Benedict and Florentine.
Highly recommended this hotel, will definitely return when next in Dublin.",5,2018,11,22
208,Great stay,"Outstanding experience. Staff went above and beyond and hospitality was top notch. Character, good good, and walking distance to the stadium, parks, shopping, and Trinity. Overall, a very pleasant experience. ",5,2018,11,21
208,Loved the Dylan,Will definitely return if we visit Dublin. Staff 5 star. Given a lovely upgrade. Ate a delicious meal in their restaurant. The waiter was adorable! Minor comments about the room. It was definitely not designed by a woman. Minimal light in the bathroom; not adequate for make up application. No drawers and minimal storage. Pack lightly. Lived out of our suitcases.  No light where the coffee machine is stored. Lighting in the entire building is very low!!!,5,2018,11,17
208,Dylan Review,"Everything about the Dylan was great except the food - other than breakfast - was mediocre.  The room size was good, the location was good, staff was very good, cocktails/bar = good.  But the food needs an upgrade big time.",4,2018,11,15
208,Excellent,Stayed in The Dylan Hotel last Friday night.  A really lovely hotel tucked away off Baggot Street. Room was really nice with lots of lovely touches like a bed turn down and water/sweet left at your bedside.  Staff in reception and the bar were lovely as was the food we had before heading out for the evening.  Special mention to the Concierge Luke who was most obliging!  ,5,2018,11,14
208,Luxury and Tranquility,"Formerly a nurse's home, this has been thoughtfully transformed into a luxury hotel in a very tranquil location.  It is still however very convenient for the city centre.  A very warm welcome awaits you from the very friendly staff. Relax on the beautiful garden terrace when the weather is fine.",5,2018,11,13
208,Great stay,"I had a great stay here, the rooms and the hotel are very nicely decorated and it‚Äôs on a perfect location. The only point of critique is that the free breakfast options are limited, so you‚Äôll still have to buy something of the menu. ",5,2018,11,13
208,Great stay,"Booked Hotel via BA Holidays and had a great stay. Staff were very friendly. Rooms are very well maintained and spacious with the most comfortable bed I have slept in. Only downside was view from room was overlooking the rear of shops and a very loud pub.We did manage to sleep and would probably put it down to the rugby being on rather than a normal Saturday night.
If staying in Dublin again would differently stay here again. ",5,2018,11,12
208,U2 trip,"Excellent, blissful from start to finish. Lovely staff at check in and every other member of staff we met could not do enough for us. Lovely outside terrace too. Would highly recommend. Looking forward to our next visit",5,2018,11,10
208,Great stay in Dublin,"Quality hotel in Dublin! Staff are great and helpful, rooms are big and comfy. Breakfast is amazing. You have good restaurants around in walking distance. Highly recommend for your next stay in Dublin.",5,2018,11,08
208,Return to Dublin,"After  a  few years abscence and getting tickets to Andrea Bocelli. The wife and I decided to re visit the Emereald isle. We choose the Dylan based on reviews and lcocation, and we were not disappointed. Some great home from home comforts and the staff were just amazing from our welcome to our departunre. The hotel is so clean, very stylish and in a great quiet location but close enough to find tourist attractions. We already are planning another return very soon.",5,2018,11,08
208,Special,It was a surprise overnight for my wife's birthday. The Dylan staff made the whole experience really special. From check in to check out we had a first class visit.Thanks to all involved. I highly recommend the Dylan,5,2018,11,07
208,Nice hotel,"Nicely decorated and a great location.
Great bar.
We got this b&b as a present but if we were paying for it I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a bit pricey.
Our bed was quite worn with a dip in the middle and the bathroom ceiling was badly repaired and in need of refinishing.
The Irish breakfast was so so, took a long time to arrive and I‚Äôd say everything ‚Äòcept the poached eggs (which were lovely), was sitting under a warming lamp for some time.
Our restaurant chairs were quite loose and wobbly, lovely decor though.
All in all it seems this old girl needs fresh reinvestment, maybe then their healthy rates would be warranted.
Staff were very polite & helpful.
I‚Äôd go again - if it was free üòâ",3,2018,11,06
208,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed in this beautiful hotel for one night. And WOW it didn't disappoint. We were greeted at the door by friendly, welcoming staff who were extremely helpful. Our room was beautiful, spacious and cosy. The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. Couldn't really recommend this hotel anymore. It's in a great location away from the hustle and bustle and yet close to everything. We will hopefully be back again in the near future.",5,2018,11,06
208,Boutique Hotel In A Quiet Location,"I used the hotel for one night. On entering, I immediately fell in love with the property. Small reception area, professional friendly staff. I ate a late lunch which was delightful. The room was 'cosy' but beautifully furnished. The bathroom did lack space for toiletries, just a small detail. On returning to the hotel later that evening I enjoyed a relaxing drink in the comfortable bar area with an inviting courtyard. Perfect for groups, heated and insulated. Will definitely return.",5,2018,11,02
208,Nice but small rooms,"We stayed at the Dylan on our recent trip to Ireland and found it pleasant and safe, yet the rooms were small and the location a little further from the main attractions than what we would have preferred.  ",4,2018,10,24
208,Perfection!,Loved everything about this hotel...the area of Dublin it was in; the friendly and very helpful front desk who helped us plan our day in Dublin and our drive down to Killarney; the breakfast was DELISH; room was comfy and bar was fun at night! Highly recommend!,5,2018,10,22
208,Wonderful place to stay,"Lovely place, lovely town! The hotel is well placed in the centre of town in walking distance to restaurants and shops. We had a wonderful time visiting the wharf and watching the fishing boats come in and shelter from the storm. Spent two restful nights there despite the stormy weather.",5,2018,10,21
208,A nice boutique hotel within easy walking distance to everything,"My second time here, and I liked it again. It is not too large, and has nice modern decor. I would recommend it to others. (I was here on a business trip for three days.)  I liked the breakfasts and also ate lunch here. Just the kind of healthy food that I personally like (along with the less healthy for those who prefer it.)",5,2018,10,21
208,Wish I could have stayed longer; Would love more vegan options,"Overall great experience, and the rooms are more handsome in person. I arrived quite early, but the concierge made sure my room was ready while I had a drink at the bar. I do wish there were more vegan dining options - including the chocolate at turndown service üòÄ But the restaurant staff made sure I could eat something delicious even if it wasn't on that menu at that time of day!",5,2018,10,18
208,Excellent hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is situated close to good pubs and cafes, very central.  The coffee and food were first rate in the hotel. The staff were very efficient and friendly. There is an outside terrace which is ideal for lunch or afternoon happy hour which we enjoyed",5,2018,10,17
208,Dublin and Beyond,"This little gem of a hotel is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city, with a charming location set among lovely homes.  The Dylan is walking distance to everything, or a short cab ride into the city center.  Lovey!",4,2018,10,17
208,Great hotel,"I had a very pleasant experience during the week I spent at the Dylan hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful and room was clean. The hotel is not in the most live part of the city, but it's not too far away either,",4,2018,10,15
208,Super Stylish Dylan,"Dylan Hotel is my home from home when in Dublin. I think I've stayed in almost every room at the hotel at some stage and here's why:  - it's a boutique hotel so it always feels intimate and even when traveling alone, - the hotel and rooms are super stylish, and functional  - the staff are so friendly and the service is top class  - nothing is too much of a bother to the team - the new rooms in the extension are well on par with the hotel's 5* standard Super hotel in an amazing location and one in which I hope to experience many more #DylanMoments ",5,2018,10,15
208,Business Trip,"Enjoyed this nights stay, a little bit out of the way but that has its pluses. Not stayed before but would do again. Good sized room and very clean with great bathroom. Normally stay elsewhere but came highly recommended and didn't disappoint.",5,2018,10,15
208,"Great quality, friendliness and location","We came to the Dylan Hotel at the end of our trip.  The staff was welcoming and competent, the location was perfect for our needs and the room and breakfast were first rate.  We needed to be at the airport at 4:30 in the morning and we were splendidly accommodated with a cab that showed up two minutes early and a wake-up call by a real human being that was exactly on time.  That may not seem like much, until it doesn't happen.  All in all, I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2018,10,15
208,Super Comfy,"Lovely quiet spot in Dublin - 15 min walk away from the main areas - Trinity, Museums and shops. Great bed and spacious room with decent bose speaker and nespresso machine. Very comfortable and will stay again next time.",5,2018,10,15
208,Outstanding service and a quiet comfortable room,"The staff are beyond friendly and helpful. Room service is fast and the food is great. The hotel is located close enough to stores and restaurants to walk, but far enough away to avoid the noise and traffic.",5,2018,10,13
208,40th Birthday trip for Wife,"Decided to take my wife to Dublin for her 40th birthday, and after some research, I chose the Dylan Hotel as I felt it met all of my requirements (location, service, quality of room, and amenities nearby).  

The outside of the hotel is quite beautiful, and I would recommend eating out in the terrace if the weather is good (we had lunch there).  I booked one of their deluxe (superior) rooms and I found it more than adequate in terms of size and bathroom. 

The location is excellent if you have a lot of activities planned nearby. We ended up bouncing from the hotel to the venues quite often, and it didn't feel like it was a huge hassle.

Definitely not on the cheap side, but little is these days in Dublin & London when you book a 5-star hotel.  My wife enjoyed the trip immensely, as well as the hotel.   I would definitely consider coming back here with her in the future.",5,2018,10,13
208,Perfect Overnight Stay,The Dylan Hotel was offered to us by a tour company as a pre-tour overnight stay so our stay was only short.  Our room was very nice with a comfortable bed and a great breakfast to start us on our journey the next day.  Staff were friendly and helpful. ,5,2018,10,13
208,Overpriced - but every hotel in Dublin seems to be these days,I would describe this hotel as having a bit of a personality disorder - i‚Äôm not really sure it knows what‚Äôs it trying to be! The dark wallpaper and bold red carpets in the hallways are a bit weathered and more akin to something you would find in a West-end strip club!!! I could of got a room in the Conrad for the same price and for and extra 150 more (reflects 2 nights stay) could of stayed at the Westbury - needless to say I really should of picked one of those options!,3,2018,10,09
208,a nice expierence here,quite near down city. walking distance to Tesco and restaurants. very yummy breakfast during our stay. small but style-by-heart room. all servants friendly and nice. we would prefer to choose again next time traveling here.,5,2018,10,09
208,Amazing hotel,"The Dylan was a fabulous experience from start to finish. The staff could not have been more helpful. Staff were so accommodating and nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was immaculate, the beds were super super comfy. Highly recommend this place if you're in Dublin. ",5,2018,10,09
208,"Great location, lots of charm",The location is fantastic and full of charm.  The front desk provided very helpful recommendations for my first time in Dublin.  The breakfast is quick and substantive.   You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Dylan.  ,5,2018,10,08
208,"Good, clean, reasonable","Nice hotel about 15-18 minute walk through nice neighborhood from Grafton St. - main downtown shopping area & Trinity College. We stayed here because our Back Roads tour met us here in early morning.  Decor modern eclectic - outside of building does not give a hint as to the inside.  Our room was one of those pictured and was very clean and nice. Bathroom marble & glass with large shower area and heated floors.  
  Restaurant unremarkable.  Staff pleasant, friendly & knowledgeable. 
  Pub noise kept us awake til closing.  Try for a room in front.",4,2018,10,06
208,Good Night's Sleep,"The Dylan is in a residential area of Dublin but still close to great restaurants and shops.  It was wonderfully quiet and peaceful at night with comfortable beds to get some real sleep in the city.  High quality wifi, good breakfast, helpful staff.",4,2018,10,05
208,Excellent Hotel,Excellent Hotel and was a great introduction to Dublin. We felt very welcome and the hotel had covered all bases for comfort and luxury.  We would definitely try to stay here again. The hotel is also close to the city centre - ie within walking distance. It was well worth the Experience. ,5,2018,10,02
208,Fantastic hotel,"Amazing hotel, we stayed with work for one night and it could not have been better! The rooms and general hotel are incredible, only regret is not having chance to try the breakfast as we were in a rush.",5,2018,10,01
208,Nice Place,Very nice place with excellent breakfasts. It‚Äôs a little bit of a walk to the main attractions so we took a cab on the way to the city center on the mornings and then walked back.  Definitely allowsome time for the  Guinness plant.,5,2018,09,30
208,Dublin at the Dylan,Gabe Saglie of Travel Zoo told us about it and when I emailed the consierge and they responded I booked it and they were so attentive and helpful everydayThey helped us visit Irish studd farm and get a booking by airport as wellSuper comfy beds too,5,2018,09,29
208,Wedding Party and Overnight stay,"We celebrated our wedding at the Dylan, the venue, the rooms, all the staff and the food have been amazing and ensured an unforgettable experience for us and all guests.
In particular, the event manager, Vedrana went above and beyond to ensure that even the smallest detail was perfect and we were taken the best care possible.
The canap√© dinner was outstanding, same for the cocktails.
The service was fully dedicated through the night and quick also! 
We cannot recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2018,09,28
208,Great Gem in a busy city!,Great hotel in a quieter part of Dublin. It is a bit of a walk to the busier parts of the city but it was easy to get to and the local restaurants were great. Plus the rooms are beautiful. The outdoor lounge area is great to enjoy a drink or just relax after a busy day. A great breakfast every morning- highly recommend the full Irish breakfast. It was delicious. Everyone who worked there was lovely and the map they gave us helped us to navigate the city.,5,2018,09,25
208,Beautiful Boutique ,"A nice boutique in a quiet area, down a cul-de-sac, just  steps from a busy street. Good restaurant are steps away and only a mile down the street from the museums and theaters. 

My helpful hint is to ask for a room facing the courtyard.  Our room was 207. Nice and quiet. I believe the TOUR BUSES are in the other wing. 

Restaurants: the hotel has a list, but we were fortunate to find a local who provided us with the following: Kerala Kitchen, Pauline‚Äôs Pizza, The Ivy Restaurant, Roly‚Äôs and Asador.  We went to the first two, I‚Äôll review them on the restaurant list, and they were fabulous. I believe the others are equally good. These are better bets than what the hotel recommends. Also, loved Hugo‚Äôs",5,2018,09,21
208,"Excellent hotel - Great location, friendly staff","The Dylan Hotel is in a quiet neighborhood, about a 30-40 minute walk to the center of downtown. With that said, there is a LOT right nearby, about a one minute walk from the hotel. The rooms are pretty spacious, and very clean. Internet was fast (never used TV). I asked for a iron and ironing board, and received it within minutes which was a big help. My only complaint, and it's  small one, is that the breakfast is just meh. The staff is really nice, but the coffee is just okay, and the couple of choices get old after one day. With that said, it's still a great hotel in a good location (away from crowds and noise, but still walking distance to everywhere).",5,2018,09,21
208,Very nice place to stay.,Nice property short walk to most everything. Great Irish breakfast lots of choices. Very nice rooms with super comfy beds nice walk In shower with heated tile floors an a towel warmer would definitely recommend staying here.,4,2018,09,18
208,"Stay in modern part , large room, big shower, great food","Loved the location, more in a high-end neighborhood but still walkable to the busy parts of town.  Excellent private 3-course dinner in the library.  Large rooms and bathrooms. I recommend the modern part of the hotel after seeing a room in the historic part. Excellent products.  I didn‚Äôt require much service. ",5,2018,09,16
208,Boutique hotel in Dublin,"Very nice experience here - rooms were nice, staff was lovely.  interesting location off the beaten path but within walking distance to everything.
we ate dinner in the restaurant - it was almost empty, so we were suspicious, but the food and service were lovely.
the bar was hopping all night.  we would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,09,16
208,Very nice but go through your travel agent,"It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel with very friendly and efficient staff, comfortable room, and close to the city center. We had booked one night ourselves for before our trip, but later realized we needed a night at the tail end of our trip, so since the trip itself was booked through our agent, we asked her to get us that final night. What a difference! The last night was half the price. Which was sort of ironic since on that last night, the hotel upgraded us to an even more outstanding room. No complaints for this lovely hotel.",5,2018,09,16
208,"4 night stay at The Dylan, Dublin","Loved our stay with two friends at The Dylan. Couldn‚Äôt fault it. Lovely staff. However, we took our dog with us, for which we were charged 100 euros per night. This is extortionate. Never been charged more than ¬£20/euros.",5,2018,09,15
208,Visiting Dublin,We stayed at the Dylan Hotel at the beginning and ending of our trip to Ireland and it was very nice. We were warmly greeted both times and quickly checked in by the friendly and professional front desk staff.  The rooms are very well appointed and I am happy to say each is slightly different. The hotel is located in a quiet part of Dublin and was just a short cab ride from the center. We wanted to stay in a quiet place and the Dylan was just right. ,5,2018,09,13
208,Dylan Hotel,"Nice rooms and interesting decor. Many special little touches that make a stay worthwhile. Staff were very helpful. Hotel is a 20-30 minute walk from the city centre, but does have all amenities within a few minutes walk.",4,2018,09,11
208,Something different.,"A brilliant hotel with great staff at all levels. Styled to within an inch of its life, with some quirky touches, but generally highly functional. It was a pleasure to stay in the lap of luxury. I‚Äôd come back.",5,2018,09,11
208,Nice and restful stay,I enjoyed my time at the Dylan hotel. The front desk staff and housekeeper were extremely friendly and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the interior courtyard and the music selection available from the TV in my room. My only recommendation is that the Dylan update and recaulk the in-room showers (or at least my room).,5,2018,09,10
208,Very pleasant stay,"I stayed at The Dylan for 5 nights. Every aspect of my stay was pleasant. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, all the staff were helpful and organized. I highly recommend this hotel. ",4,2018,09,10
208,5+ star experience,What an absolute delight it was to stay at The Dylan. Everything about this hotel is incredible. The roo i had was a suite and it was next level comfortable and classy. Room #10 on the ground floor. The beds are heaven plus - just incredibly comfortable. Breakfast was excellent and the staff are absolutely all very helpful and happy to assist with anything. I'm already planning my return trip.,5,2018,09,08
208,A very enjoyable stay,The room and breakfast were excellent. We enjoyed the balcony in our room and the bed was very comfortable. Would certainly recommend your hotel. It was centrally located and we could walk everywhere we needed to go.,5,2018,09,07
208,5+,"Nothing but raves for the Dylan's 5 Star staff. From bottom to top our experience there was amazing. We had been alternating between Air BnB's and fine hotels on a two week vacation of a lifetime. I logged several hundreds of miles in rental cars driving on the other side with manual 5 speed on the left. Seeing what WE wanted to see, it was great. We had gotten btw a great deal at the Dylan thru Costco travel, our first experience with them. Between the other 5 Star hotels and our Air BnBs, we had many different experiences I assure you.
We did stay in a few other 5 Stars around Ireland and Scotland enjoying each hotel we stayed. In our experience the Dylan topped them all. Their full Irish breakfast was exquisite with their constant attention to good food, service and smiles. Americano Tip... The best coffee and Irish Coffee we found was here. 
I was impressed with the quality and style of the bathroom fixtures. We encountered all types of plumbing throughout Ireland and frankly were left unimpressed by many ""modern"" fixtures. Toilets that wouldn't flush well, gaudy ""modern"" touches like those boring chrome press plates on the wall that need to be ridiculously hard pressed to make them work. It actually did take me awhile to figure out the new fixtures at the Dylan/. When I finally did, they really were functional and easy to use, from the showers temperature regulator to the floor warmer. We felt truly pampered. 
After our too short of a stay, when we checked out of our room, we asked staff if they'd hold our luggage in their storage room while we toured Dublin for the day. Not a problem but when we returned to pick up my hard carry on piece, it's handle had been accidentally bent making it difficult to adjust up or down. It was high season late August and the storage room was packed to the corners with luggage. An unfortunate thing that made the rest of the trip a bit more difficult. However...
After only a few phone messages and emails, I was very fairly compensated without a single question asked. This just the frosting on the cake. 

Good old fashioned customer service and genuine, caring people. What more could you ask for?

208,Gem of a find in Dublin,"The Dylan is a gorgeous, quirky little boutique hotel, tucked on a back street in a very leafy part of Dublin city. The design cues are very much velvet and silk, rich fabrics and imposing bed headboards in the rooms and a wonderful zinc bar in the lounge/bar area. The courtyard is a cute, but grown-up escape from the city.Certainly my first choice of hotels in Dublin now (and I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin!). I didn't eat in the restaurant, but the bar food was good and the kitchen totally happy to deal with my slightly odd personal preferences in dish modifications.",5,2018,09,04
208,Much More Than 5 Stars,Best hotel  we ever stayed at.Quiet area 10 minute walk to hop on hop off busGreat pub around the cornerroom was large and very clean . Bathroom with heated floors Bed was fantasticWhen in Dublin stay at the Dylan,5,2018,09,04
208,Amazing Stay,I loved my stay at the Dylan hotel.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.   I will definitely recommend this hotel...   everything was great 10+   The food was very good.  I will definitely will be coming to Ireland and will be staying at the Dylan hotel.  ,5,2018,09,03
208,We Love The Dylan!,"We chose the Dylan as our homebase while on our honeymoon in Ireland. The location was perfect: within walking distance of plenty of shops, restaurants, and coffee houses, but still calm and quiet enough to be relaxing. The rooms are sizable, especially by European standards. The bathroom was downright massive compared to hotels I've stayed in in London and Paris. 
The staff was really the best part of staying at Dylan. Everyone was attentive and friendly. The food is really excellent at the restaurant attached and room service was good too. After finding out that we were on our honeymoon, the staff spoiled us just a little. 
We traveled out of the city every other day for about a week, so it was such a nice relief to sink into the bed at Dylan after an exciting day exploring castles and the countryside. I would highly recommend Dylan to those who want to be in the heart of Dublin for any amount of time.",5,2018,09,03
208,lovely hotel,we enjoyed our stay at the Dylan. We had to stay there because our Back Roads tour was leaving from there. We found the tariff was quite expensive and we didn't get breakfast included which we felt was not very good as we stayed there for 2 nights altogether.,4,2018,08,26
208,Fantastic Hotel!,"This was real find ‚Äîgreat patio dining‚Äî rooms wonderful as well as breakfast‚Äî
It a fun hotel, not stuffy and Starbucks around the corner in a great area within walking of town center and lots of history!",5,2018,08,26
208,Charming hotel in a great location,We loved our time at the Dylan.  We stayed at the Dylan for one night  when we first arrived in Dublin and were so happy we booked it for two nights when we returned to Dublin after touring the ring of Kerry. The staff is lovely and the included breakfast was perfect!,5,2018,08,21
208,The dylan,Great place to stay friendly helpful staff..found it within walking distance to Dublin city Center.Plenty of places close by to vary your dinning experiences.Clos to bus services.Bar inside and outside the ideal place to enjoy a quiet drink or two.,5,2018,08,20
208,Great start to a vacation,While not in the center of Dublin it is close enough and a great value. The rooms were very nice and the staff extremely responsive. The exercise room was current and being outside the hustle and bustle has its advantages,5,2018,08,18
208,Great service but food wasn't great,We decided to dine at the restaurant in the hotel but the food was not good and I ended up getting sick the next day. They also gave me food with something I was allergic to AFTER I told them I was allergic to it ,4,2018,08,13
208,Fabulous,Wow wow wow is all we can say to describe this beauty.... perfect location just off baggot street... we had a scone and drinks on arrival and then went to our stunning room... bed is huge and decor stunning.   The breakfast was delicious and we really enjoyed our stay. Staff so friendly ,5,2018,08,11

208,Awesome ,"Fantastic stay from start to finish. Expensive, but worth it. Bed gorgeous, room quiet, cocktails great.staff wonderful. Great stay. Highly recommended. Well worth a treat in Dublin if you get the chance",5,2018,08,08
208,The downside,"Was the last stop of our Ireland tour. Hotel is nice. The downside is the service. There were two people one at the reception and one at the Resturant that were doing their job fantastically. However, service in general at the hotel needs a bit working on.",3,2018,08,07
208,Pleasant quiet with anonymity but sadly breakfast was a disappointment.,"My stay here was very pleasant, I requested a quiet room with a bath and was upgraded to a beautiful front facing room with sash windows and of course a bath. We felt left alone but very taken care of.  The location is perfect.  The only let down was the breakfast, there is a continental buffet which looked very uninspiring and quite bland so we opted out, and an option for a cooked breakfast. I ordered the Eggs Florentine my husband the  Eggs Benedict both where not at all up to the standard the hotel clearly holds itself to.  I will stay again but I would wander out to the many spots on Baggot Street for breakfast instead.",4,2018,08,07
208,Outstanding! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Loved our stay here - beautiful building excellent service.  Quiet and luxurious. Room decor and bed meant we would happily never leave üòç Breakfast was served in our room and excelled our expectations.,5,2018,08,07
208,A fabulous 5 star boutique hotel in Dublin,"This hotel was recommended by the owners of Clonganny House in County Wexford, which travellers should also visit. From the moment we stepped in the door, to the upgraded room on the 3rd floor, everything was fabulous.
The quality and service throughout the whole hotel was impeccable and is highly recommended.",5,2018,08,06
208,the room,"the rooms are very very small , to be able to place 1 of our suitcases on the case stand we had to put a chair in the wardrobe , the 2 bag could not be opened unless you climbed over it . for the money paid not worth it . go down the road 50 mtrs and stay at the Landsdown Hotel , great value for your money.",3,2018,08,05
208,Posh & Friendly Boutique Hotel,"We stayed for three nights and it was a perfect place to recover from jet lag and explore Dublin on the first leg of our journey around Ireland.  Staff was friendly, location quiet, low key and excellent food.   ",5,2018,08,04
208,Best.Hotel.Ever!! :),"Best hotel I have ever stayed in and I cannot wait to stay there again! The room amenities were perfect and the staff were very friendly and professional. The hotel itself is simply stunning and is a good distance to the center of Dublin. Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a relaxing, luxurious and comfortable stay. ",5,2018,08,02
208,Wonderful event and overnight stay,"Vedrana, Bernardo and their team were the most helpful, accommodating and obliging events team I could possibly have hoped for, for helping me to organise a recent event for my sister and her family and friends. Nothing was a problem to them and the day went flawlessly.
We stayed overnight at the hotel aswell, our room was large, very comfortable, well stocked; our breakfast in our room the next morning was served exactly on time and was absolutely delicious. Sincere thanks to all at The Dylan for making it a most memorable weekend for us all.",5,2018,08,02
208,Not worth it; none responsive Manger.,"How to review this hotel? It presents a massive challenge. The food and drink were outstanding. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms well appointed and very comfortable. The customer service is where there is a problem. The hotel staff are very well trained and ran nearly all functions of the hotel to an excellent standard. Except that on my floor, the 2nd, there was some celebrity staying and apparently smoking all the weed Ireland had to offer. The entire floor, including my room stunk of weed. I make no judgments of anyone but the manger who on check-out told me: ""We've kicked the signer out. I wouldn't know what weed smells like; some people like it"". A 450 Euro a night the halls and my room shouldn't stink. The lack of concern on this simply means I'll exercise choice-- there are other outstanding hotels in Dublin.",1,2018,07,30
208,Vacation,"I enjoyed my stay with you very much, Everyone was kind and helpful.  Thank you for your help. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Ireland and o would happily stay there again.  You made my stay in Dublin very pleasant. ",5,2018,07,30
208,A Pleasant Surprise,"My wife and I recently spent four nights at the Dylan. We arrived with modest expectations as the hotel is located on a side street in a residential neighborhood.We ended up being very satisfied with our experience at the hotel.The rooms are very comfortable and well maintained.The staff was generally helpful and accommodating with suggestions about restaurants and night life( in particular life music venues).The location of the hotel was not a problem--it is one block from Baggot Street,one of the city's major thoroughfares, and 20-25 minute walk to some of the city's landmarks,including Trinity College,the Temple Bar area,St. Stephen's Green public park,and the Irish National Gallery.There are a number of excellent restaurants nearby including Matt the Thresher,where we enjoyed a superb sea food dinner.There is also an excellent restaurant(The Tavern) part of the hotel,where you can enjoy breakfast,lunch,and dinner or just drinks in an outdoor patio area or inner courtyard. On our last night in Dublin we were blown away by our meal at the Tavern--our cod and chicken entrees were out of this world. If you don't mind doing some serious walking(though cabs are easily available)this is a great place to stay.",4,2018,07,29
208,Hit and miss,"Our tour commenced at this hotel so we decided to stay for three nights prior to see the sights of Dublin. Check in was quite slow and some reception staff needed to be taught some people skills. A smile is worth a thousand words to someone who has been travelling for 24 hours. The room was clean, but the bed could have been replaced, as it sagged in the middle. This was the same in the room we had the night we stayed after the tour. Bar and restaurant staff very friendly and service good so that was a plus. It is a long walk into town and also to the closest hop on,hop off bus stop. For a 4 star hotel, a little disappointing.",3,2018,07,29
208,Dylan review,Excellent all around!! Our family had 2 rooms and they were both outstanding. The people at the front desk were great. They made us reservations and helped when our shuttle to the airport was delayed. The restaurant was also outstanding. We ate dinner and brunch there. Excellent food. We can't say more nice things about the Dylan.  We would definitely recommend and go back there to stay.,5,2018,07,26
208,Not as nice as the Dylan Amsterdam ,"We stayed at the Dylan hotel in Amsterdam which was a 3 day break which was amazing and the staff were so friendly and so helpful, unlike the Dylan in Dublin!  We were very disappointed! We arrived early in the morning and made are way to the hotel and asked to leave are suitcases whilst we went to do some sightseeing. There was a lady on reception who was quite miserable and when I said anything she answered with an erm ! Not pleasant nor professional! I mentioned this to the taxi driver and he knew exactly who I was talk about! 
We had a great day out in Dublin and returned to the hotel late afternoon, I was told by the same lady are suitcases were in are room! 
They weren‚Äôt, I called reception to be told they would bring them up! In actual fact they had been misplaced, when they finally found them ( in some other bedroom!) no apology from that lady ! She has no manners considering she works on the front desk! I expect better standards from a 5 star hotel! 
We had booked a table in the restaurant which was very nice and the food was excellent. During are meal a young gentleman ( I presume he was the restaurant manager) wasn‚Äôt awfully pleasant to a member of staff ( raised voices) he should have taken this out of the restaurant! He didn‚Äôt smile at all I found him unpleasant! The member of staff was a very nice lady. 
Overall I wouldn‚Äôt stay at the Dylan 5 star hotel in Dublin ( I highly recommend the one in Amsterdam)! I found many of the staff unpleasant and not at all welcoming!! Spoilt by the staff! 
The young gentleman who served us coffee when we arrived was very nice and polite ! It‚Äôs a shame a select few were miserable! ",3,2018,07,26
208,A hidden gem,"Enjoyed our stay. Located near whatever you needed. Good service, really nice room.... spacious even by US standards. Helpful staff who wanted to make sure we had any needs met.  I would go back again.                                 ",5,2018,07,23
208,Disappointed ,"We decided to try and taste the brunch, since this is apparently a good hotel with a class. We left very disappointed. Ordered omlet and French toast, and both were honestly disappointing.. Omlet was done like a wrap, but egg texture was just weird, felt like gel, and all ingredients for omlet were stuffed in it, like in a wrap, rather than in actual egg. It was not a nice omlet. The French toast was made of a stale brioche, too thick also and heavy texture. All in all  average start of a day, 30euros for just poor food. Such a pity, won't be back. 
",3,2018,07,21
208,Excellent stay,"Couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel or staff at all! Not cheap but an excellent hotel for that but of luxury. Large, comfortable  rooms and bath rooms. Great decor and food. Loved the toilets! Would throroughly recommend for an up-market few days in Dublin!",5,2018,07,17
208,"Beautiful hotel, great location, lots of potential","This hotel has so much potential as it is classy, elegant and in a fabulous location.  Luxury, 5 star property.  However the staff are dis-engaged and lack the level of professionalism expected for this type of hotel.    Only 2 members of the staff were exceptional - Eric at the front desk and one of the breakfast serving staff.  

",3,2018,07,17
208,DISAPPOINTING!!,"Did lots of research before booking this hotel & we were that disappointed  I have just joined up to tripadvisor solely to write this review. 
I wont go on only to say the food & restaurant staff were awsome, the front desk staff were cold & unwelcoming & we must have got the smallest darkest dingiest room the Dylan had, not impressed !!",2,2018,07,17
208,Not a 5-Star !!,"The Dylan is just a hotel, it does not provide an exquisite experience that you would expect of a 5-star. Our room on the main floor was dark, cold & dingy with a beautiful view of the back alley dumpsters of Dublin. After expressing disapproval, we were moved to the second floor with an equally dreary view, but with no space to open a second suitcase. Finally moved a 3rd room after ""a sudden cancellation became available"". While the room was suitable, the sink was plugged, the housecoats were worn & ratty. Not what one expects from a 5-star. There is no concierge, just whomever is at the desk might answer your question, and two of the staff were walking around with walkie-talkies, felt like a prison. The outdoor patio furniture is worn out with bird feces on it. The manager did offer a complimentary breakfast after our horrible check-in experience but that in itself was meager, lacking in quality or quantity. Happy to check-out of the Dylan.",2,2018,07,17
208,classy & cute,"The Dylan Hotel was such a nice surprise when we arrived in Dublin all the way from Western Australia.
The Breakfast was wonderful.
Thoroughly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again.",5,2018,07,17
208,Starts from the top!!,"All staff but one were not anyway friendly and the restaurant had only 4 couples in it on a summers Friday evening, I think that‚Äôs what got us worried most. + the vally parking guy kerbed the wheel on our car and said nothingüò¢",2,2018,07,17
208,Wonderful Experience,"My wife and I spent our first trip to Ireland at The Dylan. We've been to Hotels throughout the US and Europe and I would have to say The Dylan was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Our room, amenities, service and food were all top notch! I looked forward to waking up every morning and having several double espressos to start my day. The breakfast menu and service was extraordinary!
The outdoor garden was a great place to relax, have a drink with my wife or just check my email.
After touring Ireland it was pleasant to return to the Hotel and have a late night meal. The food was Michelin class! My wife and I will never forget The Dylan and hope to return someday. 
Thank you, to all the professional and kind staff at The Dylan. A truly special place!!",5,2018,07,16
208,Breakfast at the Dylan ,We had our anniversary breakfast at the Dylan this week and it was superb- we sat out on the terrace in the sun. The service was really excellent and the food too was top notch.. the perfect treat. I had eggs Benedict and it was the first time in a long while that I can give full marks for this dish.. the coffee was great too!,5,2018,07,15
208,Stylish boutique hotel close to Aviva stadium,"Stayed here for a concert at the Aviva stadium which is just a 10 min walk away. 

Central Dublin also just 15 min walk. 

Staff were curtious and helpful, breakfast buffet was fine but maybe a bit limited.  

I‚Äôd definitely come back with either my husband or with friends. ",5,2018,07,09
208,‚Äúdylan‚Äù,"The Dylan hotel is modern and stylish with a personal touch. 
The reception staff are lovely, Ruari checked us in and was very pleasant and confident at his job, there is no rooming in this hotel. 
We have food later on and Nicole the waitress could not have been better, a true jem of the hotel, likewise for breakfast, Rebecca served us and was such a pleasant lady bursting with Confidence.
Some of the staff struggled with the English language.
There seemed to be very little managerial presence in the hotel? 
The staff seemed to be under pressure as a result of this, yet they made the best of it. 
I would love to come back to the Dylan and stay. 
The decor and ambiance in the hotel as fabulous.
The rooms are very well done with wonderful mini bar! 
The wooden floor seems a bit cold in the rooms but you get used to it. 
The bathrooms are just amazing, the black Italian marble is very tasteful! 

See you soon üòá",4,2018,07,08
208,Family Reunion,You must get by the tecno/eclectic decorating scheme-crushed red velvet and weird ceiling and wall decorations. In very quiet area but still a 20 minute walk to city center. Not a five star or top-rated hotel in my view. Breakfast was hot and freshly prepared and rooms were clean. ,4,2018,07,08
208,The only place to stay in Dublim,"If you are looking for a stylish boutique hotel in Dublin with friendly, helpful staff, wonderful ambience, quirky furnishings and really comfortable beds then look no further. Our only regret was the brevity of our visit. We could easily have stayed longer.",5,2018,07,03
208,Dublin,"Got there early in the morning and staff was friendly and accommodating getting us into a room as availability allowed. Since the wait was longer than expected, they upgraded our room for free. We‚Äôd stay thre again. ",5,2018,07,03
208,Great place to stay,"We stayed in the Dylan for a weekend while attending a concert at the Aviva stadium, which was an easy 15 minute walk away from the hotel.  The Dylan is smart and stylish, with very friendly and attentive staff (which seems to be the norm in Dublin anyway).  Our room was very comfortable, the bed especially, with a good bathroom.  Being concerned about some of the reviews which mention noise from an adjacent pub, we asked for a quiet room and got one - it overlooked the central courtyard where people were sitting with drinks from the bar, but the soundproofing was so good that we couldn't hear a thing.

As others have said, the hotel is in a quiet residential area of Dublin about 20 minutes walk from the centre - an ideal base, really and fairly priced.  Our only quibble would be the slightly ramshackle service at breakfast, but only a minor point.",5,2018,07,03
208,Charming Boutique Hotel,"A charming Boutique hotel 10 minutes walk from the centre, same distance to the Aviva. Friendly and very helpful staff
The rooms are all spacious and very comfortable 
One (very) minor gripe is that the breakfast buffet could be more varied. 

Altogether a most enjoyable, luxury break",5,2018,07,03
208,Dylan stay,I enjoyed the couple of nights I stayed while joining and completing the Back Roads tour the hotel decor and comfort was of high quality with friendly staff that were attentive to your needs the food and atmosphere was most enjoyable ,5,2018,07,02
208,Amazing boutique hotel!!  Extraordinary service,"I'm  high maintenance and this was THE perfect hotel for me.  Spent 7 nights there and everything was wonderful. Had a problem with the view from my room and it was handled immediately. Got help sourcing out vegan rearaurants, yoga classes and day trips.  Front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate my many requests. ",5,2018,06,27
208,Excellent hotel in quiet location,"Enjoyed our time at Dylan hotel. Friendly staff, good food, good location. Only problem we encountered was no hot water for showers early morning but it was on later in the morning (after we had endured a cold shower and dressed) . Problem reported to reception staff so hope they have addressed it. ",4,2018,06,27
208,Dylan is an excellent hotel,"The Dylan Hotel was a great place to stay in Dublin.   Food is excellent, hotel is quiet, very nice.   Outdoor patio is perfect place to end the day with a drink.  Boutique decorations are very quaint.   Wifi is good, fast.",5,2018,06,26
208,Dylan,"Gone down hill over the years, not able to offer my usual corporate rate as they were too busy. Staff very grumpy and difficult to tell who works there now. A real shame as I‚Äôve been using this hotel for years.",2,2018,06,25
208,"Beautiful hotel. Lovely property,","We enjoyed the outdoor courtyard every evening we were there. The restaurant was very nice, breakfast was delicious. We had a little confusion about breakfast being included. It was rectified and all was well. ",5,2018,06,25
208,Wonderful,"This hotel was wonderful! My family and I arrived here early Sunday morning. At the time, due to multiple concerts the night before, they didn‚Äôt have a vacancy ready for us. In the mean time they showed us multiple tours and even assisted in getting us tickets to a Gaelic Foodball Game (Finals). As soon as two rooms were available, they were able to room us. Even though one room was still not available, they upgraded us to a better room for no charge! The staff here is amazingly helpful! Better than any hotel staff I‚Äôve encountered. Eric was my main contact. He made our stay here better than we could have expected! THANK YOU ERIC!",5,2018,06,25
208,excellent,"the personnel of the hotel were kind and available. we arrived late at night and the check in procedure was fast and kind.
breakfast was included in the room rate and there was plenty of fruit.
the personnel was very kind .",5,2018,06,22
208,I have got to stop falling for the ‚Äúcontemporary boutique‚Äù schtick,"I‚Äôm skeptical of contemporary hotels to start with but I try to be open minded but this has got to stop. This hotel is just garbage with pretty window dressing.  I‚Äôm talking drapes covering the windows during the daytime because the view is so awful, towels so worn out that they look like they should be given to the local pet shelter, and electronic systems not working.  All covered over by lots of lush red fabric, dark colored walls, and chic looking staff members. I only want real luxury or real practical. None of this fake chic stuff.",2,2018,06,21
208,Go to hotel in Dublin for Business Trip,"The Dylan has been my go to Hotel for business trips to Dublin. The staff are always very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and stylish and the general ambiance is warm and welcoming. Couldn't recommend the hotel enough.",5,2018,06,19
208,Beautiful respite,"Stayed here the night prior to starting a tour of Ireland. After a long overnight flight, I was so happy they had a room ready for me and I immediately took a nap! Very comfortable room with coffee set up, bathrobes and slippers! It was an HC room even though I was not disabled. I think anyone who was would be very pleased with the hand bars and tollin shower. ",5,2018,06,19
208,Growing pains,"Stayed here for 1 night for a business trip after their refurbishment and was disappointed when I arrived and there was no wifi (their server was down) and the room I had originally purchased was no longer available. There was a smaller room available which I took and was comfortable.
To their credit, I expressed my frustration the next morning to the manager and received some financial relief off my bill.  I'll be back in a couple of weeks and will try to stay their once more as I appreciate they may be going through some growing pains.",3,2018,06,19
208,Dublin flying visit,A very modern boutique hotel close to Dublin centre and many good testaments. Superb room and facilities. Only the service at breakfast needed improving as appeared to have just one person doing everything so time to get requested items was slow even though the food quality was high. ,4,2018,06,19
208,I will repit,Nice and centric neighborhood to hang around and visit the city. an Outstandig building with modern decoration. Super friendly staff and nice restaurant with delicious snacks and food. Tiny balcony where you can hear the seagulls and birds in the morning. ,4,2018,06,19
208,Lovely Hotel in a lovely street.,Great place to start our holiday. Nothing was to much trouble. Felt like a five star hotel. Enjoyed room service. Good bathroom with thick bathrobes. Well appointed room. In a nice street. I felt looked after.,5,2018,06,18
208,Not even close to 5 star,"I usually only leave a TripAdvisor review if I want to recommend a place but our experience in the Dylan was such a let down I felt compelled to let others know. Also, I had no opportunity to feedback to the management directly as we were not asked how our stay was on check out.
We stayed for 2 nights and at 375 euro a night for our deluxe room we were expecting it to be a treat. The hotel is in a nice leafy location about 15 minutes walk from the centre of town. On entry you can tell that it's in need of a refurb, the carpets are filthy and the wallpaper on the walls in the corridor were scratched and dirty and the decor is dated. We figured that the rooms would be in better shape but that was not the case. Even though we booked a deluxe room it seems that we we allocated the smaller room size and there was barely room to open our suitcases and no room for our toiletries in the bathroom. The carpet was ripped and there was mould in the corners of the shower. The shower was also very unpredictable- going from cold to scalding. We enquired at the desk as to whether we had been allocated the wrong room and the receptionist told us he would look into it but never got back to us. We left the place feeling ripped off and neglected and completely perplexed as to how this hotel was ever rated as 5 star. We've stayed in several other 4 star hotels in Dublin that were far superior and at half the price. I'm leaving this review because we would not like another couple to think that they are pushing out the boat and treating themselves to a five start stay and then be so let down.",2,2018,06,18
208,Excellent Hotel,"I generally make the Dylan the hotel I stay in whenever I work in Dublin. It is a great boutique hotel, slightly out of the centre but within easy walking distance of the centre. I've stayed in a number of different rooms from a suite to a standard room and can say that all of them were very comfortable and well furnished.

The staff are all very friendly and happy to help with any request that you might have. The bar itself is very cosy in the hotel and a great place to relax, whilst the restaurant has a wide variety of choice and I haven‚Äôt had a bad meal here. It isn't open on a Monday but you can still get room service if you would like.",5,2018,06,13
208,Best of Irish hospitality,"I stay at this hotel quite often as the Dublin branch of my office is just over the road. I love this hotel. It is unusual, quirky, welcoming and the staff are great!  The rooms are large, clean and have massive beds with lovely linen. I would always chose the Dylan if I could but it does get booked up quickly (as you'd expect).  Stay here if you can!",5,2018,06,09
208,THE place to stay in Dublin,"Hotel was first class. The staff was both personable and professional 
Large modern bathroom. Luxury amenities. 
Great food and beverages. Bar and dining area were both very comfortable
Wonderful location ",5,2018,06,06
208,Love this Hotel,"Excellent hotel in every way. Staff terrific, excellent service, delicious range of foods for breakfast, extremely comfortable rooms, beautiful surroundings and a great location. A gem in the city! I will be back.",5,2018,06,05
208,Graduation Trip to Ireland,The hotel is situated on a quiet side street but very close to all the tourist areas we wanted to visit. It was very clean and modern. We ate dinner one night in the hotel restaurant and the quality of food and wine was great.,5,2018,06,05
208,Nice Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"Well situativ in an upmarket residential area of Dublin, yet still in walking distance to The City Center (15-20 min).
A DART Station is not to far away which
makes day excursions in the vicinity of
Dublin easier.
Friendly personel especially in reception, excellent breakfast,comfortable rooms , some - those  giving to back yard of a nearby pub - a little bit noisier 
Overall Definition a recommandation",5,2018,06,05
208,Nice hotel,"We enjoyed our time here, and found the city not too far away to walk to. Busy long weekend in Dublin as there was a mini charity marathon happening.. Would recommend it to others,but I was with a group booking, not sure how the rates compare with others of similar standard.",4,2018,06,05
208,Hard to Fault,"This is the second time I stayed in The Dylan, the first being 8 years ago.  It was a lovely experience back then and still is.

Good sized rooms, comfortable bed, good location (you can walk to town and you're near the best places to eat).  The underfloor heating in the bathroom makes it good enough to sleep on.

Certainly 5 start by Irish standards, hard to tell if everyone would agree.  The breakfast selection is perhaps not as big as some people might be used to but the quality is great.

When compared to other Irish hotels the standard of the staff is much higher also.

",5,2018,06,05
208,Mostly good,"Bar the attitude I experienced at check in, this was a nice stay. 
 
Comfy room, food was fine, dining staff were friendly. They provided a late checkout with no fuss which was nice. The external dining/bar area was nice for relaxing, we got some rare Irish sun which helped.

Nice spot, great location.",3,2018,05,30
208,Dylan,"Beautiful hotel, spacious room and friendly service. Only a brief one night stay but was very impressed with the hotel which exudes high standards. Within Dublin the valet parking is also a very useful option. ",5,2018,05,30
208,"Great location, peaceful stay",Easy walk to Stephens Green and Baggott Street.  Good breakfast and nice bar area.  I would recommend to people on vacation or business.  Fruit scones were great.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Thank you.,5,2018,05,29
208,Love the Dylan!!!,"The Dylan Hotel was a lovely experience!  The food was excellent and the staff always attentive and helpful.  We required a handicapped room and it had every amenity and comfort.  Next trip to Dublin, we'll be back!",5,2018,05,29
208,Issues resolved.,"The first room I was assigned had a dismal view and lights in the bath didn‚Äôt work. When reported to Neeve she first tried to resolve the lighting and when that didn‚Äôt work she promptly found another much nicer room where everything functioned. Classy environment. Nice location, very comfy bed.",4,2018,05,29
208,Excellent!,We especially liked having the single room private wifi. Everything was lovely and the staff was very helpful to us for our first few days in Ireland. We could walk to all the places and bus stops we wanted easily from the hotel-- great location! The heated bathroom floor was luxurious!,5,2018,05,29
208,Awesome hotel,"Very nice hotel with clean and spacious rooms with a good value for money. The hotel is very quietly located. The staff is helpful and friendly.

Improvements suggested:

I was missing cups for the coffee machine in room 

The breakfast buffet could have mir choices for 21 euros a bit meager and no refills once empty (I.e strawberries)",5,2018,05,19
208,Great ! ,"Kind of the place you need to relax and enjoy Dublin. 
We booked three nights there for the may‚Äôs bank holiday. The staff was really polite and great to make our stay there amazing. Food was good. 
The room quite spacious, clean and with some nice details. 

Highly recommended ",4,2018,05,12
208,Traveller,Wonderful Hotel and wonderfully friendly helpful Staff. Great location in a nice area of Dublin. The bed is super comfortable. Lots of treats to eat in the room and a good selection in the mini bar. I would stay there again for sure.,5,2018,05,08
208,Not a 5 Star hotel,Its a nice hotel however definitely not a 5 star standard. Shower facility not ideal for women (hard not to get your hair wet) because of lack of versatility. Room was noisy from the street. Breakfast - small continental breakfast on the table and actual meal needs to be ordered from menu. No vegetables. Staff was friendly and helpful. Good location.,3,2018,05,08
208,Classic Hotel,"This Hotel lived up to its expectation!  Generous guest room, spacious bath, wonderful toiletries, excellent coffee and tea for waking up in the morning.  The next surprise was the neighborhood, quiet, convenient, and not far from the typical tourists sites of Dublin. Also we had excellent meals in the hotel and in the neighborhood (walking distance).  Indoor and Outdoor bar (heated and Covered) and I was able to have a cigar on their outdoor patio.  Overall, I can not say enough wonderful things about this hotel.",5,2018,05,02
208,"Amazing place, amazing customer service","I highly recommend the Dylan hotel for your stay in Dublin. We arrive from Houston Texas on an anniversary trip and our luggage was lost in London airport. They did everything they could to help us track the luggage down. They were also very helpful with any questions we have. It is a beautiful hotel very comfortable, very quiet, and we really loved it",5,2018,05,02
208,First class hoel in Dublin,We were made extremely welcome on our first night in Dublin - I would recommend this hotel to anyone - the service started at the front desk and continued throughout our stay and the facilities were hard to fault - definitely a 5 star establishment!,5,2018,05,01
208,Weekend in Dublin,"This is probably the best Hotel we've stayed in for many years!!
Whilst not the cheapest in Dublin - for a Saturday night it was competitive. The whole experience from start to finish was 1st Class and every member of staff we came across was happy, courteous and over and beyond to assist.
The quality of the room was 5 Star and the facilities provided met expectations.Whilst it's a little off the beaten track, it's worth making the effort to visit - you won't be disappointed. I would thoroughly recommend and we will book this hotel on any future visits to Dublin!",5,2018,04,30
208,I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more amazing staff!!!! Will always stay with the Dylan,"The best boutique in Dublin. The staff is what made all the happiness and magic happen. They were kind, accommodating and effortless. No attitude and pure kindness and professionalism. The Dylan was in a great area and easy to travel around. 5 stars ‚ú®!",5,2018,04,25
208,Luxury without the price,"This hotel was booked for couples beginning a 12 day tour of Ireland. The company picks quirky little boutique hotels for its groups and this one is exceptional in decor, cleanliness, food and drinks, comfort, and design. We have one more night there at the conclusion of our tour and I already know it will be a nice last memory of Dublin. ",5,2018,04,23
208,Very nice!,"The people are so nice in Dublin. The hotel was very clean and walking distance to a lot of places. The food was ok. But if you walk a little bit there are plenty of pubs around. 
They were very attentive to everything. ",5,2018,04,22
208,Loved the Dylan,"My wife and I were traveling with another couple and couldn't have hoped for more out of the Dylan.  All members of the front desk staff were wonderful, special should out to Michael.  Design and feel of the hotel is very sophisticated and sexy.  Room was spacious and comfortable.  Location was great.  If looking for a small boutique hotel look no further.",5,2018,04,22
208,Good place to stay for business,"Enjoyed staying at the hotel in Dublin on a short business trip. It was only 12-15 mins walk from work and a short distance to numerous very good restaurants and pubs. However I was very disappointed to find the breakfast didn't have any ham or cheese available as part of the standard buffet. Considering the price, it was an omission too big to ignore.",4,2018,04,18
208,Nice but Noisy room.,"Nice room and cozy hotel but ask to be in a quiet room as the hotel is next to a bar with music at night. 
Apart from that. Very nice hotel. I did not take breakfast there. Bar is ok. Food is not great, prefer a restaurant in town.",3,2018,04,18
208,Fantastic hotel,Easily located from the airport this boutique hotel has very friendly helpful staff who can't do enough to make you feel at home. Lovely decor throughout with a beautiful dining and bar area to complement your stay. Excellent full Irish breakfast washed down with English tea. Definitely going back five stars throughout ,5,2018,04,17
208,Average - not even close to 5*,"Not a bad hotel per se but nowhere near 5 stars. Starting out there is no door man or proper valet service - when you drive up you have to find a space then drag all of your bags across the road to the hotel (in the rain in our case) and give them your keys at reception and describe where it is. We waited about 5 minutes after this at reception to check in while a fairly disinterested staff member debated about the price of a room on the phone with someone who was looking to book in the future. When he finally lowered himself to dealing with us he just about got through checking us in before going back to whatever he found more interesting on the computer (and almost sighed aloud when we asked if our luggage could be delivered to the room). The rooms themselves are fine but small and very stuffy and the windows are locked from opening too much so it‚Äôs hard to get air in the room. The hotel also doesn‚Äôt have a gym and the tiny facility across the road which I visited is private and the guys there basically don‚Äôt want you around.

On the plus side some of the other staff we encountered were excellent and really worthy of a 5 star rating. The bar is also fantastic and the hotel is in a perfect area.

Overall if the hotel was 30 per cent cheaper I‚Äôd say it was perfect but at the same price (or near) as the other 5 star hotels in town it‚Äôs not comparable in terms of service or facilities.",3,2018,04,15
208,Irish Hospitality in lovely boutique hotel,"Everyone has heard of how wonderful Irish hospitality is and this was no exception.  From the moment I walked in the door I was warmly welcomed.  

I arrived shortly before noon and was given a room straight away.  I always appreciate it when a hotel is able to accommodate a slightly early arrival.

I loved the location.  The centre of Dublin is very touristy so it was wonderful to stay a short walk south of the city centre, out of the bustle of everyone else.  This is in a nice part of Dublin with a few bars and restaurants nearby.  It is also easy to catch buses to other parts from nearby.

The hotel definitely falls into the boutique category and was very sumptuously styled.  My bed was very comfortable.  I had a room at the front of the hotel which I am told is the quiet side.  
Wifi worked well.  The television had a mix of Irish and UK channels with a few US ones - I possibly would've expected more options in a hotel of this standard but hey, I wasn't really there to watch TV.

The bar and restaurant are places I would consider returning to even if I wasn't staying in this hotel (although I can't imagine visiting Dublin without staying in this hotel!).",5,2018,04,15
208,"Great boutique hotel within walking distance of restaurants, pubs, parks and downtown","Great boutique hotel with excellent customer service walking distance from everything.the staff provides excellent recommendations for restaurants, day trips and places to visits. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of restaurants, pubs and landmarks.",5,2018,04,12
208,Short stay in Dublin,"Overall it was a lovely stay at the Dylan. However if you provide a bath, it should be full size. The food was delicious, service was excellent. Location was good, but not sure why it gets a 5 star rating.",4,2018,04,10
208,Dylan weekend break,"Handy location , quirky decor , older rooms are nicer than the new block , comfortable , clean rooms , nice bar and restaurant. Friendly staff. Use of private gym next door very handy , lovely location along the river .",4,2018,04,10
208,Nice boutique hotel in central Dublin,"Very pretty hotel with great attention to decor detail, especially lighting and seating. A little busy at times with two weddings over a 3 day weekend stay where the dining room wasn't available but they catered for diners in the library which looked nice. Had breakfast one day as wasn't included and slightly expensive I thought but absolutely delicious and worth it if you're hungry! Rooms were lovely although seem to vary greatly as our friends' room was almost twice the size of ours. Lovely turn down service with free water and chocolates. Great mini bar selection of drinks and snacks if a little pricey.",4,2018,04,10
208,Great staff,"Stayed here for a couple of nights.  It feels like a huge hotel, the room we stayed in was up a lift through some fire doors down some stairs all while walking on plush red carpets.  Upon arrival to the room it hard hard floors, a window that backed on to a pub garden but a plush bathroom and comfortable bed.  The boutique feel of the rest of the hotel did not follow through to the room I felt which was a bit disappointing.  
Sleep was disturbed with the bar outside the window closing at 2:30am one of the nights and the empty bottle collection early in the mornings.  
The staff were really friendly and client focused.  The area it is situated in is generally very nice and it takes about 20 minutes to walk into the city centre.  It‚Äôs very easy to get around.  
Would consider staying again if the room location meant a quieter nights sleep.",3,2018,04,09
208,The Perfect Stay,We all stayed at The Dylan recently for a very special event and we were beyond impressed by the hotel and the service. We hired out the private Library for a function and it was beautiful. Our rooms in the hotel were spotless and the food was top class. Of everything we were most impressed by the staff and the service. Nothing was too much and they couldn‚Äôt do enough to help us. A very special thank you to Vedrana and Michael who went above and beyond to ensure everything went smoothly.  They are what good customer service is all about. Will be looking forward to returning to The Dylan. ,5,2018,04,09
208,Great hotel in quiet cul de sac but near everything!,"This is an excellent hotel with exceptional staff and an ideal location. Situated in a quiet cul de sac, yet only a 5 minute walk from many restaurants (including our favourite Japanese place), bars and shops. 
The rooms are well kitted out with beautiful fittings and fixtures. This includes a mini bar, Nespresso coffee machine, underfloor heating and handmade soap company products. 
The turn down service included laying out hotel robes as well as a bottle of water and delicious chocolate. 
We would definitely stay there again!",4,2018,04,08
208,Great Quiet Hotel near City Centre,Very comfortable hotel near city centre and Aviva stadium. Some lovely restaurants nearby. Breakfast a little dear but again a number of breakfast places nearby. Staff extremely helpful at all times. Bar service and snacks are excellent. ,4,2018,04,04
208,Excellent stay,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Dylan for 2 nights 1st-3rd April and we could not have asked for a better stay. 

Due to our flight time we got to the hotel at 8am to drop off our cases (as check in isn‚Äôt available until 2pm) but on arrival they let us check in and upgraded our room for free, which was a very nice surprise.

Turn down service offered each evening, however, we didn‚Äôt take the offer as we didn‚Äôt think it was necessary as every day they brought 2 bottles of water and chocolates to our room, yum! 

There is a bar behind the hotel and our window faced the smoking area which was really loud. This wasn‚Äôt a problem for us as we‚Äôre a young couple and stay out late ourselves but I would keep this in mind if you like to go to bed early. Also, the pub does a really nice full Irish breakfast!!

Overall it was an amazing stay and I would definitely recommend to anyone going on a trip to Dublin.",5,2018,04,04
208,Once again an amazing stay.,"It‚Äôs the second time we have been to this hotel.  We bring our dog with us as this is one of a few hotels in Dublin who allow dogs to stay.  We are made to feel so welcome, From the moment you check in nothing is too much trouble.  The staff go above and beyond to make our stay a pleasurable one.  There is nothing that i would change.  The breakfast was really good. Even a vegetarian version which was very tasty.  We had dinner on our last visit which was really good.  Can‚Äôt was for the next time we stay.  Thanks again to all the wonderful staff ",5,2018,04,04
208,Gorgeous hotel,"The staff we so friendly and helpful, the room was gorgeous, I loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom, and the food was just perfect - I'll definitely stay again and recommend it to all my friends and colleagues too.",5,2018,04,04
208,Beyond expectation service,I stayed for one night and forgot one toiletry item when I called the guest service who actually went to a close by store to buy it for me. Beyond expectation service that really impressed me!! Thank you!,5,2018,04,03
208,"Fab hotel, great location","Couldn't recommend it enough - lovely staff, great location and exceptionally comfy beds. Great for a city break. Couldn't recommend it enough. We'll definitely stay again on our next weekend in Dublin. ",5,2018,04,03
208,Excellent,"Really dealt with a small issue we had in a very professional manner and looked after us extremely well! Always stay here when on business and pleasure in Dublin, great location! Will remain number one choice in Dublin",5,2018,03,27
208,A really nice experiences,"Travelling back from the USA, I had to stay in Dublin for a night and I selected the Dylan for the purpose of this type of experience. 
On check-in, the front of house gents where super nice, helpful and engaging. However, this is the type of service engagement that you would expect from this hotel standard. 
The room was really nice, bed was comfortable, I liked the underfloor heating option. But, what I really want to rave on about is... I enjoyed the best cod fish dish I have eaten in a long time, the food from the dinner service was super and really tasty. 
Essentially, I highly recommend the Dylan Hotel.",5,2018,03,27
208,Perfect ,"Had an amazing visit to the Dylan hotel to celebrate a birthday. The room was beautiful with fab facilities including rain shower and underfloor heating. We had dinner in  house and enjoyed the lovely court yard for a few cocktails after. All staff we encountered were courteous and very helpful. Couldn‚Äôt fault the place, definitely worth a visit. ",5,2018,03,25
208,Excellent boutique hotel ,"I stayed 3 nights at the Dylan at the end of a week in Ireland. The room was large and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a large walk in shower. Loved having the Nexpresso machine in the room.  I really loved the neighborhood which is more residential and away from the tourist traffic.  It‚Äôs just a 10 minute walk to St. Stephen‚Äôs Green.  There are many restaurants and food shops just around the corner.

Not a five because the hallway decor is really utilitarian and not consistent with a five star property (in my opinion). And there was no shade under my curtain so there was no option to leave the curtain up unless you wanted a direct view to/from the office next door.  Finally the garden of a nearby pub can be noisy in the evening - not terrible but something to be mindful of.  ",4,2018,03,24
208,I felt at home,We love the Dylan. The staff will bend over backwards to please. The location is perfect . One can walk to the city centre and to so many other places of interest. The bar and lounges on the ground floor are so pleasant. ,5,2018,03,21
208,Good Hotel - Very good bar :-),"Its a nice hotel with very good service. A litle bit outside from Dublin, but still with many nice bars around and the cocktailbar at the hotel is super. The restaurant at the hotel is also very good.",5,2018,03,21
208,Gorgeousssssssss,"We arrived at 11am and had a warm greeting and complementary coffee while we waited 10 mins for our room, this hotel is a boutique style hotel and had beautiful decorations. It‚Äôs a little out of town , approx 25 mins into centre but it‚Äôs a nice walk . Beautiful room although the bed is quite small! The bathroom is spotless and I love all the attention to detail . I would highly recommend this lovely hotel .",5,2018,03,20
208,Fantastic hotel in great location,"Really nice high quality hotel with a boutique hotel feel. Extremely helpful staff. Great outdoor drinking area, all within short walk to city center and also herbert park. Rooms are extremely comfortable and finished to a very high spec. Will definitely return.",5,2018,03,16
208,Nice buzz in bar and great staff,Stayed last Saturday night. Rugby game was on so very busy. Service and food excellent in the restaurant. Menu simple but good. Good pint in the bar and great atmosphere. Only thing is the rooms are not as luxurious as the other 5 stars in Dublin. The mini bar is well stocked with goodies and snacks which I think is a good sign of a hotel. Overall the staff do make up for the lack of luxury in the room. Hotel and staff 5 star room a good 4 star ! Hotel is located in one of the best neighborhoods in Dublin near nice bars and restaurants.,4,2018,03,14
208,Intimate Delight ,"To celebrate a rather important birthday I booked a a table for two for the 10th of March totally forgetting the Ireland v Scotland Rugby Match taking place just around the corner! Fearing the worst, we arrived to find, predictably, the place jammed with supporters from both sides. However, the dining room was quite peaceful and we were able to take our seats early and enjoy a few drinks before eating. Despite the fact that the staff were under severe pressure with number of people on the premises, the service was quite exceptional. Great credit to all concerned, a first class meal enjoyed, and unsolicited, a small birthday cake delivered to the table to finish off a delightful evening! ",4,2018,03,13
208,Great food and location.,"The food at Dyan's was excellent.  We were stranded in the hotel during Snowstorm Emma.  Luckily the food made the snowstorm experience less stressful.  We love the afternoon tea and the food menu at the bar.   Great location.  There is a Boots, Tesco, ATM and lots of other restaurant options near by.  Hotel is also around the corner from the canal - excellent for running or a stroll.       ",5,2018,03,07
208,Not family friendly mid week,"Great for families on the weekend, would recommend anywhere else during the week where hotel seems geared more towards business type lunch meetings, thus little people not very welcome by either clientele or management in common areas.

But staff, service, accommodation and quality were superb (from a young family perspective) on the weekend. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.",3,2018,03,05
208,We were treated like royalty!,"The Dylan is an amazing place to stay! We were so comfortable taken care of there. The luxurious interiors were stylish and welcoming. They thought of everything. 

They were so friendly and accommodating to all of our requests. They literally cleaned our room twice a day. 

It was about a ten-fifteen minute walk to the central area of Dublin where we went to Trinity College, the National Library and other awesome sights. The bus system is fairly easy to use, and Guest Services made sure we understood how to get around town before we headed out. 

The room was stunning, large and comfortable! The soft, cozy bed gave us the best sleep we‚Äôd had in days. The bathroom was ridiculous! Four shower heads, with a HUGE bathtub and a tv on the wall. The Nespresso machine in our room was a huge hit. The bathrobes and slippers were cozy. The room was warm and relaxing. 

We had breakfast every morning served in our room and it was phenomenal! For more pictures visit our social media @lordsinlove. 

We met some of the most amazing hotel staff ever and were so incredibly friendly and helpful. Namely Elaine, Felipe, and especially Ruairi Mac! 

We‚Äôll definitely go back next time we stay in Dublin, and we highly recommend Dylan to anyone looking for luxurious, amazing accommodations.",5,2018,03,03
208,So disappointed,"I was really looking forward to staying in this hotel.  All the reviews were great and it seemed like such a cool, quirky hotel that I was delighted when I got a fab deal to stay there. 

On check in everything looked good, the building was quirky as expected but in comparison the room was a bit vanilla.  We were in town for the rugby so just checked in and then headed off.  We got back that evening but went out again to eat.  On getting back we had a couple of drinks in the bar, whatever way the room is configured once the doors between the rooms are opened the breeze  that blows through is Baltic and we ended up sitting in our coats!

On heading up to the room the key cards wouldn't work so we got that sorted and got in.  Then we realised the room backed onto the rear of Searsons pub, granted it was a rugby weekend but the noise continued till @ 3.30am.  The rooms seem to have no soundproofing at all since we had that on one side and the noise from the room upstairs as well.  The bathroom door seemed to be swollen and wouldn't close properly and the room temperature was hard to control.

It was such a disappointment but at least I hadn't paid full price, if I had I'd have been rightly p'd off!   I've stayed in similar hotels in the area on rugby weekends like the Herbert Part and the Intercontinental and they are streets ahead of the Dylan so I won't be returning.    ",2,2018,03,01
208,Friendliest staff and the best breakfast,"Dylan hotel is located in a beautiful part of Dublin, hidden away off the main road. The staff couldn‚Äôt be friendlier, the food is fantastic (breakfast and room service), and the beds extremely comfortable. It was my sisters 40th birthday and the staff left cake in her room and was extremely nice to us all weekend. The room was very warm and difficult to cool down but that would be the only negative. ",5,2018,02,19
208,Best bed in Dublin,I was in Dublin on a business trip. My stay in the Dylan was terrific. Probably the best hotel bed I've slept in. The staff were so lovely - especially at reception. The city centre is super accessible from here. This is my new favourite hotel.,5,2018,02,13
208,A big hit,"This hotel is a big hit for me - great location with easy access to Dublin City centre, only 25 mins from airport, quiet off street location, fabulous design, great rooms and affordable. What‚Äôs not to like?!",4,2018,02,13
208,Darling Dylan in Dublin,"Dylan Hotel is my home from home when in Dublin working. I have stayed here many times and continue to do so...here's why:

 - boutique hotel - when travelling solo, the size of the hotel is perfectly suited to having dinner / drinks alone whilst working or people watching 
 - Location  - centrally located and short walk to bustling Baggot Street 
 - Staff  - impeccable and nothing is ever too much  - always make me feel welcome when returning 
 - Rooms  - first class, individual and very comfortable  
 - Flowers  - the awesome and vibrant arrangements on arrival always make a trip to the Dylan very special 
 - Breakfast  - always a pleasure",5,2018,02,13
208,Romantic break,Top class hotel in quiet area close to excellent restaurants and good pubs.  15 minute walk to city centre and 15 to Aviva stadium.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Rooms large with touch screen controls.  Bathroom and shower luxurious.  Will return.,5,2018,02,13
208,pleasant midweek stay on business,"very friendly and helpful staff. breakfast and dinner were both excellent. in room wifi an issue, bu otherwise a superb stay. hotel is located in a central area of Dublin, close to shops and restaurants. ",5,2018,02,06
208,Amazing,"Stayed for 2 nights for my partners birthday treat. We had an amazing stay from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. 

When we arrived our room was not ready - not a problem but was offered a free coffee whilst we waited, lovely... the room was worth the wait. 

Bed was amazing, so comfy that we slept 12 hours the first night. Nespresso machine in the room was a brill touch - we have one at home and it‚Äôs our favourite! 

Reception staff, maid service, bar staff - all fab! We will definitely be back.

Thank you so much for making my partners birthday extra perfect! ",5,2018,02,05
208,Weekend Break with friends,Beautiful large room for 3 people - gorgeous breakfast - overall a lovely experience! Staff were very pleasant and accommodating.  Reasonable rate for January would definitely look forward to returning again soon - ,5,2018,02,05
208,Pernickety Pesty,"On the whole our stay was fine but the most annoying feature of the hotel was the gloomy lighting. Admittedly, we may be of a certain age which requires good light, but all the lighting, everywhere in the hotel, was far too low to be comfortable!",3,2018,01,28
208,"Stunning hotel in a quiet, convenient area","I loved this hotel. It was really nice (comfy bed, great shower, good Wifi) and close to lots of restaurants and cool pubs while still quiet and peaceful (on a sidestreet). I'll be back! Thanks for a great stay, The Dylan. ",5,2018,01,22
208,"Great location, super staff","Stayed here last weekend with the mrs. Staff were so friendly and helpful (going out of their way to help us in any way.) 
Upgraded to a lovely suite at the front of the hotel, much appreciated. Even bumped into a few celebs on both nights. Will be back soon....babysitters depending!! ",5,2018,01,20
208,Pure bliss,We arrIced early after a very stressful night in another hotel the staff were amazing Caroline greeted us and soothed away our worries the room was superb and we ate in the bar later which was also fabulous thank you to everyone probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in!!,5,2018,01,20
208,Great night away,"Clean, modern, tv remote was not working, staff were more than helpful and rectified straight away. Receptionist was so friendly. Chatted with the bartender from Peru he was great. Finished the night with bringing a hot chocolate with vodka and caramel from their chocolate list (only during winter) back to the room it was AMAZING. Will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,16
208,Fantastic hotel!,"My husband and I have stayed at the Dylan on quite a few occasions and we always enjoy our stay. The staff are friendly and accommodating, nothing is a bother to them. The hotel is very inviting and comfortable with generous sized rooms. The food is fantastic. I would highly recommend the Dylan!!",5,2018,01,16
208,Weekend away,"Fabulous hotel, great decor, cocktails and staff. Bed was extremely comfortable, could have stayed in there all day if only we didn't have to explore Dublin!
Only downside was the breakfast which was a little sparse. ",5,2018,01,16
208,"Amazing boutique hotel, at heart of Dublin","If you are looking for something unique, try Dylan. Boutique, individual and friendly, set in a chic atmosphere. Niamh, Baltoz and the rest of the team will look after you on every stay -:). 

Highly recommended. ",5,2018,01,15
208,Fantastic minibar,Lovely staff! Hotel has a warm and welcoming vibe . Slightly dated amenities in room - tv in bathroom that didn‚Äôt work and state of the art phone which also didn‚Äôt work . But staff were delightful and couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and accommodating . ,4,2018,01,15
208,One night stay,"Great welcoming, charming neighborhood, very comfortable bed. Loved the decor. No noise. I wish I could ve stayed more than only one night. Nice bathroom with towel dryer. Lovely Xmas Trees and decor. Definitely great place to stay! ",5,2018,01,15
208,A great hotel,"Stayed over NY - great location, just out of the hustle and bustle, but close enough to walk into the centre. Friendly and very helpful staff, lovely rooms, great bar. Really good breakfast. Would definitely stay in this hotel again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2018,01,15
208,Nice small hotel but room walls a bit thin,"This is a great hotel in a nice central part of Dublin. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. There was a mix up with my colleagues booking which they sorted without any fuss. The room was comfortable but the walls between adjoining rooms poorly sound insulated. Otherwise, a great place to stay.",4,2018,01,11
208,Dylan in Dublin,A great boutique hotel in an ideal location - quiet and upscale neighbourhood but walking distance to all of Dublin.  The staff went out of their way to be helpful and mostly succeeded. The food was solid albeit not memorable.,5,2018,01,09
208,Boutique Dublin,"The Dylan Hotel is a welcoming hotel with a warm ambiance throughout. It is located close to a variety of casual dining restaurants, and also offers tasty room service menu. Service is always excellent and with good humour. 
The beds are very comfortable and rooms are stylish and beautifully maintained. ",5,2018,01,09
208,City Escapism,"Very chilled and relaxed, from the minute you walk in the door you really feel the atmosphere mellow. Stayed in a grand deluxe room and it was lovely, very spacious, comfortable and clean; couldn‚Äôt fault the room at all. Found it hard to justify walking through the front door of the hotel to go elsewhere for a drink. Would certainly return. ",4,2018,01,03
208,Friday Bed and Brunch ,"Availed of the ‚ÄòFriday Bed and Brunch‚Äô offer with my husband to celebrate our anniversary, and from the moment we arrived to our departure, our stay was absolutely perfect. Beyond the beautiful rooms and facilities that the Dylan has to offer, the biggest takeaway for us was the level of service, attention to detail, and hospitality of the staff. The staff went out of their way to look after us, which made our stay so personal and relaxed - something you don‚Äôt always see from 5 star hotels. All in all, would highly recommend the Dylan if you are looking to escape the city centre buzz, and want to enjoy some great food, drinks and a friendly, welcoming service.

Looking forward to going back.",5,2017,12,31
208,Long Weekend Break,"Two nights at the Dylan hotel. Hotel looks nice, a little quirky - or whatever counts as boutique these days. Our room was OK, but there were some issues, the mattress sagged and was uncomfortable, but apparently that is the design intent. The toilet flush was broken so needed some encouragement to stop constantly draining into the bowl and the bath drain was blocked. Staff were very friendly and the food was very nice. bar prices, as always in Dublin, made you pass out in shock.",4,2017,12,12
208,"Great Hotel, good location, friendly staff","We stayed at the Dylan a few weeks ago on a long weekend anniversary trip. We arrived very early in the morning, and although our room wasn't ready for us at 6am, the hotel staff did everything they could to get us into our room quickly. This boutique hotel has a lot of character, and the staff were exceptional. After getting breakfast the morning we arrived, we sat in the lobby for a while, and accidentally fell asleep due to our overseas flight, the time change and sheer exhaustion. Instead of waking us up - the hotel staff let us doze and got us into our room so we had time to lay down before our first scheduled event at 10:00 am. We had a room next to the Waterloo bar, and although on the weekend nights, it was a little noisy, it was manageable. The hotel is not in the center of the city, but is within a 15 minute walk of all the major sites. We enjoyed being further out of the city center and felt like we were able to experience all Dublin has to offer.",4,2017,12,11
208,One night stay ,"Stayed for one very enjoyable night at the Dylan. The room was stylish with all the little extra touches
i.e heated bathroom floor, night light, turn down service... The staff were very helpful and courteous. I managed to leave my electric toothbrush but they happily posted it to me with a sense of humour. I will stay here again.
",5,2017,12,08
208,Perfect from start to finish.,"My husband and I are just back from a two night stay in the wonderful Dylan Hotel.  This was our 2nd trip to the Dylan and we cannot wait to go back. Every single staff member we met was pleasant,  courteous and professional. Our room was beautiful with lovely views. Breakfast was freshly cooked to order and the menu was very good. The location of this hotel is brilliant. You are literally round the corner from BAGGOT Street and within walking distance of great pubs and restaurants.  Wonderful.",5,2017,12,06
208,Weekend break,"A beautiful hotel very well positioned 
10 minute walk to the city centre
Lots of bars and restaurants close by
Staff very friend and helpful
Rooms spacious and newly refurbished
Restaurant - food excellent",4,2017,12,03
208,Noise is terrible if your on the side of the pub.,"Same issue as other people who had the unlucky draw of getting a room right above the local pub. Hearing every conversation from the pub going on as if they were sitting next to me I gave up and was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to get moved to a room right next to the elevator. 

No hassles with hotels normally but this one is supposed to be 5 star. 

If you want a decent nights sleep do not stay here.",1,2017,12,01
208,My husbands 50th birthday ,"We spent 3 nights at the Dylan and as far we were concerned it was lovely. I had told them on booking that it was my husbands 50 th birthday and if we could have an upgrade that would be great. They did upgrade us, had a little birthday bun surprise and it was quiet, comfy beds, nice bathroom and helpful staff....thank you ",5,2017,11,30
208,Didn‚Äôt come for the Karaoke. Is it extra?,"I‚Äôm reviewing while lying awake in The Dylan. I‚Äôm lying awake because sleep is impossible. I can literally hear every word of every song being sung by a crowd of incredibly drunk people in the neighbouring establishment. This establishment seems to promote a sing-along culture to its clientele and while The Dylan, in developing it‚Äôs site have incorporated expensive triple glazed windows, they may as well have used Kleenex; such is the intrusion of noise. It‚Äôs now 1.08 am and it shows no sign of letting up. Strangely the website for The Dylan does not mention this addition to it‚Äôs guest facilities. I have no idea why. I‚Äôm sure people from around the globe would be flocking to pay ‚Ç¨300 plus for a room if they but knew that they could feel the vibration of ‚ÄúSweet Caroline‚Äù in the wee small hours instead of the restful sleep they anticipated after a busy day in the Irish capital. 1.13 now and I‚Äôm loving the strains of ‚Äúride on time‚Äù. I‚Äôm here to celebrate my birthday. It‚Äôs a treat from my wife. We were hear 10 years ago and loved it. It‚Äôs not cheap but it‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù. At 1.17 it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcool‚Äù- it‚Äôs far from cool. It sounds like what I imagaine Benidorm sounds like (on a bad day). What a terrible shame. Oh yeah the Management were fantastic about it. Except they weren‚Äôt, because ‚Äúit was out of their control‚Äù apparently. Or at least it was when I raised it with them at 1.00, 24 minutes ago.
I am not a complainer by nature. I normally just bite my tongue and pay the bill but given the 5 star status and 5 star prices the least I would expect would be a decent nights sleep. Not really a lot to ask for considering it‚Äôs a... hotel.",1,2017,11,18
208,Shockingly Poor Service,"I have been here about 4 times in the past few months and each time my experience was the same-awful!  

I had breakfast there with a guest-the full Irish was missing a few items so I had to ask for them. That should never have happened.
On another occasion I was there for a business meeting. A server tried to refuse to let us sit in the restaurant even though it was open and the only place that didn't have music. Once we were seated and had got our drinks we were interrupted a number of times, even though it was obvious that we were engrossed in conversation and didn't need anything.

On another occasion we ordered coffees to go and sat outside. That order was wrong and needed to be re done.

I can't believe here is a 5 star place! 

I only go back if I absolutely have to and it is never my choice. ",1,2017,11,18
208,Excellent Hotel,"The Dylan hotel is in a lovely area of Dublin. WIthin walking distance to the Aviva Stadium, several restaurants, and the relaxing canal. The wonderful rooms are bright and spacious. The hotel restaurant and lounge offers excellent meals with a large outdoor space in both the front of the building and in the back. The staff at the hotel are very professional and helpful.",5,2017,11,07
208,Stayed 4 nights on vacation,"The Dylan hotel is a hidden gem. A beautiful boutique hotel 1 mile to city center. Sexy and sleek decor and furnishings, stylishly decorated with a contemporary vibe. Our suite was luxurious and large with down pillows and comforters. The food delicious service excellent and Felipe Laier very accommodating.",5,2017,11,05
208,Like!,"A nice boutique style hotel in Dublin close to Waterloo Road, so an excellent location if working close by. The bar, restaurant and lobby are stylishly decorated. Room was kindly upgraded to a balcony room, although too cold to open the doors. Reasonably priced for bed and an excellent breakfast. ",4,2017,11,02
208,Excellent hotel in a lovely location,"We stayed at the Dylan for 3 nights with our parents in early October and had a fantastic time. The hotel is in a great part of Dublin, about a 15 minute walk to the centre, but with it's own local restaurants, eating and drinking spots and shops. The rooms are plush, a good size, have amazing beds / linen / pillows and large bathrooms. The breakfast was excellent and the service fantastic. Would definitely come back.",5,2017,10,06
208,Stylishly sleek seclusion ,"Its a wedding anniversary night away yet staying at home. I stumbled across this inner city gem. 5 star rated and doesn't dissapoint. Effortless from arrival to departure. Quick and easy check in, nice decor friendly staff. Uber cool yet stylishly sleek room with all you need and space to spare. Really enjoyable stay and yes I will revisit hopefully for a longer stay. 
Worth a stay and deserves the rating.",4,2017,10,01
208,Lovely spot,"The Dylan Hotel is a beautiful, welcoming spot, located on a quiet street a bit outside the center, but close enough to walk if you don't mind a 20 minute stroll. The rooms are elegant and comfortable (although some do look right out at a wall) and the staff is helpful and friendly. There's a lovely terrace out front of you are blessed with sunshine, which I was, and a hidden covered terrace behind the restaurant, too. The restaurant closes at 10 but they serve food until 11 in the stylish bar and they have all-night room service. I had a super healthy salad that was delicious. ",5,2017,09,30
208,"Incredible service, fun decor","We stayed with a group for 4 nights at The Dylan. Everything was incredible.. the beds were The comfiest ever, the service at the front desk was above and beyond. We loved the nightly water and chocolates. The area was in walking distance of Grafton st. The decor was unique and fun. We enjoyed the modern shower and Eco friendly light sensor switches. 
All in all, an incredible experience and we felt so spoiled.",5,2017,09,26
208,Brian ,"Stayed there last night with a large corporate group. Rooms were fine and staff were very friendly 

Issue was service in the restaurant which was very poor. We were a party of 12 and experienced long delays in having our order taken and between courses. The one waitress did her best but couldn't cope with our table and the others she was trying to serve

Food was ok, but not great and my starter was cold when it arrived

Would not recommend for corporate dinner

",3,2017,09,23
208,No room as overbooked,"Arrived to check in at 1030pm, following a dinner, only to be told they had overbooked and had no room available that night. Only solution was to stay at a hotel they had arranged 25 minutes outside of Dublin. Whilst the staff did everything they could to make it up to us i.e. Didn't charge us, fruit/wine delivered to room etc this is still completely unacceptable. Having stayed here 4+ times this year, I never will be again
(Also watch out for the shortage of irons/ironing boards if need a shirt ironed in the morning)

208,beautiful hotel,"what a great hotel. amazing decor in each room. Room had a balcony too. rooms are immaculate and beds are so comfortable. Service is top rated. Food there is delicious, specially lamb shank. staff is friendly. do visit.",5,2017,09,19
208,Beautiful boutique hotel,"One of my best experiences.  Loved the decor of the hotel and the individuality of each room.  So much so I now prefer staying at a boutique hotel as appose to the chain hotels. Our room had it own balcony which made it so convenient as one of us was a smoker.  The dining area is absolutely beautiful and is complimented by very professional and helpful staff.  Loved the decor in the dining room.  The outside bar area is also very refreshing and convenient should anyone be a smoker. The breakfast was delicious and I would recommend their Bloody Mary after a night out or should I say if you are jet lagged.  The Dylan served the best sirloin steak and lamb shank that I tasted in Dublin. Would definitely recommend the fish as well.  Thank you to the director of operations Oscar Navarro for making your guests feel so welcome and important.  Your team are well trained and as pleasant as you which was a contributing factor to us having such a memorable and enjoyable stay at the Dylan hotel.  A huge thank you to your manageress at front desk for her kindness and patience (apologies I forgot her name.). Thank you Dylan hotel and staff, from the Juanita and Nicole Matheson.",5,2017,09,14
208,Sheer Luxury ,"Has the pleasure of staying here with my wife.
From the time we arrived the service was amazing.
The room was exquisite. With a giant bed which was probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in.
The restaurant for breakfast. Was well late out.
And the service again was professional.
Walking distance to the city. 
Would highly recommend.
",5,2017,09,14
208,Better Average Dublin hotel ,"Hotel was ideal for a weekend visit. Basic 3 star level hotel. It did try to be quirky and modern boutique type hotel which I can appreciate. Unfortunately the hotel needs to be have a freshen up and service was an issue. Everything seemed to be a huge problem for the workers. I appreciate there are lots of difficult customers to deal with by when there is no appreciation for gratuity being left at the bar for just receiving a drink when normal tips are not mandatory are necessary in Ireland, it's a put off. ",3,2017,09,13
208,excellent hotel!,Stayed here for work in August 2017.  the decor was very nice and the staff were always very happy to help with whatever I asked.  I would definitely stay here again and I would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone.,5,2017,09,12
208,A little gem - amazing stay,"We had stayed here a few years ago and was blown away again  

amazing stay from start to finish

We had one of their fab new suites - so luxurious and comfy..

They have thought of everything in the room and more... 

Staff were so efficient yet so discreet - hard to find such service nowadays but Dylan had it to perfection

Food was amazing and the cocktails.. where do I start.... 

wish I was back there now......

We celebrated our wedding anniversary in Dylan and what a way to celebrate it.. think I will have to make it a yearly event! Also left us fresh fruit and wonderful chocolate brownies in the room with a lovely note to congratulate us

5* +..... huge commendation to all the staff in Dylan.... made us feel very special",5,2017,09,09
208,At the top of its game,"There are many different hotels out there, and it is quite a job to find one that just does it all, and I have been extremely privileged to visit some truly outstanding hotels.

The Savoy in London, Grand Lakes Resort in Florida, The Ritz Carlton off Michigan Ave, the Baglioni in London and Bologna, the Ritz Carlton, Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, the Shelbourne and the Westbury in Dublin.

Having worked in the hospitality industry, I know how hard it is to produce a great product.

As a younger man, I worked my way through most disciplines in the industry.

In the Culloden Hotel, Cultra, I started as a night porter, then day porter, junior barman, restaurant waiter, function waiter, commis chef, and second chef and finishing as a porter to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who at the time lived there. I have run a house and cooked for an ‚ÄúA list celeb‚Äù, so I know how demanding clients can be and also what clients expect.
So forgive me if I say I have a fair idea how a 5 star service should be and what such a product should deliver.
Sitting on an exclusive Victorian neighbourhood just off Baggot Street, Dublin, the Dylan Hotel is Dublin‚Äôs leading five star boutique hotel. What they offer is something really special.

Opulent contemporary comfort, in a unique landmark property, in a peaceful and tranquil neighbourhood located in one of the most fashionable areas of Dublin.

The hotel is housed in what was formerly the nurse‚Äôs home for the Royal City of Dublin Hospital.

At the Dylan the whole team take immense pride in the history and character of the unique building and this is shown in the well-written narrative that is available on the in house entertainment system.

The Ross family, owners of the Dylan say ‚Äúyou make the Dylan your home while you are in Dublin‚Äù. This statement is so honest; from the front of house team managed by Niambh Doorly to the kitchen and housekeeping team, they all do their level best to make you feel at home whilst away from home.

The hotel is beautifully decorated and no expense has been spared. Boutique furniture, hidden spaces, rich colours and wonderful furnishings make this a very nice space where you can while away the hours. You will love it",5,2017,09,08
208,A beautiful and stylish hotel,"This hotel ticks a lot of boxes and excels in many of them. Many hotels describe themselves as ""boutique."" In my opinion the Dylan is the best and most authentic boutique hotel in Ireland.
The location is south side and central, but at the same time tucked away in a quiet leafy area of Dublin within a few minutes taxi ride or walk of great restaurants and even a nice park, embassies etc. The decor and rooms in general are exquisite - stylish, classy, elegant, individual and genuinely unique in varying ways. 
Our check in process was effortless, every help was offered with baggage etc and the room was stunning. Some dishes of fresh fruit and chocolates were laid out for us, and there is a marvellous selection (for purchase) of unusual Irish handmade food products in the room.
We didn't dine in the hotel so I will leave that for other reviewers, but we did have breakfast. Everything was freshly prepared, tables were clean and well set, and well spaced. All the staff from reception to room prep to restaurant were friendly and warm. Like I said - this hotel ticks a lot of boxes. Did I mention parking? There's plenty of that too.",5,2017,09,05
208,Beautiful hotel great location,"Found really cheap flights to dublin so had more cash to spend on hotel. Chose dylan as its a boutique hotel and just off main city centre with a local high street with lots of bars and restaurants. Check in was easy rooms were ready ours had a balcony but not the greatest of views son had a corner roo m overlooking a garden and fountain. Very clean good quality bathrooms . We didnt eat at hotel but found great restaurant angelinas nearby. local bars were good Searsons in particular again just round corner. After a few drinks returned to hotel to rnjoy nightcap in lovely bar. Second day we did the tourist thing Guiness storehouse and Jameson distillery couple of free museums within 15 min walk. Beds really nice ordered us a taxi back to airport and very nice merc pulled up nice touch, will return. Thanks to the staff who looked after us.",5,2017,09,02
208,Comfiest hotel bed ever!,"Stayed here with my husband for a night away. First room they allocated us to was a little on the snug side with what looked like a queen size bed. Was also a little dark as only a small window. We asked to be moved and the staff were very accommodating, moving us to a much bigger room with a king sized bed. I have to say - the bed was the comfiest hotel bed I've slept in in a while! We had cocktails in the hotel bar which was lovely but really busy so we wanted to sit outside on the terrace but a beggar was going round the tables asking for money which I wasn't really comfortable with. I did point this out to our waitress but she did nothing about it. Shame really as apart from that I couldn't fault it, but paying those prices you do expect a certain level of service.",4,2017,08,31
208,Nice,"I stayed here with my daughter,The room was nice but got very warm and I had to open the window,It's in a nice part of Dublin loads of bars and restaraunts nearby .We got bar food there which was nice ,The staff were  polite and helpful, it's a nice place to stay.",4,2017,08,21
208,Amazing Stay,"My boyfriend won a competition with Lovin Dublin for an overnight stay, cocktails on arrival, dinner in The Tavern Restaurant and breakfast the next morning. We arrived yesterday afternoon for brunch and were overwhelmed with how great the staff were. They were completely accommodating to us even though not all of them initially knew about the competition. In particular Vaidas, who was amazing, made our stay even better during our dinner last night and breakfast this morning. I would definitely recommend staying here. We didn't want to leave!",5,2017,08,21
208,Stylish boutique venue in central Dublin,"I stayed here on business for two nights and the experience was outstanding. Smart, modern decor, great food and high service quality. The rooms are very funky but extremely comfortabke and I was given an upgrade on check-in to a spacious room with a fantastic shower area. Great experience.",5,2017,08,20
208,Disappointing ,"Unfortunately we were disappointed with our stay at the Dylan. We stayed on 3 different nights over the space of a week for a business event. The rooms on the whole are lovely, except for one of the night when the room had a very strong musty/damp smell. Bathrooms all very functional but again on the final night the plug was blocked and the water built up so much I had to stop showering.
The breakfast was average, poor selection of cereals and the large amount of fruit flies circulating around the breakfast was less than appealing. Staff seem a little lacklustre and service was pretty slow. ‚Ç¨21 for a continental and ‚Ç¨25 for hot breakfast ordered from the kitchen. In my advice, walk down Pembroke road for much nicer options at a fraction of the price. 
Decided to go for lunch on our first stay, again slow service and what arrived was disappointing. ‚Ç¨30 for a salad and a sandwich, with tap water. Again, a short walk to Ranelagh and you have much nicer options. 
Just not what was expected of a 5* hotel. 
Must mention a couple of the staff at reception were great, they do seem to be trying their best. However over ‚Ç¨300 for a midweek stay with no breakfast included is completely overpriced in comparison to other hotels in Dublin! ",2,2017,08,19
208,We didn't want to leave!! ,"From the second our taxi pulled up, the doorman ran out to street to greet us and grab our luggage. We were then greeted with big smiles by the front desk, and the manager personally walked us to our rooms. We were all ready blown away with the hospitality! We had two different rooms (no 2 rooms are alike at the hotel) and both rooms were gorgeous! Rooms were so spacious too. Hotel is in great location, and we were able to walk everywhere. We were so sad to leave The Dylan!! I highly recommend this hotel. They made our trip to Dublin extra special. Also, check out there bar downstairs and order a Gin Old Fashioned....best drink ever.  Thank you to all the staff at The Dylan!!! ",5,2017,08,18
208,Lovely!,"Stayed in this lovely boutique hotel recently and I was very impressed.  The welcome at the door and from Reception was very warm and friendly.  We were staying just for one night and got a lovely room but the only downfall was the air conditioning didn't work in the room! We didn't report it until check out so only ourselves to blame on a very warm night, even with the window open! The bar staff were great and very friendly.  The full breakfast was delicious, one of the best I've had in a long time in a Dublin hotel.  There was plenty of fruit options available and the brown bread was delicious! The hotel is in an ideal location for all sports events or just a short city break.  I would highly recommend this little hotel for couples or friends, not ideal for children in my opinion.",5,2017,08,14
208,Great location ,We Booked it on LastMinute a few hours before check in and hadn't stayed before. Great location for Baggot Street restaurants and pubs. Good clean rooms and breakfast in bed was top class. The rooms also had SkySports so also got to see the Lions match in bed.üëç,5,2017,08,01
208,"Great location, room fit out and staff","Highly recommended by a previous guest and deserving of praise. Walking distance to great Irish bars and high end restaurants. Highly quality furnishings, good beds, locally produced toiletries and chocolates etc. About 25 euros cab fare from airport. Experience suite is great - beautiful views of neighbouring garden. Had to wait till 3pm to access room but worth it. Highly recommended. ",5,2017,07,30
208,"Nice, but not perfect","We stayed here two nights at the end of a weeklong family trip where we stayed in the country in beautiful inns and hotels. Dylan is of course in the city and our room was very noisy from the adjacent bar at night. It was not city center, but still a walkable distance to all the sights. Rooms were very modern, bathroom had heated floors and towel racks! The bed was quite comfortable. Overall nice, not great.",4,2017,07,28
208,Beautiful boutique hotel in quiet location,"I stayed here for one night to attend a concert in Dublin.  We had a package that included valet parking (no other parking on site) and breakfast.  The hotel is lovely; located on a quiet residential street a little out of town but still within walking distance.  I love this part of Dublin and would recommend here if you want to get away from the hubbub of direct city centre.  We were greeted at the door and check in was friendly, efficient and exemplary.  The valet whisked the car away quickly and even got my sunglasses later when I realized I had left them in the car.  Great service! The hotel itself is not overlarge, but is welcoming with cool d√©cor.  Every staff member we passed greeted us.  The room was big with superking bed (king for US travelers), 1930's style interior design, quiet, and sumptuous.  The bed was really comfy (so much so that I checked out the brand of mattress so I can buy one for home).   We had booked a terrace table for late lunch and they accommodated our party of 8 plus a few newcomers efficiently and with smiles.  We also tried out the terrace bar at the rear of the hotel for drinks after the concert and had a good experience.  The breakfast was cooked to order with a smaller buffet for smaller appetites.  It was great.  I will definitely check out his hotel every time I get back to Dublin and hope I get to stay here again.",5,2017,07,27
208,"Great Hotel, Lovely Staff","We stayed here on the first night of a week long tour of Ireland and were not disappointing. What a service!! Super friendly staff, great food, and super well decorated Hotel and Rooms! They are also a pet friendly Hotel, short walk to the city centre, and a very nice area to spend the night at.",5,2017,07,26
208,Home away from Home,"We stayed at the Dylan Hotel for the U2 Concert.
The Staff is simply great, kind and very friendly, the rooms are greatly decorated.
we had the chance to enjoy the bar before concert, and the drinks are very good.
Definitely Recommend this Hotel.",5,2017,07,25
208,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here for one night for the U2 concert. The staff are wonderful, so friendly and helpful. We ate in the Bar before the concert and the food was beautiful. The hotel have a valet parking service & they also organised our Taxi to the concert for us. The room was lovely and very quiet with a very comfortable bed and pillows.  We ate brunch on the outdoor Terrace before we left on the Sunday and again the food and service were wonderful. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again. ",5,2017,07,24
208,Conveniently located hotel - a little overpriced?,"This hotel was perfectly good, but I felt over-priced compared with other options in the city.  We were in the recently added part of the hotel and stayed for two nights.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were OK in terms of size - neither large or poky.  Our room (and I guess a number of others) backed on to an alley the other side of which was the back of Searsons bar.  So no view and some noise at night.  Breakfast was good and included in our rate.  We used the bar one night which was fine although the service could probably have been better given how few people beside us were in there at the time.  Overall, perfectly fine place to stay, a little overpriced and best to request a room at the front of the hotel.",3,2017,07,20
208,Fantastic stay,"Stellar. I loved this hotel soup to nuts. Impeccable service, resources (traveling alone so this was especially appreciated on a multitude of levels), accessibility to all ""things"" Dublin, hotel resturaunt had fabulous food...I would go back and stay at the Dylan in a heartbeat.",5,2017,07,15
208,No sleep,"Extremely noisy, unable to sleep in the new part of the hotel due to a bar that stays open until 2/3am (that the hotel do not own)

Staff very polite, service exceptional. Shame you just cannot sleep!!! In the 'new building' anyway.

Also, no decent water pressure in shower & towels are not 5star. Like the thin 'flannel' type. Awful.

Cocktails, dinner & old part of hotel do seem 5 star and were lovely.

Just the extension that seems to be poor. The shame is the staff seem to know of the issues and so were unreservedly apologetic....even the cab drivers know about this place's problems!!!!

The senior management should not be selling rooms near the bar unless warning people or heavily discounting.

You should not be charging for these rooms!!!!",1,2017,07,15
208,Nice Boutique Hotel,"We stayed here for one night in June. The location is great - on a very quaint street across from a small park. It's removed enough to be quiet - with some nice pubs around the corner - but a close enough walk to the center of town as to not feel isolated. Definitely has a boutique feel - the entire staff was great, breakfast was excellent. The bar area is really charming as is the dining area. The whole premises have a great feel.

The rooms, at least ours, felt like it could have used a bit updating (we had 211) - it didn't seem to match the quality of the rest of the property (or some of the pictures of nicer looking rooms we saw online) - but we were only staying the one night and I'm sure they have nicer rooms on the premises. This would be the one mark against it - the room we had didn't seem to match the rest of the experience, especially for the price. All in all though, seems a nice hotel and a solid choice when in Dublin.",4,2017,07,12
208," Very unique, excellent","I've been lucky enough to stay here while traveling for business a couple of times, and I love this hotel. Every room is different. Every hallway is different. It has a LOT of charm and character, and the staff are superb.",5,2017,07,10
208,Great hotel,We spent 3 nights here for a big birthday. The first night we were given a room overlooking the back of the hotel. The room was lovely and had everything we needed including mood lighting. We did experience noise late that evening from the pub backing on to the hotel however the receptionist kindly moved us the following day to another room. The new room was amazing it was an upgrade with TV in the bathroom and everything you could wish for. The beds are very comfortable. We booked room only as we found breakfast was a lot cheaper elsewhere. Will definitely stay here again. Lovely flat walk into the city centre too approx 25-30 mins.,5,2017,07,10
208,Delightful Dylan,Spent last weekend at here with my 3 daughters.  Loved the hotel. Staff are friendly and attentive. I have an issue with the music that is piped over your conversation.  This spoils the sophistication of the place . It is dominant   and if you were with a big crowd you probably wouldn't notice.  But was a big minus for me and would be the only reason I wouldn't return here.,4,2017,07,07
208,Not worth it,"Just checked in and already disappointed despite the funky decor. Cleanliness has been compromised for style with the dusty lamps which must be impossible to clean, and for a hotel of this class I would expect basic toiletries like cotton buds and pads, but alas nothing. Ordinary and disappointing, I will not be returning.",3,2017,06,26
208,Fantastic boutique hotel in Dublin,Impromptu weekend in Dublin with my wife booked this great hotel .Just far away enough from the centre to be quiet yet in an area with great amenities . Comfy bed free wifi mini bar and fluffy towels. Only a couple of negatives the breakfast was ‚Ç¨25 Euro each so we went to Searsons bar next door where full Irish is ‚Ç¨9.95 . The water pressure in the shower could have been a bit stronger but other than that it was a really nice hotel and we will definitely return.,5,2017,06,25
208,Excellent,"3 night stay in this beautiful hotel in a suite which had everything we needed and was immaculately clean - very happy.

Breakfast was superb .... all made to order and the buffet had delicious yoghurt pots and plenty of choice.

Had one meal in the restaurant which was one of the reasons we chose this hotel because we had been told the food was very good .... which it certainly was.  Tried to book for our last night but were very disappointed to be told there was a 10 year anniversary event and the restaurant was not open to hotel guests.  Whilst we understood events like this happen we do feel we should have been advised in advance as everything else was so perfect.

Staff efficient and helpful as they did try to find us an alternative restaurant.  

Would return and would highly recommend as excellent location as easily walkable to the city.
",5,2017,06,24
208,Attention to detail.,"This is a gorgeous boutique hotel in a fabulous location. The rooms are well planned and the attention to detail makes it a joy to stay in. Very professional and welcoming staff, with a great bar and yummy cocktails.",5,2017,06,23
208,Should be better!,"This is a beautiful hotel which has a gorgeous decor, amazing showers and unforgettable scones that are baked fresh to order.  However, the service is uniformly poor from the time of check-in to check-out.  Housekeeping, front desk staff, bar staff and restaurant staff all seemed pre-occupied, disinterested and lack the hospitality I experienced at other Irish properties.  Management has a LOT of work to do to justify the prices, given the poor service ecperienced.  Go to the Shelbourne.",3,2017,06,22
208,Good customer service.,"Stayed in the Dylan hotel recently.As it was a birthday gift.
Got a very warm welcome from Niamh at reception.She was very helpful, gave me plenty of information.Any questions I asked, were swiftly answered.
The room was beautiful,plenty of room. The bathroom was very nice, shower and bath facilities.Very nice toiletries were supplied.
I must mention Stephanie who I was in contact with twice, about my stay in the Dylan.Thank you for the fruit platter, and brownies that were in the room. When I returned, after going for a walk. It was very thoughtful.
Enjoyed my stay at the Dylan, hope to visit again in the future.
Thank you all again.",5,2017,06,18
208,Pre concert snack ,"The Dylan hotel is lovely with good outdoor areas. On 17 June, service was extremely slow and orders mixed up which I think was due to lack of staff and was compounded by some inexperienced staff. The wheelchair accessible toilet is also the baby changing area and a nappy was left on the floor. There is a pull down grab rail on the right hand side of the toilet but none on the left hand side (one could easily be affixed to the wall).  The door to the wheelchair accessible toilet opens out but is almost impossible to close  when you're in a wheelchair. There is no emergency call cord but a telephone on the wall near the door which would be impossible to reach. If the staffing issues and additional grab rail were addressed, I would certainly return ",3,2017,06,18
208,"Friendly, comfortable, stylish","We stayed at the Dylan for two nights recently--in two different rooms as we stayed one night at the beginning of our Ireland trip and one night at the end.  Our rooms were spacious and well appointed, with large bathrooms, comfortable beds, and luxurious amenities.  

The hotel is quirky--four buildings knitted a bit awkwardly together.  It's a complete maze getting from one part of the hotel to another.  Signs are not always clear.  Some of the halls are like narrow warrens and one must go up and down small flights of stairs to transition from one part of the hotel to the other.  That is the only negative thing I can say about The Dylan.

Our first room was on the ground floor just steps from a narrow lane and a lively pub.  I was a bit worried that we would hear pub noise all night long (we were there on a Friday night).  We didn't hear a sound--not from outside, not from the hotel hallway, and not from adjacent rooms.  The beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was large and beautiful, with plenty of counter space and a large shower but no tub.  Cozy robes and slippers were provided, the towels were lush, and the toiletries smelled fabulous.  

On our return night we had a gorgeous room in the main building of the hotel overlooking a garden and a courtyard.  The space was very generous and the bathroom comfortable with a large tub.  (The tub was a bit treacherous to get in and out of, but was great for a hot bath.)  Again--no noise.  And we were able to open the windows for a fresh breeze, which I love.  

Breakfast is delicious--try to get a rate that includes breakfast, as it's 21-25 Euros per person when ordered from the menu.  The service in the restaurant is friendly if a bit slow.  The dining room is very pleasant.  Though we did not go to the bar/lounge, it was quite lively on the Friday night that we were there, with many people on the terrace enjoying the fine weather.  It looked like a lot of fun.  

I would definitely stay at the Dylan again.  It is not five-star in the sense of a Four Seasons or a Ritz, so if that's what you're looking for, try the Shelbourne.  However, I prefer a smaller boutique hotel and the Dylan fit the bill on every point.  Beautiful and convenient neighborhood, very comfortable, lovely and helpful staff.  ",5,2017,06,17
208,Brilliant wedding venue!,"We had our small (ish) wedding reception at the Dylan and we were delighted with our choice. We had 56 people for dinner, with a drinks reception on the front terrace in the sun beforehand. It was just gorgeous! 
The food for dinner was beautiful! We chose crab or pork plate for starters, monkfish or lamb for mains, and Dylan assiette with fairground cart for dessert. Everybody loved the food and had a great time.
The staff, especially Oscar, were incredible! Nothing was too much hassle, from the moment we walked in the door, they parked our car, brought bags and my wedding dress up to the room and helped with kids. 
It was the perfect small Dublin wedding for us, and we can't thank the staff and chefs enough for making it so good! Highly recommend for a party or occasion! ",5,2017,06,14
208,Comfortable hotel with accommodating staff,"Had a lovely room , with a balcony, staff always helpful and several good eateries within walking distance.Great start to our Irish trip after a delayed flight with Ryanair! Full of American golfers and obviously popular with them also.",4,2017,06,10
208,Good location,"This hotel is great. It is clean, staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean and had a Nespresso machine in the room which was great. There are som really nice restaurants right around the corner and we really enjoyed the Searsons Pub. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,22
208,In NO WAY a 5-star hotel,"From the moment we pulled up I had reservations about the Dylan, which bills itself as a 5-star hotel. We were not greeted curbside, and no one came up to valet our car or help with our bags. Upon check in, I found that my request for a King room had not been met, even though I called months in advance to ask for this. The friendly front desk staff was able to make the change, but when we arrived at our new room we found it looked DIRECTLY out on to construction. (Side note: Hotels that do not mention construction when you book are the highest level of deplorable in my book.) The construction was so bad and obvious that the workers were staring into our window, and we had to keep the blinds closed at all time.  Because of this I asked to see the original Queen room they had reserved us initially which boasted a balcony, but upon examining it we found that the balcony was unusable as it overlooked the construction as well. We spent one night in the King room and were awoken first thing by the construction (which we were told would not be going on that early.) That night we were also asked if we wanted evening turndown service, and we said yes, however no one ever came to the room for the service. 

The next morning, while I was at a work meeting, my husband once again requested to switch rooms. They showed him two rooms, one overlooking construction (once again), and one ‚Äúsuite.‚Äù The suite was quiet with nice windows that overlooked the quiet street, but when I returned from my meeting and wanted to lay down for a few hours I found that the bed was broken! It felt like the springs were popping out, and there was a huge divit in the mattress. So once again, we asked to move. 

Finally, they put us in what they referred to as the best room in the hotel. At that point, all I cared about was a quiet room and a comfortable bed. Both were provided, but the second night in that room brought yet another issue. Our neighbors apparently decided to bring a dog to the hotel and leave it alone while they went out. The poor dog barked all night, and the hotel did not offer any solution except to say they would call the owners. (Not sure they ever did as he barked consistently throughout the evening.) 

When we checked out we were asked how we enjoyed our stay and pretty matter of factly said it wasn‚Äôt satisfactory. No one at the front desk offered to make retribution in anyway which I felt was another sign of a very sub-par experience. 

Not only would I avoid the Dylan for all the reasons above, but I would also mention that the decor was incredibly dated. It felt like a cheesy 1980‚Äôs movie vomited all over the hotel. The carpets were unclean, and the elevator felt like a literal coffin (tufted red leather walls, very small). Hallways felt like a maze, and the red carpet everywhere was super aggressive, and felt kind of murdery. The throw pillows in the room were also dirty and old, and the towels were small, and not plush. The Dylan should be ashamed to be charging 5-star prices. I will certainly look elsewhere next time I am in Dublin and so should you.",2,2017,05,21
208,Great staff and service in Dublin!,"I've just had a great weekend at the Dylan hotel in Dublin with my wife.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone; they have the best staff ever, the rooms are great and the neighborhood is really nice and close to city center.
We will come back soon!
Thank you!",5,2017,05,21
208,Good,"Had dinner with another couple last week in the Dylan. They had never heard of it before and were surprised when we suggested going.We had drinks to start in the bar, I ordered some bubbles  but when my drink arrived it was as flat as a pancake and not a bubble in sight. My husband returned and a fresh bubbly glass appeared.3 of us ordered the crab starter which was delicious and one had the smoked salmon which was unspectacular . 3 also had the lamb for mains ,it is served pink so if you like your lamb done well ask when ordering. This dish was deemed good. I had cod which was served with a herb crust and was also tasty . Desserts were good also. We went on a Sunday evening and it was quiet but it's busier during the week. This is a nice boutique hotel to stay in.",4,2017,05,21
208,Fun place near the central city,"We enjoyed staying at the Dylan which was recommended to us by an Irish couple in Madrid.  The rooms are decorated in a modern style, with hallways that have red carpets and red lights. It's modern and fun. The building is located in an area close to the embassies so the lunch and dinner crowds are people that appear to be coming to the hotel from local areas.  We were drinking in the bar close to a group of women who were having some type of hen party.  The place is alive with many people coming and going.  Within walking distance is the people filled Grafton Street and main city centre.  We took a local bus to the Guinness Storage Facility and went on the tour.  We narrowed our search down to four hotels within the city centre area and the Dylan is definitely one those places we will return to when in Dublin. Thank you staff  for making a stay enjoyable.",5,2017,05,17
208,Wedding at the Dylan,"We held our wedding at the Dylan and loved every moment!! Perfect venue for our small intimate family dinner and bigger evening reception. Relaxed venue, easy to organise, staff were fabulous, nothing was too much and the food for both dinner and the reception was fantastic!",5,2017,05,15
208,Simply perfect,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 days when we travelling to Dublin for a city break. A few weeks before arriving I emailed to confirm our stay and let the hotel knew we were celebrating our anniversary. On arrival we were given a room upgrade and on your first afternoon were brought platters of fresh desserts, fruit and a lovely note from the hotel manager to thank us for choosing the Dylan and wishing us a good stay. Great start! The room was gorgeous, modern and very well styled with the comfiest bed I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. Spotless and tidied every day thanks to the lovey housekeeping. We had breakfast booked as part of our stay which we recommend, food was delicious and so much choice! We were out sightseeing every day so we only spend evenings in the hotel but all staff were lovely and very tentative to us. We had dinner in the restaurant on our final night and it was beautiful! A glass of champagne on the house and a beautiful three course dinner with a few cocktails for good measure! Overall we left wishing we could have just one more night. A beautiful hotel, in a great location only a short walk to the centre of Dublin. The staff are an asset to the hotel and I would highly recommend anyone staying. ",5,2017,05,13
208,Mrs,Excellent all around. Accommodating in all ways. Service was swift and met all needs. The staff was extremely professional and were genuinely helpful. Food was very good. Would stay here any time that we had an opportunity to visit Dublin!,5,2017,05,03
208,Great weekend ,"Had a great birthday weekend in Dublin with group of friends with this hotel 'making it' perfect. Bedrooms good size, very clean and comfy bed.  Good variety for breakfast and dinner was excellent. Sitting in the heated courtyard with friends and a few drinks was a perfect way to end a Saturday night. Staff were brilliant and thank you to the restaurant manager on Saturday who, with his staff created a very enjoyable evening. Wide range of drinks, but if not on the list, they'll still find a way to make it, or give you something even better. Good location and don't take a a taxi into town - walk there - there are some great pubs (proper ones) and some stunning buildings on the way in. Unlike some reviewers, I think the decor was spot in, and my friends (who stay in some very fancy places) thought it worked just right. You can not go wrong with this place. I'm sure I could find a few niggles, but they would be insignificant. Brilliant ",5,2017,05,02
208,Good stay,"A really nice hotel.  Our room was great, though would perhaps have been nice to have a free bottle of water and maybe some biscuits for the coffee/tea.  The bar in the hotel was exellent too.  The only slight downside was the early wake up call from the builders putting up the scaffolding at 7.30am on both days we were there, otherwise it would have been 5 stars",4,2017,05,02
208,"Great location, but.....","Check in was easy, although  no bell hop to help us from the cab into the hotel (it would have been a nice touch after flying overnight).  While our room was readied to accommodate us for an early check in, they treated us to breakfast.  So far, so good.

Our room was lovely... super comfortable bed, but a bit tired.  Also, no clock and only 2 bath towels per room.  I use a lot of towels, especially if they are not bath sheets, when traveling but that's my little pecadillo.  

Breakfast was included in our room rate and it was delish!  There is a full bar that was packed with both hotel guests and locals every night of our stay. Other than breakfast, we didn't eat at the hotel, but the food looked good.

Would I stay there again when in Dublin?  Yes!",4,2017,04,26
208,Love this place.....,Situated in a great part of the city. The rooms are lovely and spacious. Also the staff are soo nice and helpful. Searsons pub is located just around the corner and it is great craic. There is also a few good restaurants down the road near the Aviva stadium that the staff recommended.The bar in the hotel is lovely aswell and do great cocktails. It does get very busy though. Really didn't want to leave...,5,2017,04,21
208,Not really worth it!,"Usually boutique hotels are our preferred stays and usually they are worth the money. Not so the Dylan. For a design hotel, our room was amazingly void of any decoration, quite dull actually - with the electric outlets strangely aged. The bathroom shower lacked any curtain or proper bathtub, so after showering you got to wade in a pool. Breakfast is ok, but again the pricier than its value. Treat yourself by going to Eathos around the corner for breakfast. Service at reception and in the bar was nice though.",3,2017,04,17
208,Very comfy experience ,"Comfy atmosphere in this hotel well decorated and furnished. The service is excellent and rooms are really confortable and quiet.
Nice breakfast with good quality products.
I will recommend for the location as well.
",5,2017,04,16
208,Worth the stay,"The first thing I liked about the Dylan Hotel is that it is off the beaten path (i.e. not near Temple Bar) but still close enough to the center of Dublin to get where you need to go.  Driving up you would be forgiven if you thought it was someone's home.  But it gets better than that.

The rooms are very comfortable - I had the pleasure of being upgraded on my last visit (this review is based on the the third time I stayed there) and all the rooms I've stayed in have true attention to detail and are very comfortable.  The last one even had a television in the bathroom which I could watch from the bath!

Loved the restaurant and the bar including the outdoor seating area.

But the best part of the Dylan comes down to its staff - professional yet personable all the way.  One of the better boutique hotels I've ever stayed in.",5,2017,04,14
208,"Beautiful hotel, lovely stay","Our group of 8 had 4 rooms, each was a bit different, all were very nice.

Comfortable beds, contemporary design and all the amenities we could want- added to the overall quaint and quiet setting just off the busy byways of Dublin made this a perfect place to stay for our visit 

Staff is excellent, property is beautifully maintained in a nice section of the city. The Dylan was a nice place to come home to after sightseeing in crowds!

Plenty of restaurants within walking distance in addition to the on premises Tavern.",5,2017,04,08
208,Perfect place to stay in Dublin,Staying here is a great choice to make while in Dublin. The facilities are clean and the staff were some of the friendliest I have encountered while traveling - they were overly accommodating. The location was great and the bar/restaurant inside the hotel are definitely worth checking out.,5,2017,04,03
208,Touch of class,"I attended a function here. There's a touch of class about this hotel, the decor, the staff, the service. The function room itself was perfect for the numbers. Bar staff were really efficient. Food was excellent and piping hot. Great venue. Staff are professional. The menus indicate reasonable food prices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Toilets, male and female were a mess. ",4,2017,04,02
208,Incredible Hotel With Even More Impressive Service,"We arrived late but were immediately greeted by the gentleman at the front desk. He quickly radioed for someone to assist us with our luggage and another gentleman was there to help. As I stated earlier we arrived a bit before midnight and asked the gentleman if there was anything open locally that we might be able to grab a drink at and he gave us the great news that the hotel bar was available 24 hours. What a perk! 
When we got to our room there was a handwritten note welcoming us as well as a personalized message on the TV in the main area. There was also a plate of fresh fruit and some chocolates as well. Very nice touch! The room itself was very nice (Room 206) with plenty of space and comfort. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the size of the bathroom but the rest of the room was amazing. 
After settling into our room we headed back down to the bar where the same gentleman that helped with our luggage also served us our drinks. Two pints of Guinness and a glass of whiskey neat was a perfect night cap to our long day of traveling that would not have been possible at most hotels. 
The next day we were gone most of the day but the cleaning service while we were gone was spectacular and included fresh chocolates on each side of the bed. We had been out to quite a few pubs so we made the not so sober decision to order room service at 2am. Because of the time of night the menu was quite limited however the food was still top notch. Not a bad move on our part at all. 
The wake up call the next morning was done in person rather than on the phone which I felt was another great touch. 
The only issue we had during our stay was not with the hotel at all. The street parking that is available outside (which we chose instead of the parking that the hotel offers for 20 Euro a night) apparently expires quite early in the morning. The lovely folks of Dublin booted our rental vehicle which cost 80 Euro to remove. Tough break but no fault to the great folks of the Dylan Hotel. In fact, the staff of the hotel assisted us in making sure that the boot was removed in a timely fashion after paying the fine.",5,2017,04,01
208,"nice rooms, eccentric location, cute boutique","I would have given it a 5-but the gym, was actually across the street, super tiny-like  a rented out cross-fit portion of a gym, in the entry you could use the treadmills.  
It got the job done so that was fine. But if nice gym is a key for you, then a bigger/non-boutique hotel is better for you.
It was hip, clean, & nice.  
We didnt use hotels much except to sleep at end of exhausting days of touring around & visiting restaurants.  But I enjoyed it.  Posh little cafe for breakfast downstairs. Very modern tv/ phones in the room. Felt safe & clean  (2 key impt pieces for me!) if gym was bigger, it would be a 5 star",4,2017,03,29
208,Make sure you don't leave anything behind as you won't get it back!,"Before I describe the situation let me just say I loved this hotel before, and it was 3rd time I stayed there.  I thought the service was great, and helpful. My company uses their service a lot which is even more disappointing. 
When I was packing in the morning I left a folder behind. In the folder were lots of reservation confirmation, car rental confirmation and between those my passport and 2 envelopes with money. Let me emphasize that no one would know there is money unless you go through the file carefully and check inside.
Here is what happened when I called the hotel to check on this. The person from the staff said that he can‚Äôt check if something was left, because he doesn‚Äôt have a key to the storage room. The cleaning ladies left and he can‚Äôt do anything to help me. I will point out it was only between 9 and 10pm. He didn‚Äôt bother to check who was on duty and call that person. I told him I won‚Äôt be able to sleep as I need passport to leave the country. No help, other than he told me he will call me the next day. I left my hotel and room number, I also left my cell phone number. The next morning, no one bothered to call me.  I called the hotel myself and the lady immediately said ‚Äúyes, we checked nothing was found‚Äù.  What bothers me the most is the fact no management took actions, nobody called me, nobody cared. Obviously, the hotels takes care more about the staff than a client who is in a terrible situation. I reported the whole incident to the police and had to postpone the trip to wait for a temporary passport. When ITAS, which works at the police station called again to the hotel to talk to hotel  the staff played as if I lost it. Very disappointing the hotel takes no responsibility and cares for the client only when they are being paid, but doesn't bother to call the cleaning staff at 9pm to ensure the customer is not stressing out all night waiting for news.",1,2017,03,29
208,Fabulous 10/10,"We booked the Dylan for a trip to Dublin to Watch Wales play football and to celebrate our Anniversary 
The staff were amazing, attentive, courteous and knowledgeable- nothing was too much trouble 
The hotel is elegantly decorated with a real flare for attention to detail 
The selection of Champagne and Premium spirits is excellent as well as the quality of food 
To top it all we even managed to enjoy a drink on the patio next to none other than Bono üòâ

Special thank you to Conner the Manager 
And to Anna for the excellent service üëå",5,2017,03,26
208,"Friendly, comfortable, and great location.","This was the perfect hotel for our first trip to Dublin.  Located just out of the hustle and bustle of the city but within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see.  Our room was clean and comfortable with every amenity (except a fridge).  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was wonderful, too!  We stayed in Room 303, right next to the elevator but we had no noise issues.",5,2017,03,21
208,"A wonderful stay, what fantastic staff","This is my 4th visit to the Dylan, this time with 3 Spanish friends in tow. I was delighted they loved the quirky style and warm service as much as I do. The proximity to Dublin is of course a plus and the Ballsbridge location offers a good selection of cafes and bars outside the heart of the city centre. One particular bonus is that the hotel is 3 minutes from a Hertz car hire office which makes escaping Dublin in a hire car particularly easy. The rooms are a good size and the bedding is particularly good but I think the highlight of this hotel is the staff who are warm, charming, cheeky and friendly all at the same time. We couldn¬¥t fault this experience. Thank you.",5,2017,03,20
208,Great hotel with excellent service,"We stayed here to follow the rugby and it was in easy distance of the ground in a really nice area.

Hotel staff were great with every need delivered with a smile and good conversation added in.

Room service was prompt and the food hot

Great hotel ",4,2017,03,19
208,Lovely boutique hotel with great staff,"Stayed here for a long weekend in March - the rooms are nice, new and clean, the bar is great for a quiet but atmospheric drink and the staff were great.
We were woken up on the second night but our neighbor playing VERY loud music but the hotel quickly resolved for us.",4,2017,03,14
208,Scrumptious afternoon tea,"I'm new to the world of afternoon tea and The Dylan Hotel is the first place I've had it. I must say everything was delightful! The food was fresh and tasty, the staff were friendly and attentive. An all round amazing introduction to the art of afternoon tea. ",5,2017,03,13
208,Great stay,"Overall a nice relaxing experience. Received a warm welcome in reception acknowledged that I had stayed before. Room was very nice. A loft style room on the third floor.  It exceeded my expectations. 
Very quiet hotel, comfortable nights sleep.
Breakfast was too a high standard. The hotel was quiet so this contributed to a very relaxed meal. 
Reception staff again very friendly on check out. 
If you are looking for a chilled out, hassle free weekend stay at a high standard - the Dylan is it. ",5,2017,03,10
208,Tavern Restaurant in Dylan Hotel ,My girlfriend and I had an amazingly nice  Tasting Menu in Tavern Restaurant tonight. The food and service were beyond compare! I've been fortunate to dine in a number of Dublin's renowned Five Star hotels and the food in Dylan Hotel is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The staff were courteous and friendly and the the food was flavoursome and rich. An excellent dining experience! ,5,2017,03,05
208,Wonderful venue for family celebration,"Just want to thank Mateo, Vedrana and the team at the Dylon Hotel very much for all the help in organising the celebration lunch for a special family occasion, we had really wonderful day. The food was excellent, as was the service from the warm and friendly staff. The helpful customer care and personal touch in the both the planning of the celebration and on the day itself was first class throughout. We booked the elegant Library space for pre-lunch party gathering with drinks and delicious canap√©s which was a perfect way to begin celebrations. The day could not have gone better, a lovely memorable occasion, highly recommend the Dylan. Thanks very much  again to the team for all their care and attention to detail that made it such an enjoyable day. And most importantly, my Mum, whose special day we were celebrating, loved it!",5,2017,03,05
208,Family meal,Had a family get together here in November having visited the hotel a few times and being impressed. We were a party of 18 in all. Mostly very disappointed with every aspect of the stay and dinner. We went for the private dinning option. Many of the main courses were cold. The entire soup course was cold. The room wasn't ready at the agreed time so our guests had to kill an hour in a packed bar. The entire event had been prepaid so on complaining the response wasn't sparkling. Waited a week for a manager to call to be offered a reimbursement for the soup course. Not a whole lot on a two and a half grand bill. Stayed in a suite which was badly decorated and outdated. Breakfast the next day was a joke. One waitress trying to manage the whole room.  Overall I'd really struggle to say anything positive or recommend this hotel. ,3,2017,02,28
208,Our Valentine's was even better in this Hotel,"We had a late check in, but the staff welcomed us in and made us feel at home. A restaurant and bar are on the ground floor, we did not hear any noise though. The bed was amazing, heated bathroom floor, and shopping/dining are just around the corner. This area is known as Ballsbridge, and is about a twenty minute walk from City Centre. Plenty of bus stops are near by, and a multiple day hopper/pass can be purchased nearby.",5,2017,02,24
208,Very nearly perfect! ,"We enjoyed our stay at the Dylan last week. The service is brilliant, friendly helpful staff always happy. On arrival we were able to check in earlier than expected which was nice. We were intending just to drop bags off. Our room was lovely, very spacious with a balcony a big bathroom and a very comfy bed. 
I was very happy until I saw all the building work going on right opposite the balcony! Scaffolding is not a good view. 
To be woken at 7 in the morning is not nice for anyone let alone when you have booked a 5 star hotel for a romantic valentines break. It is not the hotels fault I understand this cannot be helped. But then I also think it should have been mentioned on our arrival this was the case. 
It didn't detract from a lovely time but may be more of a problem for others. 
The drinks in the bar were sublime and a very reasonable price. 
If we were to return to Dublin I wouldn't hesitate to stay here. ",4,2017,02,20
208,Great place to stay in Dublin,"If you want a lovely friendly and special hotel to stay in Dublin then Dylan's your place. Great rooms, Comfy beds, great staff, friendly service and good food. Would definitely stay again. Not too far from the centre .... a relatively short walk into the centre of Dublin.",5,2017,02,19
208,Weekend away,"Spent a long weekend in Dublin, for my partners special birthday celebration! Stayed at this fantastic hotel ""The Dylan"". Hotel was rated as 4/5 stars, and we were not disappointed! Rooms were large,beds were comfy and spacious, with a boutique modern,some say quirky burlesque theme! A very enjoyable stay! Staff were very helpful and attentive! Would highly recommend! ",5,2017,02,10
208,Dirty & Disorganized,"Public areas are used as pub on weekends ...if you like bar atmosphere, the day after ...this is the place for you. Linens are soiled, food on floor, while the staff are all busy spacing out. Overall experience: gross",1,2017,02,05
208,Celebrated my fianc√©'s 30th over New Year! ,"I've been quite late in writing my review but felt I must do it. We stayed over new year for my partners 30th and wow! What a hotel. Amazing service, incredible rooms and you felt really looked after. Everything was incredibly clean and immaculate and the staff would go out of their way to welcome you with personalised notes and a fresh fruit platter which was absolutely delicious. They only enhanced our visit and we would happily return! Thank you so much xx ",5,2017,02,03
208,Going above and beyond,We spent just one night here but it was sublime. The room and service were fantastic. The food was really good and they went above and beyond to accommodate us in our food. I had some special requests which they all took care of. Overall I can highly recommend Dylan Hotel,5,2017,02,03
208,Not as good as expected....,"I booked the Dylan as a January treat for me and friend. I'd had drinks there before and was excited about staying. The check in was lovely, staff were friendly and efficient. Noting that it's a 5 star, we were not asked would we like any help with our bags, this disappointed me. The room was small but I expected this from a ""boutique"" hotel and didn't mind. Both of our bath towels were all frayed at the edges, this is not what I'd expect at all. There were also no glasses in the room. I always think in a five star, or in any hotel worth its salt, complimentary water should be provided, it was not. These are small things buy they are usually why you go for the ""better"" hotel. Where you don't have to ask or look for things, they are just catered for. Overall my experience in the dylan was fine. I did not come away gushing about the hotel as I have from others. I probably wouldn't make a return trip based on the fact that other hotels for the same money are offering that little bit extra. ",3,2017,01,28
208,Excellent,"My wife and I have just spent two nights at Dylan Hotel Dublin ,it was a great experenice 
from we checked in till we checked out .a nice quiet location ,10min walk into city ,staff were very friendly 
and helpful .i would definetly come back to Dylan hotel .this was the best hotel I have stayed in when in Dublin ",5,2017,01,27
208,Great hidden gem that's walkable,"I was in town for an event and all the ""standards"" were full.  Took a chance on the Dylan based on the reviews I read - it is now my go-to spot.  The rooms are smaller than a chain hotel, but much nicer than a budget or B&B. The furnishings are top notch (best hotel sleep I have had in ages).  Great air conditioning, nice bathrooms (shower can be a little tricky to figure out) and even heated floors in the bath!  My room even had a small balcony, which was great for getting fresh air!

The breakfast is great - everything from Benedict to full Irish, and even lighter fare in between.  The bar has a great selection of wines by the glass, and food service in the bar is great.

Then there is the staff - the most amazing thing about the hotel!  You feel like a welcomed guest from the beginning. Requests are answered withing seconds, no delay if there is an issue or a need. You are treated as though you are family, which is a welcomed feeling for a weary business traveler.

All in all - a treat! I look forward to going back soon!",5,2017,01,23
208,Comfortable hotel with attentive staff,"Stayed between Christmas and new year as a surprise birthday present from my wife. Upon checking in I was impressed with the beautiful frontage, the hotel seemed very upmarket and welcoming. Check in was swift and we headed to our room. The room itself was good although I would say more 4 than 5 star as it was quite small and missing a few little luxuries you would expect with a 5 star, maybe a small coffee machine and complimentary waters? The food in the restaurant was excellent but a little pricey we found however the staff were very friendly and un-stuffy. The breakfast selection was fantastic and cooked perfectly, my only big issue during our stay was the heating at breakfast, it was far too hot and uncomfortable! Being walker's my wife and I didn't mind the position of the hotel but it's a good mile maybe a mile and a half into the center of Dublin. I would stay again though",4,2017,01,23
208,Disappointing!,"Stayed at the Dylan on recommendation by a taxi driver (maybe there is my mistake!). Well arrived at 7pm in the evening to be told that the Gym was shut (TBH I wouldn't have stayed in the first place had I known), so then asked if I could reserve a table for dinner...not unusual in itself, to be told ""sorry the restaurant is closed on a Monday"", but if you would like food we have bar meals available. Ok I will go with that option I thought! So walk into the bar & find pretty much all of the tables have reserve signs on them! Clearly the hotel has building work going on so to be woken to the sound of some drill hammer! Brilliant I thought...so seeing as I've not been able to have a work out the night before I think I'll walk....to then Find that yes it's just off Baggot Street...the wrong end! At breakfast the waiter didn't actually listen to my food request. So on departure I raise my concerns with reception. They remove to cost of the breakfast (great seeing as all I had eaten was cereal & tea. I mentioned the building noise & they said that there had been letters placed through the doors of each of the rooms! It would have been more helpful had the added this to their website before I booked & I would have made alternative arrangement! Yes the bedrooms are nice, the staff were pleasant but with the competition in Dublin...the Dylan is living on an old reputation that is not current! I am sorry I stayed....",1,2017,01,14
208,Excellent customer service,"We always find the Dylan to be a quiet comfortable place to stay while in Dublin.
Rooms are clean, comfortable and luxurious. 
During this trip I lost my wallet while out walking with my son.
Gabriela, who was at the front desk could not have been more helpful. She advised me to file a police report in case my wallet showed up and directed me to nearest police station. What was an upsetting situation was made more tolerable by her kindness and assistance. And yes - someone found my wallet and returned it to me later that day (minus the cash) but with my drivers license and credit cards intact!!",5,2017,01,12
208,"Lovely hotel, staff and food!! ","Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the New Years. First time to visit Dublin, and this hotel just made it fabulous. On the way from the ferry port which is approx about 10/15 mins in a taxi to the hotel the taxi driver was telling us that this hotel was the best in Dublin, which made us more excited about arriving the hotel. 
Arrived the hotel and was greeted by a lovely member of staff who checked us in and gave us all information that we needed about Dublin itself.
The location is brilliant, located in a quiet street in Dublin, close to some local pubs and shops. City Centre is approx 20 mins walk from the hotel. We really enjoyed the walk down to the city centre as you could see and visit the different shops on your way down to the city centre. 
The room we stayed in was lovely, with enough facilities, snacks and drinks, with little brownies waiting for us when arriving the room. 
Staff were always lovely and always happy to help. Very easy to get a taxi from the hotel to anywhere you would like, just ask at the reception and they'll book one straight for you.
Planned on visiting the New Years Festival on New Years Eve to watch the countdown, only to find out that we needed to book tickets which were unfortunately sold out!! We went around Dublin which had great atmosphere and decided to head back to the hotel for the countdown, which had lovely atmosphere with a guy singing and playing the piano, only downfall was that the countdown had been and no one realised! 
The food at the restaurant was very tasty, but a little too posh for my liking, but if your one for the ""A La Carte"" then this hotel is a must to try! 
Only negative was the shower and taps in the room, they were constantly hot, impossible to shower for long, but without a doubt if you would call the reception to explain they'd be up straight to sort it out for you!! 
Lovely hotel, would recommend to all family and friends and definitely would be back :) ",5,2017,01,09
208,Great location and restaurants...rooms left much to be desired,"We booked one night at the Dylan Hotel after some business appointments in Dublin. Given it was a treat prior to our upcoming wedding, we were looking forward to a romantic, night away. I jokingly called it our ""wedding moon"". 

The bar and restaurants were terrific - food, service and atmosphere all lived up to our expectations. Once we entered the elevator and started up to our room, things changed. Finding our room was a bit like navigating Alice In Wonderland. We could have gotten past that if the rooms had been up to par. They were only average in decor and size. The bed was comfortable and clean. The following morning the shower handles came off in my husband's hand and he only achieved a lukewarm shower. While he's not super-fussy, he was less than impressed.

Based on our experience, skip staying there and enjoy the ambiance and fine food on the ground floor.",3,2017,01,05
208,Beautiful Hotel,"Me and my partner have just come back from Dublin after staying at this hotel. We don't often visit 5 star hotels so was a treat for us anyway. The staff were very helpful and friendly, our room was gorgeous and warm and comfortable. Staff couldn't do enough for you and we felt very looked after. The bar area was lovely and the food was lush! all bar staff and wait staff were friendly and helpful and easy to get along with. Its situated just outside of the main city centre, but it only took us 10 mins to walk in. we would most definitely visit again.",5,2017,01,05
208,Excellent Hotel off beaten track.....,Boutique Hotel just off Baggot Street which is a hidden gem. Excellent location 4/5 star but can be overly expensive so look out for deals. Great place for a romantic getaway I'd say and a good place to relax. Good restaurants and pubs within walking distance of the hotel if you didn't want to eat in hotel. Parking is an issue which would be the only down side.,4,2017,01,04
208,Return visit to Dylan Dublin did not disappoint,"We paid a return one night visit to the Dylan just before Christmas. Plenty of buzz around the hotel as you might expect and lots of Christmas decorations; so top marks for that aspect.

Service at reception was top notch, attentive, warm welcome etc. Service at the bar was somewhat less so, albeit they were quite busy. Cocktails were very tasty but there was a rather high volume of ice which quickly diluted the drink quality - think they need to revisit this as the cocktails were unusually small. Surprised also that no nuts were served with the cocktails as had been custom - though they did arrive when we requested same.

The rooms was excellent, spotless, warm, inviting & wifi works well. A small problem with the shower was readily resolved following a call to reception.

Service for breakfast was very attentive & efficient. Quality of the cooked breakfast was reasonable enough.

I would happily recommend this hotel for quality, service & location.",4,2017,01,04
208,"Lovely hotel, excellent customer service ","We stayed in the Dylan and found the staff extremely welcoming. The rooms were very comfortable. We had a very late night drink with friends in the bar and the night staff were very accommodating. Breakfast made to order was excellent. We requested a later check out and the reception staff were happy to oblige. A great stay all round, I would love to return! ",5,2016,12,29
208,Breakfast at The Dylan,"Excellent Christmas Breakfast here. Food was amazing, staff were exceptionally helpful.
Such a lovely place to escape the buzz of Christmas shopping - sumptuous surroundings, cosy fire all in the company of family and friends.",5,2016,12,23
208,Lovely boutique hotel ,"Beautiful big room with exceptionally comfy bed. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the setting was very cozy and well decorated 
The bar looks great and the restaurant was always busy
It's a fairly long 20-30 walk to the centre of Dublin but that's not such an issue
There's also a good pub at the end of the road!",5,2016,12,23
208,Lovely,"Third time staying here and this really is a lovely hotel. Rooms are excellent - spacious and comfortable. Excellent Wi-fi and good selection of TV channels in rooms. Great customer service. Breakfast is excellent, with cereals, fruit, pastries buffet style and hot food served to order. They even gave me a takeaway breakfast and coffee one morning when I had to leave early. Lovely location too - so many eating options 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,12,20
208,Overnight stay- sublime! ,"Had a last minute trip to Dublin this week, Sunday night, and luckily found a room at the Dylan. 
Stunning little hotel, all modern amenities including a power shower with side jets, super comfy mattress which may be memory foam, lush toiletries, soft towels, quirky interior. The food was relish too...What more can you ask for? ",5,2016,12,05
208,Lovely boutique hotel ,"Had a lovely one night stay at Dylan while in Dublin last week. Our group all commented on how comfortable the beds were. Very well stocked bar, and the breakfast was excellent.  Room service available for late night snackers. Would like to revisit with my wife as I think this would be a great hotel for a romantic break.",5,2016,11,28
208,Very Nice Stay,We were heading out on a road trip from Ireland to Portugal with our dog and decided to kick it off in style at the Dylan.  We weren't disappointed.  They gave us and our dog a warm welcome.  The room was great.  We had a long hard day and decided to order room service rather than going out.   The food was exceptional - much better than any room service experience we have had at other hotels.  The only disappointment was that we checked in so late and out so early that we didn't get to take advantage of all the Dylan offered.,5,2016,11,27
208,Great boutique hotel and well located!,"Great boutique hotel and well located! - particularly if you are a rugby fan!!! The hotel is a 10min walk from Aviva Stadium and around 20min walk fromDublin city centre. Easy walking in both directions. Around 2 minutes away are good restaurants and pubs and shops so a great location. The hotel is great - friendly staff and helpful. Our room was 312 in the new section, spacious enough, a bit of door rattle due to the door connection to the main hotel. Excellent breakfast and the bar worked well. In all we would recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,11,27
208,Good Boutique Hotel,"Good boutique hotel looks a bit tired in some areas but overall no issues. Nice our room was ready on an early check in we only expected to drop our bags but we're told room was free and allowed to check in and go to room. Our only main issue was an event on and so when we got back to the hotel could not even get near the bar for a nightcap! As far as been 'out of the way' you can walk to Temple bar in 15 minutes and the restaurant recommendations we received from the hotel were brilliant both 5 star reviews and within a 5 minute walk plus a few really nice friendly bars, Our taxi from the airport told us we were lucky to be staying in such a nice part of the city!! Would stay again without hesitation!. ",4,2016,11,14
208,Fantastic ,A friend booked the hotel for us and wow what a gem great rooms.fantastic food and brilliant staff .start the day with the Dylan breakfast and you'll be set up for the day ahead would recommend to any one wanting to visit Dublin.,5,2016,11,11
208,A bit out of the way,"The hotel is a bit out of the way.  If you are short on time and just want to see the sights, better to pay extra and stay in the center of town.  That being said, the neighborhood is full of great restaurants, so if you are a foodie, stay here to end your day with a great meal and walk home.  
The hotel is very nice and the staff friendly and helpful. Rooms are a nice size and the beds very comfortable.  Windows that you can open are always a plus for me. We lamented that it was too cold to sit outside while we were there. The space was very inviting.",4,2016,11,07
208,Great wee boutique hotel,Great hotel very nicely decorated and in a lovely part of Dublin. About 20 mins walk to the city centre and plenty of nice restaurants are about a stone throw away. Staff all very helpful and hospitable. Rooms were well spaced and very clean. ,5,2016,11,06
208,Relaxing enjoyable stay,"This is my second time reviewing this hotel.I returned after a previous negative review which primarily related to noise.On return, I cannot fault the hotel.

Again, there were some very notable positives,
- the front of house staff who greeted us were exceptionally welcoming
- the room itself was large and warm
- the bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable and lead to a great night sleep.
- the fresh milk in the room is a lovely touch
- the turndown service is as always lovely to come back after a night out
- the breakfast was delicious and there was a great choice of fruits and pastries  in addition to a well cooked tasty irish hot breakfast
- we sampled the cocktails in the bar which were exceptional and again the staff were faultless in their delivery of service
- we ordered room service and whilst what we were looking for wasn't on the menu, the staff helpfully obliged without question.Again service was quick and impeccable. 

From check in to departure, I cannot fault the hotel.We enjoyed a relaxed and comfortable stay in the hotel and will undoubtedly return again soon.",5,2016,11,06
208,Superb hotel,My wife and i spent 2 nights at the hotel with friends. Its a great location close to great bars and restaurants and a 20 minute walk from Grafton St and all the shops. The hotel staff were very attentive from the minute we walked into the hotel and were always on hand to assist with anything you needed. The choices at breakfast were endless and was really enjoyable. i cant recommend this hotel highly enough.,5,2016,11,03
208,Beautiful hotel ,The hotel is lovely and in a very accessible location to any of the main Dublin areas to avoid cab fare. The street the hotel is off has a wide variety of restaurants which all look lovely and were rated high on this app. The only downside is that on our last night a house alarm was tripped around 3-5am and that impeded our sleep but that couldn't be helped from the hotel ,5,2016,11,02
208,Quality boutique hotel,"Three nights in a Superior King room for a getaway from the kids. Not cheap, but worth it and the hotel is recommended.

The Dylan is in a quiet road off a main road, 15 minutes walk from Grafton Street or a short bus ride on the 39a. (Buy a 3-day Leap card at the airport and get your return Airlink and all bus journeys for less than Euros20). An eclectically/funkily furnished, decorated and lit Victorian building, with odd stairs and passages, we had a newer room at the back that did not disappoint: large with a large and very comfortable bed; well-appointed and very quiet, with the exception of thoughtless door-slamming vulgarian room-neighbours.  Not the hotel's fault. The bathroom was very small and - black mark here - no hand-held shower handset and the shower head itself an unadjustable ceiling mounted rainshower - unhappy wife. Nice touches: fresh milk for tea, water each night; good hairdryer, slippers, robes.

Staff were very pleasant and obliging at all stages, including in the bar, where the outdoor smoking area  is extremely large and well-furnished with TVs showing sports and heaters for the evening. 

We did not eat in the hotel. 25 Euros for breakfast is ridiculous. Walk round the corner and there is a choice of places  - Searsons pub is good - offering great cooked breakfasts for half the price. Black mark for gouging. 

Could have been a five-star contender without the shower oddities and pricey breakfast. But a solid 4 stars so long as you don't mind being a bit 'out'.",4,2016,10,31
208,A real customer care experience!,"We went here for our anniversary and to go to a gig in the evening.  We chose a package that included an evening meal and full breakfast.  The food was exceptional!  A three or four course meal, depending on what you include, and a quality wine list.  Then the following morning we had a fantastic breakfast. The staff could not do enough to ensure that our stay was comfortable.  Great location.  Comfortable bar and lounge areas.  And most importantly, the bed was so comfortable we both had a sound night's sleep!. The WiFi is really strong too which you don't always get in hotels.  All in all, a fab experience and will definitely be coming back. Wonderful!!!!",5,2016,10,30
208,Lovely hotel and superb attention,"We stayed at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin last weekend.  Our room was excellent, attention to detail amazing and the staff exceptionally accommodating and helpful.  The bed was very comfortable.  We ordered room service which was delivered speedily and the food was hot and tasty.   The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice.",5,2016,10,29
208,Great boutique hotel,"We arrived Fri 21st until 23rd Oct over weekend to celebrate my 30th birthday.
The hotel was immaculate with a very modern interior, the first impression of the hotel was great. 
The check-in staff was very helpful and friendly advising us on trips and things to do including advance bookings for taxis.
The location of the hotel is just outside the city center but within walking distance to the main strip.
We had breakfast at the hotel and was to a high standard, the waiters were very friendly and quick to replenish toast and drinks.
Overall great location in Dublin would highly recommended for a personal boutique stay. 
",5,2016,10,26
208,Sophisticated boutique hotel located in great neighborhood!,"I stayed at the Dylan hotel for one week and had a truly fine experience characterized by a hip room, 5-star staff and excellent amenities.  The in-room Nespresso machine and electric kettle made waking up jet-lagged ever so much easier and the concierge staff were unfailingly BEYOND polite and helpful.  They had lots of opportunities to help me sort out transportation, tours, business tasks etc and it felt like coming home each night after a long day of business activities.  A giant plus was The Dylan's proximity to two fine gastro-pubs less than 5 minutes walk around the corner,  as well as a lovely architecturally interesting and very safe walk-neighborhood. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and would recommend to friends and family with enthusiasm.",5,2016,10,25
208,excellent place for a function,"We attended an evening function at this hotel where the food, service and drinks were all first class. It has a hip decor and fantastic atmosphere. The staff were really on top of everything including a room change-over to clear dinner seating into a dance-floor and everything went very smoothly. There's lots of break-out spaces for conversation and an outside terrace. The servers kept everybody's glasses filled and the food service was excellent and imaginative starting with canapes on arrival and ending with fish and chips at midnight.",5,2016,10,23
208,Couldn't fault the hotel,"Great boutique hotel. Funky rooms, all different. Friendly hard working staff, from all over the world. Delicious food - have to try the Sphere - which is a pudding - a must! An easy 15 minute walk into the centre of town and some good pubs and restaurants close by. ",5,2016,10,23
208,"A gem of a hotel, with a fantastic bar!","My friend and I were heading back to Dublin, for one night only, and the Dylan was so fantastic, it made leaving the wonderful city of Dublin even harder that it was already.
We checked in, and there was a bit of construction going on.  The front desk swiftly handled a change of room, bought us a guiness at the bar, and was so incredibly lovely.
The room was clean, large and had incredible design.  Could not be happier,  can't wait to return.
And Oscar at the bar was SO knowledgeable.  Just a great place, location and staff",5,2016,10,21
208,Friendly modern hotel,"My wife and I stayed here last night,on arrive we were greeted with a welcoming reception and a swift swipe of the credit card for the mini bar.
The hotel is very very modern,room sizes are very good, bed was king size  and very comfortable.
Location is great a walk away from The city centre and lots of bars and restaurants to choose from.
The bar in the hotel is very nice and the staff are very nice.
Only downside we thought was the cost of breakfast at ‚Ç¨25ish euros per person......I feel this is a little steep and opted to go to Searsons around the corner where a full Irish breakfast with a tea/coffee is ‚Ç¨9 and is a very good breakfast.
Thank you for the great stay Dylan's and we hope to return in the future.",5,2016,10,09
208,"Lovely, save teeny tiny bathroom","The Dylan is a perfect base for discovering Dublin. It's a boutique-style hotel, with funky decor, well trained, friendly staff and top notch food (we can highly recommend the mushroom soup, the burger and a most excellent breakfast).  

Our only slight bugbear was the minuscule bathroom, particularly when compared to the size of the sleeping area. We were in room 208 and can't for the life of us work or why more bathroom space wasn't taken from the bed area. I'd definitely ask to see alternatives If that's what you're offered. 
",4,2016,09,26
208,Smart 5 star operation,"This 5 star boutique hotel is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of noise and beside a small beautiful park beside St. Marys Road D.4. I have enjoyed dinner there twice in 6 weeks. The bar area offers a lounge menu of things like Classic Burger ,Fish and Chips priced about ‚Ç¨15. Drinks are expensive ,house gls..white wine from ‚Ç¨8.
The Restaurant is smart and has an very nice ambiance with quality on offer ,wines affordable , cocktails from ‚Ç¨12.
relaxed and pleasant atmosphere with very switched on staff. We will return.",4,2016,09,26
208,Good all round choice,"Good location, good staff (although the restaurant staff were over run on Saturday night - very nice lady, who was working at real pace, but only really two/three people covering 20 tables). Room was nice and the whole place has a quite cool vibe without being painful. Very happy to recommend.",4,2016,09,24
208,"Lovely, modern hotel.",We have stayed here a few times now and it fails to disappoint. The rooms are lovely and the service is really good. The drinks can be quite pricey however but overall it is well located and very welcoming..,5,2016,09,23
208,Delightful place to stay,"Great staff,attentive and helpful
Great location, quiet area and walking distance to attractions
Great room,modern and clean but could use some more lighting
Great soundproofing and blackout curtains.",5,2016,09,14
208,Quiet Hotel Close (Enough) to Attractions,"Great hotel situated on a quiet street, but still close enough to walk to all popular attractions. Though, a taxi back was handy after a long day of walking.

The staff was friendly and helpful, and we were checked in at 9am when our flight landed with no issues. Hotel room was clean and modern, the AC came in very handy. Lastly, the cocktails in the hotel bar were tasty and the patio is a great spot.",5,2016,09,12
208,"Nice modern hotel, not so great for big families","The Dylan is a lovely luxury hotel that we selected for its proximity to Aviva stadium. We walked to the GT vs Boston College game with ease, and we were grateful for avoiding the exiting crowds and taxi queues. The hotel staff were super nice and accommodating. They even helped us make dinner reservations for 14 people on a Friday evening at short notice! Our daughter turned two during the trip, and they let us have cake and cocktails on the front patio area to celebrate. The rooms are lovely, if very modern. The only issue with this hotel was that they have no adjoining rooms and no suites, so we had to break up our family. The three rooms we were given we not even next to each other, so it was awkward. If you are traveling as a couple or for business, this would be a fine choice.",4,2016,09,12
208,Very high quality rooms and staff,"Rooms very comfortable (especially the beds) with good aircon and great shower. I got upgraded to a suite although my colleague ended up bumped to another hotel because they were overbooked!!! Breakfast very high quality, albeit slow, but I will say that when I told them i was running out of time, they did bump my order up. Particular accolade should go to the concierge team though, who really couldn't do enough: cash for taxis, different coffee capsules for the machine and great restaurant recommendations, all delivered efficiently, professionally and with a smile. ",4,2016,09,03
208,Boutique feel with 5* service,"A great hotel close to the canal in Dublin. Good size rooms, with nespresso, free water, TV in the bath and striking design. Nice bar and breakfasts so good that seemed people were meeting here for pre work power breakfasts. Friendly and helpful staff. Slightly overelaborate wifi system but still free. Will definitely stay here again.
",5,2016,09,02
208,Lovel Location Staff and Room,"We loved that The Dylan was just off a main street in a quieter setting but close enough that we walked to the Hop On buses and walked to many of the sights we wanted to see. We had a wonderful room on the 3rd floor which had a lovely comfortable bed and very large bath with a shower and tub. We ate at the bar and the food and the service were very good. The decor is lovely too. The staff makes this hotel. They were super kind and helpful with directions and confirming our auto rental at the end of our stay at the Dylan before we hit the road. Martin, the concierge, was amazingly kind and helpful as was Adeline, Gabriellla, Katrinka and Antonija. I would stay at the Dylan just for the way they make you feel a bit like royalty.",5,2016,08,31
208,Family trip to Dublin,First off the staff at the Dylan was truly exceptional.  They responded quickly competently and well to all requests.  They made every conceivable effort to make our stay enjoyable.  That said we were disappointed with the rooms in the Dylan as they are fairly small and especially the bath rooms are more of a size and appointments of a three star property.  The breakfast was good while not exceptional.,3,2016,08,26
208,Amazing hotel!!,"We arrived for our 2 night/3 day stay on 19th august 2016. This hotel is the best ive been too, from the room, the comfy bed,  the amazing breakfast but most of all the service, the staff couldnt have done more to go out of their way to be helpful! Being slightly away from the city center was great just a short walk or taxi ride. We've had a fantastic break in dublin and the hotel has been a huge part of that! ",5,2016,08,21
208,"Simply charming, lovely base to explore the city and it's weddings customs:-)","Great charming place in a small cozy neighbourhood. Just loved it. Choose it for my small group as a start and finish of our deluxe Ireland tour in June-July and did not regreat it for a minute. Very nice, individual rooms, nice breaky and a great bar which the locals love and take for their receptions, wedding costum show offs and more, great place to see the greatest hats and dresses of Dublin. Rooms are large and very well designed, fun to be there!",5,2016,08,21
208,A Small Lovely Boutique Hotel,"We have been here three nights. The hotel is quiet, romantic and extremely comfortable. A little out of the way, but not too much. Twenty minute walk to Grafton Street and very close to great neighborhood pubs. Breakfast is fantastic. Searsons Pub nearby is excellent. Hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. Have had a marvelous time here. ",5,2016,08,19
208,Boutique and off the beaten track.,Great boutique hotel with nice rooms.  Rooms are comfortable and some have unique designs.  Food is excellent. Staff very helpful. Location is very good.  Rooms facing front of hotel can be a little noisy because they face a school. Quite noisy at recess and afternoon pickup.  Lobby is good for meetings.  The restaurant is large and welcoming.,5,2016,08,14
208,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"A fantastic place to stay and really central; excellent staff and customer service; outstanding food; gorgeous room, really spacious; short walking distance from the Aviva; if you are seeking a bit of luxury or to a special treat this hotel is ideal ",5,2016,08,09
208,Simply wonderful,"Fantastic hotel with friendly staff, great valet parking service, rooms are elegant and clean. Great area of the city. Wonderful bar and smoking area. Very welcoming and professional staff. All round a wonderful hotel.",5,2016,08,07
208,5-star boutique hotel in Dublin - fully matches this description,"I stayed two nights for business travel and everything including the rooms, food, service and facilities were great. The room decor was quite nice, comfortable and the building is a pleasant change from skyscraper-style 5-star hotels. And it's worth noting that the mention of the hotel drew praise from friends in Ireland. The breakfast spread is nice, and if you decide to go around walking, it's not far from anywhere either. Room service was good, and in general pricing is not over the top.

I highly recommend this luxury hotel in Dublin, whether you're on business or leisure.",5,2016,08,06
208,"Excellent, mainly.","Lovely boutique hotel just close enough to the city centre to walk but far enough out to avoid the crowds. 

Service and rooms were five star standard but restaurant was average at best, with one of the worst Irish breakfasts ever, despite its description. 

Not cheap but would definitely return. ",4,2016,08,04
208,"Wonderful, dog friendly hotel!","We stayed here in December and I have been meaning to write a review since! From the moment we walked in it was great (and I am a very picky guest!). The staff were exceptional - on reception, in the bar, throughout the hotel. The room was gorgeous and we had our little dog with us and they had a lovely dog bed, bowl and treats for us. Dylan does not just accept pets they are super pet friendly compared to other 4 and 5 star hotels in Ireland. The food in the restaurant was fab also and we cannot wait to comeback the next time we are home!",5,2016,08,03
208,Wonderful boutique hotel in Dublin,"This is a terrific spot to stay in Dublin. The hotel is everything you'd want from a top flight boutique hotel - great rooms, great service, great location. Lots of nearby restaurants. Easy cab ride from the airport.",5,2016,07,21
208,wonderful oasis in dublin,"Checked out all the leading hotels in Dublin and was so happy to land here as a base for a week while visiting my daughter. Staff were lovely on so many levels, and neighborhood was a respite and very easy walk to central locations",5,2016,07,20
208,"Unique, comfortable, great staff","We stayed for one night at The Dylan after traveling a long distance to get to Dublin. Loved the decor and amenities of the room (especially the bathroom!) 

The bed was rather small but was comfortable and we enjoyed the patio lounge with drinks and a cheese board that evening. Very quiet area which was nice after touring the busy Temple Bar district most of the day! 

I would get breakfast elsewhere as its expensive for the value but overall I would definitely return! ",5,2016,07,19
208,good hotel,"The Dylan hotel is nice,  centrally located in dublin. The hotel is quite small but this was nice as it wasnt crowed. Rooms were off a very high standard and decorated very well! 

The staff made this hotel, I was ill during my stay and they were very helpfull. The restaurant also was superb, although I didn't dine as I was poorly family members were impressed!",3,2016,07,16
208,Quiet luxury close to all the sites,"Our multi-generational family of 11 had a wonderful stay totaling four nights at the Dylan. The staff were incredibly accommodating and gracious during our entire stay. The rooms are lovely, spacious and comfortable. We dined in the restaurant one evening and it was quite delicious with a wonderful wine list. Breakfast was equally delicious and enjoyable. We can't thank the staff enough for all of their thoughtful care in making our family so comfortable and welcome during our stay. Thank you Dylan Hotel!",5,2016,07,11
208,Stunning Hotel great staff,Stayed at the Dylan in June visiting family in Dublin. This is a great hotel with great service. We stayed on the second floor the room was nice and bright clean and spacious. The staff make this hotel and the service is second to none. The hotel is located is about 20 minutes walk into Grafton Street. I would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,07,11
208,Went the extra mile - will stay here again,"We were staying at the Dylan Hotel whilst celebrating my husbands birthday, and to help us celebrate the staff upgraded our room and cakes and a note were left in our room on the first night. Every member of staff that we encountered were very polite and helpful and the hotel was modern, clean and stylish. It is a short walk from the main attractions which meant it was much quieter at night. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again ourselves - thanks to everyone who helped us celebrate.",5,2016,07,08
208,"So pretentious, aloof and totally clueless","It's rare that I post a review of accommodation whilst I'm still staying somewhere, but The Dylan is an exception. 

From the moment we arrived it was an almost icy reception, where one woman at the desk told us about breakfast only to the other to curtly put her in her place by saying not breakfast was included for us, then the lift didn't work and finally our room was completely unmade when we entered. All in all, it was not a very good start. However, this was to be a small reflection of our stay here.

To put this hotel in context, we are paying over A$400 per night, so expectations were set at a suitable level. However, this is a hotel that places great emphasis on style over function, and where the staff has little, if any, interest in guest relations. In particular, they appear to know virtually nothing about Dublin. 

By way of example, the map we asked the front desk for was a basic one issued by hop on hop off buses, and it doesn't even show the road that the hotel is in. I asked about an adjacent suburb and the woman at the desk hadn't heard of it, despite the fact that it is recommended in the free Dublin guidebook that's widely available. We overheard another guest ask directions to the Abbey Theatre, only to be greeted with a blank stare from the receptionist. Really??? Luckily, my son could give her the advice she was seeking. 

Yesterday, I asked the concierge to assist me with a call to my airline. When I returned in the afternoon, I asked if there was any response. The receptionist said there was a message in my room, guess what?? No message. So this morning I asked again. The concierge (a different person than yesterday) said he would look into it. About an hour later, I asked how he had gotten on. He hadn't managed to get around to the call but he would do so today and leave a message in our room. Well, it's now 10.30pm and nothing received yet. Is this really the service anyone expects from a ""luxury, boutique hotel""?

This is our third night and as we entered our room there was indeed a letter under our door - not the message I was hoping for but a welcome note from the manager hoping we enjoy our stay (the fact there's a typo in the letter speaks volumes for the level of attention to detail that happens here). Well, we check out in a day so better late than never, I suppose. 

On the positive side, the beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are clean, though the vanity is too small to fit even a small bag of toiletries, the fancy 3 way shower jets lack power, and for us the 3rd jet is not functioning at all. The shampoo wasn't replaced after our first night, there's no pen or paper in the room, though the bedtime chocolates are delicious. 

Best thing about the hotel? ...I'd have to say it's the pub around the corner!

Don't be fooled by the funky style of this hotel, it's simply not up to scratch. You can definitely get better value and service elsewhere. 

",1,2016,07,07
208,Very enjoyable stay,"Very enjoyable stay. Service was excellent, the room was very pleasant. The breakfast was delicious and it was nice to be able to have it on the terrace which is a very nice space. We were return visitors to stay and will stay again",5,2016,07,06
208,First rate but the Devil is in the....,"Detail.  Detail is what separates a 4 star and a 5 star hotel. The Dylan is a fine hotel in many ways and our stay was a very good experience.  Let's start with the decor - it's chic and exquisite with modern takes on classic furniture making it visually stunning when you walk in. The lift for example is a padded red experience which transports you to your floor.  And the rooms are of a high standard - opulence, good sizes and grand high ceilings.

Now let's get back to detail.  We were staying three nights and on the third day we decided that we needed more shower gel and shampoo as the hotel decided not to replenish the stocks daily and we had to call reception - a little unusual and obviously an error as all hotels will replace daily the mini shower gels etc. 

On the Monday night we returned back to the hotel and asked the waitress if food was being served at 10:55.  We were told No but were surrounded by people munching snacks- we only wanted a club sandwich.  I thought it was slightly unusual not to be a little more flexible- we'd just returned from the theatre and we were ravenous.   The hotel offers 24hr food apparently. 

The lift broke on the Sunday and in this situation it should have been essential for the hotel to schedule in bag pickups for all rooms ( especially on the top floors) rather than ask guests to schedule this.  In the end we dragged our suitcase down from the third floor. The lift was broken for over 2 days.

On the booking we had mentioned that it was a special birthday occasion- no acknowledgement was made whatsoever at any point- I've never experienced that from a hotel especially a 5 star. 

If we'd have stayed in an OK 4 star hotel the above would have been fine but the main thing about 5 stars is the customer experience and the gloss of the decor was occasionally overshadowed by the service details.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would recommend. With a few slight service changes this could be a great hotel but it's not quite there yet.",4,2016,07,05
208,Chic hotel in quieter section of city,"We loved our stay at The Dylan- it's a very chic modern hotel in a nice section of the city (20 minute walk from Trinity College, plenty of restaurants  nearby but less hectic than staying in the city center). The room was large and roomy for me and my two young adult children- we were greeted with lovely snacks. The minibar and in room snack selection was innovative and included beauty products! The restaurants  were fancy and the bar crowd was posh. The staff were extremely  helpful and seemed very international. Pricey but worth it.",5,2016,07,04
208,Cool hotel,"My friend and I enjoyed our two nights at The Dylan. The staff was very helpful and the room was comfortable. The decor was hyper modern and the place felt a little like a nightclub. The couch in our room had a few stains. Also, the bathroom was a awkwardly designed (the sink was wedged behind the door). Location was great. But, a bit expensive (and breakfast not included).",4,2016,06,24
208,Unforgettable touch *****,"Checked into the Dylan hotel with my daughter, on the wat to the hotel my daughter said she didn't feel the best so we stopped to get fresh air at this stage I rang the hotel and told them it would be after 9.

This is where our experience of Dylan began we spoke to a lovely girl Gabriella who advised us this was no problem when we mentioned our daughter was sick she asked was their anything she could for us of course us been 'super parents' just said oh she will be fine! She then called us again before we arrived to make sure we were ok

Arrived at the hotel at 9.30 to be greeted by the beautiful Gabriella who immediately approached my daughter to check was she ok. Best check in experience we have ever had!!! Gabriella is an asset to your hotel! Room was amazing.

Next morning I got up after been awake all night by my daughter been so sick

Gabriella called the care doc for us printed directions for us and told us to call her if we got lost!!

All in all my experience at the Dylan was amazing!! I personally want to thank Gabriella what an amazing person my daughter is still talking about the beautiful receptionist.

Great location in the city and within walking distance to great pubs, restaurants, parks, and or course tourist sights. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2016,06,23
208,Memorable stay,"From the reception staff, who were excellent, to the quality of the accommodation, bar and restaurant facilities, the Dylan is an exceptional hotel. Situated within 15 minutes walk of the city centre, Dylan offers a sanctuary away from the crack, hustle and bustle. Highly recommend The Pigs Ear for traditional dining with a modern twist, within in the city, and Catch 22 for an equally fine food experience.",5,2016,06,20
208,Classy but quite expensive,"We visited this hotel on a trip to Dublin, it was in an area just outside of the city centre but not too far away that it makes travelling hard. The room was high quality but very hot, The Air con did not seem great and when checked with the manager it was the same in every room. I can only imagine it is much worse in a hotter summer! The staff were friendly and welcoming. Definitely a good place to stay if a bit expensive",4,2016,06,19
208,Style > substance,"There has been a ton of money poured into making the Dylan uber self-consciously cool. The style is very late art-deco (late 20s/early 30s). Lots of attention to details such as the fancy a/v system (including the tv in the shower), the dome mirror fixture over the bed, embroidered towels, etc. Not so much attention to details that you might actually need. For example, there was exactly 1 trash bin (tiny one next to the toilet) in our suite. There were exactly 2 (adjacent) power points in the suite- at the desk. No power points near the bed or couch, so tough luck if you want to charge your phone while you are sleeping & still use it as an alarm clock. Very nice people on the front desk.",3,2016,06,17
208,Great place to unwind,"I just love this hotel. This visit was probably my 6th. I think the two best things are the great staff and the great spaces they have to relax. This is the best hotel I've ever been to to relax. If you find yourself with an hour or two of kicking around time in the hotel its great. They have a beautiful spacious heated and covered courtyard out the back great in summer and winter, ample seating out front (in front of the restaurant) there is a library, a bar and seating in the bar next to a fireplace (lovely in winter). 

I often sit out the back in the evening with one of their fantastic cocktails and chill before going out to dinner. When we get back we have a pre-bed drink and a smoke. In the morning it lovely to sit out front with a coffee before breakfast and yes another smoke. In winter i like to sit by the fire or in the library with a crossword or such-like.

The staff are always so nice and helpful. 

Its a little out of the way but I think the extra space they have makes up for it and i love walking and i mostly walk into the city centre from the hotel.",5,2016,06,15
208,Top Hotel! Minor yet very unexpected glitches!,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and was immediately impressed by the level of Staff support shown towards my wife and myself having just driven from Glasgow. SO lets continue the theme; ALL staff, from reception, to waitstaff to Bar person everyone is very helpful and make you fell special. The Art and interior of this hotel is a joy to behold.  Some Funky, some serious but all highly imaginative pieces of furniture are scattered around the hotel,  Rooms are spacious, though bathrooms are very small, and here is where we felt let down.  For a hotel to be taken as a Serious top end Hotel, then you cannot afford to have a sink which is cracked. Nor can you afford to have a bathroom handle door which is broken from the door.[photos attached].  There is no where to place your toiletries - especially if there is two of you - on the bench occupied by the basin. Amenities are top notch.  A light in the shower would have helped. We left early morning - 6.15am. but there was no attempt to offer us a cup of tea or coffee or juice  on departure. Breakfast for which we had paid in advance for.  So while it certainly is a fabulous location and a very good hotel; it is let down by some shoddy maintenance.",4,2016,06,10
208,Great Location & Staff,"We were booked into this hotel by our hosts. The staff was phenomenal and the hotel more than met our expectations. The rooms are spacious and the beds are fabulous. The restaurant has an adequate menu for a small hotel, and everything we ordered was very good. The location is within walking distance of almost everything with many good restaurants and pubs less than a 1/4 mi away. I will stay here again.",5,2016,06,03
208,Fantastic,"This hotel is fab and in a fantastic part of Dublin
So quiet and only 15 mins walk into town
The bar is small but the food is great
We got a fab suite 
Couldn't fault anything here , expensive but worth it",5,2016,05,31
208,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is in a perfect quiet cul de sac, which meant no city noise  !!!! And only 15 minutes walk. The staff are so helpful and taxis can be booked within 2 minutes. The breakfast is delicious and the beds really comfortable. The team at the welcome desk will organize anything for you and really want to accomodate you. I would definatly stay here again . It was like a home away from home",5,2016,05,23
208,Neither 'average' or 'very good' - somewhere in between!,"The Dylan lies in a very lovely part of Dublin, with lots of surrounding houses that are both large and beautiful. 
What makes the Dylan 'good' rather than 'very good' is that they occasionally border on too fussy, with lack of attention to simple detail. For example, frequently our bathroom condiments such as shower gel, body wash etc. were not changed each day. Our tea was also not replaced, and at one stage despite clearly using two mugs we were only given one back. It's stuff like this that is vaguely annoying (particularly with the relatively expensive cost) but often typical to hotels. 
The rooms were obviously very clean and well kept which I think warrants the hotel as getting 'very good' rather than 'average'. 
However I have to mention the significantly poor breakfast. The menu needs to be revised to offer both more complicated dishes like eggs Benedict, as well as the classics such as simply just scrambled eggs and toast. We did actually request the latter, which we were provided with but had we not it's not obviously available. The toast was then brought 10-20 minutes before our meals, meaning it had gone cold and had to be replaced. It was also, curiously, plain brown Hovis (I know it to be so because you could see the waitresses making it in the corner) which seemed a shame considering we were in Dublin, and Irish bread is so delicious. I think the waitresses were trying their best, but one or two seemed relatively incompetent. Often hotels don't spend the same amount of effort, time or money on breakfast and here this showed. 
The bar, however, was slick and professional and very enjoyable each night, and the outside heated smoking area is very civilized and very much appreciated by my smoking companion! 
The Dylan is a good alternative to the bigger hotels in Dublin, but I just really wish their breakfast was better. Little forgotten bits stop it from being excellent but it was still a very enjoyable and comfortable stay.",4,2016,05,23
208,Not good value,"I've stayed at The Dylan about once a year for the last 10 years. I'm unlikely to stay there again. To be fair Dublin was busy on the Saturday I stayed and as a result I paid ‚Ç¨307 for one night. Whereas the service used to be exceptional , I was not greeted on my arrival. Reception were friendly and efficient. My room was very small, no bath and too hot. I called reception to order a taxi to dinner but the phone didn't work. Despite calling from my mobile amd telling them they didn't fix it or make any further comment. I wrongly assumed breakfast was included. That was an additional ‚Ç¨25! To be fair it was nice and the service was good. I ordered the Sunday Times to my room on arrival. It wasn't delivered. The receptionist got it when I asked on arriving for breakfast. It is pleasant hotel but I fear it's losing its edge. The real issue is that it certainly is very very poor value for ‚Ç¨350+. For that price I think it is fair to expect everything to be quality - room, service and efficiency.",3,2016,05,22
208,perfect small(ish) hotel in dublin,"the hotel is idelly and peacefully located in ballsbridge, only a few minutes from the heart of the city. the room was spacious and well-equipped. the restaurant and bar were welcoming and pretty much perfect. the staff was helpful, informative and delightful.
thanks to all!",5,2016,05,19
208,A Dublin Gem,My sister and I stayed at The Dublin on our first trip to Dublin and Europe. We couldn't have been more pleased with our accomodations and the level of service we received. The beds were a comfortable escape from the hustle of the city and all of our sightseeing. And the turndown service with chocolates was an awesome surprise! The hotel was beautifully decorated and we especially loved the balcony outside our room. Hotel was a brief walk or cab ride to major Dublin attractions and we could easily walk to many restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!,5,2016,05,19
208,Super experience!,"Our stay at the Dylan was a truly excellent experience from start to finish!  The very welcoming reception staff on arrival, the lovely relaxing bar, fantastic food, beautiful rooms and all round decor throughout the hotel gives it a true boutique feel.

The breakfasts were exceptional - i can fully recommend the 'Full Irish'...!!

If you are looking for unique experience in Dublin, in a hotel just away from the hustle & bustle then look no further!

Thanks Dylan, for a magical weekend!!",5,2016,05,18
208,Stylish hotel in a great neighborhood,"Not in the middle of the most tourist area, but that was a positive. A short pleasant walk to Stephens Green shops and attractions. The immediate neighborhood around the hotel was quiet and upscale, with a great pub around the corner. The hotel was modern and clean, with a cool vibe. The staff was courteous and helpful.",5,2016,05,17
208,Lost for words!,"I'm struggling to find the words to describe this whimsically idiosyncratic hotel. Modernist eclecticism with a strong dash of quirkiness might fit the bill. Fantastical chairs, a padded lift, faux-marble pillars, an enormous chrome bar, enough chandeliers to light a small city, huge mirrors in outlandish frames, corridors lit by low-level red lights, books about quantitative economics in the library - Dylan has it all. But boy, does it work! This is a seriously classy hotel where everything is done with understated style and dazzling effectiveness. The beds, the bathrooms, the public facilities, the staff, the food, the ambience - all are absolutely faultless. Go to Dublin, stay at the Dylan, drink plenty of Guinness, talk to the locals, and your life will never be quite the same again. Promise!",5,2016,05,17
208,stylish room,"My friend and I stayed for 2 nights .
The room was large , comfortable and stylish bathroom well stocked and very warm 
1 straight road into the city , staff friendly and helpful.
shops , bars and restaurants close by",4,2016,04,25
208,Weekend stay,"Great staff, great interior, great food and bewerages! The staff was extremely serviceminded without being bothersome.
They had a great selection of wines, craft beer and delicious food. 
The interior design was really cool and modern and it was clean.",5,2016,04,25
208,"Lovely hotel, beware currency switching!","We had a very pleasant night in the Dylan. We booked via a Mr and Mrs Smith deal and the room was very nice. It had a little balcony over the bar courtyard but was quiet at night. Nicely decorated, bed comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and even found me some GHD straighteners to borrow.
We enjoyed our cocktails in the bar and the dinner in The Tavern. Food was of a very good quality and similar in taste and style to places we are used to in London. So not big hefty Irish platefuls of plain food ! Eat elsewhere, if that is your thing.
Location was great. Close to the lovely Georgian squares and museums.
The only sting in the hotel was at the end. The French receptionist asked me in a chatty way where we were from. She then handed me the machine to pay and I was asked for my PIN. It was not clear that she had switched to sterling until my PIN had been entered. She had not asked me directly if I wished to pay in euro or sterling as she is supposed to do. I thought this was very underhand and other guests need to be made aware of it. Management need to address this with her. It may simply have been one rogue staff member, but do be aware.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would return to this hotel next time we are in Dublin.",5,2016,04,25
208,Friendly Staff,"Stayed here four nights in room 306.  All of the staff were so very, very friendly, welcoming and warm.  Our room was spacious, very quiet, attractive, and had a very comfortable bed.  Unfortunately, the room is dimly lit.  The bathroom has a bathtub and a separate small stall shower. The towels were of a very good quality and size. Sadly, the bathroom lighting is basically non-existant. If you want to see your complexion and whether or not it has been thoroughly cleansed, if you want to be able to see the bristles of your toothbrush or if you want to apply make-up, I wish you luck...there are shadows all over and you cannot see your actual skin color or if the floor has been cleaned.  Luckily, I brought my own hair dryer which had to be plugged into an extension power cord that worked by bed side as there was no outlet to plug in the hotel's dryer.  The safe did not work two nights but someone from the desk immediately showed up to reset it.  Talk about service!  On our first morning in the dining room, we were seated next to a dark wall that must have been splashed with something white so I mentioned it at the desk and the person was very appreciative for the information.  On a subsequent visit, while being seated and passing that wall, I did notice that it had been cleaned.  The breakfast food is disappointing.  My three egg omlette with spinach, onions and cheese had maybe half an once of cheese and maybe four to six leaves of spinach and  a teaspoon or two of cooked onions...it was really just eggs and dry and quite firm, not soft.  Another day I ordered two eggs over medium and they were well done.  The toast was inedible one morning as it was burnt on one side.  Toast is served 15 minutes before your eggs arrive!  Spoiled watermelon and unripened honeydew and canteloupe  were on the buffet. Location of the hotel is pretty good.  For example, it is about a twenty minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and St. Patrick's Cathedral.",4,2016,04,23
208,Beautiful Hotel just a little out of the city,"We booked the break to Dublin with British Airways Holidays, We picked this hotel as it said it was a Mr and Mrs Smith chain hotel and wanted it to be a little special for my wife.

The hotel was quite a way out of the city, a good mile from Grafton Street and not too many transport options without getting a taxi.

We arrived at the hotel and were checked in and bags taken up to the rooms.

The rooms were a great size and decor was lovely. We had a smart TV with wifi codes just for our room. Bathroom was a nice size with both shower and bath.

Breakfast in the morning was very nice. I had the Irish breakfast the first morning and Eggs Royale the second morning, all of it was very tasty.

There were a few americans complaining about various bits in the hotel, which were not the staff's fault at all. One woman complained of a man snoring too loud. Another the noise from the bar area. We also almost ended up with someone elses room service.

The last night we had a call from room 210 as she thought we were the concierge, I wasn't to happy with her and she knew it.

All in all a great stay and a beautiful hotel. Just wish it was a little closer to the centre.",5,2016,04,21
208,A Great Visit,We stayed at Dylan our first night in Dublin.  The room was large and very comfortable.  There was a personalized greeting on the flat screen tv when we entered our room.  The staff was very helpful from the front desk too the maid service.  We really felt that they wanted to help and to make sure that we had an excellent stay.  The bar was nice with a comprehensive drink list.  The Dylan was a great way to start our visit to Ireland.,5,2016,04,19
208,Stylish hotel but not perfect,"The Dylan is a good choice for affordable luxury but the service at breakfast, lack of good sound-proofing in the rooms and the restaurant let it down a little. It's not the best location for those wanting to be right in the centre of Dublin either but it's a nice enough area.",4,2016,04,18
208,Top Class,"As a hotelier I'm always looking for that extra special element to an experience.  The Dylan has this quality in spades.  
Check-in, bedroom, restaurant, bar - start to finish our stay was exceptional.  My wife and I and our 20 month old daughter were treated as VIP's which seemed to be the happening for all the hotels customers. 
 Oscar, the Deputy GM with his attention to detail throughout dinner service, to Ronan the Kerryman in the bar, each piece of the puzzle left us feeling like royalty. 
The hotel itself, from the outside, looks subtle but inviting.  Once you enter it has a comfortable welcoming vibe that is becoming more rare in the industry.
The room was plush with beautiful furnishings and a very comfortable bed.
Dinner was outstanding to say the least.  There seemed to be a private function on in the main restaurant so what seemed to be the library lounge was converted for dinner service but still seemed very well decorated and intimate.
The bar has a great selection of beers / spirits / cocktails and the bartenders are capable of catering for all tastes.. 
All in all an outstanding experience, and could recommend the Dylan highly enough.

Keep up the good work.",5,2016,04,18
208,Great boutique hotel with excellent service!,"We had been on a 6 day tour of Southwest Ireland and were a bit tired for our trip. We were greeted by the GM at the taxi who immediately took our bags and showed us to our room. The room was outstanding! The next day the concierge showed my husband around while I got ready explaining the history of the building as well as giving him a tour of the property.  Service is top priority by all the staff. The bar was relaxing, great place to stay as a young couple or an older couple who is young at heart!",5,2016,04,17
208,Wedding Celebration,"Okay.. let me start with the positives.. Food excellent (rates as one of the best meals I have ever had) room luxurious (again rates as one of, if not the, best rooms), staff professional and friendly.. so why the average score, you may ask?

The event was not planned as agreed and was disappointing (we did not allow our disappointment detract from our celebration).  Firstly, we arranged for the private dining, instead, when we arrived, guests were informed that a section of the restaurant had been reserved for us.  Secondly, there was no sign of our contact as we arrived- and there was no sign of the welcome drinks (though we arrived at the time stated) and indeed our best man had to serve us our drinks.  Thirdly, the canopes were not served until we were about to go into eat.  Fourthly, the service at the meal was exceptionally slow- it was over 30 minutes between sitting down and the first course being served.  Fifthly, the refreshments arranged for our evening guests were not what we asked for but were changed- without any discussions with us.  Finally, its a small detail (and yet is it not the small details that distinguish an excellent service from a good one?), though they knew it was our wedding, the welcome message on the TV was to my partner only!).
Would I go back?- certainly- for the food and for the room.  But not for a special celebratory occasion... we were treated as anything but special.. and in this way the Dylan was extraordinarily 'ordinary'... and not deserving of its above average costs.  
Now in the end, the organiser had his excuses/reasons but made no attempt to acknowledge 'the miscommunication' as he described it might have taken from our experience.",3,2016,04,17
208,wonderful,"Beautiful hotel,  staff cannot do enough for you.  special mention to the Junior Manager (Stephen?) who went out of his way to organise us restaurants and taxis throughout our stay.  Our room wasn't huge but certainly big enough for a busy city break weekend.   The bed was comfy and the heating was easy to operate.  There was a well stocked mini bar and the usual tea/coffee etc. One thing we noticed throughout Dublin was not much in the way of Decaf tea.  There was decaf coffee in the room but no decaf tea - perhaps if we had of asked we could have got some but to be honest we were so busy!   We had complimentary newspapers each morning, and it was great to have a late checkout.  The hotel is just under 2miles from the centre of the city but that was perfect for a brisk walk after over eating and indulging on Guinness over our stay! Talking of drink, the Dylan has a well stocked bar that is open pretty much all of the time.   The hotel is situated in a quiet area probably the business area so no noisy vehicles or trades waking us up at early O'clock.  Free wifi and lots of tv channels too.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,16
208,Old fashioned hospitality in buotique style,"For a city hotel the most peaceful place we have ever stayed aided by the fact that it is at the end of  a cul- de- sac so no traffic noise. Everything is great , staff, food, d√©cor service and attention to detail. Have already recommended it to others and will return.",5,2016,04,13
208,Best hotel we have stayed in,Beautiful modern hotel. Staff were more than obliging and went over and above what you would expect. After a late tour cancellation Gabriela planned a day for us with the limited time that we had. After a taxi didn't show Martin went out to the Main Street in the rain and came riding in the passenger seat of a taxi he hailed. Bed was very comfortable and the layout of the room was great and very spacious. Definitely recommend this hotel. ,5,2016,04,12
208,Super Chic Hotel,"The Dylan is a great addition to Dublins hotels. We stayed for two nights on a leisure stay. It has the most stunning, chic decor and spacious rooms with Italian marble bathrooms. It is a quintessential 5-star boutique hotel, full of unique style and art pieces.  Dylan is located out of the inner city centre but still very close it.

Great I.T with Bose iPod docking stations loaded with historic Dublin walking tours - great touch. Also the beds are luxurious,  linens and terry are great quality. 

The bedrooms are very spacious and are individually designed and boast opulent furnishings and memory foam mattresses. Professional hairdryers and foot spas are available on request.

Great food also the Dylan's restaurant. Tavern serves gourmet bistro / contemporary fine dining styled cuisine using the finest of Irish ingredients.

All in all a great experience, all the team there are so professional and friendly. .... well done to all. I'd love to return.",5,2016,04,04
208,Valentine's weekend,"Nice hotel situated about 15min walk from St Stephens green. Staff were really nice and cocktails excellent.
Rooms were nice but breakfast was really disappointing and not worth the money.
Outside bar/smoking area is great.
Would expect proper coffee machine in this sort of room and a bigger tv. The mirrors everywhere are just a bit too much in a room this size.
",4,2016,03,29
208,"Service excellent, rooms very small","We stayed at the Dylan for 3 nights on the Easter weekend. The warm and friendly welcome is one of a kind and so is the overall service. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was very good, tasty, varied but also expensive.
The room had a very comfortable bed, was nicely decorated but very, very small. I also never saw such a small bathroom and I travel quite a bit. You can barely move or towel yourself off after having showered.  Even the bathrooms in 2* budget hotels like Ibis or MotelOne are larger. For a 5* hotel like the Dylan I would have expected more space and at least some shelves to put on our toiletries.
The hotel has no gym, no pool and no sauna but offers complimentaey access to s public gym nearby (which was closed most of the times we walked by).
The Dylan is a 15-20 Min walk to downtown Dublin or a ‚Ç¨ 10 cab ride.",4,2016,03,27
208,A March visit,Difficult to fault really. Maybe a little further to walk into the more central sights but what you gain is a beautiful hotel in peaceful location. Staff were helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommended.,5,2016,03,17
208,"Fabulous!  Great location, wonderful staff, gorgeous and stylish..","Just spent 6 nights here and it was outstanding!  The rooms and public spaces are stylish and comfortable.  Our room was large and comfortable, with a quaint balcony.  The location is close to the bus routes and DART (train) as well as walkable to the City Centre.  The best part of the Dylan, by far, was the wonderful, wonderful staff.  We felt like family, as they helped us with big and small things.  In particular, Fiona was fabulous, as well as every single member of the staff.  Thanks for a great vacation!  We will be back!",5,2016,03,12
208,Achingly stylish with excellent staff,"The Dylan Hotel is in a quiet square off Baggot Street, beyond Dublin's Grand Canal.  It is styled and stylish to your very fingertips (literally - even the door handles are stylish) but also comfortable.  This was true about the public areas, inside and out, as well as our room and so we could make ourselves comfortable whether we wanted peaceful privacy in our room, eat in the restaurant or have a drink in the bar or library (albeit the library tends to get booked for private functions).

Our room was a ""style"" room (there's a theme) which was huge. The bed was comfortable and the furniture was well designed and chosen - not only did it look good it also worked for whatever it was meant to be doing.  In the bathroom, there was no bath but the shower was also spacious with both overhead and side-jets and, again, it worked well with good water pressure and easy controllability.  The toiletries were nice and the towels exceptionally soft.  The bathroom was however too small - it was not comfortable or even practical for two people to use it at the same time (even slender people) and the lighting was dim.  Soft lighting may be flattering but it is the opposite of what you need in the bathroom.

All of this is an important part of the experience of staying in the hotel but what really makes the difference is the staff and service.  They were, without exception, excellent.  The service achieved friendliness and personality without impertinence and efficiency without sacrificing the charm. This was tested for us when there was something that was not quite right.  The heating in our room did not work when we arrived on a chilly day in February but the problem was acknowledged immediately and we were given immediately a temporary heater whilst the problem was fixed and then, without having to ask, kept informed about progress with fixing the problem. It's dealing with problems that show how good service really is and this was.

As for the restaurant, we only ate breakfast there but, again, it is definitely to be recommended - other reviews have commented on that. 

The Dylan's location is pleasant but is a substantial walk away from Dublin's Visitor Central (St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar etc).  We were fortunate that we enjoy walking, the weather was dry (for four consecutive days!) and we were not in a hurry.  If any of those conditions were not satisfied there might be a problem.  Reception will, of course, always call you a taxi but Dublin traffic means that this is not always a great solution and there's a cost too.

Overall, a lovely place to stay but bear in mind the location.",4,2016,03,03
208,Beautiful hotel,"We have just returned from a two night stay at this beautiful hotel. Our room was very modern clean and had everything that we needed
All the staff we came across were lovely very friendly and welcoming especially the front of house team 
We did not eat at the hotel but would imagine the food is excellent, we did sample a couple of cocktails thro in the lovely relaxing bar which were very good and reasonably priced , will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family when visiting Dublin",5,2016,03,03
208,Beautiful Hotel ,"I really can't recommend this hotel enough! Beautiful hotel with the best service I have ever had, very friendly staff that cannot do enough for you. They also make a amazing Cosmopolitan in the extremely chic bar. The decor of the hotel will impress the fussiest of travelers, ie me! ",5,2016,02,29
208,Delightful Dylan,Although not in the centre was actually nice to be slightly further away with nice bars and places to eat nearby once you've done Dublin during the day . The hotel is lovely and drinks in the bar make you wonder if the trip back into town is worth it ... Could be getting old but a lovely stay for couples who have done Dublin before x,5,2016,02,22
208,Delightful Dylan,"I'm very lucky to get to travel lots, see lots of beautiful places and stay in a range of hotels. I don't have a 5 star pocket, but recently I was able to stay at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin as a special treat. 
We were only there 1 night which was a real shame as this is a beautiful hotel. Check in was smooth and the staff was polite and friendly. Our room was on the top floor of the hotel and had gorgeous arc shaped window with plantation blinds on, which are great for real darkness, a plus when my partner is a really light sleeper.... 
The floor in the bathroom was heated, a real treat, the bath products of a high quality. The hairdryer - HAD A NOZZLE!!!!! Omg goodness why do hotels think a hairdryer with no nozzle is an acceptable piece of equipment for ladies to dry their hair with? Plus, it was a professional hairdryer too, none of this cheap, almost holiday hairdryers you usually get. My sisters room also had an iPod and docking station which was pre filled with music...Very classy. 
Breakfast - now I'm no food critic but I know a good brekkie when I see one.... A good brekkie consists of NO food under grill lights, drying out and being touched by hundreds of patrons!!! NO NO NO!!! .
This did not disappoint. There was a menu, i.e cooked to order, which to my delight, included Eggs Benedict, Eggs Florentine and Eggs Royale. Clearly I'm an eggs benedict girl, but this is not an easy dish to perfect. The eggs need to be runny, the hollandaise needs to have just the perfect amount of acidity, and to my delight this had all of the above. 
The buffet table had gorgeous breads, fresh fruit and cereals, as well as juice. The full irish breakfast also hit the spot for my brother in law and partner, as did the pancakes and accompaniments my sister choose. So all in all a good start to the day. 
This hotel is lovely, understated elegance with a hint of glamour, I would recommend it to anyone... Put it on your list!!",5,2016,02,15
208,"Beautiful hotel, discreet & excellent service!","This hotel is tucked away in a residential area. Excellent service and in particular the team on the front desk and in the restaurant at breakfast and during the day. The food is excellent and is a brilliant place for meetings and coffee.
The only negative and it is very minor....in the rooms it is just the standard kettle and instant coffee even coffee filters would be an improvement and a step up.

But all-in-all a lovely stay and a real gem!",5,2016,02,14
208,Five Star!,"My husband & I went for a meal in the Tavern restaurant recently.  It was our first visit and hopefully it won't be our last,  We had a voucher for a 3 course meal with wine which was excellent value. The staff were both friendly and professional.  The food was simply top class, we both had ribeye steaks which were cooked to exactly to way each of us liked (both different).  We are keen foodies and are sometimes disappointed in restaurants but were delighted with each course here.  High fives all round!",5,2016,02,09
208,Perfect!,"Booked this hotel even though it as a little more out of the way than we would have liked and it was worth every penny. Beautiful hotel, room were amazing and staff were all that you would  expect. Clean, tidy, beautiful pieces of furniture. We got a taxi to and from the airport and walked while here. 20 min walk up to temple bar which is easy enough sober or drunk! Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2016,01,26
208,Absolutely perfect! ,"My partner, family and I stayed in The Dylan in December 2015.  It had been on my bucket list for a long time.  We were celebrating a special event so decided this beautiful boutique hotel was ideal.
From the moment we pulled up outside to the moment we left the next afternoon, everything was perfect. 
Receptionist who greeted us was so friendly, chatty and professional with the perfect mix of discretion thrown in. I got upgraded to a gorgeous suite too...really lovely touch.
Location ideal Base for Ballsbridge. So quiet. Parking is worth the cost. Hotel appearance is that of a large townhouse. Not ostentatious at all. 
Interior is amazing, the perfect combination of modern and classic with lots of quirky details thrown in.
Suite was really big considering the constraints of this old building. Overlooked the private gardens. 
Lunch in bar was a great experience too...lovely atmosphere and very attentive staff. Their appearance blends in perfectly with the surroundings.
We did not have dinner in the hotel but returned after dinner for drinks. We were so well looked we did not want to leave! Reception also did not ring the next morning to vacate room...we were given the freedom to leave later. Again a really lovely touch. 
All the staff in the Dylan...Thank you for making my special day even more special. We will be back but am definitely staying for two nights next time. Keep up the fantastic work. ",5,2016,01,21
208,Perfect Hospitality ,"I've stayed here a few times now. Each has been perfect. Feels so homely and welcoming. The staff are lovely. Great bar and wine list. Glasses are top drawer. The rooms have everything you need and such good quality. What else can I say, best in Dublin. ",5,2016,01,18
208,Amazing experience,"We got married in the Dylan in December 2014 and that day was simply wonderful. So we went back for a night in November 2015 and we were treated once again like royalty. The staff treat you like a friend and go out of their way to make your stay the most enjoyable it can be. Beautiful hotel, great food and excellent service start to finish. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,01,14
208,Love this boutique hotel!,"What can I say, one of our favourite places in Dublin. Charming hotel with great service and excellent friendly staff. You feel at home,the food is great, great bar and good location. The staff are warm and friendly and they so great with kids!",5,2016,01,13
208,Loved the Dylan!,"We stayed for a long weekend and loved every aspect. We arrived early and were fortunate to be able to check in, which was great as we were tired from a mega early flight. Our room was beautiful and super-clean, a really nice touch to have fresh milk in the fridge for tea/coffee - makes such a difference. Only minor niggle was the quality of the pillows compared to everything else, they were thin and not particularly comfortable.

We stayed room only, but had brunch on both mornings of our stay and it was absolutely delicious and great value. The bar also make a mean Bloody Mary with a lager shot! :)

All the areas of the hotel are really well styled and also comfortable and the location itself is in a lovely area of Dublin, loads of stunning Georgian houses. It's about a 20 minute walk to the centre of the city, but there are plenty of pubs, restaurants and shops nearby.

Lastly all the staff must get a mention. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, they couldn't do enough for us - thank you for having us to stay and we hope to be back!",5,2016,01,11
208,Great hotel,"Loved this place - great boutique hotel.

All the public areas are very boutique and the service was great - very 5 star.  Enjoyed the food and drinks here.

There is about a 20 minute walk into central Dublin which was great on a nice day.

The room was very nice - a little less boutique and more standard but great furnishings and very clean with some good amenities.

Will definitely be back!",5,2016,01,10
208,Excellent - but not cheap,"We stayed for one night with our Labrador. There was even a dog bed and water provided in the room of this pet friendly hotel!
The decoration and furnishings are fabulous, the staff are helpful and attentive - and the food was very good.
Its not cheap, but as they say, 'you get what you pay for'. (Usually).
We would go back.",5,2016,01,04
208,Excellent from start to end,"we had a three night stay here in late November. The staff were all very professional and focused on making our stay comfortable. The bed was possibly the best we ever slept in (praise indeed) and the breakfasts were delicious.

We ate in the restaurant one evening. This did not hit quite the same standard but this is a small quibble.",5,2015,12,24
208,Fine Establishment,"We stayed at the Dylan for a weekend recently.  It is a lovely hotel and worthy of its 5 star status.  The bar, dining and outdoor area (smoking) are relaxing and very well furnished.  The staff were all excellent, from reception to waiting staff.  We ate in the bar on one night and the food was excellent.  The breakfast was also excellent.  Our room was a little on the small side, which appears to be the norm for ""boutique"" hotels.  We also thought 20 euros per night for parking was extravagant.",5,2015,12,21
208,Excellent service and truly a 5 star hotel ,"Stayed for 3 nights from the 30/11/15. 
Excellent stay. 
Arrived early 10.30am and they checked us in straight away which was so helpful. 
Room was immaculate and the quality is truly 5 star !!!
Shower and bath super clean. 
The staff where fantastic, from reception , concierge , restaurant thank you to you all. 
Highly professional and nothing was a problem. 
Breakfast is again 5 star with very good quality local produced used. 
10 minutes walk and you are in the heart of Dublin City, 
Will most definitely stay there again. ",5,2015,12,19
208,Spent one night,"The staff were very friendly, professional and the room itself was fantastic. The layout of the room was very nice with a large mirror, table, mini-fridge, pretty much all you could need for a one night stay. The bed was very comfortable and the heated floor in the bathroom was a very nice surprise too. Absolutely no issues.",5,2015,12,16
208,Weekend break,"The Dylan Hotel was a perfect base to enable us to explore Dublin. The village type atmosphere just up the road from the hotel is great for a quick drink , browse and slow Sunday morning breakfast .Thank you to Head Concierge Marcin Worek who was surperb in his role.",5,2015,12,15
208,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"I visited the Dylan on a Saturday afternoon for afternoon tea with my mum. The staff were unfailingly helpful and friendly, offering us fresh pots of tea and even turning down the heating for us. I had never eaten at The Dylan before but was a little disappointed to be seated in the dining room which was quite empty after seeing the lovely tables in the lounge. However once we were seated we thought no more of it as the food and service were excellent. A really enjoyable afternoon.",4,2015,12,15
208,outstanding,"This hotel has thought of everything, down to the little touches like having umberellas to use to having fresh milk for your tea and coffee in your room. The staff couldn't do enough, food was amazing, breakfast in particular. Only advice I would give is unless weather is really bad dont order a taxi into the centre, walk it, its much quicker and easier. Taxis take forever to come and with one way systems and volume of traffic at weekends it takes about half an hr to get into centre where as if you walk its 15 mins tops. Would most definitely recommend this hotel...........outstanding",5,2015,12,10
208,Lovely 5* Star Quirky Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"Spent one night in the Dylan. Very Christmassy, staff were helpful and friendly but not too over friendly
Free upgrade on arrival to a lovely spacious room with a nice bathroom. 
Decent mini bar with lots of choice. 
There were Christmas parties downstairs but we couldn't hear anything.
The bar is funky and it's a lovely trendy hotel. 
It's in Ballsbridge so a 20 minute walk to St Stephen's Green for ‚Ç¨10 max in a cab
There are plenty of shops round the corner to go and get breakfast if you don't have it in the hotel",4,2015,12,09
208,Don't go here if you would like a night sleep,"I stayed here at the weekend with my mother.the hotel is modern and decorared in a very modetn fashion.it was clean and front of house staff welcoming.whilst there were some positives to note
-large bedroom which was comfortable and warm
-comfortable bed
- fresh milk for tea/coffee in room
-nice breakfast
-turndown 

The overwhelming issue related to noise which lead to a night of little sleep. Firstly our room was over the beer garden which was extremely loud.when this eventually stopped the other residents seemed to run rampage outside our room until 5am.banging doors,singing etc...attempts to ring reception lead to no answer.the following morning when we went to reception to tell them,whilst the staff did apologise,they didn't seem at all surprised.a cup of tea was the only retribution offered.given the price we paid for the room this was entirely un satisfactory.

Also it is a bit out if the way.particularly if you want to head north side (jervis/illac)to go shopping. 

We are frequent visitors to dublin and usually stay at the shelbourne where we never have a complaint to make but decided to try the dylan for a change.we are very disappointed and we will not be returning here.",2,2015,12,08
208,Great staff,"Beautiful hotel with great front desk staff. Only issue was table space in the bar, they hold lots of events and we couldn't get a table to have a drink, hotel guests were given no priority over visitors

208,really good hotel especially for business trips,"I have stayed at this hotel in october for the weekend. as a business travel consultant i highly recommend this hotel - not only for the quality of services provided but for the location that it has - 10 mins walk from Dublin city centre.
the rooms are really spacious,elegant and the area is quiet. I had breakfast included and can say the food was lovely - a mix of everything.
Highly recommended!

Madalina Woods",5,2015,12,02
208,Okay but feels overpriced ,Had a very pleasant stay in this hotel. The common areas and lobby are beautiful and creatively decorated. The rooms are pretty average. Location is a little bit off the beaten track so be prepared for a bit of a walk if you want to go out. Hotel bar has delicious cocktails but you'll likely be one of the only customers. Breakfast ok but nothing special. Had a good stay here but would not go back or recommend to anyone. ,3,2015,11,29
208,Truly stunning!,"I've had the great fortune to stay in some of the finest hotels across Europe and the States. But I can honestly say we have never enjoyed any of them as much as my time in the Dylan, Dublin. It's effortlessly chic, √ºber cool without having to try too hard and just about the most chilled-out place in the city. But what makes the Dylan that extra special are the team that run it. They make you feel like an old friend; nothing is too much trouble and there is a genuine warmth that you you just can't fake. Thanks to Oscar and team for making our stay so welcoming and memorable. Here's to the Dylan, our new 'home' in Dublin!",5,2015,11,29
208,Business Trip - An elegant boutique hotel.,I recently stayed at the Dylan for 2 nights as I was on a business trip. I know the and the Dylan quite well as I used to live across the road.  I had a nice welcome and as my room was not ready I ended up with an upgrade to one of their style rooms on the 3rd floor.  The room was lovely - nice bed - an area to sit and read and an area to work from.  The hotel is boutique-ish but not in an in your face way so I think it does suit a business traveller!  The receptionist was lovely and the doormen were very helpful and friendly.  My only complaint (small one) was the lack of attention from the bar staff on my second night.  It seems that they were all caught up in a customer's story and ignored the other tables for a little while - which included me and the bar was quiet!  These things happen and it wouldn't put me off going again!  Great area for restaurants - if you like crazy pizza's - go to Millers Pizza Kitchen around the corner.  I also discovered a lovely cake place called Eathos - when you look in the window you literally want to eat everything!!,4,2015,11,27
208,Very funky and modern hotel!,"I stayed here on a Friday night, the rooms are very unique - Really modern with a funky twist (record player and old records ect), excellent view, comfortable bed, excellent staff. Lovely roof top bar.",5,2015,11,22
208,"Superb service, staff, style and atmosphere","Stayed for two nights on a business/leisure break. From the moment of check in to leaving everything was perfect.  We had a fabulous room, bed very comfortable, excellent bathrooms and facilities.
The staff are so friendly and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble, the standard of food in the restaurant 'Tavern' is superb and the variety of cocktails is amazing in the Dylan bar.
I would highly recommend staying here as Dylan offers a quirky, stylish and funky atmosphere with mood lighting, wonderful interior design and comfortable statement furniture in the lounge/bar areas.
Excellent Boutique Hotel overall a great experience - we will return.",5,2015,11,11
208,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Stayed in hotel in November 2012 for one night only to celebrate my wife's birthday.
Great Boutique Hotel and what is important for me- pet friendly hotel. Close to city centre. Hotel and rooms are very modern and spotless. 
Hotel is great for romantic getaways and for someone who is looking for  5 star luxury pet friendly hotel in Dublin City",5,2015,11,08
208,Not too bad.. nice location,"Friendly staff. neat, tidy and clean. The room was a good size, but a bit of a trek up a lift and through a few corridors (up and down steps). The location is a good 20min (or so walk to the city), but there is a good strip of shops, restaurants, cafes and a tesco just around the corner. probably a tad overpriced, would would probably still recommend.",4,2015,10,25
208,Lots of tweaking needed,"We arrived here for one night and then travelled to western Ireland for a few days then returned for 4 nights.  On arrival both times Reception was organised & proficent in settling us in, & attended to quibbles we had with the room's towel warmer that would not warm in the bathroom & later the malfunctioning plug in the bathroom sink. 

The style of the hotel is best described as an awkward eclecticism that marries faux provincial French with Adams family gothicism. Though not my taste, it is redeemed by very clean & comfortable rooms, though somewhat cramped bathrooms that leave little room to hold toiletries. 

We had a few drinks at the bar & found the cocktail bar person could make a standard martini which was a real positive in a city that from 5 days experience in many bars yielded little expertise in making this classic cocktail. 

Breakfast however was a real disappointment. For the price charged it was sub standard.  There was no barista training evident in the coffee making & the food for the main lacked flair & imagination. However, the naturally squeezed juices were a redeeming feature. We sought breakfast away from the hotel in the nearby street. 

All in all a mixed review. It's a comfortable hotel in a great location but they should be doing better.",3,2015,10,21
208,"Brilliant hotel, friendly staff",Room was spotlessly clean - as was the bathroom. The room was very spacious and everything was well appointed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and certainly hope to stay again. Breakfast was brilliant. ,5,2015,10,11
208,really good boutiquesque hotel,"10 mins walk from the city center. This hotel is a good little place tucked away in a nice part of town which seems on the edge between city center and a plush residential area. There are some bars and restaurants close by but the main action is a 10-15 min walk. The room was very nice, bed comfy, etc. Breakfast was a la carte - i had the 'full irish' which was great. there is also a buffet continental breakfast - the chocolate pastry was tasty",5,2015,10,06
208,Boutique Experience,"We loved the Dylan for its aesthetics and boutique feel but it does lack 'Irish warmth' we had hoped for. Beautiful furnishings and lovely, attentive team. Quiet location an easy walk to the city and sites with a selection of good pubs and restaurants nearby. ",4,2015,10,03
208,Really liked this place - personality!,"Lots to like about this hotel.

I was here on business with lots of colleagues - we may have had a few drinkies too many...  One of my colleagues was discovered at 3am asleep in the corridor (having lost his room key) by another colleague who had ALSO lost his room key and was being let in by a member of staff.  The staff member acted as though he didn't see the sleeping individual, not a second glance, almost as if it happened all the time.... Maybe it does?!

The rooms have a ""Malmaison"" vibe to them - lots of leather.  Indeed, the lift is lined with red leather....

Breakfast was absolutely lovely - cooked to order.  However, it wasn't the fastest of service as a result - so make allowances, or miss out!

Really liked this place.

if you found this review useful, please like!",5,2015,10,03
208,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"Would highly recommend. The staff, in particular reception, were fantastic. Breakfast fantastic, room lovely and spacious (experience room) and ideal location for those who like a little walk after a drink or meal. Takes around 20 minutes to walk to Grafton Street however there are other things, bar, restaurants, shops much closer if needed. They could not help enough and let us check in around 11:00 as we arrived early just to drop our bags off. One of VERY FEW hotels we would go back to.",5,2015,09,30
208,Overbooked and bumped !,"After a long day of meetings , I arrived at the hotel at around 8pm to be told that they had over booked/ over sold the hotel and there was no room for me! This is amazing because I had booked and paid for the room over 10 days ago through a travel website. The Dylan proceeded to book me into another hotel for the night thinking that this acceptable. It's not, I had to reschedule the meetings I had planned at the hotel also. It seems that greed has gotten the better of reservations team and this is not at all what I would expect from a hotel of this standing. They could have gotten in contact with me to let me know they were planning this ? Unprofessional and I will be avoiding this outfit in the future. I would be careful about booking with the Dylan if you want a guaranteed room.",1,2015,09,30
208,Lovely boutique hotel,"The Dylan is a quirky friendly place. Staff can't do enough to help and the rooms are nicely equipped and comfortable. It is also in a great location for restaurants and shops but tucked away so it's on a quiet street.
The only complaint I really have is the lack of gym facilities. Whilst they have an arrangement with the gym next door, guests can only use the cardio machines and none of the weights.",4,2015,09,28
208,Great for a short break,"We only stayed one night so my review is restricted to room, sleep, service and breakfast quality.
The rooms are large and spacious, modern decor, good sized clean, modern bathrooms and a well stocked mini-bar.
The rooms are well lit but we found the rest of the hotel a little dark.
Service was fine, efficient perhaps to the point of being a little unfriendly.
The a la carte breakfast items were good but the buffet was a little sad, although we did eat late, but it's always annoying when hotels serving buffet breakfast don't bother restocking for the late comers....
Good location, walkable into town for night out",4,2015,09,27
208,Baggot Street Hospital Class of '85 Reunion,"We held our 30 year reunion in the Dylan Hotel and chose this venue because the original Victorian part of the hotel was formerly the Nurses' Home, where we had to reside as students in our first year. Conor Dillon, Director of Rooms was superb in the planning of this reunion and everything was superbly executed, down to the smallest detail.  The bedrooms were very comfortable,  our meeting area was set out very nicely and the library, which was laid out very beautifully, provided a lovely intimate setting for our reunion dinner. Conor Dillon even found a photo of the former Baggot Street Hospital Nurses Badge and placed it on the front of the dinner menu, providing a copy for each of us to keep as a memento.   All the staff on duty during our stay were so welcoming and helpful, in particular Conor, as well as Fiona Murphy, who was on duty at reception as we arrived and the following morning.
The coctails were very good, dinner was delicious and we concluded with freshly made breakfast together the following morning. A big ""thank you"" to Conor, Fiona and all the staff of the Dylan for exceedling my expectations and I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.  We all were so pleased that we have decided to make this reunion a more regular event and will definately be returning to the Dylan!! 

Mary and 11 former classmates",5,2015,09,22
208,Great for a Romantic getaway,"My partner booked this place through Mr & Mrs Smith, it wasn't too far from the city centre and we could walk there in 20 minutes or get the bus. The hotel was lovely, very boutique-y which i loved. The room was amazing, much better than i had expected, and with a little balcony as well which overlooked the back terrace (unfortunately it was a bit cold to be sat outside on there to chill) We had breakfast included which was well worth it, and it was really good (as was the cheeky prosecco we had as well!). The staff were really friendly and attentive as well. We had drinks at the hotel bar one night and sat outside, i would recommend having a drink at least before you head out elsewhere too.",5,2015,09,20
208,Baggot St Hospital class of 85 reunion,"The class of 85 held a reunion in  our old  Victorian ' nurses home ' a place we spent 18 months of our formative years , now the Dylan hotel. It was an amazing experience in all respects. The staff ,particularly Fiona the receptionist treated us like VIPs, and made us feel at home instantly. The environment ,food and staff made the event very special. The wifi proved a bit convoluted to connect to but wasn't a deal breaker ! Beds were comfy and products were  luxurious & plentiful. Cocktails were especially delicious and food was really fresh ,well cooked and tantalisingly presented.",5,2015,09,20
208,SHORT STAYPRESENT for my 70th Birthday,"My wife & I stayed at the Dylan for three nights in April 2015. The hotel was quite spectacularly decorated, with vivid colours and many mirrors. The staff were fantastic, all very friiendly and helpful, we were made very welcome  and although we arrived earlier than we should have, they couldn't do enough for us. The room was excellent and facilities great, Breakfast was what ever you wanted with enough choices to please anyone. The food was great. Although our visit was a deal arranged as a present by both my sons & their wives, we enjoyed it so much we would like to think that we could go back for another visit in the not too distant future. I would certainly recommend the Dylan Hotel to anyone as a fantastic experience and well worth having - Steve Bird",5,2015,09,16
208,"Crazy decor, great service, a bit far from the city center, fabulous breakfast","The Dylan Hotel looks like it was decorated after the designer dropped acid.  The Dylan is located in such a pretty little neighborhood with traditional Georgian-style architecture. My sense is that they could have moved in a different direction with the decor blending in with the traditional style of the neighborhood. 
     The staff was really fantastic.  Every person was attentive and nothing was a problem.  The people in Ireland are all so nice and super friendly; it's quite amazing actually.  We were treated very well.
    The Dylan is a little off-the-beaten-path, so the location may or may not work for you depending on your itinerary.  For me, it was my first time in Dublin so I would have preferred to be closer to the city center, but in the end, it wasn't a big deal.   It was a short cab ride or a long walk and the Dylan is located on a pretty little street.  
     Breakfast was included in our stay and the food was excellent.  There was fresh-squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit, fresh breads, porridge, and eggs prepared any way you like them and sausages.   I stayed a few days so I pretty much had everything that I mentioned above and it was all really delicious, outstanding really.  
     Overall, I would recommend staying at the Dylan if the location works for you.",4,2015,09,16
208,Rock and Roll half marathon ,"My husband booked the Dylan for 1 night. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room and the lovely balcony.
The room was in a quiet location with tea and coffee facilities. The room was expensive with no breakfast included.
With flights from the UK this was a very expensive overnight stay. This was probably due to it being a bank holiday weekend.
I would love to return to the Dylan and maybe a special price with breakfast included.
Baljit.K.Watson ",5,2015,09,15
208,Such charming staff,"From the moment we arrived at this boutique hotel, we were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble for the charming and attentive staff. The quiet location suited us well as it is well aways from the city's lively and noisy nightlife district. As this hotel is within an old converted building, our room was spacious and well furnished but with very limited natural light due to its tiny and oddly positioned windows. The bar was lively, the food good and breakfast was adequate, although chef needs to work a bit on how to prepare his eggs.",5,2015,09,10
208,LOVE the Dylan,"Our stay was superb, the hotel is stunning and the rooms luxurious. The staff were faultless and incredibly helpful. 

Only slight downside is the location, although Dublin isn't a large city the Dylan is perhaps slightly off the beaten track. It's almost a double edged sword as it's wonderfully quiet but walking to the centre is a trudge at about 20mins. We don't mind using taxis but when on holiday we'd rather walk to soak up where we are, but on a short visit it just took too much of our time. 

Don't let this put you off though, a stay here is truly lovely and not to be missed! ",5,2015,09,06
208,Divine Dylan,"We could not recommend the Dylan Hotel more it is the best hotel we have stayed in. From the welcoming staff to the most delicious meals. I had been looking at the Dylan for a while, then came the perfect excuse to visit for my husbands 50th Birthday. We arrived quite early in the day so our room wasn't ready, dropped the bags at the hotel and went for an Irish Breakfast in the town centre which is around 20 mins walk away. We had a good explore of the town and walked about 5 or 6 miles round all the streets. Then headed back the hotel around 2pm and our room was ready so we collapsed in bed. We'd been up very early in the day to fly over to Dublin so we both slept well and when we woke it was 8.30pm !! As we'd had a good walk round the town in the day we decided to stay and eat in the hotel and what a good choice that was.
The Tavern Restaurant was so accommodating, we sat and had a drink on the terrace at the back while we looked at the menu, which I have to say is not extensive, however having tasted the quality of food there is a reason for that. When you are making such good quality you do not need that much choice.. 
We asked for some bread and oils which was so light and tasty then were brought out a sample of the the crab meat with citrus fruit, compressed melon & pumpkin seeds - WOW. 
Our meal started with the Tomato & Basil soup which was served with such care and attention by the young lady that looked after us. For our main we decided on was the Salt baked Sea Bass for 2 with lemon creamed potatoes, broccoli & smoked almonds. This fish was so tasty & flavoursome, before we ate we were told that as it is cooked in a sea salt crust it may be a little salty to the palate but this was not the case the baking in sea salt just enhanced all the white meat of the fish. All the food at this meal was so good we actually could not manage any dessert though on seeing the desserts brought to other dinners they looked delicious. 
The next day we decided to venture into Dublin rather than have breakfast at the hotel and had a day of drinking - well when in Ireland it would be impolite not too !!
On our final day at the Dylan we did go down to breakfast. Again what a treat, the fresh fruit buffet with the yogurt pots was divine, mine was followed by scrambled egg with smoked salmon and my husband had the Eggs Benedict, then some toast.
Why oh why we had even bothered to try anywhere else for food when The Dylan has such good quality and lovely staff, I would say was our only regret about our trip to Dublin that we did not enjoy this brilliant hotel more and stay more local. Going into Temple Bar area and the main town drinks and food etc are actually more expensive and nowhere near as good quality.",5,2015,09,04
208,Different from all the rest,Stayed here on a weekend break. Really quite different from the usual city centre hotels. Quiet location yet  only a short walk to the city centre. Friendly and helpful staff. Very nice and spacious rooms. Really good breakfasts. What more do you need. Well worth a visit and a place I will go back to.,4,2015,09,03
208,Impressed,Beautiful hotel is a quiet leafy area. The staff were really friendly and we had a top class room. Couldn't have asked for more in terms of attention to detail and comfort.  Would definitely recommend.,5,2015,08,31
208,One Night at the Dylan,Allan and Steve are good hosts and gave us great suggestions on sights and restaurants. The hotel is located in a nice section of Dublin near a residential area. It's a nice walk up Baggott to where all of the action is in City Centre.,4,2015,08,27
208,Quirky haven,Found this by happy accident. I love Art Deco and this hotel has no shortage of that. The room was large and well appointed. Hotel is in a cul de sac so a quiet little nook conveniently located for the Docklands but not to far from the centre either. Service was good but disappointing to find the restaurant closed on Monday night which meant limited choice if one wishes to dine in. Prawn salad was good though presentation a bit rustic. Breakfast better. Good service from the staff especially Marcin. Would be very happy to stay here again. ,4,2015,08,26
208,Lovely place in Dublin,"I was not sure what to expect of this place based on the trip advisor and web site photos, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a beautiful building. It is in a good location and easy to navigate. We found a parking spot for the evening right out front, and did not have to pay for it - albeit we left at 8:00am.

The room was spacious, clean and bright. The staff were friendly and helpful. I loved the hotel and would certainly stay here again if I am in Dublin. Sadly, we did not eat or drink here so I can't comment on the restaurant, but it looked elegant and inviting.",5,2015,08,25
208,Tiny tiny bathroom,"Small boutique hotel. Stayed here on a hen party. Room was small. Bathroom was tiny. Smallest hotel bathroom I have ever stayed in. Service was good. Private dining was excellent. Food wonderful. Valet parking was good. Location quite good, although difficult hotel to find. Would rate it a four star hotel. Probably wouldn't stay again unless I got a very good rate for a larger room.",4,2015,08,24
208,Dylan hotel ,"Absolutely fantastic hotel. The decor is unique and quite unlike any other hotel I've stayed in. Had a room with a balcony. All the staff were wonderful and they could not be more accommodating and helpful.
We will be back for sure and most definitely it will be sooner than later.

",5,2015,08,24
208,quiet location just minutes from the centre of the city,"just home from a stay at the Dylan hotel.  wanted a location good for the aviva stadium and croke park and the city centre, and found that the Dylan was perfectly located for everything.  Our first room was by the lift, and we wanted to be further away although we were assured there would be no noise, and were accommodated immediately.  We were shown two other room option and allowed to take out pick - great customer service.  Breakfast from the buffet was great, and the a la carte options were also top notch, however the service at breakfast was disappointingly slow.  Not so in the evenings when the restaurant is transformed and the food glorious.  We even got back late one night and ordered desert from the room service menu in the bar with some late night drinks and the presentation could not be faulted.  A great location, good food, quiet hotel yet only 15 minutes to St Stephens Green, will be back again and again.",5,2015,08,23
208,Not what one expects from a 5-Star,"What I liked: Lovely neighbourhood. Lovely breakfast. Quality drinks at bar. I was disappointed with: The welcome... it was cool at best, had to drag my bags in from taxi on rainy evening after long flight, decor is dated, room was average particularly disappointed with bed linens, they were not the quality 5 star linens I would expect also there was some kind of nylon /poly pillows and mattress padding which didn't help matters. Room layout was odd...our room had a patio with 2 chairs and table but it was a forced addition to the room and weirdly placed. We had requested a wake up call and did not get it. After travelling for a couple of weeks in Morocco, France, Spain and Portugal and staying in 5 Star hotels regretfully this was at the bottom of that list. It needs some TLC and/or a re-do!",3,2015,08,22
208,Interesting and comfortable,"A boutique hotel that has a feel of difference.  Its small (so some 5 star amenities are not there - swimming pool for one), but also more intimate.  Staff know you very quickly and interact with you as a person - not a corporate customer type thing.
Service is friendly - but sometimes odd and can feel a bit untrained (Please sign for your drink....no pen offered/I switched on the heater above your head - when it was a warm evening and was never asked.....)  Overall I quite like the relaxed nature of it, but it could improve.
Food in bar and restaurant is good and better than most hotel kitchens.  More standard fare than anything novel - but that's fine for me.

One gripe is the mad doorhandles which are an ergonomic nightmare....",4,2015,08,06
208,Outstanding Hotel,"The Dylan Hotel was the first stop on a two week trip with family to Ireland and a couple of other countries.  To be candid, the outstanding experience we had at the Dylan ruined us for the rest of the trip. We stayed for two nights and overall this was a great place to stay.  The welcome by the staff on checkin was very warm and inviting. The rooms were very well appointed and comfortable and the service was top notch.  We asked the staff for recommendations on things to do in the area and good restaurants in the area and we received fantastic recommendations.  The hotel restaurant and bar are also great places to hang out. The only minor comment is the location, but restaurants, shopping, and a great park are only a 10-15 minute walk. We felt totally welcome and would without a question stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.  We cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2015,08,03
208,Felt so at home,"Normally stay closer to the City but chose this property as we had a client dinner in the restaurant. Warm welcome on arrival and fabulous decor. I was early to the hotel but all was done to get me a room soonest.
The luxury room was spacious, clean, included robes, slippers and the wifi was very quick.
Beds designed for comfort and this hotel gives you fresh milk in the fridge for your tea...loved this touch.
Enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and the catering is flawless. Seriously worth throwing the diet out the window as indulging. 
Great staff, great hotel, don't think I'd want to stay anywhere else again in Dublin but here.",5,2015,07,26
208,Hip and Lovely,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Dylan. The cool, hip atmosphere, the comfortable bed, the yummy breakfast made for a wonderful stay.  The staff took great care of us, anticipating our every need.  I would definitely visit again!",5,2015,07,23
208,"The New Dublin: Hip, Cool, and Luxurious","This is not your grandfather's B&B in Olde Dublin town. It is new, hip, luxurious and fabulously located. We were here for 2 nights in early July, at the start of a holiday in Ireland, and the Dylan exceeded expectations.  Room was large, bright and fully equipped, and bathroom was equally large and modern. We walked to St. Stephen's Green, which was about 20 minutes, but you can easily take the bus, which stops around the corner from the hotel. Martin, the friendly young man at the front desk, was very helpful, with excellent dinner and lunch recommendations. It's on a very quiet back street, but close enough to easily get to bars and restaurants.  All in all, a real and unexpected treat.

(BTW, be warned: we were very surprised that the taxi from the airport did not take credit cards. This is crazy, in a large modern international terminal. He had to wait at the hotel while I went in search of an ATM.)",5,2015,07,20
208,Great Hotel!,"You will not be disappointed if you stay here! Clean, welcoming, nice breakfast, modern rooms, valet parking.  A litle further from town than other hotels but makes up for it in peace and quiet and lovely setting. One of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in.",5,2015,07,16
208,Love coming back here..,"It's been a few years since we were last in Dublin and therefore a few years since we last stayed at dylan, so it was interesting to come back again. Once more the hotel and the staff didn't let us down. 

From the moment we arrived on Saturday morning the staff were helpful, efficient and warm in their welcome. Our room was not ready but they ensured our bags were looked after, then delivered to our room, whilst we ventured out into the city. We love the fact that dylan is about 20 minutes walk from the centre of Dublin, as it both gives us the chance to walk off their wonderful breakfasts and also it's away from the hustle and bustle of the centre. 

The area near dylan is worth exploring too, some lovely little eateries and coffee shops within a good walking distance. One of the reasons for our stay was to see Damien Rice at Iveagh Gardens, so were delighted to find the venue just a 15-20 minute walk along the canal away. 

Our room, a signature suite, was wonderful. It was spacious, luxurious and just a great place to hang out and relax after our ventures out. The bar and dining area in the hotel is just as wonderful, as are the quiet break out lounges. The food was, as always, very lovely and a great drinks and cocktails menu with some interesting drinks to enjoy. 

Each time we come to Dublin we stay at dylan and that's not about to change any time soon.",5,2015,07,14
208,Modern Hotel in Georgian Dublin,"We had a lovely stay at the Dylan on the last leg of our honeymoon.  The room was spacious and very conformable.  The shower was awesome, I loved that you could control the temperature without standing in the flow of water so as to not scald or freeze yourself.  The tv in the room was difficult to work, we could not actually watch television without the menu popping up and the channel selection was limited.  This wasn't a big problem as we were not there to watch tv, but a minor annoyance as we like to have it on as we are going to bed.  The restaurant downstairs had breakfast (included in our stay) and we always had excellent service.  

My biggest complaint would be that I wasnt asked about payment options upon checking out, the lady at reception put through the charge in dollars instead of Euros without asking for my preference.  Thankfully I caught this, and she did cancel the first transaction and then recharge my card in Euros.  She wasn't very apologetic about it and actually tried to discourage me from changing the charge.  (For those traveling, the exchange rate on the credit card machines for paying in dollars is significantly worse than what you will get from your bank. In this case the difference between the dollar charge they originally put through and the converted charge from Euros was around $100)",4,2015,07,14
208,"Dylan - brilliant service, great stay!","We loved our night spent at Dylan. Fun,funky decor with the bar area downstairs buzzing on a Friday night. We ate at a restaurant 50m away, Asador on the concierges suggestion - great choice! Staff could not do enough to help us...from suggestions on where to eat, to organising taxi's etc. etc. Service was truly outstanding. Our room was fabulous and not over the top decor-wise. Bed was large and very comfortable. We enjoyed the 15 minute walk into town after a hearty, delicious Irish Breakfast. A really enjoyable stay in a less frenetic area of Dublin.",5,2015,07,13
208,Super helpful staff makes up for the long walk into the City!,"What a great hotel! From the second we walked in we were warming welcomed and well looked after. 

Check in was quick & easy. We were escorted to the lift and asked if we wanted any help with our bags.

Our room was well equipped with functional opening windows and a large comfy bed. Excellent air-conditioning unit, spacious desk and plenty of TV channels/radio. Great minibar selection with complimentary fresh milk for in room teas & coffees.

Clean bathroom with a huge shower (no bath in room 212). The only design flaw is the very low sink with a large central tap... it's near impossible to wash your face without soaking the area around you. Easily remedied by placing a towel on the floor & we used a face towel to clean up water spillage over the basin area & toilet (disguarded after use obviously.)

Every evening we arrived back to our room & the curtains had been closed & chocolates were on the side table with complimentary bottles of water.

We had breakfast on our first morning. The service & food was good overall although we didn't love the hollandaise sauce on our Eggs Royale (too lemony) & there wasn't any bread/croissants. After waiting 10 minutes we figured they wouldn't be replenishing the baskets. Perhaps it was because we were at breakfast at 10am (it finished at 10.30am) however for ‚Ç¨25 each we only received a tea & coffee, 2 bowls of cereal & 2 portions of Eggs Royale (which my partner didn't finish.)

The only real downside (if I have to mention one) is the location. It's rather a long walk into town, however the reception staff are happy to book you a taxi which will have you in the City center within 5 minutes. There's plenty of nice local bars & restaurants though, & a large Tesco just around the corner if you need urgent supplies.

Locations;

AirCoach from Dublin Airport - Kildare Street Approx. 35m drive - 20 minute walk to Dylan.

Dylan - Temple Bar - 30 minute walk

Dylan - Local Tesco - 5 minute walk

Dylan - Trinity College - 25 minute walk

Dylan - Closest stop for Hop On, Hop Off tour bus - Merrion Street - 15 minute walk

AirCoach from Dawson Street - Dublin Airport Terminal 2 Approx. 35m drive - We got a taxi from Temple Bar to Dylan, grabbed our bags then were dropped off at Dawson Street. This cost ‚Ç¨10.

I would definitely recommend the Dylan for your stay in Dublin! Thank you to the staff for providing us with such a pleasant stay.",5,2015,07,12
208,"Dylan Hotel Dublin - Great venue, loaction and staff","Dylan Hotel is very much a boutique hotel. It is quirky, colorful and room we were in had plenty of space and light. Breakfast offerings freshly cooked and plentiful but a bit too expensive at 25 Euro. Brunch menu looked to be very good value.

Across the board all staff I met with were friendly and very helpful. 

About 10 minutes walk from centre of Dublin",4,2015,07,10
208,Strange design decisions ,"The hotel is a nice boutique hotel in a gorgeous building but the interior design decisions in many instances feel forced and not practical enough. For example, it's almost impossible to use the strangely designed phone, the only way to connect to wifi is to navigate a confusing TV interface, I never figured out how to turn off a light under the bed that the turn down service people turn on; we needed to call the front desk to turn the towel warmer on-- turns out you need a chair to reach the switch-- that's why we missed it. The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are nice, it's clean and the people at the front desk are helpful. The breakfast is good but very expensive for what it is. ",3,2015,07,09
208,The Dylan was awesome!,"The Dylan is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin. They go above and beyond to accommodate. The rooms are lovely. The restaurant serves the most delicious foods, and the staff is so friendly and helpful. The manager Collin Dillion was especially helpful!",5,2015,07,08
208,Wonderful wonderful wonderful loved this hotel,"After a disappointing experience at The Gibson we checked into the Dylan and what a difference a gem of a hotel and we loved it. What's not to like? great outdoor areas, with heating and brilliant service, everyone was on point from the moment we arrived. Never ever had to ask for anything, it was offered. Room well appointed and all mod cons, mini bar etc. Very comfortable bed and great nights sleep. Very quiet. A short trip into central Dublin but just far enough out to be connected but relaxing. Great wifi, never had a problem. Food very good and excellent breakfast. Good value too. Would strongly recommend and were coming back. See you soon.",5,2015,07,06
208,Your town home in Dublin...with staff.,This is approximately my tenth stay at this hotel totaling over twenty nights.  I still look forward to arriving and settling into one of their lovely rooms.  The stylish rooms are fun yet the rooms I like the best are at the back of the hotel and are decorated my conservatively.  Not once have I had to wait more than a few minutes to be in my room and I usually arrive earlier than check in.  They are efficient and helpful without being obsequious.  They know what you need as travelers all have wants drawn from a predictable list and they aim to satisfy.  The bar is a wonderful meeting place from breakfast until drinks late at night.  They never seem to mind that we sit over cappuccinos for an inordinate amount of time.  The packages on their website usually yield substantial savings too.,5,2015,07,06
208,Lovely hotel ,Stayed here at the end of June as a treat for my wife's birthday. We both really love this hotel and can't wait to go back. The service was very friendly and efficient and they have lots of nice personal touches you don't get in a run of the mill hotel. The room was very stylish and the bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was very relaxed and plenty of choice. Looking forward to returning ,5,2015,07,06
208,nice boutique hotel,"nice boutique hotel with very friendly staff , rooms sizes are generous, but the overall design is overloaded and just a little bit too much - lightning in the rooms is mediocre and the carpets are a no-go ...
The restaurant is nice but the food is mediocre, the wine list too small and not up to standards for such a hotel - on the other side the bar area is very nice and has superb service",3,2015,07,05
208,Not your grandfather's Dublin hotel,"The Dylan is in a pleasant location some 15 minutes walk from the City Center and near a commercial street with local restaurants, food shops and convenient transportation. The Dylan has fanciful decor and no two rooms are alike. This is good and not good in that you must know what you want and be sure to ask for it. The lighting in rooms is subdued, to put it mildly. But the video and, especially, audio offerings are outstanding. Through your TV monitor you can access radio stations from around the world. The breakfasts in the restaurant are outstanding. Worth having even if you are not staying at the hotel. Staff at the front desk are friendly and able. One receives the customarily gracious and sincere Irish welcome.",4,2015,07,04
208,"Great hotel, mediocre food","Love the boutique feel, with every floor and room different. Great location to visit the city, too. Staff was all super friendly and eager to give directions and recommendations. Highly recommend staying here. The food at the restaurant is just ""meh"", though - Plenty of other options in the neighborhood.",4,2015,07,03
208,Overpriced,"Stayed for one night as myself and my husband were attending the ACDC concert in the Aviva Stadium. 

Positives; 
- close to the stadium (10 min walk)
- amazing staff, the minute we walked in, they were so helpful, and not in an overbearing way. 
- the food in the restaurant was stunning!!! Best meal I've had in a while. 

Negatives;
- for nearly ‚Ç¨300 for the night, I was so disappointed with the room. It was TINY! Room 312. The bathroom was so small, for example the towel rail is placed just above the toilet. Ew. I have bigger wardrobes at home! And the bed was small too. So disappointing as I was really looking forward to my stay. 
- the prices in the bar were scandalous. ‚Ç¨8.50 for a SMALL glass of wine. I was shocked to get a bill for nearly 26 euro for 3 small glasses of wine!!! 

Nice hotel but I will not be returning. Brilliant staff but I've had better nights away in 3 and 4 star hotels for more than half the price.",3,2015,07,02
208,Boutique chic great location,"Lovely romantic and hip setting for a summer long weekend. Great sunny terrace for lunch or a drink and plenty of nice spaces to hang out. We liked our vaulted room 303. The main restaurant music was pumping even at 4pm on a Sunday and there were several group events whilst we were there, but you can always to retreat to the calm of the library. Breakfast is fine - not amazing. Reception staff were excellent. It's well-located with a nice walk into Central Dublin and 2 mins to a street of caf√©s and useful shops around the corner. ",4,2015,06,28
208,"Great hotel, great staff and great location","Stayed here over the weekend for the Ireland v Scotland football match. 

The hotel is definately a boutique hotel and in my opinion worthy of 5* rating. The interior and room design are excellent (Stayed room 108). 

Can't commend the staff highly enough - from reception staff to breakfast team and bar staff. A special shout out to the two guys on reception, who were most welcoming and helpful with hints and tips for our trip.

They claimed to be happy with Scotland getting a draw, but i think they were just joking!

Think we walked about 12 miles over the weekend, with hotel about 15 minute to Grafton Street and 10 mins to Aviva stadium.  Some lovely bars just round the corner from the hotel on Baggot Street. 

Would definately return, the next time with my wife as she would absolutely love the hotel in what is a wonderful city.",5,2015,06,24
208,Disappointing food,"Still my favourite hotel in Dublin. The staff and service are excellent, however the quality of the food has gone down hill at a rather alarming rate. While the food wasn't inedible it really wasn't great. Both lunch on the first day and breakfast the following morning were average at best.",3,2015,06,21
208,Well located trendy hotel but internet service is a problem,"Dylan staff are exceptionally friendly, the feel is trendy and the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable with amenities (e.g. ipod playing U2). I would stay here again but the hotel should be rated 4 or 4.5 not 5 stars in terms of luxury.  The complimentary wifi is frustratingly slow and the room has its issues: sink lacks counter space and is hidden behind the bathroom door (need to close bathroom door to get to sink), there are no towel racks (towels are hidden under sink), pillows are too hard, and the single phone is so modern that I couldn't figure out how to use it. Otherwise a good experience.",4,2015,06,20
208,Overpriced in my opinion,"A luxurious boutique property but IMO a good bit over priced, a small enough room. breakfast was probably the biggest disappointment where attention to detail was poor and little attention from the staff. Buffet was poorly set up with a menu stating juice from the buffet yet we had to ask for it and could see it then being poured from a container from behind the bar. I ordered an espresso to start with and received a pot of regular coffee and the got the amazed look from the staff member aphorism said ""this is your coffee"". Toast came after we had received the hot breakfast. In general for ‚Ç¨25pp breakfast was poor value. Unsure if I'd return!",3,2015,06,19
208,Both good and bad,"We booked our reservations months in advance and specifically selected the Dylan for it's high-end boutique-y feel. Our trip was a once-in-a-lifetime, so spending extra to stay in a luxury hotel was something we were willing to do. Upon check-in the morning of our flight in (June 6), we were greeted warmly and ushered to our room to shower and rest before sightseeing. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and plush, but there were a million little glitches that occurred repeatedly during our first 2-night stay. The internet wouldn't work and the key reader never let us in our room once (resulting in the front desk staff having to let us in every time). The front desk staff was great, but it ended there. The bar and restaurant staff was never available and resulted in us leaving the hotel, around the corner to Searson's instead. When we checked out, we were content enough and went on the rest of our 5-day trip to other areas of Ireland. 

    Our reservation had us arriving back to the Dylan our last night in Ireland before flying home (June 12). I was in contact with the hotel desk staff during those 5 days and we were never informed of any problems. After a long drive back to Dublin and the Dylan, I came in and announced our arrival, they let us pay to park on the street and then, after lugging everything in, they regretted to inform us they were over booked and we were being bumped to another hotel (The Marker) in an undesirable, touristy part of town. Both men working the desk kept assuring us how sorry they were, but there was nothing they could do. We have traveled all over the world many times and have never, ever been bumped from a hotel. I'm shocked and disturbed by this - especially with how far we booked in advance, and that our reservations had been confirmed, as well as the fact that I was in contact with the Dylan desk staff at multiple times during our time away. 

  For such a high-end hotel, this is simply unacceptable. It's unfortunate that I cannot give glowing reviews for the Dylan Dublin. The little technical difficulties are one thing, but to just excuse a reservation is inexcusable.",2,2015,06,18
208,Anniversary,"We found the staff to be very welcoming and I nice touch from the general manager who left a hand written note in our room to congratulate us on our anniversary. I found the look and feel to this hotel to be stylish and modern, the rooms are comfortable and generously stocked but cosy.
We will be back!",4,2015,06,16
208,4*,"Lovely hotel but expected more for 5*s. Large rooms and only half an hour walk from city centre. The bar seemed very popular with locals on the Saturday night...it is not as outstanding as I expected, not really worth the hefty price tag. We've stayed in nicer 4* hotels.",4,2015,06,14
208,An Excellent Choice,"The Dylan is located on a nice, quiet side street in Dublin. It is only a few steps to Baggot Street and some great pubs, restaurants and shopping, with a money machine on the corner. 

A nice ten minute walk takes you to St. Stephens Green and the well known Grafton Street. After a walk in the park you can shop till you drop. You can visit Trinity college near the bottom of Grafton Street. Once you have packages or are tired of walking, you can pick up a cab at one of the hotels at the top of Grafton Street to have a short ride to the Dylan. 

The staff members at the Dylan are all very friendly and attentive.  They remember return customers and refer to you by name throughout your stay. They are also very helpful with information about the city or to assist with rental cars or other travel details. 

All of the rooms are great. The interior design is new wave, thus their ""boutique hotel"" rating. The rooms are very comfortable and the restaurant serves great food. For those who smoke, as I enjoy a fine cigar, there is a great semi-closed smoking area off of the bar that has great lounge seating, heaters if needed and large screen TVs for viewing matches. 

We have traveled to Dublin semi-annually for about 12 years and since finding the Dylan, it has been our first choice every year. I think it is an excellent choice!",5,2015,06,11
208,Fantastic Hotel... Search no more,"My favorite hotel!  Service was stellar.  Staff takes pride and truly enjoys what they do.  This makes the Dylan special..... from the reception desk to the cleaning staff, from the concierge to the wait staff in the restaurant, everyone was warm and super friendly and wants to make you happy.  The food was fantastic and they make a mean cappuccino.

It's located just outside the city center and in walking distance to Graffton street and St. Stephen's Green as well as some great pubs where the locals gather.  Great restaurant within walking distance as well, Asardero....get the steak.

Ask for Stephen O'Tool at the Conceirge Desk.  He put together a nice welcome surprise for my niece.  We were celebrating her graduation from college and birthday.  They had balloons, prossecco in the room along with a welcome treat of brownies.  Very nice.  Dinner was great as well.  We felt like we were the only ones in the hotel.

We missed our flight to return home due to a very bad wreck on the motorway.  We called the Dylan hoping they would have a room, but no luck. They were completely booked.  Big festival going on, so we were concerned that we would not find a room.  However, Stephen located a room for us at a 5 star hotel and we were upgraded at check in at no cost.  We were blown away.  Such a different mentality in Ireland when it comes to hospitality and service!  We love the Dylanüòò",5,2015,06,06
208,A Great Stay,"My wife and I stayed in the Dylan for our anniversary over the bank holiday,all the staff were amazing and made our stay such a special one.We had a late lunch which was fantastic and cocktails in the the evening in the beautiful surroundings.Thanks so much",5,2015,06,03
208,"Lovely, quirky hotel in a nice neighborhood","What a lovely find!  Quirky little hotel not too far away from the action yet in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Room didn't have a bathtub but it had a wonderful shower and heated bathroom floors.  Room service dinner was fabulous.  Employees were very friendly.  Decor was comfortable but unusual in an Alice in Wonderland kind of way (a positive).  

Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,06,01
208,Service makes the difference,"This is a nice boutique hotel that is well located in Dublin. I would have rated it four stars on the rooms, cleanliness, etc. but the desk staff made the difference. We dealt with four or five different individuals at the front desk over our two night stay, and they were all outstanding. They were informative, knowledgeable and helpful beyond the norm, including many five stars at which we have stayed.  Great staff Dylan!",5,2015,05,30
208,"Nice Bar, Delicious Cocktails!","Went for drinks at the Bar with some friends, service was fast and nice. Heated outside area were it is nice to sit at even later during the evening. Cocktails we tried were delicious. They had some snacks and sandwiches with them, which were apparently really good as well. Design is funky and appealing, very good bar.",5,2015,05,27
208,Lovely boutique hotel near centre,"This is a lovely boutique hotel about a 10  minute walk from the centre of the city. The staff were all really helpful and friendly. The rooms were spoacious, clean bright  with sufficient cupboard space. We ate in the hotel one evening and the food was very good. The hotel is in a side street so reasonably quiet. Free wifi included, always a plus!",5,2015,05,27
208,Don't forget to ask for a bath!,"We stayed here recently on a weekend trip to Dublin, having previously stayed at the Dylan a few years earlier.

The decor and general style of the place is still really 'cool' and 'boutiquey', but something about it just felt a little tired compared to our previous stay.

That said, the cocktail bar was excellent (try the smoked old fashioned, with real smoke!) and breakfast was great too...

However, one top tip is to ask for a bath when you book. Our room only had a shower, which for a 5 star hotel was really disappointing. Especially as the wet room had no apparent ventilation meaning it got wet and stayed wet!

Great location, but could do with a couple of tweaks...",3,2015,05,25
208,"Nice room, expensive hotel, disapponting restorant","Old , rebuilded building. Red carpets everywhere. Nice staff. Only parking available is valet parking. too far from the city center, if you want to take the walking option, it will take ~1/2 hr to get to the Temple bar area. Restorant staff didn't wake on time for 07:00am breakfast guests.",3,2015,05,19
208,Lovely rooms but restaurant disappointing,"We stayed here for one night.   The hotel is lovely, nice decor in the bar, hotel lobby and very comfortable,  stylish rooms.  Overall the staff were very polite and helpful.  However on arrival we stood for quite a while  in reception being ignored as we tried to check in, the one receptionist who was there was dealing with another customer but it would have been simple for him to look up acknowledge we were there and say 'I will be with you in a minute' and it would have made a massive difference to how welcome we felt.  These small things cost nothing but make a big difference.  
I was very happy with the room, slept very well and the  cocktails were delicious .
We ate in the restaurant it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was very quiet but given the prices being charged we were disappointed with the food it was ok but not up to the standard we were expecting.  I would stay at the hotel again but would probably eat elsewhere 
Overall a pleas at stay",4,2015,05,17
208,Suite heaven!,"Stayed here for one night when we were in the city celebrating our wedding anniversary. Booked a deluxe room which is really like a mini suite. This hotel stands out as an oasis in a sea of characterless big hotels in Dublin. Its a bit quirky and is situated in one of the leafy wealthy suburbs of south city Dublin.Beautiful houses and beautiful people are the norm here. The bar is very well stocked with very knowledgeable bar staff. One thing we noticed is that the bar is frequented by a lot of locals so you get a real buzz rather than a flat sterile hotel bar feel. Breakfast is not included and to be honest is too expensive. It's a let down, premium charge for an average start to the day.",5,2015,05,11
208,Irish weekend break,"This is an excellent hotel, the staff are friendly and very helpful with nothing too much trouble for them to sort for you.

Rooms are well equipped, with an excellent bathroom and luxurious main room. The beds are extremely comfortable, there is a writing desk and chair, plenty of lighting and ample wardrobe space.

Other facilities are as follows: tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer, TV and turn down bed service every night with a bottle of fresh water and chocolates.

You will have a little walk to the centre of Dublin but this is not too far as long as the weather is fine.

Regards
Colin K",5,2015,04,28
208,Beautiful Boutique,"I stayed at this hotel over the Easter Weekend break and was pleasantly surprised, the hotel room was spacious and clean.  The staff were very accommodating and helpful.  The food was lovely and the stay was great.

I would stay there again.  The hotel location was 15/20 minutes walk from the main shopping area, Temple Bar, as well as St Stephens Green.   The Guiness Storeroom and Jamesons are a bus or taxi ride away, but for those that love to walk they are about 45 to 1 hour....

There a Pubs and restaurants on the main strip around the corner from the Hotel if you want variety.",5,2015,04,27
208,best stay in Dublin,"the reviews of this hotel say it all,one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in.Couldn't  fault anything would recommend to anyone.Excellent staff who us couldn't do enough for us.Impressed with the valet parking.",5,2015,04,15
208,Funky hotel,rooms nice reception bar restaurant and library are very relaxing ... Service very good cocktails yummy but the restaurant food was disappointing . .  Location great especially around rugby time and waking distance from many bars,4,2015,04,14
208,Was Nice but expensive,it was a lovely hotel close enough to walk to main areas however was really pricey. Buffet could have been better and we were given toast with mold on it. Nice hotel but not 5 star. The bathrooms were lovely and the staff extremely friendly.,4,2015,04,13
208,"Wonderful retreat, sophisticated and individual","My husband and I stayed here midweek with another couple.  Our first Dylan experience, it was excellent and better than we expected.  Impeccable style, clean, fresh and individual.  Rooms were immaculate had great music on the iPod, super chic , great attention to detail.  Even had conditioner! We are avid concert goers and contrary to what another reviewer noted, that it was out of the way, its easy to get to RDS, Aviva and to 3Arena.  Can't wait to get back, staff were from all nations but we had our Irish welcome regardless. Breakfast was prepared to order, wonderful.",5,2015,04,11
208,Five points tripadvisor like its five stars,"I am already reviewing the Dylan thpugh I still have to check out, amazing stay for three nights long and such a sorrow to leave, I had two double luxury rooms one for me and my wife and another adjointed one for my two kids, I will definitely come back here mext time in Dublin, quiet surroundings, plenty of food opportunities nextdoor and still close to the city center, about 15 to 20 minutes walk depending on where you are heading to unless you want to go to visit te Guinness Brewery store house for which it is better a short taxi ride, all in all a great Boutique hotel experience",5,2015,04,07
208,Stylish and friendly!,"Overall great hotel with good style and ambience. Would book again but ask for a room not near the stairs. 

Good points:

- amazing breakfast and brunch 
- excellent service from staff and very friendly especially at breakfast
- good wines and chilled out bar
- nice location if don't want to be super central and down a quiet road
- good and fast room service 

Bad points:

- music in the bar was a bit too much dance/trance and wanted to chill rather than party
- doors were banging in the morning near the staircase and was annoying
- room was smallish size",4,2015,04,06
208,Great Hotel,My partner and I recently had a weekend break in Dublin staying at the Dylan Hotel.  This was a fabulous hotel with beautiful decor.  It was about a 20 min walk from the city centre.  Staff were very pleasant.  Our aircon wasn't working on the last night but we put up with it as we were leaving in the morning.  Would definitely recommend anyone staying there when visiting Dublin.,5,2015,04,02
208,Lovely,"arrived from an early flight at 10am a room was ready but we were offered a better room which we took, cases kept and we were off to shop. Came back to bags in a beautiful room, staff very helpful with taxis and places to eat. A bit out the way so taxis costs a fair bit so be prepared! Overall fab hotel, lovely staff.",5,2015,04,01
208,Excellent hotel in a great location for a weekend away,"Stayed at the Dylan for our 25th Wedding Anniversary March 2015

Our stay was excellent from arrival to drinks in the bar, breakfast and wonderful five course taster menu not to be missed at dinner 

Customer service is spot on - and room that we stayed very comfortable 

We have stayed at many excellent  hotels over the years and must say that this is one of  the best!!
Try it if you visit Dublin  you will not be disappointed",5,2015,03,18
208,Tastful dining experience,"We recently had the pleasure of the 5 course tasting menu in the Tavern restaurant here. The ambiensce and service throughout were excellent. Each course was explained perfectly and the whole experience was delightful. I loved the dessert delivered in a miniature wooden handcart and contained a full candyfloss for each person....brings back far distant memories from childhood, Most diners could not resist a photograph.

Will definitely be back to this establishment.",4,2015,03,17
208,Weekend break,"Great hotel, got an upgrade! Yummy breakfast. Dinner in the restaurant was nice too but not out of this world. Steak main was just so so. So dinner needs a little improving. Staff are friendly and it's lovely and peaceful there. Always on our list when in Dublin.",5,2015,03,17
208,Fabulous hotel in a great location!!!,"Just came back today from this hotel. Stayed for 3 nights. Room lovely. Breakfast fab. Great location. Staff very helpful. Would definatly stay here again.
It's about a 10 min walk from St Stephens green... And 20 mins walk to Temple bar. We ate last night at Cafe En Seine on Dawson Street just off St Stephens Green... I'd highly recommend this restaurant. Great few days away.",5,2015,03,10
208,10/10 and super value,"Small hotel, amazing service, fabulous decor, top class breakfast. I will definitely re visit. Andrew at the front desk is a real asset the hotel. I woudk define you recomend this hotel to all my family and friends for either a working trip and a romantic break ",5,2015,03,09
208,Excellent staff and service,"I just spent 2 nights here this month, and found the hotel to be very clean and the staff extremely helpful.  My only complaint is the location of my room, because the balcony is over the back door of the kitchen, and it stinks of cooking oil and grease, quite unpleasant.  Also below my balcony the staff from the kitchen and lobby sit and smoke, so if you are a non-smoker, you wont like the smoke rising up.  So, avoid room 108 if you want to use the balcony. I have given some photo's for you to see the wonderful view of ash and butt ends!  However, apart from that, I must say the staff were excellent, and I would definitely stay again.  TIP:  order your own taxi, if the hotel orders you one, they get a commission and you pay more - driver adds 3 euro's to his clock!! 
All my photo's are view from balcony, below is kitchen, to the right a laundry drop - views not great",5,2015,03,07
208,tasting menu,Decided to  try the tasting menu in the restaurant. Lovely restaurant and staff were very nice. Really enjoyed the tasting menu which were tasty well presented and brought at nice intervals. Had a bottle of house red which we both enjoyed . Walked through some of the hotel and it seemed well decorated and very peaceful. Would eat here again and maybe we will stay next time,4,2015,03,03
208,High Level,"I was in this hotel during the rugby game agains France ( I am French, nobody is perfect!!!)
Congratulations for the people, the bar, the restaurant and the room.
The quality is really high.
I recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,01
208,Stunning Hotel!,"We stayed here on our anniversary for two nights. The hotel is amazing, the bedroom was stunning. The restaurant and bar ate lovely, had a delicious meal in the restaurant. The staff were really helpful and catered for all of our needs in a speedy amount of time. Would definitely recommend this hotel if staying in Dublin. Hopefully we will be back soon.",5,2015,02,25
208,The bedroom made this hotel,"Spent 1 night at the Dylan recently. The room was really gorgeous, split in two with seperate living space and bedroom. No less than 3 TV's one in the bathroom...felt like an episode of cribs lol.
Beautiful sash windows remind you of this beautiful historic building. We didn't find the staff very friendly mind you. There were 2 issues with items missing from our lunch and breakfast and nothing was made of that other than to go back to the kitchen, put the missing items on a plate and plonk down beside us. I would still recommend the hotel though just for the bedroom. 
Bit of a trek into town but doable...go in flats not in heels!",4,2015,02,24
208,Lovely boutique hotel,"Spent 2 nights at The Dylan in the Signature Suite. Stunning, spacious room. Staff were all friendly, helpful and efficient. A little way out of the centre but not far from the DART station so not a problem. There was a variety of options for breakfast..the full Irish breakfast was very nice.",4,2015,02,23
208,Night away,Stayed here Saturday night and really impressed. We arrived early but it wasn't a problem accessing our room. Room lovely contemporary decor and really comfortable bed great breakfast also. We will definitely go back .,4,2015,02,22
208,Taster menu,"Had the taster menu.Absolutely terrible food.2 courses were inedible.The fish course was cod-overcooked, chewy, rubbery.Steak was the same. The other courses were not far behind.No redeeming features here in food or service.Do not waste your money.One of the worst meals I have had in a while.",1,2015,02,22
208,Fantastic hotel!,"Modern, comfortable and spacious rooms (with good wifi).  Great cocktails, food and very friendly staff.  About ten minute taxi journey into Dublin city centre and close to the Aviva stadium.  Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2015,02,16
208,"Lovely place, fab food and great value",A lovely location. Fabulous food and great value for value. Service couldn't have be better nice and friendly. A lovely location also for sitting outside having drinks with friends for a chat on a nice day. ,5,2015,02,11
208,Poor / over priced.,"Booked afternoon tea for myself and two friends. When we arrived our reservation wasn't recorded. That's ok, these things happen. We were seated promptly however we were left waiting after that. The service was poor apart from one lovely waitress who helped when asked. The tea selection was ok however the ""normal"" Breakfast tea was organic and in our option tasted strange so we all switched to coffee. Again that's ok. At ‚Ç¨35 per person I would expect that the food provided would be adequate. The selection of savoury items included were tasty but small. One small scone was included. The dessert selection was also small -a pot of chocolate mouse, one small macaroon and a chocolate truffle. We asked for extra scones at the end because we were simply not fulfilled with our meal. While we had to wait for these to arrive these were provided at no extra cost. I was really looking forward to this dining experience however given the service, the amount of food proved for the cost and the service I wouldn't recommend Afternoon Tea. ",2,2015,02,07
208,Super stylish hotel. Very comfortable.,"I spent 5 nights at the Dylan, and must say it was an excellent stay. Beautifully done up, spacious room with just about everything you could ask for. Everything about the Dylan is stylish. Even the room phone looked like something futuristic. My room had a well appointed bathroom with heated flooring and a giant tub. The chocolate truffles left on the bedside after turn down service, were a nice touch. The lobby areas are a little dim and the furniture can be a little confusing to some, but overall this is one of the most stylish places I've stayed at.",5,2015,02,03
208,Very good tasting menu,"Had a couples night out here on a voucher for the five course menu and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The soup course was tasty, the pork plate was versatile, the fish plate was very well cooked and beautifully presented. The beef plate had some nice little morsels on it and I particularly liked the braised beef crusted with bread crumbs. These were flavourful and very novel. The steak accompanying the plate, however, was quite tough and both my partner and I left them on our plate. The cooking of the steak was fine though, which made us think that the beef supplied to them was of a lesser standard so we decided not to complain. The highlight of the meal has to be the dessert. A wooded barrel with carnival style designs carried the delightful little marshmallow bites, miniature ice cream cones, apple and toffee doughnuts in a Martini glass and some chocolate truffles. I loved the tiny candy floss with freeze dried raspberry the most. Holding one in my hand really brought me back to a simpler time and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic. This was washed down with a very good strong espresso and we were both contented and smily when we left. Definitely an experience not to be missed! ",4,2015,01,28
208,"Not quiet as it should be, stay somewhere else ...","Dylan is in a truly gorgeous location ! The bar has a great vibe cocktails fab ! But the reception greeting wasn't really a greeting sadly and the room was ok but tired. bits coming off the bath, stains on the carpets and edges of carpet poorly hoovered ! Did I expect better ... Yes, would I stay their again? No ! I just think for your money you could stay somewhere more finished and have a nicer experience in Dublin! So really think before booking ! ",3,2015,01,26
208,5 star boutique hotel,"The title says everything. 
Dylan is to me, the best place to sleep when in Dublin,  quality/price is amazing. 
Never got a chance to dine in, but soon will try the restaurant. 
The reception staff is good, but the best costumer service that I got here was from a young girl called ""Dina"", she is a legend. Always very attentive and passionate about what she does. She would go out of her way to help you. 
Will be back soon and keep the high standards",5,2015,01,26
208,Gorgeous Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Dylan for a long weekend for my birthday.  The hotel is slightly out of town on a quiet road, hidden away almost.  The room was spacious and clean with a lovely big contemporary d√©cor, comfy bed and good size bathroom with under floor heating :)

The staff were friendly and happy to order you taxi's, the housekeeping kept the rooms clean and offered complimentary water and chocolates in the evening which was a nice touch.

They sent me up a little plate with chocolate brownies and a card on my birthday which was a lovely touch.

Taxi to town c10e so not bad, close to a little row of shops for essentials.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked good too.  I would recommend a visit.",5,2015,01,22
208,Convenient location for access to the city,"The hotel is very boutique and will appeal to a lot of people. 

Nice little touches on the room like own ipod paying music as you entered the room.  Additionally you could buy a mini hamper items in the room.   ",4,2015,01,20
208,Excellent in every respect,"Conveniently located in a quiet street within 20 mins walk to the city centre this small but perfectly formed hotel is to be commended. Friendly & helpful staff, great food and well-provided rooms. The decor is unusual but pleasing. Breakfast excellent, and the restaurant is of high standard.",5,2015,01,13
208,Boutique luxury,"Staying at the Dylan for 2 nights was perfect for the short break to Dublin, The room was bright , clean as well as very well styled. Facilities in both the room and bathroom were excellent with nothing lacking. Breakfast was very good with a broad selection of options available with the waiting staff happy to oblige with a few customisations requested. Front of House were very helpful booking restaurants and arranging taxis. Overall a great stay and would highly recommend.",5,2015,01,05
208,"Great Hotel, Ok Staff","The hotel is very nice, clean, quiet, and it was our favorite room on our trip. The beds are super comfy and made me want to stay in bed the whole day, just to feel them. The hotel staff were unusually quiet and felt pretty cold. They were never rude or uncaring, they just seemed sort of detached and they never acknowledged us when we would walk past or even make eye contact. I don't think it was on purpose, but at a five star hotel, I expect a little more on the personable service side.",4,2015,01,04
208,"Nice, but too pricey in my opinion...","My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights over new year 2014/15. 

The hotel staff on reception were very friendly and helpful and gave us a map of Dublin to help us navigate around. 

My first thoughts on the decor is that it looked a little bit like (what I would imagine!!) a high end brothel might look like, this may be a little harsh, but it was just a tad gaudy for our tastes.  The bedroom was a bit better, and not quite as ott. 

The bathroom was fine, no bath (which is disappointing for the price) and there were a number of tiles with cracks and some slight mouldy areas above shower. But really nice complimentary bath stuff.

The hotels location is a bit further out, and it's a good 30/45 mins walk in to the centre.

Overall the hotel was absolutely fine, and staff were lovely, however it just wasn't really our taste and felt it was a little over priced. 

However I think our view may have been reflective of the fact that our final nights stay in Dublin (which we had to book last minute as flybe changed the date of our return flight to a day later) we booked a night in the doubletree Hilton which is only a 10min walk from the Dylan through Agogo, and it only cost us ¬£50 for a night and was much better value for money, and we wish we'd spent all of our nights there instead of forking out the money we did on the Dylan.",4,2015,01,02
208,Excellent charming hotel,"We are staying at Dylan for the Fourth time (December 2014), we'll keep coming back to this one of a kind hotel; great service, interior and restaurant. Very nice rooms and always a personal touch! In a nice area of Dublin.",5,2014,12,30
208,"Treat yourself,  Worth every penny,","The background of your stay if pure style and sleekness.  Combine that with friendly, relaxed staff and you have yourselves and amazing hotel.  I often work in Mayfair and Chelsea and can find myself feeling uncomfortable in these backdrops, sometimes feeling judged by staff as if they are doing me a favour by choosing their venue.  This is not the case here.  Once through the door you soon realise they mean you to be happy and this goes a long way to making you relax and feel happy.

We arrived at 8am in the morning and they managed to find us a room without and stress.  They were also very generous when asking us to leave a 1.00pm after a night on the whisky.

In reply to other people comments about price especially on ""booking dot com"" it is true that we ate elsewhere for breakfast due to the price and would have prefered to stay in the hotel for this.  I would agree that although i am sure the breakfast would be 'to die for' I still think as guests at the hotel a more sensible price would be adventational for breakfast.  As for the general price we actually found the mini bar was quite competitive against prices locally in the bars usually a tiny bit more but also sometimes cheaper!  Honestly I can cope with a slight mark up for convenience and it is a mini bar it is to be expected.  As for the stay in the hotel you could consider it cheap in comparison to London.  If you consider ""value"" over all I was very happy and this place is NOT expensive.  You get allot for your money and the staff proved themselves worthy over and over.  This is a hotel that will make your break and is much more than just a bed to sleep in.  Five star over the door and five star when you through the door.  Some hotels tick the boxes needed to get five star this place feels five star.

We loved it and will be staying again.
Thank you Dylan for making us so welcome and comfortable in dublin.  We consider you a very special hotel with your own vibe.  Well Done Team",5,2014,12,27
208,Best rocking boutique in Dublin!,"The room was so spacious, high tech and clean. The bed was really comfortable!! I stayed at the Morrison the next day and wasn't as impressed, although it had the Dylan beat for location you couldn't conpare the rooms: Dylan had class with an edge!",5,2014,12,24
208,Dublin Charm,"It's hard to call the Dylan a boutique, but I cant find a more modern word to describe. It feels like a locally owned, independent luxury hotel.....minus the attitude. Rooms can be on the smaller side but are very unique and comfortable. A bit off the beaten path, but still easy to get around. Everything from the linens to the toiletries are top notch. The bar scene in the hotel is not to be missed and has an eclectic crowd. Bartenders are excellent. The downside here, if any, is the cost.",5,2014,12,23
208,"Afternoon tea overpriced, poor quality","Visited here in December 2014 with a group of friends for afternoon tea. Overall we were disappointed. Service was slow, had to constantly ask for tea, extra food. No choice of teas offered, sandwiches were bland but the desserts were tasty, esp the scones. The waiter/waitress were friendly but it appeared as they were understaffed and disorganised. As afternoon tea goes in Dublin it was overpriced and poor quality.
 ",3,2014,12,22
208,Luxurious,"Went on a 2 night break with my wife. We got a really good deal on a suite which was pure luxury. Wonderful room in a nice quiet part of Dublin off a Main Street. The cocktail bar is quite expensive but still worth a visit nonetheless. Wasn't the cheapest of weekends, but we got what we paid for and would stay again (deal permitting)",5,2014,12,17
208,Beautiful and trendy hotel  ,"Buzzy, busy bar/restaurant and gorgeous boutique hotel. Small but beautifully decorated rooms with everything you could need - beware of the basket of Irish goodies! :) The only downside is that as the bar gets busy in the evenings, it could be a bit noisy if you're staying as a guest. Overall love it though and this will be my go-to hotel when visiting Dublin from now on!",4,2014,12,13
208,it`s ok but bring plenty money,"This an an unusual establishment. Location: funny with limited pubs within walking distance   which is unusual for Dublin. Staff were very helpful. Sleep quality was fine only for somebody waking me up talking out in the corridor- yes, in a 5 star ! Food : did not have any there and the fee did not apparently  include any special rate for residents..can you believe? Drink was the the most  expensive I ever had and that gets me to the nub of the matter; this  property is seriously overpriced  in my opinion",3,2014,12,12
208,Extremely overpriced I thought :/,Stayed here over the weekend with my boyfriend. Really felt the price we paid for the room we got was just an absolute rip off :/ Breakfast wasnt even included either. Have stayed in executive suites for cheaper that have been absolutely amazing so I really wasnt impressed with my room unfortunately. Other than that the staff were really nice and I really liked the idea of the ipod in the room!,3,2014,12,01
208,One of the very best ,"Massive fan of the Dylan....Fantastic small, classy hotel. Superb bar area and restaurant. Rooms are very well appointed with large comfy beds. Great location for exploring Dublin. The best staff in the business, courteous, friendly and always there to help. ",5,2014,11,30
208,Lovely hotel. Lovely people.,"My girlfriend and I went to Dublin last weekend and stayed here.  It was recommended by my brother, who is a regular guest when over on business.  We had a lovely, spacious room.  The full Irish breakfast was superb.  The staff were all really helpful and friendly.  The hotel is situated not far from central Dublin hubbub, but far enough away to be quiet.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,22
208,Lovely Classy Hotel,"This was our first trip to Dublin for our wedding anniversary.  It was this classy hotel and the excellent staff that really made our trip shine for us! The staff are so well mannered and gracious they make you feel like royalty. They came in and tidied up the room for us while we were out at dinner, leaving little chocolates and water bottles. The little touches which make Dylan Hotel extra special. The restaurant was a bit pricey but worth it to avoid the torrential rain. We eat quite a lot and tried lots of dishes. They were all very good. There are a few nice restaurants and pubs right around the corner and Eva at the local salon does a fantastic blowdry if you have Irish hair!! All in all a great hotel for a romantic break.",5,2014,11,20
208,AMAZING !!!,"This was our first trip to Dublin and our stay  at The Dylan made this trip even more special. We had a very early flight and took a taxi from the airport to the hotel , We did not expect our room to be available but arrived hoping to leave our bags. We were greeted by a lovely friendly receptionist who told us our room was available, what lovely surprise that was. Our room was fabulous with tasteful d√©cor very modern and absolutely pristine. There are lots of lovely little touches and everything you need to make your stay a memorable one. The staff are all vey friendly and go out of our way to make you feel comfortable and very special. 
The Irish breakfast is delicious and is served in a beautiful setting. We found the hotel in good walking distance to the city . We did eat at the hotel on the evening of our wedding anniversary and the food is excellent  and the waiters were very helpful and attentive. All in all we enjoyed our first visit to Dublin but what really made it was staying at The Dylan",5,2014,11,13
208,Beautiful place,"The trip to get to the hotel was great...could not ask for better service. The hotel staff welcome us and proceeded to our rooms, which were beautiful. The beds were comfortable and slept well...went out on the town and found a lot of stuff too do, also had excellent food. So try it out for yourselves...just don't take my word for it...and what do you think about the place?",5,2014,11,11
208,A rememrable stay at the Dylan Hotel,"I stayed in The dylan Hotel three weeks ago  
I loved room and my stay there and the staff were also great but I have to say there was a one female receptionist who really stepped out and she really made my stay memorable
I would definitely recommend this hotel not just because its realy nice boutique hotel but because of professional and mannered staff!
The service was always friendly and nice even in restaurant the staff was welcoming and friendly.The walking distance to the city centre is also a an advantage! 

I would definitely recommend to all of my friends and family!!",5,2014,11,06
208,A sophisticated stay,"My first trip to Dublin, and my company booked me into the Dylan. I decided to stay the weekend and explore the city. The Dylan is a great boutique hotel nestled in a wonderful part of the city. It is just far enough to be quiet and quaint, and close enough for wonderful walks into the heart of the city. The rooms are tastefully appointed and the staff are as friendly as the Irish are good at having a pint. The restaurant also serves a great Irish breakfast. I also had the freshest Guinness I've ever tasted in the bar when I first arrived (yes, the bar is open relatively early). If you're looking for a sophisticated stay, then definitely put the Dylan down as a serious consideration.",5,2014,11,06
208,small boutique hotel,"stayed here for 3 nights. Overall a great location and hotel. However there is mould growing in the shower cubicle which has not been cleaned properly and is in need of some attention (213). The bed is very comfortable although the rooms generally are small. 
The staff are great with the exception of the surly, unhelpful, female receptionist who was on duty when we arrived. 
Overall a good experience.",4,2014,11,04
208,what a pleasure !!,"very nice boutique hotel just outside the center of Dublin but walking distance , no worries. we had a very lovey family weekend at the Dylan. the rooms are good size and very nicely decorated, the service is always friendly and professional. will be back",5,2014,11,04
208,"A really enjoyable stay, would highly recommend the hotel.","We really enjoyed our stay at the Dylan hotel. We loved the style and decor and the cocktails were delicious! It was in a really good location away from the hustle and bustle. There were some shops and restaurants near by but only a 15-20 mins into the city centre. The staff were excellent-very friendly, professional and couldn't do more to help. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2014,10,31
208,Memorable meal!,"My girlfriend and I visited the Dylan hotel on Saturday last to try out their new restaurant menu which was recommended to us. With it being my first time in this hotel my expectaions were high with it being a five star establishment. My first impression from the outside was that this hotel oozed class. The entrance and foyer area were all you would expect and more. The first experience we had of the staffs impeccable service was with the doorman greeting us with a huge smile and friendly welcome. Immediately we felt at home. We met our two friends inside at the bar and took our seats in the very nicely designed restaurant almost immediately. We were presented with the menu and I have to say the options just jumped out at me. There were so many dishes that I would have loved to have tried!! The menu itself is designed is such a way that the dishes speak for themselves. I opted for the scallops to start which I was delighted with when I saw what was presented a short while later in front of me. Never before have I seen a dish presented so artistically. The scallops were sitting in a large shell on a bed of smaller shells in a wooden tray. Accompanying this was a 'test tube' of sauce (cucumber, lime and corriander I think...) I wasn't sure whether to drink it or pour it on my scallops....so I did both.. ;) This was all served with a side dish of delicious and original tartar sauce. All in all a feast for the senses. Would highly recommend this. For mains I went for the rib eye steak which was cooked to perfection and was the leanest and tastist cut of meant I've had in quite some time. My better half went for their signature dish with a friend which was the sea bass for two!! Amazing is the only way to describe it. Cooked in an infused sea salt crust it is 'battered' by a mallet and then filleted for all the restaurant to see. Indeed I think we started a trend as it seemed nearly every table that was seated opted for this dish. By all accounts it was a delicious fish dish and melt in the mouth was how it was described. This was all washed down by a beautiful light French red that was kept chilled by our ever attentive waiter. And this is where the night was really capoped off. The service in this hotel is top class. The staff are so personable and friendly it really does give you a sense of homeliness and this you cannot put a price on. A special note of mention to Oscar who kept us entertained and looked after so we almost left as if we were friends. Indeed his education to us on champagne and the aging of wines highlights the knowledge and passion this man has for providing top class service, Finally, the desserts!!! We opted for the fairground selection which came laoded with mini ice cream cones, candy floss, caramel and passionfruit marshmallow. One word...Wow!! In addition to this, the chocolate sphere which melted in front of our eyes when hot chocolate was poured on top to reveal the fruity raspberry insides was an experience in itself. The lemon tart rounded off our dessert order and indeed it was in unison that we agreed that the lemon tart got our votes as the best...but only just!! The restaurant itself had a great buzz in it and the atmosphere made for a really enjoyable evening. The night was rounded off with a very nicely made cocktail in the bar which was once again attentively staffed. I would highly recommend this hotel for a visit and definitely try the new menu in the restaurant. You won't be dissapointed!!",5,2014,10,27
208,Overnight stay for concert,"If you are ever staying in Dublin and need a place to stay then the Dylan hotel has to be a top choice. We stayed in October for lady GaGa concert and from start to finish the hotel was amazing. We were dinner,bed & breakfast and dinner was amazing and breakfast was excellent. Staff could not of been more helpful and the rooms were sheer quality. It was our first time staying in Dublin and we will be going back for the Xmas market and we will be staying at the Dylan hotel again.",5,2014,10,26
208,Faultless.,"After staying here for a long weekend I personally cannot find fault at all with this Hotel, staff were extremely friendly, welcoming and efficient, rooms and hotel were decorated to extremely high standards. Everything was spotlessly clean also, with great attention to detail being taken by all members off staff. The hotel is only a short walk into Dublin City and because the weather was nice we chose to walk into the city most days. Saying that the hotel is a very short distance from bus stops and train stations. Overall it was a faultless experience and a fantastic weekend break in Dublin. I would like to personally thank all the staff and management for their efforts and we hope to visit again soon.",5,2014,10,20
208,"""SUPERB""","Im am not easily pleased but having stayed in many 5star hotels worldwide this  beautiful boutique hotel is almost flawless. ..the staff need to smile a bit more (i know its painful)...!
Full irish breakfast. ....if i was on my last and sternest warning from a scalpel poised heart slicer...i would prefer to roll over in to a bliss induced end game.than balk at the most magnificently presented and prepared breakfast that i was presented with....top top marks .
The rooms are mod and exciting. .
Downstairs the bar and restaurant are beautifully decorated ..so swish and nouveau. .
I have found my new Dublin home.",5,2014,10,19
208,Very good hotel in Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Dylan over a weekend - it was our first time in Dublin. When we arrived, we were warmly greeted and very quickly checked in. There was a biblical storm front going through, so we wisely accepted the offer to dine in the restaurant, which was no problem even though we had arrived quite late on a Friday (21:15 or so).

The rooms are well sized, cleanliness is excellent, and I lied the slightly quirky interior decorating.The bed is very comfortable, and when we asked for additional pillows with a bit more volume, they were sent to our room within minutes, likewise an iron.

As others have mentioned, the bathroom is fine, however the lighting does need a bit of work, it would be nice to have a softer light, particularly if you are taking a bath. 

Location is good, just outside the main hustle of the city, but close enough to walk, with a few pubs just around the corner if you wish.

Our meal at the hotel restaurant was fabulous. The menu frankly sounded a little ho-hum, but actually what was presented was of excellent quality. The presentation was amazing, and the flavours were classic combinations with excellent produce. The wine list was also excellent, and the ambience in the evening has an almost alice-in-wonderland feel, a fabulous place to dine.

The only downside was that our breakfasts were not really of the same quality as the rest of our stay. The produce seemed very cheap, the omlettes had been pre-cooked and re-heated, and on the first morning it took over 50 minutes for it arrive. For ‚Ç¨25 for a reheated omlette with cheap pre-cut ham, or ‚Ç¨29 for a properly top-notch rib eye steak, there was absolutely something amiss here. I did raise this as feedback on our departure, and received an email from the manager later noting that they will investigate what happened, and that this was not what they would normally have served, so they have been responsive to this feedback which is absolutely to their credit.

Overall a good stay, and if I were to return to Dublin, I would book this hotel again.",4,2014,10,17
208,The worst service ever !!!,"Lovely building, but the service is one of the worst that I have ever experienced in a 5 star hotel,all of our food was cold and very slow at being served. There was plenty of staff but none of them had a clue about waiting ",2,2014,10,12
208,Great hotel.,"I went recently to the dylan hotel for my birthday with friends. From the moment we arrived we were made feel welcome. The staff are exceptional. From the reception staff to the barman to the servers. All very professional. The room was lovely and they put extra bed in for us girls! The breakfast is wonderful. Great food, great selection and all served!! A treat. Would go back in a flash!",5,2014,10,06
208,Traveler ,"Dylan was a fantastic place to stay, close to everything, we walked to every place that we wanted.From the moment you step foot in the Dylan the staff makes you feel welcome & take care of you. Rooms are excellent, amnesties were great. Didn't eat at restaurant but looked great. Defiantly would stay on a return trip or recommend it to anyone!!",5,2014,10,04
208,Tranquil boutique hotel,"We stayed here on two occasions, on our arrival to Dublin and the last night before our return to Vancouver. The rooms are very well appointed and equipped, and completely updated. The staff are exceptional and will go out of their way to ensure your guest experience is the best. The breakfasts are excellent, there is a small bar as well as an outdoor patio for your retreat at the end of the day. Although the hotel is about a 20 minute walk into the city centre, it is well worth it. The neighborhood is quiet and pristine. We would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again if we returned to Dublin.",4,2014,10,03
208,Another great night in The Dylan,"We love The Dylan, the room you end up with is a little bit of a lottery, they are all different shapes and sizes but quaint. Plenty of character to this old building but spotlessly clean and quiet. 
The location is not city centre but a 20 minute walk or short taxi ride.
Staff are great, lovely breakfast, nice bar food. 
This time we ate in Marcel's which is just over the road from the hotel and had a great meal there. 
Cocktails in The Dylan were excellent and there's a lovely covered patio seating area. 
Can't fault it.",5,2014,10,03
208,Terrible sleep... other than that OK,"The hotel is in a nice area, not very central but the walk the the attraction isn't too bad (took me 15-20 minutes to walk to the centre). It was a beautiful day when I was there so sitting out on the restaurant's relaxed balcony was very nice. The staff is very helpful and nice, couldn't fault them. Everything in this small boutique hotel was very promising, until we got to the room... the decor of the room was completely different than that of the rest of the hotel. The hotel felt 'warm' and this room was 'cold'. It was one room below the most expensive one, so my husband and I were pretty baffled... the decor was comprised of some really unattractive and cheap metal flea-market accessories, like a big metal sun-mirror on the ceiling an crooked metal can shaped floor lamps amongst other things (my husband and I debated which was the ugliest, it was a hard call). The room wasn't small but it just felt cold and empty and average, nothing special. The bathroom was OK but not big at all. The tv was quite small for the size of the room and distance from bed - it felt like I would get more from a business hotel room. The feel of the room would've been fine if it wasn't for the TERRIBLE BED! It was rock-hard and was so uncomfortable, my husband and I were very sore in the morning. The windows were quite thin I guess because at night we were woken by outside noise at different hours of the night, mostly guests who were coming back and having a sit down outside, Breakfast was average. When my husband and I were looking to book a hotel in Dublin we were looking for something a bit 'different', that's why we chose a boutique hotel. When we left we agreed that we should have just gone to the four seasons, where the beds are good, and there's a spa in case they aren't... saying this, the redeeming feature of the hotel is its lovely exterior and very friendly staff members.",3,2014,09,30
208,Fabulous location and friendly staff,We are currently staying our third day in the Dylan. Normally we stay in the Marker which we thoroughly enjoy. The Dylan however is equally good. From the reception staff to the delightful breakfast staff the experience has been wonderful. We ate both nights in the restuarant with excellent service from Martin and Michael. We will definitely return.,5,2014,09,26
208,"Elegant, boutique hotel in a quiet though central location","The Dylan is a great hotel.  Located just out of, but still very close to, the highlights of this wonderful city, the Dylan delivers on every level.  It's beautiful to look at, a lovely grand and elegant building on a little side street (which leads to nowhere really so there's not much in the way of through traffic).  A great deal of attention and flair has gone into the interiors which are elegant yet very contemporary. The staff are friendly, attentive, and very helpful.  We enjoyed breakfast daily in the lovely Still restaurant on the ground floor, and nothing was too much trouble.  By the way it's a great continental buffet supplemented by a very good selection of hot dishes for a very minor incremental charge.  There's even sparkling wine on the buffet!  Our room was on the first level and compromised a sitting room, bedroom and bathroom.  Very well appointed and lovely views from the windows in the sitting and bed rooms.  Location, though, is the key.  The Dylan is about fifty metres from Baggot street with its array of pubs, caf√©s and restaurants as well as Tesco, Spar etc.
My husband and I really enjoyed staying at the Dylan (he stayed for 10 days and I stayed for 5) and would not hesitate to stay here again.  I wouldn't even bother looking at the competition.  We were very happy!!",5,2014,09,19
208," Heaven","The dylan hotel is a beautiful hotel.The staff are extremely helpful .Our room overlooked a lovely garden . The food and drink are well priced, in fact their cocktails were cheaper that many other hotels I've stayed in .The patio out front was a real bonus  we were able to enjoy it in the September sunshine .I would highly recommend the dylan hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,09,14
208,Brilliant boutique hotel with belt-busting choice of food and drink,"The previous reviews and the pictures speak for themselves, a great base for visiting Dublin and surrounding area, or just a discreet place to get away for a few days. The interior is everything a boutique hotel should be, the iPod in the room finally convinced me that U2 are worth a listen, and the outside bar offered some wonderful food and cocktails too. Breakfast was taken outside and set us up nicely for the rest of the day. Should have stayed longer and fasted for a week beforehand....",5,2014,09,14
208,Great boutique hotel in Dublin,We spent our first two nights at the Dylan after we arrived in Dublin. This is a charming boutique hotel right in the heart of things. Nice clean rooms & staff where pleasant. I cant comment on the food because we ate elsewhere (breakfast buffet not included like many hotels in Ireland & very pricey) Over all our group was very pleased & would return,4,2014,09,10
208,Unique & Beautiful,A group of six of us stayed here for a weekend. On cusp of city without feeling admits the chaos. It is truly a boutique hotel with unique decor. Attractive & interesting aesthetics. Room full of character. Bathroom products yummy. Food really good. Beer garden was fabulous due to random sunny Sunday. Chilled out watching match on large outdoor TV. Bar has good vibe. Lovely relaxing afternoon tea. Nice part of Dunlin. Would stay again.,5,2014,09,06
208,Very impressed with this hotel!,"I stayed at the Dylan hotel for one night for business, and would have loved to have stayed longer! The service is really good - the staff are friendly, efficient and really welcoming. My room was lovely, furnished to a high standard, but it was the little extras that I really appreciated. There was a plate of macaroons and chocolate truffles waiting for me, and just as I was tucking into them, a lady knocked on the door with two bottles of mineral water and two more chocolates! Not good for the waistline, but much appreciated. There's an iPod and a TV with lots of services, as well as free Wifi. I had to get up early for breakfast the following morning, but it was all ready on the dot at 6.30am. I asked them to organise a taxi for 6.50, and when I finished breakfast, the taxi was waiting for me and my bag had already been put in the car. I was very impressed with the service and the decor of the hotel and the room, and only wish it wasn't such a fleeting stay. I shall definitely be back.",5,2014,08,29
208,Boutique hotel as it is meant to be!,"For business I am frequently visiting Dublin. I am always using the Dylan hotel. Friendly staff, good food, nice bar and inner-garden and a very quiet place just outside Dublin's busier places. One of the few hotels  where I have to remember I am not home when I wake up. Great place for business, but also for a Dublin weekend would I go there with my wife. ",5,2014,08,23
208,Wonderful hotel..,Clean and comfortable rooms in a great location. Staff are professional and friendly. The only negative part for us was the checking out - it seemed to take ages! We will be back though! Dublin is great.,4,2014,08,23
208,Not good,"Dissapointing hotel . Wouldn't take a lot to make this a good  place but really struggling at the moment. Poor service from barstaff and a hint of arrogance which is distasteful. 
I definitely would not stay here again and would warn anyone to avoid  this place . It looks good from the outside but something is rotten within.

Plenty of much better hotels are available and keen for business  in the the area.

The cost is another point of contention as parking fees are little short of  larceny and the bar seems to be a double the normal price and then add some more scheme. 

Finally the front if house staff seem to think that being rude is a good way to build the brand!  Its not !!!!! If you want some place cool and chic this is not it.

I couldnt express strongly enough that this hotel is failing on many levels and I am surprised at some of the positive reviews on this website as at best thia place has two star quality and service.",3,2014,08,16
208,don't forget the basics,"It's infrequent that I write a response, but I felt compelled to.   This is a lovely hotel, not your standard homogenous affair.  beds are comfy, staff are friendly and attentive.

BUT - they are forgetting the basics.
My room smelt on arrival, but they did move me without hassle.
The room phone is so advanced its hard to call reception, you need to dial 400, not 0
Making the TV work is a headache
The network connection is slow, if you can call reception to find out what the wi-fi code is.
Milk in the room fridge is off, curdles in the coffee
Breakfast is not the usual hearty irish affair

If they sort the",3,2014,08,13
208,Mixed review. ,"Beautiful atmosphere throughout the hotel. Bar staff were excellent. Our starters were perfect, and presented beautifully. However the rib eye steak had a horrible smell off it. I cannot express how badly it smelt. It turned my stomach. Our waiter was also a handful. Grumpy and very hurried. He should follow in his colleagues footsteps as the rest of the staff were excellent. ",3,2014,08,09
208,don't look any further for a superb Dublin hotel,"Everything about the hotel is excellent. I have stayed in many superb hotels internationally but don't think I have ever stayed in a better one.
The location is superb, valet parking great and the staff especially Madison couldn't be better or more helpful.
We just had breakfast but this was first class.
The rooms are great with sky sports and music and great attention to detail.",5,2014,08,06
208,"Great location, lovely accommodation and friendly staff","The Dylan has everything.  We stayed three nights and the staff were very friendly and the accommodation could best be described as 'old world, five star charm'.  Loved it.  
Whilst at the Dylan, we needed to have laundry done, the in house service offered was quite expensive.  An alternative to the in house service, is the 'White Wash Laundry' located at 60 Grand Canal Street Upper, a 10 minute walk from the Dylan. The cost ?  Well worth the walk.",4,2014,08,05
208,Fantasic Hotel,I stayed there last Friday with my wife and we found the whole experience brilliant.All the staff were very nice and helpful and the room was beautiful.I love where the hotel is located away from the city centre but only a few minutes walk away.I would highly recommend it and we cant wait to go back...J.P.,5,2014,08,05
208,Beautiful hotel with very helpful and friendly staff!,"We only stayed for one night but it was great. Beautiful and modern room, but the staff was the best experience. Very helpful and friendly. :-) We did not try the restaurant so no comments on that. 

The hotel was a good 15-20 min walk from the busy tourist streets but it was OK. The hotel itself was in a quiet street which was very pleasant and calm. Free parking on the street since we stayed only from Saturday til Sunday. ",5,2014,07,31
208,Pretty good,"I spent 4 pleasant nights at the Dylan.  The hotel is charming and the staff is superb. The rooms were very nice, but the bathrooms are small and a bit oddly configured.  The bar is great, and the food is good, but overpriced.  I loved the location and the front patio.",4,2014,07,23
208,A beautiful gem,"My mom and I stayed at the Dylan in the beginning of June. We arrived from our long flight to be cheerily greeted by the lovely receptionist Madison. She was very sweet and accommodating. The rooms were spotless and very quiet. The location is perfect if you don't want to be in Dublin's center, but it is still a walkable distance from most major attractions.",5,2014,07,17
208,Amazing hotel,"I was here a few weeks ago in the private dinning room food was amazing staff very helpful and a beautiful hotel, room was stunning with everything and more than you need. Love the tv in the bathroom.",5,2014,07,09
208,A little paradise in the middle of town,"My first two days/nights in Ireland were spent at the Dylan Hotel. And what a way to start the vacation! The look and feel is elegant and peaceful. The staff is gracious and genuinely helpful. Best of all, given the slender tendencies of the Dublin streets, many sites and shopping were within easy walk. Definitely recommend the Dylan!",5,2014,07,06
208,Stylish & Cosy ,"I really like the location, the rooms- including the bathrooms are good, however I did bruise myself very badly getting out of the bath as it also doubled up as a shower tray! Otherwise a chic hotel with pleasant staff & good service. Stylish bar, terrace & restaurant. I would go back despite the bruise!",4,2014,07,02
208,Great hotel,"Just stayed three days at The Dylan.  It's our favorite spot when in Dublin.  All the rooms are slightly different, so the downside is you can sometimes find yourself with a rather small room.  This hotel has become very popular over the past three to five years.  It's first class for small functions as the staff take very good care of their guests.  Breakfast is excellent here also.  

This is an excellent location for walking into the city and easy for public transport also.

Overall a nice hotel just south of the city.",4,2014,06,22
208,A fine and pleasant stay,"I stayed at the Dylan for two night in a luxury room.  I thought the finishes and d√©cor were top notch, the linen and bedding was also very high quality.  All the electronic appliances were also very high quality.  My room was quiet and the other problem people seem to have had with non-soft closing doors seems to have stopped.  My breakfast was also very good, there is certainly a lot of choice and the champagne on ice, ready to make a bucks fizz was a really nice touch.  Very friendly staff too.

All in all it was a pretty pleasant experience.  The hotel does have a luxurious feel to it which I enjoyed.

I had a few niggles - it's a 5 star hotel after all and I was paying more than ‚Ç¨250 a night...

I was disappointed to not have a bath, when I booked I asked for a room with a bath but there were none available when I checked in.

The service in the bar area really needs to step itself up.  I've stayed in loads of 5 star hotels (even non-5 star hotels) where the service is miles better.  I asked the barman if he could make me a particular drink not that common in the UK and Ireland and he said curtly, ""of course I know to make that."" Turns out he didn't have a clue and the drink was not what I ordered but I found it too funny to complain.

I then waited more than half an over for my salad in the terrace area out the back.  And no one came to check on me in all that time to ask if I needed anything and I wasn't offered any nuts when I sat down which other patrons were.

My key card stopped working twice and each time I had to mission downstairs to get it updated.  On the way up the second time, the front desk staff man said oh, best not put it near your phone as it can wipe the card.  Ok, thanks for letting me know.  Maybe a good idea to tell your guests at the beginning of their stay?

And sadly, my room wasn't turned down on the second night of my stay.  I think possibly because at 5.30pm I was in the room (someone knocked and gave me a chocolate and a bottle of water) but they really should have made a note and come back.  It's something I would have completely expected from a 5 star hotel.

I really think if they iron these little things out this will be a top-class hotel.",4,2014,06,20
208,Boutique Charm in Dublin,"Stayed here on business with my partner --it was not our first choice as that was booked at the time--but it turned out to be quite nice.  The service is excellent, very kind people working there who are pleasant to deal with.  We had some problems with the heater in our room and they were very diligent in dealing with it.  Our room was absolutely huge, very unique decor and had a lovely view of the church --we absolutely loved the spaciousness--the bathroom was very simple and could use some updating but it was practical and worked fine for our stay.

We had breakfast at the hotel every morning and enjoyed the service/quality of the food--we also opted for dinner a few nights and both the restaurant and bar had some great options we enjoyed (love the soda bread with the soup on a chilly night).

The hotel is located in a residential area, which was nice--although we had stayed by the Grand Canal before and I personally prefer that location--this location had its benefits in that if you wanted to go for a jog in the morning you are a few blocks from the canal and can enjoy a stroll there.  There is no gym in the hotel, but they do offer to take you to a private gym next door that has a few treadmills (free of charge)...I would have preferred a gym at the hotel that allowed for some diverse exercise options as it can be a little cold to go running outdoors in the morning, but that is a personal preference.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2014,06,17
208,Excellent Boutique Hotel!!,"Quite expensive at 209 Euros per night for bed only, and an extra 25 Euros for the full Irish breakfast. Having said that it was to a very high standard and 100% clean at all times.  The staff were amazingly helpful and friendly as all the Irish folk seem to be. Evening dinner again was top price but extremely well presented and enjoyable. There was an outside sitting area to the front and a heated sitting are at the rear with TV and heaters.",5,2014,05,31
208,My favourite hotel in Ireland!!!,"The Dylan has all the extra special touches most others don't. The decor throughout is very cool and chic and the rooms I've stayed in have been huge with heated bathroom times, docking station for music, dreamy beds and fantastic customer service. The bar is very busy at the weekends with locals as well as guests which is a sign of a very popular place!! The restaurant while okay is overpriced and I would always go out to eat somewhere else given the option. Recommend this hotel to anyone :) ",5,2014,05,31
208,Great hotel,"This wonderful boutique hotel is worth staying at.
Located in a very nice street, you can walk anywhere without being in the center of Dublin.
The hotel is charming , elegant and extravagant, every room is different than the next one.
The service is great, everybody is eager to help you, we arrived at 3 AM and it was such a pleasure the way the concierge welcomed us.
The breakfast was delicious and the coffee was the best.
The terrace is a great place to rest and have a drink after a long day of touring around.",5,2014,05,28
208,"Amazing hotel, made our Engagement Weekend perfect","This hotel is beautiful, you can tell there has been a lot of money spent on the place and it looks great as soon as you walk in. Lots of taxi drivers commented on what a nice area it is and the hotel is well known as being a good one. Very close to centre - walked everywhere within minutes. My now fiance took me there as part of his proposal weekend with a surprise trip to Dublin and it was perfect from start to finish. 

The real gem about this place is the staff - Maddison and the other staff made us feel welcome, like nothing was too big an ask and were very accomodating with my fiance's surprises - they even gave him use of their meeting room and the guy on reception lent him his personal laptop to play a DVD he had put together. Had several ice buckets sent to the home for champagne we had bought, the first one even arriving with a cocktail glass full of strawberries. 

Lovely balcony and large bath, had breakfast on the balcony the next morning (there is a tesco just down the road for drinks and snacks). 

Really beautiful friendly boutique hotel that we will recommend to everyone, we will definitely visit again.",5,2014,05,28
208,Boutique style property well located for Dublin attractions,++++ Beautifully decor'd hotel. Really excellent heated smoking patio.  Good check-in. Very clean rooms. Great location. Plenty of staff on duty. On street parking or on site at ‚Ç¨20 per day.  If you are a whiskey lover a trip to Searsons bar next door is a must.----- Pricey for beverages. Standard of cooked breakfast was excellent but buffet rather limited we found.,4,2014,05,27
208,"Informal Chic, good location","Great location between Landsdowne Road Stadium and the city Centre. 15 mins walk to Landsdowne Road and about 15-20mins walk to Trinity College. The area it is in feels very residential, almost like Hampstead in London and the hotel itself is in a quiet area, but you are not too far from the city centre.

The d√©cor reminds me of Malmaison hotels I have stayed in England. Well appointed room with a very comfortable bed.  Our booking did not include breakfast but the menu for all meals looked good, if not slightly pricey.

Dylan is a chic boutique hotel, maybe not great if you are on a budget, but good for a weekend to treat yourselves.",4,2014,05,26
208,Why can't they get service right,"Such a lovely hotel yet so frustrating with the service today. As can happen in a busy boutique hotel service can be somewhat diminished but not when there are 5 waiters for 12 people. Food ordered, food arrives no cutlery, 5 min wait food goes cold etc etc",2,2014,05,18
208,Decent hotel but booking mess up and small noisy room,"This is a decent boutique hotel and we got a good deal with HotelTonight for a same day rate. However, the first problem arose when we arrived and our booking was not recorded on the hotel's system. The system doesn't update on a Saturday apparently. The room itself was nicely decorated but rather small for a 5 star in Dublin. It was directly over the bar so it was noisy at night as furniture seemed to be moved about below us. The bar area itself was pleasant to have a drink. ",3,2014,05,10
208,Superb boutique hotel,Celebrated our second anniversary with our first trip to Dublin. This is a truly lovely hotel within easy walking distance of the city centre. Delightful rooms which are spotless and well appointed. Reception and bar staff are charming. Would strongly recommend the Dylan to those lovers of small independent hotels.,5,2014,05,06
208,Outstanding Hotel and Service,It was by far the nicest place we stayed in while in Ireland.  The hotel was spotless and beautifully appointed.  The staff was outstanding in their service.  The breakfast service was great as was the food.  I am a heavy traveler - and this property was all around one of the best.,5,2014,04,24
208,"""Fabulous boutique hotel, superb service and food""","My family celebrated my Dad's surprise 70th birthday last weekend at the Dylan. We all had the most wonderful experience, one that we will remember for a lifetime. From the moment my parents arrived to the hotel the staff went out of their way to make them feel very special. Oscar and Gary in particular were both so professional, kind and extremely attentive! We had our own private dining room which was beautifully set and the food was delicious. My parents bedroom was lovely, stylish and spacious. I would highly recommend this hotel for any family celebrations.",5,2014,04,24
208,Private Hotel in Perfect Location,"The Dylan is private hotel set in idyllic south city location - a close walk (15mins max) to the city centre but without the noise pollution. Great restaurants and bars nearby, and lots of green space nearby to go for a morning run! 

Rooms are lovely, stylish & spacious with good bathroom space-  Ren products and rain showers. I've stayed in numerous Dublin hotels, and this is my fave.  

Staff are lovely and unimposing, but always there to help with any query. Good bar - and lots of space there and on terraces to get lost in a good book if required!",4,2014,04,19
208,Outstanding Boutique Hotel!!,"Over the moon we chose this hotel for a 2 night stay with my fiancess and like to stay somewhere different and romantic. This place goes oer and above to make you have a great stay, the attention to detail was fantastic - we walked into our room with an iPod playing music and the tv welcoming us with my name on, fantastic!

We paid for the middle type room and it ws very roomy and well lit, great detailing with  a slightly raised square peice in the ceiling with concealed upward facing spotlights that romantically lit the room.

The bathroom was very modern with a seperate bath and shower. There was a balcony with table and chairs to overlook the courtyard. Plenty of wardrobe space and floor to celing mirrors opposite the wardrobes and as you first walk in the room - my lady loved it whilst getting ready  as well as the large dresser and mirror.Big comfy bed and a good nights sleep!

The staff are for attentive and nothing is too much trouble, we requested restaurants and bars from different members of staff and they were more than happy to give you some local advice!

All amenities in the room as youd expect, great toiletries, tea/coffee, hairdryer, minibar, slippers, dressing gowns, vanity sets as well as nice touches like ipod docking station, Smart TV with music/movies and bottles of water with a great turn down service.

Cocktail bar is very good and the barmen are great had no end of top drinks. Only regret was we didnt eat here as we only had 3 days. It's the lower end of baggot street which from what I could tell was quite affluent. 20mins odd walk up to grafton street then templebar but there are some great traditional irish bars along baggot street that aren't touristy like those in templebar - O'Donoghues and Toners beer garden round the back! The restaurants around this area are the best in Dublin. 

Dylan thanks for the great stay, when I visit Dublin again I will only stay here and thoroughly recommend!!",5,2014,04,14
208,Continues to set a high standard,"I have stayed at the Dylan on half a dozen occasions now and each time I have been impressed. Rooms are comfortable and nicely appointed, and all those I have stayed in have been very spacious. The staff are welcoming and the service helpful.  Breakfast is particularly good - lovely eggs benedict and the full Irish is also very tempting.  Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2014,04,12
208,Beautiful stay!,"Was here in March for a rugby weekend so it was a perfect location, very close to the rugby grounds! 
The staff was seriously under pressure as it was so busy but they were still friendly and efficient! Our room was ready even though we arrived early and the girl at check in was very helpful with valet parking and directions!
The rooms were clean and absolutely beautiful. Loved the iPod and docks as an extra touch..! Just made it that bit more special. 
Location to everything was great and not too far anyway from anything. Will definitely be back! Can't wait for another visit!!",5,2014,04,06
208,Almost perfect,"Just a superb boutique hotel, would love to go back. The room was lovely, bed comfortable, but the noise from the heating/air conditioning unit was a bit too loud for our liking and it was too hot inside to turn it off. But that's a small and the only complaint. The staff are excellent, the decor is stunning, the food is great and breakfast was up there with the best my wife and I have ever had.",4,2014,04,01
208,Great Hotel,"This place is awesome! Its an awesome hotel conveniently located to everything. The rooms are beautiful and the food is amazing, but what really makes it great is the staff. Zoltan and Barry at the front desk went out of their way to ensure that our short stay in beautiful Dublin was enjoyable. They were always ready with a recommendation or a map or a ticket. Truly first class service. Will definitely be back one day!",5,2014,03,29
208,"Super service, great food!",We stayed here when we went to the rugby and we had our kids with us. Tge hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful.  They put 2 roll away beds in our room with no extra charge. We ate in the restaurant  ‚Ç¨8.50 for starter and ‚Ç¨21 for main really good value and the food was great. Breakfast also fab and they couldn't do enough for the kids. Service overall was fantastic & friendly. ,5,2014,03,24
208,I keep coming back,"I stay at the Dylan whenever I have to visit our office on Baggot Street - and they have never failed to impress. The element that stands out the most is the wonderful staff and the service that they offer. No hotel is perfect, so of course issues can crop up occasionally, but it is the way the Dylan deals with any problems that sets them apart. I always feel like a valued guest.",5,2014,03,21
208,not great location but good service,"stayed here for 2 nights last week as a treat for me and the wife.
location isnt the bestt but the service was 5 star.rooms were beautiful, we only had breakfast one morning but the food was very good.No gym on site but that wasnt a big deal.",4,2014,03,19
208,overpriced,"stayed here for 2 nights to attend a conference at the four seasons (20 minute walk away)

hotel is very overpriced for what you get.  rooms are nice with all the latest technology but nothing really exceptional.  the wi-fi broke in my room initially so i had to wait for that to be fixed.  i couldn't work the phone at all as its a bit high tech whereas I am not!  rooms are quite dark which is irritating at times.

my room overlooked the hotel entrance so anyone walking into the hotel can look into the room. there were no net curtains in addition to the proper curtains to allow daylight in without people being able to see in.

we arrived back one night at around 12 and wanted cocktails from the bar.  we were told this was not possible and we could have one drink before the bar closed - not really great service.

at around 300 euros a night this was very overpriced and i would not rush to stay there again.",3,2014,03,19
208,1st Class,"This hotel was simply excellent. From the moment we arrived the location and building were beautiful and the hotel staff were attentive and beyond friendly. We were offered complimentary valet due to an earlier booking mistake (not even hotels fault)! The room was beautiful and had everything you could need, including an iPod with a great selection of music. Only complaint was a few noisy doors and an ok view from our patio doors. The bathroom was impeccable and shower excellent. Breakfast was beautiful and service throughout was again excellent. The concierge Martin was fantastic and really looked after us, from getting the car and printing theatre tickets- the hotel is lucky to have him!!",5,2014,03,12
208,Top notch,"The Dylan hotel ticks all the boxes - although location isn't as central it is well worth the trip. A boutique hotel with all the services (even if they don't have a gym, they offer access to one around the corner free of charge). Very friendly service, great rooms",4,2014,03,07
208,Excellent restaurant,"We had our wedding reception in the Hotel's Restaurant on Feb, 25th. We couldn't choose better. The food was amazing, staff very professional and all the atmosphere in the Hotel charming and luxurious. The Polish waiter, who served us, was very attentive, but not at all intrusive, definitely top class.",5,2014,03,05
208,Brilliant place to stay,"We loved staying here.  It was slightly tucked away from the main hub but easy walk to shops and pubs.  The service was wonderful and if you go you MUST have breakfast brought to you in your room...it totally made our experience complete.  It has everything and more that you expect from the music centre in the room, luxy bath and big comfortable bed.
Want to go back!",5,2014,02,27
208,Top notch,We stayed here for a night and I have to say we will be back again. The receptionist Madison could not be more helpful and accommodating.  Also martin in concierge was really a credit to the hotel. Absolutely everything from start to finish was done to perfection...down to even leaving bottles of water in our car after we left. Well done guys....you do it all right. See you again for sure on our next trip to Dublin,5,2014,02,27
208,Fantastic Time at the Dylan Hotel,"I booked the Dylan Hotel for my boyfriend's birthday and we had the most wonderful time. From the moment we checked in the hotel staff were so friendly and warm. Even though we were checking in early they made us feel really welcome. 

The room was modern, spotless and very comfortable. They had an ipod shuffle playing music when we arrived in the room which was a nice touch. 

Every member of staff we encountered were very friendly and professional. As a customer service manager I have high standards so was pleasantly surprised. We had drinks in the bar which were delicious and sandwiches ordered to the room which were also tasty. 

As it was my boyfriend's birthday the staff had left us two cupcakes and a card in our room which I thought was a lovely touch. 

All in all I can't wait to back!",5,2014,02,25
208,One of the top hotels in Dublin,"I was recently taken to the Dylan as a birthday surprise by my girlfriend. We have been fortunate enough to stay in some wonderful hotels in Ireland and the Dylan is certainly up there as one of the best. 

From the first greeting by the staff on the front desk through to the bar staff it was a pleasure to stay here.

We received an upgrade to one of the experience rooms on the 3rd floor which was exceptional. The ipod playing U2 on arrival was a nice touch.

The room was very spacious with a large bed set in the centre and a desk backing onto it and the TV in the bathroom is always a luxury you don't realise you need until you have one.

We've both had the Dylan on the list to stay for a long time and it didn't just live up to expectations the whole experience exceeded them. Looking forward to going back.",5,2014,02,25
208,Chic,Beautiful hotel in a wonderful location just a short walk to Grafton street. A welcome and very friendly check in. Rooms are beautiful. The hotel is very chic. Will definitely stay here the next time I'm in Dublin. There is a wonderful Malaysian restaurant just around the corner which is well worth checking out.,5,2014,02,21
208,Just Perfection,"My husband booked the Dylan for Valentines weekend.  On arrival we were automatically upgraded (very cool)  We got checked in early (bonus) Staff more than helpful & friendly!
Room was beautiful.  We also had drinks in the bar & breakfast, both were first class!  We also availed of the parking. Wifi was excellent.  Really all in all I could not fault this hotel at all.  Lovely small 5* hotel.

Will most certainly return!",5,2014,02,20
208,Wonderful Weekend away!,"We arrived on a wet Friday night in January and had such a warm welcome that it really set the tone for the weekend.
Check in was quick and easy. Our room was wonderful- large comfy bed, excellent wardrobe/ dressing area, great bathroom with a bath and shower (boxes ticked for me and him) and tea and coffee making facilities.
The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from the centre, but this suited us well. We enjoyed the walk past lots of georgian buildings, up the wide streets. 
Breakfast was extra for the room rate we had, but I have to say it was probably the best I have had. The buffet was a good selection of fruit, pastries and cereals- amazing homemade granola and yoghurt. The cooked options were so lovely I wanted to stay another day- I had porridge one day and pancakes another. He had more traditional cooked breakfast and eggs benedict- so all options are covered. 
The bar was also a highlight- great atmosphere, friendly and great drinks. 
Despite the weather we had a great weekend and really enjoyed the hotel. Our room had a balcony- sadly we didn't get to use this though!",5,2014,02,18
208,Style and Substance,Fantastic old town house located not too far from Dublin City Centre (5/10mins in a cab). The hotel mixes a really nice contemporary vibe with traditional architecture. The service I found to be absolutely fantastic and the standard of the room was exceptionally high. Fresh milk in the fridge is always a nice touch for a travelling Englishman after a cup of tea :) only down side I can think of would be that the bed was a little too short for me (I am 6ft 3ins so it's more likely my fault. This was not a big deal though - genuinely fab hotel and will deffo be booking again.,4,2014,02,12
208,Great hotel,"This was my first trip to Ireland and staying at the Dylan gave me a very good first impression of the city. It is conveniently located, the staff is warm and friendly, the hotel atmosphere is great. The room is very spacious, the internet bubble worked really well, the decor is great, and there is obvious attention to detail everywhere. I particularly liked the iPod in the room with docking station, which were nice little touches. I highly recommend staying at the Dylan, for business or pleasure.",5,2014,02,10
208,Poor Service & Valet Parking,"I attended a function at the Dylan hotel on Sunday 1st February.  Service is very poor in many respects but a 20 minute wait for 2 cups of coffee and asking after it with 3 different waiters who each asked if I wanted to order. Seems to be no problem with alcohol based drinks from the bar but coffee or soft drinks meet a long delay. I used the valet parking which was very convenient but car returned covered in bird droppings and not a word of explanation or warning. Unbelievable for a 5 Star hotel, I still cannot believe it, where was the car parked by the valet service? Abysmal really.",2,2014,02,03
208,Amazing,"Best hotel I have had the pleasure of staying in. Could not fault a thing. I got engaged in this hotel which served to be the perfect setting. Every part of our stay was made more memorable by the quality of the Hotel. They had got every detail right.
I have recommended the Dylan to everyone I know travelling to Dublin. The food was also perfect.

Could not recommend enough",5,2014,02,03
208,Dylan hotel,"For the first time we visit Dylan hotel in Dublin,and just to say thanks to my sister and all the staff at Dylan hotel for the warn welcome,professionalism and outstanding work during the stay.we  recommended Dylan hotel to everyone who wants to enjoy life.",5,2014,01,26
208,A pleasant visit to their hotel bar,"Another place that's been on my ""I've been meaning to"" list for years, I finally graced its doors for some pre-Christmas cocktails. 

Firstly, I needed to leave something at reception for safekeeping, the gentleman there kindly obliged while all the time being extremely polite, addressing me a madam. How nice.

I enjoyed some cocktails with my sister and her friends. It was very comfortable and luxurious. The floor staff were very attentive and very patient too.

The cocktails themselves: I had a Sidecar to start for 12 EUR, it was ok, too sour for my tastes. Next I had one of their own creations called a Southside Fizz, I think, for 9.50 EUR. It was pleasant enough. 

I retrieved my property as I leave and I am shown from reception to a waiting taxi outside. I cannot fail the staff here in the Dylan, they are impeccably helpful and polite. I would recommend this as a hotel on their customer service alone. 

While the cocktails were fine, I doubt very much I will be back for a drink. I don't mix in the kind of circles that socialise in the bar here. But for the folk who were here in the Dylan bar, they all looked very at home and happy.",4,2014,01,08
208,"Loved this hotel, incredibly friendly and helpful staff","I stayed at the Dylan for a week while in Dublin on business, and I was SO happy with the choice! The staff was very friendly and made the stay very pleasant. Though not located in the main downtown area, it's only a 20 minute or so walk, so I still got plenty of site-seeing in during my trip and still had very restful nights. The breakfast included made-to-order omelets and the smoked salmon option was a delightful treat. Overall, lovely hotel!",5,2014,01,02
208,5 star stay,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for New Years Eve and had a wonderful time, it is one of the nicest hotels in Dublin and we couldn't really find fault with anything (other than not being able to stay longer!)
We arrived by car but the parking is Valet only, it is 20 euro per night but this was included in our stay. We were helped to our room with our luggage and spent time getting acquainted with the beautifully appointed room, we stayed in 303. The room was spacious, spotless and very very modern and comfortable. Lovely touches such as locally sourced confections were very welcome, as was the personalised greeting upon arrival in the room. We ate in our room and can recommend the Dylan Burger, fabulous. Drinks in the bar were great with a huge array of cocktails, spirits and beers. We drank far too many cocktails but they were so wonderful we can't really be blamed!
The hotel is pricey but unike other places, in this regard you do get what you pay for and I would recommend the Dylan to anyone interested, a wonderful stay.",5,2014,01,01
208,Great hotel!,"Nice, clean, spacious room. Employees were very helpful, professional and courteous. Great Irish breakfast. Great location if attending event at aviva stadium-between stadium and St. Stephen's Green. I would stay there again.",5,2013,12,30
208,"Fantastic, warm & friendly hotel","The Dylan hotel is just lovely. The rooms are beautiful and more than adequately sized. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The food is excellent, especially breakfast. It's a very short walk to local pubs and restaurants and about a 20 min walk to the center of Dublin. I'd highly recommend the Dylan and most definitely will stay there again. And for those of you that smoke, whilst all hotels now don't allow it, the Dylan has a really nice covered and heated outdoor patio area with TV's and comfortable rattan furniture right next to the main bar and restaurant.",5,2013,12,27
208,Pure luxury,"What a treat this hotel is! Service, room, ambiance... just wonderful. Breakfast and dinner - amazing. If staying in the hotel, you must try the restaurant! While we were there the Irish Masterchef crew were filming in the kitchen, which says a lot. 

Our room was tastefully decorated with great little touches. A drink in the bar is also a must. It's classy, while at the same time relaxing. A lovely way to finish off the day. 

We've definately found our go-to hotel whenever we're in Dublin again.",5,2013,12,21
208,Relaxing stay pampered - too short!,"From the welcome to departure, the staff were warmly welcoming.  At first, I thought you had to be a man to work here, but I did see a lady at the front desk at check out.  While staying here, we were attending a theatre in the city and had late supper close by.  I was sorry we did not have more time in the hotel as we had no time to eat or drink downstairs.  Also, our bedroom was so beautiful.  I also loved the bathroom which had a decent sized shower as well as a fine sized bath.  There was a TV in the bathroom for those so inclined - I was not.  Our room overlooked the front of the hotel which is on a quiet Ballsbridge Road.  I heard nothing during the night.  Beautiful hotel for a special treat.  Customer service is important here.",5,2013,12,12
208,Nice but over priced,"Stayed here May 2012 for a birthday function. Location was okay - outside the CBD/shopping district but only a 15min Walk away. Room - we had a double room up in  the ""roof"", room was poky and dark (one very small window). But at least it was clean. Considering the price i was very disapointed. The hotel itself was very modern, ""designer"" touches everywhere. Service from the staff excellent. Breakfsst not included but it was decent enough (tried the full irish breakfast) and well priced.",4,2013,12,03
208,Comfortable and character,"A comfortable and well designed boutique hotel, excellent food - the breakfast kippers are really a treat. Service  seems to get mixed reviews and having been woken by room service at 1.15 am, presumably with someone else's order and having breakfast arrive just before i had to go, this rings true, equally very helpful in other ways. Preferring some character to another chairn hotel, I would stay again.",4,2013,11,30
208,Very Special,"My husband and I booked this via Mr & Mrs Smith as we were given vouchers for our birthday. We arrived on a high after a wedding in Wexford and were not at all disappointed. The room was gorgeous, quirky and big - felt like we were in a suite! The staff were very attentive and we were never left waiting to be served at reception, the bar or the restaurant. Bar and restaurant food great and cocktails too! Great location for the City centre as only a 20 minute walk. Highly recommend",5,2013,11,27
208,Not 5 star!,"Stayed here for a night with my wife on an bed, dinner and breakfast special. Hotel itself is very nice, room was great too and the bed was lovely and comfortable. Only issue with the hotel is the bad service and it's far from 5 star in this regard. Ordered a martini with olives and the waiter dropped it down without olives stating that they had none and would that be ok? Bear in mind he had already had the drink mixed up under the pretense that I would accept it! I told him no - he seemed a bit perplexed by my response and reluctantly took it away. The other thing was the food in the restaurant which was far from perfect. We were given the wrong menus to start. No wine menu was given either so none was ordered! My venison came out over cooked and after repeatedly reminding the waiter that my wife was celiac he gave her a creme br√ªl√©e that was covered in a fine wheat crumb and chocolate sprinkle mix. She would have been violently sick had she eaten it. Overall the service was poor and the food just mediocre at best. I couldn't even bring myself to complain to management about the dessert issue as by then I had had enough and couldn't be bothered raising the issue as I know I'll never be back - that 5 star service you would expect is simply not there. ",3,2013,11,25
208,Mr Sean Read,"Day 1 in Dublin
We have just got to the Hotel after a late flight and the service on checking in was very helpful and the Room we have is 4* we just ordered room service and it was fast friendly and hot, so far so good I will let you know more as the weekend goes on, if they keep this service up I will be very happy.
",4,2013,11,15
208,Nice hotel but overpriced.,"Enjoyed a couple of nights at The Dylan for the rugby at the RDS which meant this was conveniently located. The service was very good, from the front desk to the concierge and my father and I enjoyed the bar and restaurant. The room had two comfy beds and plenty of space but I can't honestly say it was stunning ... potentially it's on the verge of requiring a refresh. I like this hotel but can't shake the nagging feeling that's its a little overpriced.",4,2013,11,12
208,The Script weekend,"I booked this hotel for a special weekend in Dublin, it was expensive, the decor was beautiful, our flight was late in arriving, we ordered room service when we arrived , but I have to say the food was awful, I brought this to the attention of the duty Manager in the morning and it was wiped off our bill, also when we returned to our room there was a card of apology and two cup cakes, waiting for us, the prices are high, the breakfast was lovely, the staff were helpful but still need to go that extra mile for the customers as this isn't cheap, our room was lovely and everything worked. I would return to this hotel as it's close to Grafton Street and the shopping.",5,2013,11,11
208,Nice looking place.. to get ripped off,"We stayed here for a very special night and admittedly booked at the last minute so I expected to pay a bit of premium.  However having paid over ‚Ç¨¬†300 for one night, including extortionate parking fees.. I was utterly amazed to find my rate didn't include breakfast.  Now you can define rip-off whatever you like.. but in this country at these times there is no other way I'm ever going to view this other than a complete rip off.    The concierges were arrogantly dismissive of my shock and embarrassment after walking into the breakfast room to be informed of this.  The parking fee was the straw that broke the camels back.  There's nothing special about this place at all and represents everything that went wrong with the hotel industry in the greed boom.  All frills and dressing, no idea of real service and not a clue what value for money means.  That doesn't mean cheap.. people who can afford to pay these rates should still seek value for money.

What should have been a nice stay, turned into a very sour experience.. I never thought a Dublin hotel would top The Clarence for sheer arrogance but it comes free in bucket loads if your unlucky enough to stay here.   Do yourself a favour, pay a few extra euros and check into the Four Season's or The Shelbourne if you want to treat yourself.  Avoid this place at all costs !",1,2013,11,08
208,Very disappointed,"Upon arrival I should have known things weren't going to go well. Valet parking was an astonishing price. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready. No probs and we decided to go for a drink. We came back about 5ish and the reception desk was crazy busy. Ok so we went to the bar for another drink..... Bar staff seemed disinterested and looked a bit shabby to be honest.
We checked in when the queue died down and both of us were delighted with the room.... At first! 
On closer inspection the room looked shabby and in need of a refurb. The tv in the bathroom didn't work, one bedside lamp was falling apart and the head board was loose on the bed.
We reported the issues as we left for dinner and we were told that they would be addressed.
Arrived back to the Dylan at 11pm and nothing had been done.

We will not be rushing back!!",1,2013,11,06
208,Great hotel close to Grafton Shopping and fun nightlife!,"Loved the design and the location of this hotel.  Quick and refreshing walk to the popular shopping areas as well as fun pubs.  The staff was very helpful - though I did feel like the concierge, Martin, was getting a cut from Hertz on car rentals as the prices he was quoting on the smallest car possible was more than what I paid at Eurocar for a BMW 5 series.  So... be a big leery of that.",4,2013,10,31
208,Not a 5 star,"Rooms are very small. Wear and tear has taken its toll. Carpets ripped in our room. Standard double bed with uncomfortable pillows.
There is only one 5 star in ballsbridge. The four seasons. This place doesn't even come close to its standard. Def would not visit again.  ",3,2013,10,28
208,Excellent in every way,"We have stayed in several Dublin city centre hotels but this was in a class of its own. From the helpfulness of the desk staff when we called to say our flight was delayed to the attention of the restaurant staff when we eventually had our very late dinner, they couldn't have been nicer or more professional. The rooms are a great size, spacious and stylish. We liked the fact that it was a little out of the city centre. Still walking distance to town but benefitted from being quieter and leafier in a pleasant neighbourhood with decent local pubs. Have sung the Dylan's praises to all our Dublin-bound friends and would definitely stay here again. ",5,2013,10,26
208,Really nice,"The Dylan was a lovely place to stay. The design of the hotel is really different and quirky. However, as other reviewers have said, there is some wear on the furnishings in the bedrooms and also in the bathrooms but the accommodation is still to a very high standard. It is a little way away from the centre of Dublin but in a lovely quiet area. The staff were fantastic and very helpful. The bar is also nice and seems to be popular with guests and locals.",4,2013,10,21
208,Quirky and Fun,"I liked this hotel.  It's quirky and has a great vibe. The staff were outstanding, and the rooms had everything needed. Breakfast was functional with a combination of buffet and al a carte. The local area is  nice - more of a neighbourhood feel, but some nice bars and restaurants.  Distance to Central Dublin is about a 20 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride - so central enough.  Given the right circumstances, I would stay here again.",4,2013,10,19
208,"quirky hotel, great location","We stayed in the Dylan a little while ago for a special occasion. We were staying in a suite which was lovely but the tv in the bathroom did not work, which was very dissapointing, especially when you are paying five star prices...you do expect everything to be perfect. The food and servie was good and the staff were extremely pleasant.",4,2013,10,08
208,"Fun hotel, quiet neighborhood","This is a late review, as we stayed at the Dylan last December.  Nonetheless, it was a great choice for us.  It's in a quiet neighborhood, just a block away from a main street with great restaurants & pubs within 2 blocks.  Close enough to the river that we walked.  We stayed in the Experience Suite - very large rooms, comfortable bed, nice view to a garden and fountain next door.  We both had colds, didn't feel great, but our suite was an enjoyable place to be anyway.  Staff was very professional and friendly at the same time - a great combination.  The restaurant was able to seat us on a weekend night, even though we didn't have reservations.  Delicious food, friendly wait staff.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,10,06
208,First time in Dublin,"Read several reviews on this site and have had a wonderful stay.  We left our larger luggage with the hotel on a two day trip to Galway.  Heading back to Dublin and back to Dylan.  Very helpful staff, great rooms.  Nice quiet boutique hotel with bank around the corner, perfect for exchanging $$ and restaurant which were all great.  Free wifi is a bonus.",5,2013,10,06
208,happy staff,"I was so impressed by the genuine attitudes of the staff at this hotel, they had time for formalities, pleasantries, real conversation and humour!   They were extremely helpful in all areas - reception, bar, restaurant and bedrooms.   

Apart from this the hotel itself is full of charm and character.  The cocktails are just fab and the full Irish breakfast ,the morning after,was to die for (after a night of those cocktails!!)",5,2013,09,26
208,Great Hotel,I have eaten here before and regularly meet friends here for a coffee.  Its really a nice hotel which offers all the usual comforts.They do a great Sunday lunch and have a great beer garden where you can enjoy a nice glass of wine and read the days papers.,5,2013,09,19
208,"Pretty hotel, in relaxing surroundings.","This is a very well appointed hotel. Great rooms. Brilliant breakfast. Hotel is on a quiet little road, yet only a minute or so from restaurants and bars ( for example there are not one but two Malaysian restaurants within 300m). Would certainly stay again. ",4,2013,09,17
208,"Well located, smart hotel","Loved staying here. The room was big, comfy and modern. The breakfast was first rate and the service was excellent. The hotel is in walking distance of the centre of the city but quiet enough to feel that you're not on top of everything. Can't really fault it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart place to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,09,17
208,Lovely boutique hotel close to city centre,A modern clean cosy hotel in a quite part of Dublin's city centre. The rooms are a little dark and without a view but they have nice lighting that eliminates any gloominess. Great for cocktails or a glass of wine but the restaurant service was below par for the style of food and pricing of menu.,4,2013,09,12
208,No great shakes...,"I don't know what the fuss is about. This place looks ok but doesn't deliver. Front of house staff excellent. Bar staff less so. Barman although accommodating, was scruffy. Place has the ambiance of an Irish country hotel in the 1970s. There's a sharpness you expect in a luxury boutique hotel and this place feels stale and slow. Doors in lobby jammed open to let air circulate? Colour schemes 'dead'. Advertising Facebook on your business card is a bit tacky too.
As I said staff try their best.",3,2013,09,12
208,Hotel With The Wow Factor,"We stayed just one night in this superb hotel which proved to be one of the best we have ever experienced anywhere in terms of its presentation, the sheer professionalism of its customer care, decor and a thrilling sense of style. Wow.",5,2013,09,08
208,A gem of an hotel,"My wife found this hotel and we stayed to celebrate my birthday. What a treat.  On arrival we were given an upgrade . The room was beautiful as was the hotel itself. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with great pillows! It  also had a great sound system.  The hotel is in a quiet area with easy access to the city centre. It really is a luxury boutique hotel. What also makes this hotel so special were the staff. They were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Could not have stayed anywhere nicer for my birthday.  We will go back to this hotel again for a longer stay.",5,2013,09,08
208,Luxury,"Fancy little touches to make a great night's stay become an amazing night to remember. Just all the little details. I'd rather not spoil it, better to experience it as a surprise. You won't regret a night. Here, it's great for a quick romantic getaway.",5,2013,09,04
208,A real 5 star hotel,"I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin over the last few years but this is the only one I would actually want to go back to purely for the experience of staying in it.  I have several dietary needs and the hotel catered for them all, an experience I have not had before in any of the hotels.  The decor and standard of finish in our room was excellent, the iPod not only had great music on it but it also had walking tours of Dublin!  The breakfast was excellent (we had dinner elsewhere) and there was a great range of room dining options available but we did not need to avail of them.  Staff were also a level above other places, right from our arrival to departure we were shown the utmost helpfulness and courtesy.  The hotel is conveniently situated for theatres, shops and sightseeing.  I am looking forward to a return trip here and have no hesitation in recommending Dylan Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2013,09,04
208,Great stay and kind staff.,"We booked this hotel because many others nearer to the city center were fully booked. It turned out to be a lucky break. The hotel was in a great location on a side street within a neighborhood, making the atmosphere quiet and relaxing, even with the windows open. Shops, pubs, and public transportation were available right around the corner. Access to city center and the DART were a comfortable 10 to 15 minute walk. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful, and the hotel had a number of thoughtful touches. 

The hotel is not easily accessible from the airport. The air shuttle drops you off within a few a blocks, but that's difficult to manage with luggage. You can take the city bus from there, but it's still a hassle. Be prepared to pay 30 euro for taxi service to or from the airport.",4,2013,09,04
208,Opulent hotel with thoughtful little touches,"Stayed here with husband. Lovely welcome with cocktails, impressive room although no bath but great shower, real milk for making tea and ipod in room with good music. We had a theatre package but couldn't book dinner til 6pm and show was at 7.30 so although dinner was fabulous we had to rush it to make show. I think restaurant should open at 5.30 to accommodate theatre package. Breakfast was lovely although service was quite slow. Would highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel and only 10min walk from Stephen's Green.",4,2013,09,03
208,The place to stay,"Myself and my wife stayed here for 2 nights and found it to be a wonderful experience. The design and decoration are exceptional, the staff were really helpful and the food was to die for. It is set in a lovely part of Dublin that is within easy walking distance of Stephens Green. I recommend it most highly. Bring a little upmarket romance to your life - you deserve it :-)",5,2013,08,30
208,Fantastic location,This must be just about the best location in Dublin. Walkable distance to the town centre close by Aviva stadium and the RDS and in an area of fine restaurants and even finer pubs. The hotel is a boutique hotel nicely styled rooms are generally very good and the staff and services were first class. We booked through Mr and Mrs Smith which gave us a 'free' breakfast and wine if you dined in house. The breakfast is fine and the restaurant with fairly limited choice is also quite good. The bar is really nice and was very lively over the weekend. The few downsides include somewhat shabby carpets in the hallway and a bathroom that really doesn't work very well. The door opens on to a single sink and the shower above the bath makes the best of very limited space but is not what you want in a first class hotel. Overall we would come again if only for the location. Within minutes you have some great pubs Searsons for one with live jazz and fantastic bars and ambience. Down Baggot street you have great little cafes like Voila and first class Michelin restaurants. ,4,2013,08,12
208,front of house-exceptional,"We stayed here for one night as part of a competition prize. We have never met such a friendly, polite and helpful receptionist to check us in-her name is Maddison. She couldn't have been more helpful, even the following day making time to talk to us and walk us to our taxi. The hotel itself is extremely clean and modern with i pods in the room! Breakfast was delicious with a variety of choices, definitely 5 star food. Bar menu included absolutely everything, many cocktails, beers and wines. We may return in the future but this hotel, as it is 5 star is a bit expensive for us! breakfast 25euro pp and cocktails ranging from 9.50-13euros. Also hotel is very quiet, in a very quiet location.",5,2013,08,10
208,"Just Like Home, But Better!","I have just come back from a weekend in Dublin and I can honestly say that I was incredibly lucky with my choice of hotel. 

I arrived late from London after a day in the office, my flight was delayed, my patience was long spent. I was greeted with a smile, checked in and 5 minutes later was in my room. Which was spacious, luxurious, bright with soft music playing in the background. I poped into a bar for a nightcap where a Black Velvet (champagne + Guinness) radically improved things. 

Now, the beds are divine. They make you feel like floating on air and I was seriously considering skipping sightseeing and meeting friends just so I don't have to leave the bed. (That was my first time in Dublin, so this is saying something.)

The nicest touch was an iPod with pre-loaded somg selection that happen to include all of my favourites and more. I ended up listening to it all the time and even took it out for walks instead of my own, as selection was better. They also come with pre-loaded guided walks, but I took the sight-seeing bus. 

I did not get breakfast with my bed, but it turned out to be a better deal (I am not a fan of buffet breakfast). Both mornings I had my breakfast a la carte in the bar/terrace area and it was a cheaper option. 

The hotel is about 15 minutes walk away from the centre which might seem like a lot, but a quiet night sleep is worth a 10 euro taxi fare from the centre in the evening.

The staff are very welcoming and very friendly - I wish I remembered more of their names, but they did rememebr my name, my room number and my previous choices. It's the small things that make you feel special. 

My only regret is that I did not take their airport transfer option on arrival, as Agustin, the friendly driver who dropped me off to the airport was a pleasure. I will be most definitely coming back to Dublin and I will be definitely staying at the Dylan again.",5,2013,08,05
208,Better to have a cocktail at the Dylan than it is to stay here!,"Stayed here in late June this year. It's a hotel I've always loved going to for cocktails or vino, but staying was really a disappointment.
Arrival and check in was fine, no particular pleasantries or otherwise, valet parking is 20‚Ç¨, and room price was 300‚Ç¨
Room was nice, nice colours of silver, greys etc. well stocked mini bar and goodies hamper available for purchase.
The bar in the hotel, not the rooms, was really busy on the night we were there.
We first had some light lunch, and it took a long time to get ordering. When we did, food came in good time and was tasty.  I ordered an elderflower cocktail and asked for the gin to be changed for Vodka. The first one was lovely. The second was completely different, with way too much lemon. So their cocktails aren't consistent which is a pet hate of mine :)
We went into town for a while and came back at about 5 and wanted to sit in the bar and have a drink. Every single table was reserved but the place was empty. We were told we could sit at the bar where there were 4 seats with one already occupied. I said we were residents at the hotel and wanted a nice seat. So the batman who was nice, checked with someone else and then allowed us to sit at a nice seat. Staying in a hotel like this, I'd expect to be able to use their facilities and be treated with some preference if you are a resident. We also had dinner there, the kitchen was really busy as they had loads of canap√©s to serve into the bar, so service wasn't as good - however they apologised for this at the time, so that was fine.
When we were checking out after yummy brekkie, (although waiter forgot to bring us our 2nd coffee) the valet mentioned that they were so busy the night before and said he hoped it didn't interfere with our stay. I mentioned that yes it had and that it was a disappointment. I also filled in a feedback form, mentioning the biggest disappointment, the bar being too busy for residents, left my email address etc, but 5 weeks on, and I haven't heard from them! Why bother with feedback!,",2,2013,08,01
208,2 nights in Dublin at the Dylan,"The Dylan was a superbly stylish hotel. The bed was DIVINE!!! i can honestly say that it was probably one of the best beds I have had the pleasure of sleeping on!! like a cloud!
The room was very chic. The common parts are similar. The bar was funky and fun. The hotel is in a nice residential part of Dublin about 25 minutes walk to the main centre. We walked along the canal, ate in tons of good restaurants and also -it was easy to eat breakfast in local coffee shops. We'd not gone for the bed and breakfast option",5,2013,07,31
208,Excellent stay! Room was perfect!,"It can be difficult to find a place to stay when basing choices on reviews, location, price, etc.  We had a short stop over in Dublin for a night, but still wanted something decent.  I can't say how convenient the location was since we were only there for a night and didn't venture too far away.  

As for the hotel...the reception area was nice and clean, with attentive and friendly employees. We hit the elevator (which was padded, we joked that it resembled a mental patients room) As we got to our floor, I wasn't sure what to expect because the decor in the hall reminded me sort of a sleazy Vegas hotel.  Some people may like the deep red and black, but it just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the hotel. We got to our room and we were absolutely taken back.  The room was SPOTLESS and tastefully decorated!  No odd smells...clean sheets, clean bathroom and we even got a balcony! Great closet space to put our suitcases. There was a mini bar stocked with goodies too. They had some nice chill music playing from an iPod plugged in. That absolutely set the mood for the rest of the evening!  We had drinks and a snack at the bar. The bartenders were all friendly and talkative, which was fun to hear what they were up to.  

If you have a car, parking is on the street. You have to pay by the hour and it is free sometime after 6 or 7 PM.  We also ate dinner at Paulie's Pizza (about a 15 min walk from hotel). It was great, but VERY small, so be prepared to be quite close to others.  

We would absolutely stay in the Dylan Hotel again if we ever pass through Dublin again.",5,2013,07,28
208,Nice Hotel in a Good Location,This is a nice modern hotel in a good location close to the city centre. Rooms are very well decorated with some nice touches. In general I would have to say that the staff were very friendly and helpful however I did feel that the those serving breakfast's appeared to be a little bit disorganised. On a similar note I felt that some of the bar staff gave the impression that they were working their first night as barmen. Breakfast was nice without being exceptional.,4,2013,07,24
208,Weekend break,"The suite we had was comfortable with nice furnishings. 2 minor issues, firstly the sink in the bathroom is located behind the door making it tight to get in and out and second the TV picture quality was poor ( nowhere near HD).
Staff at the front desk and restaurant were helpful.
 The breakfast was adequate without being sumptuous. Overcooked bacon and black pudding not good! 
The hotel is located in a quiet part of Dublin 4 not far from Baggot Street and St Stephen's Green (20 min walk). 
Overall a pleasant place to stay but not exceptional in terms of a five star hotel experience. ",3,2013,07,15
208,It's an awesome place but some things are overstated,"It's a cool place they are extremely helpful with novices to Europe. One thing that really bugged me though is that they claim to have memory foam mattresses.They don't. One of the reasons I picked the Dylan was I was going to get a mattress like I have at home. I didn't and after a week I needed 2 P.T. appts. to fix my back. Also upon leaving the Dylan READ your bill I found a $ 206.00 (US) error which they corrected immediately once I contacted AMEX. When I inquired with the front desk staff about what I termed a ghost charge they couldn't answer me. 
So, when you arrive at the Dylan pull back the sheets inspect the mattress. My advice trust but verify.",4,2013,07,07
208,Great service,Stayed in the Dylan for first time on a Thursday in June. We were with freinds. We started in the bar and had lovely drinks very well prepared and then we moved out to courtyard which is a lovely space. We unfortunately didn't have dinner there but next morning the breakfast was very good. The room was very well equipped and the bed was excellent. We paid ‚Ç¨220 which I thought was a fair price for the room. I would definitely go back as the staff are great and nothing is a problem. ,4,2013,07,07
208,Boutique hotel in Dublin,"At first I was a little surprised by its location upon arrival in Dublin for the first time, but after navigating around the city a little more I learned (thanks to the Hotel Dylan concierge) that it is only 6~8 mins easy walk from Hotel Dylan to the No. 6 stop of city's ""hop-on-hop-off"" bus tour. I would walk to the bus stop in the morning (EUR24 for two-day pass) and take the hop-on-hop-off to all tourist attractions I would like to visit. If I get tired of walking, I would stay on the bus for sight seeing. Very convenient.

Other than the distance not in the middle of the city center, Hotel Dylan is almost perfect to my likes. Great breakfast selection (its Irish breakfast is good for two meals~ and I could skip lunch if I like), very friendly and helpful concierge services. 

There is also a bus stop 2 mins away from the hotel that I could take into the city center (Bus No. 39 or Bus No. 39A) to hang out - I felt like a local after spending 2 days in Dublin~!",5,2013,07,01
208,Went the extra mile,"A colleague had booked me in for a Monday night - I arrived at 8pm to find that the booking was apparently for Wednesday and they were fully booked on the Monday.  I was given a complementary drink and asked to wait whilst they tried to sort something out or find an alternative hotel in the neighbourhood.  After 15 minutes a room had been found (as long as I could vacate it early the following morning, which suited me fine) and I was checked in, with the offer of another drink for the inconvenience.  

The room itself was lovely - spacious, clean and comfortable.  The only issue was that the picture on the TV was rather dark but I didn't want to watch anything other than the news headlines.  There are a range of restaurants just around the corner of varying cuisines and prices - traditional, Mexican, Malaysian, a diner, pubs etc - and the hotel restaurant menu looks pretty good as well.  Had breakfast on the sunlit terrace in the morning - really good choice, well presented and served quickly and efficiently.

This was my second stay at the Dylan and I will be returning to Dublin fairly frequently, so I will make it my destination of choice when I am next there.",5,2013,06,26
208,Fabulous Hotel,"This is a great hotel and perfect for a luxurious relaxing stay. The rooms are lovely and the bed is very comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly, professional and very helpful. Anything I needed or asked for was provided with speed and ease. 
We had breakfast included which was delicious. 
My friends and I were staying at the hotel as they had just got married and were holding the evening party in the bar area. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for my friends and were extremely generous. 
Try the non alcoholic strawberry mojito it's wonderful. 

I would highly recommend this hotel! I'm being a bit picky but the only small issue I have is that I would advise the hotel to provide better pillows in the room. It's only a tiny gripe though and didn't spoil my stay one bit. During my stay the night reception staff were extremely helpful and very kind. I am using a crutches at the moment and they did everything possible to make me comfortable and my stay stress free.",5,2013,06,24
208,Stunning hotel,"To celebrate a recent special occasion, we decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay in the Dylan Hotel, on a recommedation from a friend. It truly was a wonderful stay... could not fault it from arrival to departure. 

After our warm welcome at reception, we made a our way to our super stylish room, which was spotless. It was a beautiful summer's evening so we decided to have a few drinks on the terrace, which is just off the bar. It really is a great space to sit and enjoy some sun with a few delicious cocktails! We had a dinner reservation, so we made our way into the restaurant where we had an absolutely AMAZING meal. 

After a lovely night's sleep in our very confortable bed, breakfast was a real treat as we got to have it on the front the terrace, which is just off the restaurant. It's a real suntrap there, catching the morning sun. Again the food was delicious and the service was very friendly.",5,2013,06,20
208,That personal touch...,"We stayed on a Thursday as we were attending a function in town. Despite the fact that we arrived quite early..we had no issues checking in...no questions...everything was smooth.
Receptionist was friendly but not overly so. This is by no means a criticism .....sometimes, specially in 5* hotels, the welcome appears to be...fake.
She was nice, explained everything... etc. remained professional. 
Room was amazing. Quiet. Very clean. Beautiful bathroom. Funky phones. Lovely fluffy towels. Soft linen. 
Had lunch in the very busy bar. Food was great. Portions larger than I expected. Food was exactly as the menu said it was going to be. Service...what you would expect from a 5*.We spoke about the weather with our server. We spoke about Dublin. He was nice, once again professional and friendly, but not overly so. 
We did not have dinner  in the Hotel but had a drink at night in the bar when we came back. Waitress was very knowledgeable...recommended an specific gin and a variation to the Classic Cosmo...we really enjoyed the relaxing drink in their Terrace. The Passion Fruit Cosmo was absolutely amazing.... Drinks also came with nibbles...which I loved.
Bed was as comfortable as they come.
Breakfast was amazing. A la carte. Large portions once again. I can recommend without hesitation their eggs Benedictine. Beautiful.
It is not in Dublin city centre but it is well worth the little walk.
It has personality. It has character. It is has not got the chain feeling....Nothing against the Chain ethos but I prefer the personable touches. I will go back.",5,2013,06,11
208,Staff Service,"I arrived  Dublin on an overnight flight the morning of Mon 3 June,2013.
Although my room as not available Colin Brown had another where I could shower and sleep a couple of hours.
The staff were excellent and all were most helpful throughout.
Colin led the charge taking care of any details and following up.
I spent my last 2 nights on the west coast before departing Shannon. Colin made these arrangements as he had worked at several inns in the area.
I would highly recommend the Dylan for business or leisure.
SBM ( Sun 9 June)",5,2013,06,09
208,A real find!,"Our first stay at the Dylan and will definitely return.  The service was warm. friendly and response times super quick.  We booked a twin room and ended up third floor with a balcony.  Spacious, stylish and excellent value.  A lot of attention to detail - from the Ren goodies in the bathroom, to the turndown service and just general touches which lifted the experience above the norm.  The beds were super comfy and the rooms were quiet and airy.  However, we think this may have been the location on the top floor at the rear.  Could be noisy in rooms above the bar?  It's clear the emphasis is on top notch customer service - which they achieve.  Can highly recommend!",5,2013,06,08
208,"A stunning, modern boutique hotel!","I just returned from a stay at the Dylan. I want to return to Dublin and can't imagine staying anywhere else! First of all, it is centrally located but on a quiet side street so that the noise of downtown Dublin never disturbs! The staff are amazing and unbelievably enthusiastically helpful! The Dylan, itself, is a beautiful property, ultra modern but with warm touches so as to avoid looking too cold. We never got tired of looking around at the d√©cor and imagining some of the touches transported to our own homes. There were bowls of tropical flowers, such as orchids, everywhere in the public areas which had many, many places to sit with intimate upholstered chair and sofa groupings. The rooms are huge and beautiful! The food was superb. The extensive bar, which includes a hip drink menu also has an extensive food menu if you don't feel like a full meal for dinner. The bar is clearly a place for professional Dubliners to meet for drinks. On the first floor, there was also a beautiful drawing room/library with a fireplace where you can have a quiet coffee and read the paper or meet with friends. You simply can't go wrong here!",5,2013,06,07
208,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,"A little hard to find and tucked away in a corner but once you find the Dylan you'll never want to leave.  Very good location.  Walking distance to downtown.  Great restaurant that serves excellent meals.  The decor was very special and obviously a lot of thought and creativity went into designing this very unique space.  A TV in the shower!! What a neat idea.  State of the art electronics.  Very quiet, very lovely and we'll go back again.  Terrific staff.  Thanks so much.",5,2013,06,01
208,Excellent Hotel,"Very stylist and clean hotel.
Excellent and spacious rooms with everything you need for your stay.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Nice bar with 2 beer gardens ideal for a summers evening.
Good location.
Rooms, food and drink are expensive, but this comes with any higher quality hotel.
I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2013,05,29
208,Terrific Trip,We received a warm Irish welcome at The Dylan. We had a fabulous spacious room with a very comfortable bed. The staff were all friendly and determined to ensure guests had a happy stay. The restaurant served us a great breakfast too. Special thanks to Colin for the chocolate cup cakes - the perfect treat...,5,2013,05,25
208,A Great Find,"This hotel is on a quiet side street in the Dublin 4 area. The decor is very modern/artsy. The rooms are surprisingly large by European standards. They have a well known chef and a nice menu in the restaurant.  You can walk to most popular areas, although a bit of a hike at times.  Twice our taxi drivers had a little trouble finding it so provide them with nearby cross streets.  Loved the neighborhood.",5,2013,05,19
208,Almost a Brilliant Hotel,"We stayed at the Dylan for a weekend in March and had a really nice time. Unfortunately, there were a couple of problems that marred things a little but first the good points. The Dylan is a nicely converted Victorian building in a nice part of Dublin ‚Äì a pleasant walk from the centre with plenty of interesting pubs and restaurants on the way. It is very much a designer hotel with individually styled chic bedrooms and very modish public areas. The bar and restaurant areas are both stylish and inviting. In fact, despite being very close to some of Dublin‚Äôs very interesting pubs, the bar was actually a place you could easily find yourself wanting to spend time in ‚Äì in contrast to many hotel bars that we have come across. We did not have dinner at the hotel but the breakfast was amongst the best that I have ever had anywhere.
With so many good points, I almost feel churlish mentioning the bad ones but there were two to mention. First of all, the areas just outside the door to the room had a really bad damp smell that penetrated into the entrance to the room. We told the management straight away but they were unable to do anything about it. We were offered another room but we opted to stay in the original one as it was a bit bigger and we liked the decor. Being an old building, I suspect that there was a problem with the guttering. Whatever it was, it needs sorting out. Second, we were woken up early on the Sunday morning by very (and I mean very) loud music from the next room. We phoned reception and they managed to stop it but our sleep had been disturbed by then.
So there you are.  It is very stylish. We had a nice stay but it could have been nicer. That said, the management reacted when we complained but we would rather not have had to complain in the first place and the smell problem was so bad that it could not have just been a recent occurrence.",4,2013,05,17
208,Great stay,"We stayed recently in this gorgeous hotel as a treat for myself and my husband, our first child free break in years..!!everything was exceptional from the warm welcome to the beautiful room and food in their restaurant was sublime. A bit pricey but worth every penny because it was top class.",4,2013,05,14
208,"Spectacular location,a little gem","The Dylan hotel is a little gem of a hotel. Wonderful location.Walking distance to the core of Dublin but in a real neighbourhood,it Allows  the visitor to feel they are living in Dublin. The staff are friendly and helpful,lovely breakfasts too. 
It is also close to shops and other eating establishments. Would definitely choose to stay at the Dylan on my next visit to Dublin",4,2013,05,11
208,Very romantic boutique hotel!,"I was in Dublin on business 2 weeks ago and decided to treat myself to a stay in The 5 star Dylan hotel. I had been to the hotel before but not for dinner or overnight. I asked for an early check in & my room was ready when I arrived. Valet parking not bad value at ‚Ç¨20 for 24 hours.
Small bedroom but very stylish and beautifully decorated. Very comfy bed but the bathroom was a little on the small side! Had a really beautiful dinner that evening, an absolute feast for the eyes & the palate, and a fabulous wine list too. 
It was expensive but it was worth it. The bar, ante rooms & outdoor terraces are so plush, relaxing & really romantic. I can't wait to stay at the Dylan hotel again soon!  ",5,2013,05,09
208,A hidden gem in the city,"A stunning, stylish and elegant gem tucked away in a lovely location.
The service was nothing less than excellent from all the hotel staff.
Breakfast was perfect ( a glass of bubbles added the perfect touch).
The evening meal was delicious with very attentive staff who recommended the perfect wine to accompany our meal.
The only thing thats needed is maybe some live music in the bar area at night.
I think this would be a very romantic retreat for a loved up couple :-)",4,2013,05,08
208,Only place to stay in Dublin !,"I have stayed at the Dylan quite a few times on week end breaks and I love it every time! The hotel is in a wonderful location, tucked away off the main street. Madison on the front desk is always welcoming, poised, professional and impeccably dressed. The hotel is clean and stylish and the ideal place to enjoy some afternoon cocktails with friends, the outdoor seating area is also a must in summer months! Overall the hotel and staff are fabulous and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin, business or pleasure - check out the Dylan!",5,2013,05,07
208,My favorite hotel,"I always look forward to staying at the Dylan. The staff are pleasant and remember me each time I visit. The rooms are all different and offer a high end ""boutique"" experience. 

Added benefit is that the Dylan offers come time rates with a great breakfast. 

I highly recommend. ",5,2013,05,05
208,Really relaxing place to stay,"Really great location and beautiful rooms which were super clean.

Great breakfast, if a little pricey.

Nice outside bar with heaters to sit and have a few beers at.

Fast check in and check out.

Limited selection of music on the iPod in the room, but okay if you like Dr Dre :-)",5,2013,05,02
208,Very enjoyable stay & delicious food,"My partner and I treated ourselves to an overnight stay in the Dylan as we had an appointment beside it the next morning, and I'd always wanted to stay there. 

As you enter from the road, the entrance looks so pretty with all the lanterns lit. After checking in and going to our room to get settled in, we went downstairs for cocktails before dinner. The bar is very nice, but the terrace area, in particular is fabulous. After a few delicious cocktails, we went into the restaurant for dinner. The first thing that struck me was was how beautiful the dining room was. Easily the nicest dining room I've seen in a hotel. The lighting was spot on too (which can be a bug bear of mine!). In contrast to the poster one or two reviews below who said there was no music or atmosphere, we had lovely music playing in the background, also while it was midweek, there was a nice atmosphere in the restaurant. Indeed I can't say a lack of table cloth ruined my dining pleasure either! As for the food: it really was amazing. The restaurant here truly is a hidden gem. We tried their food at the Taste of Dublin festival last summer, so we were delighted to find the food in the restaurant was just as delicious as it was then. 

After dinner we retired to our room. The room itself was stylish and comfortable. The ipod with pre-loaded music is a lovely feature. I'm raging I never made a note of some of the songs I wanted to download for myself! Again, the mini bar was the best I've ever seen in a hotel: the usual drinks & snacks, but other interesting things also!

Breakast the next morning is a la carte and is served in the restaurant. The room looked completely different again in the morning light, so bright and airy. The restaurant gets the morning sun and the waiter was telling us that in the summer, they open the patio doors and you can sit out on the front terrace to have your breakfast. Unfortunately, while it was sunny, it was very cold, so we couldn't sit out. We both had eggs benedict, which was cooked to perfection. As well as the a la carte, they have the usual buffet fare: cereal, fruit, yoghurt, pastries, etc. 

Overall, our stay was throughly enjoyable in the Dylan, we hope to find an excuse to stay here again soon!",5,2013,04,18
208,Dylan delights,"A charming boutique hotel tucked away near to Ballsbridge.  I stay here regularly. The staff are unfailingly courteous and friendly, the rooms stylishly modern. The bar does great cocktails and there is a patio at the front and rear where it is great to sit in the evening.  The hotel is conveniently located for local bars and restaurants and central Dublin is a short 10 minute walk away.",4,2013,04,18
208,contemporary cool and chic,"seriously helpful staff, great cocktails and eclectic style. discreet location,in upmarket part of town with great local bars yet near enough to walk into city centre (the nice way past georgian squares) but near Dublin 4 for Aviva stadium.",5,2013,04,12
208,Dinning @ Dylan,"It's  been a long time sine I've  been inside this hotel.  The decor has been beautifully  updated but the soul is gone.   This was a fantastic spot for drinks and food.   Now it seems to have zero atmosphere and the food is well substandard.   I was really looking forward to this meal but the whole experience  left a bad taste in my mouth.   No table linens,  no music, no vibe and tasteless plates.   Considering treating yourself? Go somewhere else. ",2,2013,04,12
208,Stylish boutique hotel in the heart of the city,"I recently spent two nights at the Dylan Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who was very attentive and helpful. The public areas of the hotel are small but stylish with modern, contemporary furnishings and decor.
The rooms are of a similar style to the main area of the hotel and are finished to a high quality. The room I stayed in was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. There were nice touches like cupcakes for us on arrival in our room, iPod and docking station with pre-loaded music, and fluffy bathrobes and slippers. We did not experience any street noise and as there are only 44 rooms in this hotel, there was no disturbance from other guests.
We only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant but it was well presented, varied and tasty. The staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive in the mornings, which I like! The bar was quiet on the night we were there but they have an extensive selection of spirits etc. and serve good cocktails, at a reasonable price compared to other places in Dublin. I think my Cosmopolitan was about ‚Ç¨9.50.
The hotel itself is very central and there are a number of quality bars, restaurants and shops just around the corner, approximately two minutes walk away. So, there are plenty of choices for eating out, socialising etc.
I would recommend this hotel and would certainly go there again when I am visiting Dublin. :)",5,2013,04,08
208,Why cant they get it right????,"We stayed for two nights over St Patrick's weekend 2013.
The reception was fantastic...............probably one of the most helpful receptionists (Maddison)we have ever experienced anywhere. As a group of friends (not kids) we travel a lot all over the world so do have some experience of what to expect and what is deemed unreasonable.
As a 4-5* hotel we checked before going out in the evening that we were welcome back as residents and that the hotel bar was open all night, especially as it was the most important party weekend in the Irish calender! We could have easily stayed out and spent our monet in any of the other establishments that were open all night that weekend and did so on our second night.
The bar staff literally disappeared around 2am and we were left to our own devises until we finally found someone on reception willing to pour us a drink.............we had left euros on the bar and even waived a wad of 300 euros at the bar security camera showing the fact that we were willing to pay...........but to no avail. Not good service!
We would stay again simply based on our reeptionist and how well she dealt with us but hotels of this standing must realise if they are going to advertise themselves with a high level of service please make certain the staff they employ for the late shift are up to task...........on this occasion both the night porter and nighy duty manager were not up to the job both being absent from their posts.
We stay in Dublin every other year and will be back but only if the Four Seasons is full !!!!",3,2013,04,02
208,Stylish. Good location.,"Lobby was small but stylish.  Room is similarly stylish -- nice touches as well, like music playing as you walk in and the TV greeting you.  I liked that the rooms (at least the few my colleagues and I stayed in) were different from each other -- the exceptions rather than the cookie cutter norms these days.

Didn't get a chance to visit the restaurant or bar here, but it's so close to a number of dining options just around the corner.  At the same time, my room was completely quiet -- no problems with noise from the street (it is tucked away on a small road off the main drag) or from the bar.  Could have just been the placement of my room.

Can't comment on how much value this was as (a) I was on business and (b) I don't know how much lodging typically costs in Dublin.",4,2013,03,25
208,Great hotel just watch your dates,Pleasant surroundings with attentive staff. The food in the restaurant was excellent and the rooms small but tastefully done out. Great area however take care with your dates when booking. Eye watering escalation of prices to take advantage of large events in Dublin,4,2013,03,21
208,More than Comfortable,"We stayed here for 4 nights during St Patrick's Day weekend.  It was fabulous.  The little extras like complementary bottled water replaced when used up & heated tiled floor in the bathroom make this hotel worth every penny.  The staff were very friendly & the concierge happy to help.  It's a more quiet place set off from the main ""party"" zones, but was close enough to walk to the attractions.  Easy taxi rides too, which we preferred when it was cold, windy, & rainy.  We actually only ate at the restaurant once, for breakfast but it was excellent.  We had a late light dinner in the bar a couple times, & it was yummy with a refined selection.  It also seemed pretty family friendly, so we'd stay there again with our kids if we go back to Dublin.",5,2013,03,21
208,Friendly staff would be a hit,"Stayed here for two nights, Rooms are nice and cosy, room service is efficient, cocktails are good, witha good spirit selection, dinner in the restaurant is overpriced and extremely small portions. However I would like to point out, I only came into contact with one Irish staff member working in the hotel throughout my stay, and I must say he was about the friendliest staff member we encountered (in the bar), chatted away to us and wasnt too pushy trying to sell us drinks unlike in the restaurant. On the Saturday night  arrogant waiter was trying to push cocktails even before we had sat down, he then asked us did we want wine, as I am not a wine drinker and replied 'no' he came across as being extremely condescending and to be honest made us feel extremely uncomfortable... I think its time you hire more 5star staff",5,2013,03,14
208,Dylan review,"I stayed in this hotel for one night. Overall i found it fantastic. From check in to checkout the staff could not have been more helpful, actually in fairness even prior to check in, before going to the hotel i had a few queries and found reservations extremely efficient at replying to my emails never waiting for more than a day. the hotel is beautiful and friendly staff - i will return to this hotel.",5,2013,03,11
208,cant wait to go back,this is a fun boutique hotel with friendly helpful staff..our room was beautiful and sooooo peaceful..we were there for my birthday and took in the rugby game at the aviva stadium which is only a short walk away.Breakfast was a great treat and service was fantastic..my only complaint is that we found a cigarette butt on the floor beside the bed and a chocolate stuffed behind a cushion on the sofa in our room.yuk,5,2013,03,11
208,"Nice boutique hotel, shame about the room","I stayed in the Dylan for one night only. Overall the hotel is nicely designed and the service was friendly. I was in room 111 which was a bit on the small side. I also disliked that it was rather dark in the room regardless of how many lamps where on. The room had a walk-in shower which was adequate. Do not expect any views in this room. It is overlooks a tiny internal courtyard - rather depressing. One could easily overhear people on the corridor and if you have a light sleep that might trouble you. While the room was tiny and dark, I enjoyed the cocktails in the bar and the breakfast was satisfying too. Rather than having a huge buffet, it is more an a la carte breakfast. The walk into town is around 20 minutes. If you are lucky enough to be in a different room, I can imagine a stay at the Dylan to be very pleasurable.",4,2013,03,10
208,Fantastic - Quirky - Boutiquey,"I've stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions, and it is fabulous.  Additionally, we booked the use of the library for corporate purposes.  The hotel staff, from reception staff to bar staff, couldn't have been more helpful.  The full Irish breakfast was more than plentiful and of good value.  I love the idea of this hotel being on a side street, as its location is unexpected.  The only comment I'd make (and not a criticism), is wanting to see more 'locals' working in the bar/dining area as this would add to the charm and the whole 'Dublin' experience.",5,2013,03,09
208,Not has good as I would have hoped,"The hotel is in a great location and is well designed, with a lovely boutique feel about the place.
The reception staff could not have been more helpful when I checked in, so first impressions were good.   However, it does not take long for the issues to bubble up...eg: 
- The plug did not work in the bath, so the relaxing soak I had promised myself after a day on the road was only possible by bunging a wet towel down the plug hole
- The shower head was scaled up, so some of the water jetted onto floor (resolved when I cleaned the shower head - but why is that my job?)

The breakfast was very disappointing, as it appeared that there was only a cold buffet.  No one offered or gave me a hot breakfast menu until I had nearly finished, so that was a complete waste of money!   Why don't they give you the menu when you sit down?

I had a good nights sleep, but for the money, I would expect that.  So, overall, a disappointing experience in what COULD be great hotel.",3,2013,03,06
208,"REVOLTING, DISGUSTING, RIP-OFF AND LIES","Let me state right away that this hotel is in NO WAY FIVE STARS.
To give it four stars is being generous, I would rate it as a very poor four star hotel, but the fact that this hotel claims to be five stars would be a joke if it wasn‚Äôt so insulting.
This hotel obviously doesn‚Äôt have a clue what five stars is.  If they could be sued over their claim to be five stars, I would.
My wife treated me to what she was promised would be a luxurious night in this ‚Äúfive star‚Äù hotel and she had been so looking forward to it.
To see her face fall as we walked in to the room made me sad, and then when I saw the dump they had put us into, that made me mad.
There was so much at fault in this horrible place that we best start at the beginning and do the full list.
The first room we were put in was tiny.  For ‚Ç¨240, the room really was a joke.  The walls were all marked with God knows what.  The furniture was ragged and scruffy, both lampshades on either side of the bed were not only scuffed, they were torn and actually had gaping holes in them.  
The menu holders and room literature was crumpled and covered in various splashes and drips from I shudder to think what.  There was splash marks on the bed frame and across furniture.
The bed linen was extremely worn and crumpled.  We removed a number of black hairs from the bed, wiped dust from the windows and from the bathroom.
There was a small mirror in the bathroom which hung on the wall broken, facing downwards, it could not be adjusted to be useable.
And the cream on top, my wife specifically requested a quiet room, and yet they put us directly above the reception and restaurant and could hear scraping chairs and banging noises non-stop.
There was no way I was staying in such a dump and told the reception desk I wanted to move rooms.
Before I continue, let‚Äôs look back at this room.

Advertised as five stars, I‚Äôm sure you will agree this wasn‚Äôt even three stars.  There was absolutely nothing about this hotel that was five stars and I know I‚Äôve said that repeatedly but I really want to emphasise the point.
I am honestly still incredulous at the state of the room we were given, but this was how the hotel presented to us and was how much they valued their customers.

The front desk lady, Gladys, was very nice, very apologetic and in 15 minutes had found us another room.  She came to the room with a member of housekeeping (Gina? Dina?) and I showed her (Dina) what was wrong with the room and she sighed almost with despair and said that yes they knew about the broken lampshades and the broken mirror!!!  Really?
Yet they didn‚Äôt do anything about them and presented them to the next customers!  Us!

Anyway, we were shown to another room which was a bit bigger and was more in line with what we would have expected from a room.

You know a hotel is bad, worse than bad, when you stop looking for faults because you‚Äôre stomach is churning as you have already found so many and you don‚Äôt want to even see any more.
That was the Dylan.
The upgraded room may have been bigger, but the walls were still marked, the bed linen was worn and un-ironed and incredibly creased and the pillow cases even had mould spores on them!
If my wife hadn‚Äôt paid for the room as a treat to me and if we hadn‚Äôt planned our whole evening and night around staying here, I would have left and gone home.

The hotels doors don‚Äôt have any noise stoppers on them and so ours and everyone else‚Äôs banged like an explosion when anyone opened or closed a door.
A minor point after all the others was the amateurish menu left in the room full of spelling mistakes and errors.
I mean, just what is up with this place? It felt like it might have been nice when it opened but it had just stopped trying a long time ago.

We ordered room service breakfast and I am not kidding, after everything I have written, you may think I am making this up, that I‚Äôm exaggerating, but I swear I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶the breakfast was absolutely foul.
The chap who brought the tray to the room plonked it on the table and left.  But hold on, sorry mate, where is the five star service that goes with the five star hotel?
We removed the lids off the full Irish cooked breakfast and the stink that came off the food was stomach churning.  There was a pile of hard bacon on each plate, about 4 strips all stuck together in one large disgusting lump.  The poached eggs were raw in the middle, the sausage was the cheapest, nastiest sausage I‚Äôve ever eaten (or not eaten), it seems like it was mostly cereal and covered in foul fat.  And there were two round hash browns which I kid you not, I spat out back onto the plate as they were absolutely disgusting, just tasted of fat.  The whole sorry mess was inedible and we left it.  Absolutely disgusting breakfast to go with an absolutely disgusting hotel.   Even the fruit salad was just an apple chopped up and a couple of grapes thrown in to complement the browning apple chunks.

This is the worst review that I‚Äôve ever had to write but the hotel was really that bad.  It was so bad and there was so many horrible things there that I even wondered was it just us? Were we looking for faults, but no, we weren‚Äôt.  We work hard, and saved our money and wanted to have a lovely night away from it all and were presented into this sham, this lie about being five stars.
We stayed in the Gibson Hotel in Dublin a few weeks back, for less money and the standard was sooo much higher.  We didn‚Äôt look for or find any faults with it and had a lovely time from start to finish. There is just no comparison between the Gibson and here.

Gladys must get mention as she was very helpful and is a very good member of staff and any hotel would be lucky to have her.  The Dylan Hotel...it may be nice to have a drink or even some food here , but please don't stay...it was just so horrible.",1,2013,03,05
208,An excellent oasis,We went over for the Ireland v England rugby and were fortunate enough to stay in the Dylan. Great location and the staff were very helpful even keeping an umbrella for us as it was very wet. The full Irish breakfast was outstanding!,5,2013,03,01
208,My favourite Hotel in Dublin,"Great spot for business or fun. High style with volume levels that still allow you to think. Accommodation wise, Dylan offers 5 Star digs with attentive down-to-earth and always friendly staff, that seem to genuinely appreciate their patrons. Oh and great cocktails even if they are pretty pricey.",5,2013,02,28
208,worse experience ever!,"We stayed at the Dylan Dublin on Sunday 17thbof Feb. we had an early flight the following day, so what about a nice stylish,away from the noise you can get in the city centre ,5 star boutique hotel to have a good night sleep? My worse idea of 2013 so far :-))

When you come in, it is so tasteful,so edgy classy you want to see every space they have just to admire its architecture and its , saying we were happy to be in such cool place was an understatement , we were super happy, even the lift is beautiful inside. You definitely easy imagine that the person who designed is talented.

Then come the night, any traveller worse nightmare!!!!!! We had room 103.

At around midnight we are awake by a big BAAAM rough wake-up is the least we can say , it was the room next door...ok we go back to sleep straight away, then another BAAAAM another room around ours, the doors are smashing so loud and so brutally it awakes you with a certain panic as you don't know what it is straight away.

Then I hear, TIC TIC TIC... Ohh great now I'm hearing every single time poeple next door switching le light in or out, I hearing them taking a shower, talking.....if I could hear them so clearly they could have been hearing us too if we would have been awake then.

Poeple who are working there are super friendly and the bar downstairs was great as they had a live singer and while we were having dinner we had great live music:-))

In a restaurant or a bar I don't mind the noise and loud music I'm expecting it in fact that's the reason we go out , to happilly be around this type of noise or music but...

In a 5 star hotel room once i close my door I'm expecting a good night sleep, my privacy to be respected and a certain comfort that only you can find in 5 star hotels, like for example room doors equipped with a silent closing, those simple things allowing them to move to slowmotion until the door closes behind you, silently or almost! I didn't get that at all, we were abroad all day next day for an important business meeting....exhausted !

I personally think its a great lack of respect not thinking of your guests quality sleep as it is a hotel and the main reason we are booking there is to sleep or even better sleep well. my experience in the Dylan could be compared as going to Barbados to top up the tan and drink pina coladas and dance on the beach on the beach but during the whole stay you have rain !!

I'm afraid I will never book that gorgeous/worse night sleep hotel ever again, there are other gorgeous REAL 5 stars hotels in Dublin and I'm going to try them.

",1,2013,02,19
208,Helpful staff,"I had asked for a walk in shower when I booked and they actually gave us an easy access room which was not what I meant....However we didn't ask to move as we were only there for 1 night.  The room was rather small, but nicely decorated, and being next to the lift a little noisy.
The next morning we found we had a puncture and as we were in a hurry to get the ferry we were a bit worried but one of the hotel staff changed it for us in a very short space of time.  What excellent service!",4,2013,02,18
208,Dylan Hotel ‚Äì Enchanted,"We spend two nights at the Dylan Hotel arriving on Saturday 9th and leaving on Monday 11th February. We were there for the Ireland v England Rugby game. The hotel is well appointed and although it was last refurbished in 2006 it looks brand new. The room we had on the 3rd floor was spacious but I found the bathroom a little bit too small. The shower was powerful but there was no removable shower head and I had to be very careful not to wet my hair as I can‚Äôt wash my long hair every day and there was no shower caps. Otherwise, the staff were delightful. Breakfast was amazing. Fab selection of fruits, nuts and viennoiserie. More importantly, the full Irish Breakfast is a must. I even had a glass of Prosecco with it. How decadent! We would definitely return there.",5,2013,02,13
208,A fantastic place to stay,"A fantastic hotel with a great bar attached.
Rooms are 1st class as is the service from the staff.Food is also to a high standard if not a little overpriced tho. If you are in Dublin, its well worth a look at staying here. Would definately visit again.",5,2013,02,13
208,Worth a stay,"Stayed here recently for 1 night, was a guest at a wedding in the hotel.  The room was a good size, modern & clean.  Good shower.  The hotel is centrally located with the bonus of being on a quiet road but literally a stones throw from all the action of bars & restuarants.  The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating, if the weather is on your side there is lovely seating outside on the front terrace.  A excellent internal beer garden is avaibale with a overhead automatic cover incase it rains.
The staff where friendly.  Liked the fact you could do an express checkout.
Would recommend.",4,2013,02,12
208,Good stay,Stayed here for a conference and had a great stay. Only issue was the gym or lack of. Rooms are clean and are a good size. People are very helpful and pleasant. There is a nice indian resturant around the corner from the hotel.,4,2013,02,01
208,Love the Dylan experience,"This was my third time staying at the Dylan and I can't fault it. The rooms are just gorgeous and it's location is great too, central but quiet and close enough to town for overseas visitors. I will definitely be going back again for a stay hopefully in summer as I want to sit outside on their fab terrace!!",5,2013,01,30
208,Fab room,"Stead here for a Sat night out with the girls, we were give a fab room that the 3 of us could share, really spacious, and ipod in room with chilled out music. The staff were very pleasant too.
Had breakfast to the room the next morning, it was delicous and piping hot to the last bite. My plan is to have a kid free night here away with the hubby next time.",5,2013,01,29
208,A Pleasant Stay,"We had a very nice five night stay at The Hotel Dylan. This is a boutique hotel, quiet and off the beaten path.

The staff was very helpful and always available. The bar was always open and ready to serve. The room had everything we needed. The iPod Touch in the room was loaded with great music. The heated floors and towel rack in the bathroom was a nice touch. Our room had both a shower and tub both were above average.

A number of people complained about the location. I, for one, thought it was great. Yes, it is a 20 minute walk to the city center but it is right off of Baggot Street, around the corner from a large block of shops and restaurants including a Tesco, a Boots, a liquor store, a couple of banks, coffee shops and Searson's Pub -- apparently recently re-opened and a fine place to have a drink. In other words you are within steps of a number of necessities and a few nice restaurants and pubs.

We had absolutely no complaints about the rooms, common areas, or location. A great place to stay, especially if you can get a deal.",4,2013,01,09
208,Great Hotel,This is a fantastic hotel located in a good part of the city. My only criticism is that the decor is a little overdone but in general it nonetheless it is very comfortable indeed. I enjoyed the breakfast and thought it was good value for money.,4,2013,01,09
208,Nice but not as good as expected,"A comfortable stay; friendly staff; large room. But the food in the restaurant was OK rather than adequate. And no way is this five-star standard: even with an upgraded room, it's the level of a good four-star - and, as a result, it was something of a let-down for the price and compared to the high expectations set by the hotel's website.",3,2013,01,01
208,"Fantastic boutique hotel, mediocre location","This smallish hotel was tucked away just off Upper Baggot Street.  The staff are really friendly and the room was very clean and comfortable.  The phone in the room was impossible to figure out how to operate, but eventually we figured out how to order room service.  I had a really weird but delicious burger one day coming off a massive hangover, and it totally hit the spot.  The front desk doubles as concierge and they were very helpful in booking restaurant reservations and excursions.  They have two really nice smoke-friendly outdoor areas and several indoor areas for the restaurant and bar.  At night, the bar stays open as late as you want to continue drinking, and there are lots of well-dressed young people partying in the enclosed outdoor patio.  Warning: they did not allow us to bring guests into the hotel bar late at night for cocktails, even though the bar was still open for guests.  That was really annoying.

So, it isn't the Mandarin Oriental, but you definitely feel like you are staying in a well-managed and elegant hotel.  The only real complaint I have, apart from excluding our friends from the bar, is how far away it is from St. Stephen's Green, which is basically tourist central.  It's easily a 20-minute walk, and we found ourselves making the long, boring walk up Baggot Street almost every day of the trip.",4,2012,12,22
208,Very Nice,"I have stayed here many times and always like the location, housekeeping and warm welcome.  The rooms are ""funky"" but comfortable.  The housekeeping is first class and the location is perfect.  Quiet but accessible.",5,2012,12,18
208,Lavish and good with the extra touches,"We stayed for 2 nights (fri and sat) in a king style room. The room was very large and we also opted for the rose petals and bubble bath option. We stayed just before Xmas.

The staff are loVely, our stay was welcomed. On arrival the concierge took care of us and ensured our needs were met for our stay and showed us to our room and took our luggage. Upon opening the doom door we we were greeted with petals on our bed in a love heart shape and music playing on an iPod speaker in the back. The beatuique decor was very tasteful and was throughout the hotel, we enjoyed the interior very much. The location is fine, it's down dead end street off a main road into the city but is a good 20 mins walk into the centre so taxi most of the time. We ate and drank in the hotel and commend them greatly here. 

In summary, we really cannot find anything to fault them on, perhaps breakfast was ever so slightly there let down, the buffet is fault small, the cooked breakfasts were very large and the sausages were too plain and Low pork content variety. 

I would recommend it highly if you are after a luxury hotel with style.",5,2012,12,17
208,Lovely,"Stayed here for two nights Nov 12. We've stayed in loads of hotels in Dublin and this was the nicest yet. It's in a lovely old building in a quiet street but only 15-20 mins walk into the city centre. Room was spacious with lovely comfy bed and the quiet situation of the hotel made for a great nights sleep. Toilettries in room were v gd quality. Only couple small cons, we bought room only and to take breakfast in the hotel was an additional 30‚Ç¨ pp which is a crazy price. (if u find yourself in the same situation head for Hugos on Merron Row for excellent Sunday brunch with jazz thrown in!) also when we were checking out we had no help with doors or bags to our cars outside - (and I'm heavily pregnant!) and for that standard of a hotel maybe a coffee machine/biscuits in the room wud b nice.",4,2012,12,09
208,"Great trendy hotel, Awesome customer service.","This hotel was excellent, the decor is modern quirky with every amenity required. Fine linens and super comfy beds made it a great place for rest in-between our tours. The bar and restaurant are top class, the breakfast was pricey but good.  Peter (Barkeep) makes a perfect Hot Shot Galliano, Irish kid named Paul (barkeep) kept us laughing at the bar the whole night. Israel was the perfect waiter at every meal. And front staff Madison and Sultan went completely out of their way to make our stay spectacular, from fetching us taxi's and giving great restaurant advice and places to sight see, to helping us find a doc when my wife sprained her knee. 
It is a 15 to 20 minute walk to most sights which was kinda nice to be in a quiet neighborhood, 10Euro taxi would have you there in 5 minutes. We will definitely stay at the Dylan on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2012,12,07
208,A nice boutique hotel with spacious rooms and quality feel,"I stayed on a Monday evening on business so probably got a very good rate as a result. However the hotel has a nice individual feel to it and the staff were helpful and welcoming.  I had a room on the first floor and it was lovely - I immediately though it would be a lovely place for a romantic break.  The bathroom was lovely and warm with underfloor heating.  The TV was not great, yes a flat screen, but a bit of an old model with not a great picture - but it did n't bother me as I wasn't here to watch TV.  I eat breakfast in the hotel which was table service and of a decent quality.  I did walk into the city centre and it took me about 20 minutes.  Overall I would definately come back with my partner if I was staying in Dublin - I thought good value for money.",4,2012,12,04
208,Disappointing,"I found this hotel to be expensive by comparison to much nicer places available in Dublin.Also it is quite a way from the main tourist attractions, I had to pay for a taxi, or have a very long walk. The room on the third floor was no more than an attic room with a sloping ceiling and an arched window too high to see out of. The bathroom like, the rest of the hotel, looked wonderful but the shower was not very good, the bathroom lighting was poor, and the glass 'bowl' style sink had a  large tap over it, so every time you tried to wash your face or clean your teeth, you soaked yourself and the bathroom floor. The room was very hot and I had trouble getting it to a decent temperature. There were no curtains, just wooden blinds, and one section was broken and let the light in first thing in the morning which woke me up.It was impossible to get housekeeping to part with more than two tea bags a day, very frustrating when you want a cup of tea in the afternoon, to find the two from breakfast haven't been replaced.The staff generally were very nice and helpful, but not an Irish person amongst them.The breakfast was good.I had one dinner at the hotel, again very over priced.I shall be returning to Dublin in a couple of months, but I shall not be returning to the Dylan.",2,2012,12,02
208,soo dissapointing...!!,"me and my fiance were looking for perfect place for our wedding. one of our favourites was dylan. we had a little tour of the restaurant, bar and terrace with the general manager Grainne. we liked the place very much and we decided that that is it! Grainne promised us to send all the info, menu options, prices,...to my email next day. We were so happy and decided to have lunch and try the food as we haven't eaten there in a while. that is where all went wrong. it was summer and  we wanted to have lunch on the terrace. we waited for service for 15 mins....and as nobody was coming, we had to go inside to order. barman and two waiters were standing there, chatting and nobody had intention to go to take our order. we said what we wanted and went back. when our food arrived it was absolutely inedible. one was ""dylan burger""...it had no taste, bun was kinda old and meat not cooked properly and so dry...tasteless!! we were disappointed but that didnt discourage us to have the wedding here. than we asked for the bill, food was almost untouched, waiter asked whats wrong, we said that food has no taste, and he did nothing, we paid for the full bill and hurry to leave that place. i was still hoping that when i get the email with prices and al,l we could talk to them about food we want on our wedding and all will be fine! well we never got that email. I was so disappointed, i would expect more responsibility and professionalism from somebody who is managing a hotel!  especially that both of us working in hospitality, not to mention, management positions, so this was soooooo unprofessional and dissapointing especially coming from the general manager!!",1,2012,11,28
208,A little gem,"My husband and I stayed here during our short visit to Ireland. I joined tripadvisor just to share my thoughts of this amazing hotel. The staff were amazing from reception to the restaurant but most of all the bar staff on our last night (Fabrizio and Paul) were absolutely out of this world amazing. They werent your average 5 star statue server however they are so polite, friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful. The food is good and an amazing selection of spirits at the bar. However one fault is, the drunk old man at the bar should be barred- extremely vulgar towards us.",5,2012,11,26
208,Good boutique,"Nice mix of modern interior design and older conservative exterior, in good location. The staff are friendly and very helpful. I had the veggie breakfast - well done and very tasty. 

One  niggle - the room was too hot and the staff didn't seem to know how adjust the heating. Luckily the hotel is in a fairly quiet area so the open window wasn't an issue.",4,2012,11,24
208,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights. The room was very clean, well decorated, and ample size. Breakfast was excellent, and staff were all helpful. Great location also, about 10 minute walk to Stephen's Green. Bar looked to be very quiet so we didn't try it.",5,2012,11,16
208,A great hotel with great design. Restaurant was not great,"I stated with my partner for a weekend in this boutique hotel in Dublin. We really enjoyed the hotel, the design, the decor and the room and as we booked it on line, the price of the room was very ggod value for money
The problem is that we booked the restaurant in the hotel for the first night and while the food was OK, the price of food anddrink was not in line with the quality of the food and drink, so this was a minor diappoitment that has prevented the review to reach the 5 mark",4,2012,11,07
208,very good boutique hotel,"The Dylan is about a 10 minute walk from St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, the main hub of the city.  The slight distance (compared to other hotels near Grafton Street) has some benefits and drawbacks.  The chief benefit is that it will not be noisy and you are unlikely to run into many (other) drunks staggering out of the city's more touristy pubs. The chief drawback is that if you have been ""enjoying"" the city's pubs, you may need some stamina and sense of orientation to walk back.  Luckily, since deregulation, there are plenty of taxis.

The Dylan is ultra modern and very discreet, so don't expect any cliches about Ireland.  If you are in the bar, you should order a tray of baby Guinness.  Share them with your fellow drinkers, you will become instantly popular.",5,2012,11,05
208,Pricey but a treat none the less...,"We stayed here on a Saturday and had an amazing dinner and gorgeous (pricey!) cocktails. The bar was very busy with parties and the smoking area was a bit too dark. We went for drinks in Searsons around the corner as there was a big gathering in the bar. Later we sipped a drink by the fire and toddled off to our gorgeous room. The bed wasn't the comfiest I've slept in but it did the job!
Pricey place but worth it for a treat. ",4,2012,11,02
208,Super everything,"Our room was terrific. The service was excellent in every way. There were a lot of fun aspects to the hotel. It was quirky and offbeat, but very professional at the same time. It was a little hike to the tourist attractions, but we enjoyed the walk. Also, the hotel was in a part of town where non-tourists could be found, which we also enjoyed. The front desk folks were very knowledgeable and helpful, so I would encourage folks to use them as a resource.",4,2012,10,30
208,drinks were overpriced...service was dreadful,"i visited the hotel on 1st september where we were meeting a large group of friends. on arrival at the bar we were met by a waiter who asked had we placed a drinks order, when i told him we had not he disappeared never to return. 15 minutes later i went to the bar where there was three staff members talking and no other customers other than myself waiting to be served . after 5 minutes i was approached by  a barman who informed me that although it was THE BAR we would have to get a waiter to serve us. after several more attempts from my seat i got the attention of a waiter who took my order and waited a further 15 minutes for it to arrive. my bill was of ‚Ç¨33.50 of 3 gin and tonics and 2 pints of Heineken. By the time it arrived we had to leave and in turn leave our drinks.
the service was dreadful and the drinks were overpriced",2,2012,10,22
208,Nice Stay,"The Dylan was a nice hotel.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Bathroom was tiny.  We only stayed two nights so we had minimal interaction with the desk staff, but check-in and check-out was efficient and the staff was pleasant.  We had breakfast on the last morning and I have to agree with other reviews in that the service was poor and my omlet was burnt.",4,2012,10,21
208,October 2012 - Three Days at the Dylan,"Just returned from a 9 day trip to Ireland that began in Dublin with three nights at the Dylan. This cute little boutique hotel is a little outside city center - closer to the Aviva stadum - in the old financial district. It is a 20 minute walk at a leisure pace to the main attractions. That said, it is located in a quiet residential/commerical area which is clean, safe and offers plenty of local places to eat/drink.

Our room was spacious, fully outfitted with everything we needed including a US plug, and came with nightly turndown service including chocolate and bottled waters. Our view from the room was over a garden and church and at night it was so quiet we slept with the windows open. Bed was comfortable, bathroom large. Clean, quiet, relaxing. 

Service was exceptional here for us. Our luggage was delayed coming in from London and didn't arrive till 8 hours after our check in. Martin at the front desk stayed in constant contact with our airline and delivered our bags to our room after midnight when they arrived. He was also very helpful in making recommendations and having cabs readily accessible for us within 5 minutes of making the ask. 

We did eat in the bar area on a Saturday night. It was crowded after a nearby rugby game but our service was efficient and quick. Food was good and reasonably priced. We did not eat breakfast here as there were cheaper options one street over.",4,2012,10,15
208,One of the best,"My husband and I along with family met up here for drinks prior to another appointment.  On entering the lobby, it was very warm and inviting and spotlessly clean.  We sat out back where there was ample heating and nice cosy chairs as one of our party wished to smoke.  Waiting staff were very friendly and attentive but we were a bit disappointed when the drink we ordered (Bacardi) was not available.  However, just as we were finishing our substitute drink, we were pleasantly surprised when a waiter came to our table and informed us that they had now acquired some Bacardi.  That really made our day and we would like to express a big thank you to the staff for their kindness and consideration and making our evening such and enjoyable one.  We look forward to returning again in the very near future.",5,2012,10,15
208,Lovely Rooms,"Overnighted here for a wedding in September. Rooms are fab with lovely little touches, turn down service, robes and slippers. Aromatherapy scents seemed to be filtered through the air-con, I felt like a was in a spa the whole time, bliss! Breakfast is cooked to order and very enjoyable.",5,2012,10,08
208,over-priced,"on first entering the room, found it small and ""pokey"" with window facing a brick wall.  My wife made her disappointment known to reception and we were offerred an alternative that was much better. When we asked why we weren't offered the bigger room in the first place we were told that it would be investigated but heard nothing.  
That evening at the bar I stood as others were served before me out of line until I complained and was then served. 
They say a 15 minute walk to the centre but you would need to go at a really good pace to achieve this so we resorted to taxis.
Breakfast was, frankly, average and well over-priced.   Do have to compliment our waiter!
Charging 20 euro a night for parking is a rip-off.
There are plenty of options in Dublin in 4 and 5 star so would suggest looking at other deals.  This hotel is ""nice"" but not outstanding enough to justify almost 300 euro a night!",3,2012,10,08
208,Opulent and luxurious without being ott,"I stayed at the Dylan for four nights in September 2012.  We had one of their 'Style' rooms, and my first impression was one of elegance and luxury.  The room was large, airy, beautifully lit, and had everything I could want for and more.  When we arrived several hours before check in, the staff stored our bags, and on our second arrival they were stowed in our room waiting for us.  We ate in the bar one night, and the bar food, drinks and service were all excellent, as was the breakfast.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were extremely helpful and friendly.  I would happily stay here again and have recommended the place to all my friends!",5,2012,10,04
208,Poor Service.,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a special break.y ""heaven""  I have stayed at numerous hotels in dublin between 3* and 5* and must say this is the worst I have experienced. The room was fine and the bed was definely ""heaven"". Our dissapointing experience began with Breakfast. The service was atrocious!! There appeared to be plenty of staff but one didn't know what the others were doing?? We were ignored while waiting at the door be seated. When directed to empty seats we were not given a menu and had to ask the residents beside us to borrow theres.  We waited 10/15 mins before our order was taken. Then a futher 15/20 minutes for our cooked meal. My husband order tea but was given coffee. My coffee was stone cold and was replaced by a cup/not a pot of coffee. The cold buffet was poor with no pastries available and all the cereals were in open containers. No variety what so ever.
When checking out I attempted to ask the consierge to assist us on retrieving a taxi. He was making a great effort on not making eye contact. When I eventually spoke to him while rushing past me, he said rudely he would be with me in a minute. We waited 15 minutes and gave up and begain walking ourselves to Baggot where we were able to get a taxi at another hotel.
I had made my dissappointment know to reception an leaving and they said the manager would contact me at home the next day. I am still waiting. My experience was on the 15/09/12 and this is now 04/10/12. Never again!! Please be advised that dublin has soooo much better hotels than this at 3* and 4*. For 5*  I would reccommend the Merrion. I have never been so disappointed.",1,2012,10,04
208,Funky but nice,"Very modern, great service and fantastic dinners. Rooms spacious but lack a decent chair the only complaint .close to city center .nice big bath and good shower. 
A bit on the expensive side after 10days of b&bs. But 3 days here is a great way torelax before the 24 hour flight to australia .
Go ahead  spoil yourself. Your probably like us and only live once. ,!!!!",5,2012,09,29
208,A Perfect Break,"During the summer my wife and I stayed at the Dylan Hotel when I was in Dublin on business. The hotel was amazing and I would certainly recommend it to anyone. Everything was perfect, from the beautifully decorated and individually designed rooms to the Java Republic Earl Grey tea provided in the rooms and everything in between. The food in the restaurant was excellent throughout the day and very reasonably priced given the quality. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay, especially Madison. The location was also excellent, only a brisk level walk to the city centre. I can‚Äôt wait to stay at the Dylan Hotel again.",5,2012,09,16
208,Eclectic boutique hotel 4.5/5,"My wife and I loved our stay at the Dylan.  They have excellent service all around from start to finish; from check in, having bags brought to rooms, restaurant recommendations, check out, car valet etc it was all seamless.  The rooms are attended to twice daily as well

The hotel has beautiful d√©cor throughout the restaurant and bar with both front and rear patio seating (heaters as swell).  It is sort of a chic, eclectic antiquated d√©cor with a lot of silver tones.  It is a medium sized boutique hotel with to me an excellent location; just off a main road (so very quiet) half way between Ballsbridge and the main canal/Grafton street etc (about a km from each; 15 minute walk

The rooms are as well appointed as the bar and restaurant but the walls are quite thin. And its biggest fault is the beds ‚Äì they are extraordinarily hard and the pillows the same.  I did wake up each day with a sore back

The highlight of our stay was the lounges - cocktail menu in the bar was over the top.  Quality of the drinks and their variety was excellent.  What I‚Äôd expect in a nice bar in SF or NY

The breakfast buffet in general was ok but the menu items were much better with an excellent selection.  My wife asked for scones on the first day which they did not have but the following day our server remembered and asked if she would like them as they were available (a nice touch).  Well worth the $$ in this area of the city",4,2012,09,07
208,Quirky + fun,"We enjoyed a stay at the Dylan for a friend's wedding.  Lovely hotel, really comfortable bed, delicious food and fantastic customer service.  The staff were very attentive, and especially so where my friend's wedding was concerned.",4,2012,08,30
208,Funky place,Just home from a two night stay. This is a great hotel - very dark but cool. The staff were great - nothing a problem. We stayed in room 308 which is an upgrade in the new part of the hotel. The room was very nice. Zoltan the receptionist / maitre d was most helpful and a pleasure to deal with. We will be back ,5,2012,08,26
208,Great choice!,"Took great care in selecting hotel for this short stay (4 days / 3 nights) in Dublin. Chose quietness over proximity to main sites we wanted to visit and explore. Dylan hotel was actually a very good compromise in terms of location: quiet and we could walk (15 minutes) to heart of Dublin! 
Hotel, no question, is a gem! Good service, excellent breakfast (these were the only meals we took at the hotel, plus brunch on arrival), great room (it was at the back of the original building I believe - well appointed, large enough, on the first floor; a bit tortuous to walk to, but very charming!
Would recommend!",5,2012,08,26
208,Disappointing,"We stayed at The Dylan for two nights in July and were disappointed with our choice.   Although it is a boutique hotel, the staff, although very friendly, seemed too busy to really care about us.   The room originally allocated to us was unsuitable, so they immediately changed us to another room which was large and very comfortable with luxurious bed and linen.    However, our gripe came in when our room had not been done by the time we returned  from our meetings, around 2.00pm.  There seemed to be only one cleaning lady who apologized to us and then took another half an hour to do the room.  Our second gripe came when we had arranged a pick up from the hotel at 08h00 and taken to the airport . However, we were told by the floor manager at the time, that it was far too early to depart the hotel and we should only leave around 09h00.   Well, we missed our flight which caused untold frustration and cost!  Overall a disappointing stay.",3,2012,08,09
208,Little Gem,"Stayed in the Dylan Dublin for 2 nights. Warm welcome at reception on arrival. Little boutique hotel just off Baggot street and short taxi ride to Grafton/Temple Bar area. The cocktail bar and outside area is very inviting and relaxing espeically at night with the candles all lit. The staff always greeted me with smiles and very attentive. Rooms were an average size, well maintained and turndown service with bottled water and chocs. Complimentary morning papers. Ate in the bar each night and found the food was fine. Would come back to the Dylan and highly recommend it.",5,2012,07,30
208,Continue to deliver great service,I have reviewed this Hotel before with a Great rating and they continue to deliver. There is a good choice of rooms which have always been comfy and good sized beds to swallow you up for the night. One aspect that can always make or break stay are the staff who do a great job and go out of their way to make the stay enjoyable. In particular Madison is an absolute joy who always has a smile for you and nothing is too much trouble. A great place to stay.,5,2012,07,30
208,Great hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed it,Great hotel. Superb location. We spent the night here after a concert and really enjoyed our stay. Staff were friendly and attentive. The room was very eclectic and cool. We will be going back soon. As we enjoyed it so much,5,2012,07,27
208,Not what it once was but still a great place to stay,"I've stayed at the Dylan several times since 2007 and although I still enjoy it and would choose to stay here rather than anywhere else it has changed.  The rooms still have the same decor and it is looking a bit tired and worn and they probably aren't as stylish as they once were.  The staff have almost all changed, however the majority of them are friendly and helpful, we always receive a warm welcome when we arrive.
This time we were given a room with a balcony and separate bath and shower.  There was pleanty space for the 2 of us and it was nice to have the separate shower.  The only negative comment I have about the room was the pillows were too hard for me, but that's my preference.
We arrived too early to check in but we dropped off our bag and were offered a map of Dublin and were told about some things that were on.  It's always good to get some advice and tips from locals.
I had booked a deal with breakfast included, unfortunately due to our departure time on our last day it meant we only had breakfast one morning.  It was very nice but if you don't get a good deal with it included it is probably expensive.  We've had breakfast at the cafe across the road a few times and I would recommend that.  
This was one of the few days I'd been in Dublin with warm and sunny weather so we made the most of it and sat outside the hotel to have a drink.  The drinks are very expensive and the cocktail wasn't very well made.
We ate in the hotel on our second night as the weather was terrible and we didn't want to go out.  The food was delicious, staff were friendly and helpful and I think it was reasonably priced for the quality.
The hotel has changed, I don't think it will ever be as good as my first visit there but I still enjoy going there and look forward to staying there.  I would recommend it for any visit to Dublin.",5,2012,07,23
208,Attention to detail required,"My wife and i decided to stay for one night for our anniversary, i booked a style room, which was a let down, shower water pressure, room temperature and size. We booked an extra package which was a let down, rose petals on the bed where like potpourri, champagne was in chilled water, not ice, there was no music playing and the room was like an ice box. We went to the bar and there were no seats available due to the half the bar being reserved even though they hadn't arrived even when we were leaving! The Hotel send you a reminder a couple of days previous to your arrival with a link to book the restaurant even though it was booked out!! When we were checking in the girl at reception told us check out was at 12 but they don't enforce this since they serve breakfast till 12, i was pleasantly surprised and we joked about the lie in since we have a new baby. When we went for breakfast at 11.30 having been up since 10 we were told that breakfast always finishes at 11 by a very rude, abrupt and unhelpful member of staff. We explained this to a different girl called Madison at reception who apologized and offered us Brunch for the inconvenience.
I think on a whole the Hotel is nice, a bit run down, overpriced and the bar toilets are a disgrace,    i would stay again and that's mainly due to location and the fact that Madisons positive and professional approach pulled it back for the Dylan.",4,2012,07,20
208,The same money will get you a lot better quality elsewhere I Dublin.,"I stayed here with my partner overnight yesterday as we were attending a concert I Dublin. The web site looked impressive and I thought we were in for a treat in a chic boutique hotel. Upon arrival, alarm bells started when the concierge booking us in was not very welcoming. The room itself was fairly standard - nothing special at all - and very pricey. The real probs started upon return from an evening out. We got soaked in a heavy storm and upon arriving back this wasn't even acknowledged. The bed itself was the singularly most uncomfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in - both rock hard and soft in places! My back still aches now! I checked out and paid the bill next morning - this member of staff was as disinterested and unengaging as the previous shift. Breakfast was terrible - a sort of gourmet Irish breakfast gone wrong, with banana bread toast on the side! I was glad to get out of this soulless, overpriced full-of-itself show off! However, the icing on the cake was whe I got home and checked the bill again - to find they had charged me 20 euro for valet parking which I didn't even use as we were travelling by train. I even asked about taxis while paying the bill, so how they managed to charge me for valet parking is beyond me! There are a number of major players, well known names, in the Dublin hotel market in the same price bracket as this place. My advice would be to book one of them instead and avoid this poseur's paradise at all costs! And check your bill carefully if you do stay here!!",2,2012,07,18
208,Loved it!,"Love this hotel, easily the best in Dublin. Best bed ever!!!",5,2012,07,15
208,Can't fault it,"Great little hotel, hidden in a quiet spot away from the main roads.
Luxurious room, classy little touches everywhere, free wifi, free morning paper, ipod in every room with a good selection of music, real milk for free in the mini-bar, complimentary bottle of water.
Staff all friendly and great food for breakfast and dinner",5,2012,07,12
208,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel looks like a gentleman's club on approach and also has this feel in the bedrooms.  This super hotel is a must if you visit Dublin.  It is set in a leafy area of Dublin close to the Grand Canal and all the shops and restaurants.  I was impressed by the very comfortable bed, bose ipod player with fantastic tracks already set up.  The bathroom was again rather masculine but very well kitted out with a superb shower.  This is an old fashioned hotel with rather modern quirky pieces thrown in.  The restaurant offered a superb meal on a rather rainy night in Dublin and as a Wine Educator being rather fussy about wine I was delighted to be able to order superb wines by the glass - do try the Albarino.  There is a delightful heated outside patio which was rather spoiled by the number of smokers but they have to go somewhere.  I had a fantastic night's sleep and the breakfast the following morning was up there with the best.  I find it rather hard to say anything negative about the hotel so I recommend when  you are in the city to give it a try.  There were a couple of comments about it being past its best but this is untrue.  The staff are also marvellous and I highly recommend it.  I will return",5,2012,07,09
208,"So very chic, so very good...","The Dylan Hotel in Dublin is a modern hotel (renovated and refurbished in one section and new-built in the other) that exudes boutique style. From the moment you walk into reception, with its chic furniture and fittings, you know that a designer has put an enormous amount of effort into making this hotel stand out from the crowd. 

The hotel is well located in Eastmoreland Place, a quiet and leafy side street off Upper Baggot Street which is a direct route into the city centre. There is only on-street parking.

Our room was at the front right hand corner on the second floor. It had a good view over the street through two large windows and a side window looked on to the pretty garden of the block of apartments next door. 

Just like the rest of the hotel, the very large room was stylishly appointed, with a very comfortable king sized bed with good quality linen, desk, dresser, wardrobe, flat screen TV, i-Pod (which was playing music as we entered the room) and room safe. 

The bathroom was also exquisitely fitted out in Porcher sanitary ware and marble and had a bath with an overhead shower. If there was one criticism, with all the marble around the bath, it was a bit of a hike to get in and out of.

There is a ‚Äòturn down‚Äô service each night, with chocolates on our pillows and bottled water on the desk; and a complimentary newspaper on request.
 
Breakfast is taken in the Dylan‚Äôs restaurant (imaginatively called the Dylan Restaurant) on the ground floor of the hotel and has an adjacent open air area which is superb on a sunny Dublin day. The range of food is good (including house-made breads) and the service is friendly, although not particularly speedy. The restaurant itself is well worth having lunch or dinner at and has an early-bird menu that is very good value for a restaurant of its quality.

The hotel also has a popular bar with an outdoor seating area that is very well patronised by locals on a warm summer night. 

Nearby, Upper Baggot Street also has a number of good restaurants that can be recommended including Bloom Brasserie and the ‚Äògourmet‚Äô pub the Waterloo Bar and Grill. The Expresso Bar/Caf√© over the road from the Dylan is also well worth a visit. The Schoolhouse Bar in nearby Northumberland Road is another lively place to sit and drink the afternoon or evening away.

The hotel‚Äôs reception deserves particular mention. They were always friendly and helpful and were a good source of information on what to do and how to get around the city.

There also seemed to be a taxi permanently parked outside the hotel which made getting out and about very easy.",5,2012,07,02
208,overated,"Not a 5 star hotel. Decor is tired looking. It is popular as a cocktail bar for the locals and that's what it should stick to.
Reception was poor I had booked two rooms and they were only prepared for one. I had booked two luxury rooms and what I was given was in my opinion standard.My room did not have ipod dock which was meant to be a feature. The carpet was stained as were the bathroom tiles. The bathroom had a horrible smell in it. If i used hot water in the hand basin then wanted cold I had to run it for about 8 mins before cold came through. The bathroom was tiny nowhere to hang clothes. There was no drawer space for clothes. the kettle had a two inch flex which was difficult to use. On the first day I only had two tea bags and these were not replaced when used. In the bar at night we had to wait ages to get served. can't rate the food as we didn't eat there as no discount was given for residents using the restaurant. Given the cost of the rooms would have thought that would have been standard. Overall hotel is punching above it's weight, two chocs in room does not a 5 star make. In my opinion 3 to 4 star at most.",3,2012,06,24
208,Very cool and nonchalant,"The concierge gave us his parking space the receptionist was as warm as toast the rooms were wonderfully appointed in fact even the corridors are a pleasure to walk through.
A fabulous restaurant and very good cocktails.
We will definitely stay again.",4,2012,06,24
208,Nice and comfortable,"One of the most important things to me is that a place is quiet and comfortable. If it looks nice and lovely, it's a bonus. This hotel was a joy to stay in, service was great and staff were friendly. As the restaurant was busy with a ""do"" when we were there, we were served in the library, which felt a bit like being at home - but with great service. Flexibility shown was appreciated. Walking distance to central Dublin. Great stay in all.",5,2012,06,16
208,Dublin in Style,"My wife and I with our 3 young adult children just spent two nights in Dublin at The Dylan. Wonderful. A+ service in a terrific neighborhood. We didn't have a dinner but the breakfast is fantastic (eggs benedict in particular). This will cost a lot more than a B & B but it's worth it. The motif is sharp and different with bright red theme. Very cool. It's a short 20 minute walk to the center of everything in Dublin and only 5-10 minute walk to a stop for the Hop On Hop Off buses which for one price per days you can see the entire city.

208,"The vampire Lestat designed on a dole-binger budget, for the cost of 5 stars","The Dylan Hotel is a joke as a 5 star establishment. The decor is very dated .. Think the paramount hotel in NYC circa 1993 meets the vampire Lestat on a dole-binger budget. It's shabby, rundown, broken, and just plain tacky. The bathrooms smell like ashtrays because of the ventilation system, and the windows over looking the smokers balconies...  it permeates the rest of the room. Tiles are cracked and broken. Shower heads don't function. and there is little or no counter space to place toiletries. Front desk staff are helpful but tomato red sweater vests over black dress shirts remind one of a saddest Mc Donald's worker.. staff with a red complexion look eternally mad because of the shade of red in the uniform. Location is isolated slightly, though on a pretty street and easy to give cab directions. Again I really can't believe this is a five star hotel .. Yuck. 3 stars at best. As such it would be right on course, however I wouldn't have chosen it. I like my five stars to mean something, and three stars don't even register for me, as this hotel shouldn't have. ( as an aside I had prepaid and booked a second stay here at the end of my trip, since it was too late to book something else I returned, the 2nd room was much better than the first, as far as smell)",2,2012,05,31
208,quirky boutique hotel,"Stayed for a night recently at the Dylan. I really like the location in that it is really close to the city centre yet in a nice quiet area of Dublin. We stayed on a Friday and there was  ice adfter work buzz around the place - good cocktails at the bar and a nice area to sit outside both front and back of the hotel. 
Rooms are of a good size with decent bathrooms , all in wacky colours with quirky furniture - nice to stay in but I couldnt live with it ! Some nice extras like proper fresh milk to make tea / coffee, ipod docking station with Ipod stereo system and newspaper delivered in the morning. Staff are absolutely brilliant, and breakfast was first class with a nice a la carte menu, I had the kippers which were the best I've had for a long time.
Great place for a short break  and good value for money too. One small complaint would be that the rooms could be better noise proofed.",4,2012,05,22
208,nice relaxing stay,"our stay @ the Dylan was very impressive especially the room ( 305)
the girl at the desk on arrival (sorry can't remember her name) was very polite & pleasant 
the room was extremely clean & very functional (loved the i.pod deck and the Bose phone)
didn't had dinner so cannot comment,however we did have breakfast and it was excellent.
overall , staff was very efficient & professional and attention to details was spot-on
will be back again !!!!!!",5,2012,05,16
208,"Great service, beautiful hotel","I stayed one night at this lovely boutique hotel. Rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and I just love it that you can plug your iphone or ipod in the speakers and listen to your own music. The staff was very friendly. When we ordered coffee in the morning we drank it in the lounge and asked to put the coffee on our room bill. One of the staff was so alert and great to tell us that breakfast was actually included in our room rate so we did not need to pay for the coffee. 
That felt like true personal service. I would definitely come back again.",5,2012,05,09
208,5 Stars?  Easily...,"The pupose of being there was for Ulster Edinburgh rugby and I met up with an old chum who had used the place previously for business and a pal who now lives in Dublin.  At first I was put off by the price but went with it anyway.

Dylan is a 20 minute walk from town - only 5 mins by a Eu7 taxi though - but ideally placed for the Aviva Stadium, Dylan being close to Landsdowne Road.

On arrival got a great and friendly welcome in a clutter-free area with waitiing seating where you could go on-line FoC.  

Staff were knowledgeable about the area and nothing was too much trouble - not a lot of Irish accents. 

Accessed the top floor room by the lift thereafter used the stairs to my front facing room.

Hallways were immaculately clean and the room was a good, functional size with free WiFi.  No bath but a shower a giant can get into - such a nice change not having to hunch in a bathtub...

The hotel bar is very well stocked and popular with the local cocktail set - didn't see anyone drinking beers just wines, champagne, spirits and cocktails.

Breakfast: we arrived bang on 11am and never left until noon - and there was no pressure  then to leave.  First class breakfast too but the maximum price you can pay in Ireland at Eu25 a head.  Fantastic choice though - and once again, spotless, with nothing too much trouble for the staff.

Post rugby - and too many Guinness - we headed back to Dylan which was packed with with cocktail drinkers.  Ordered a good Sancerre that was reasonable priced for a 5* hotel at cEu40.

Previously when in Dublin I've stayed at the 4-Seasons, some Boutique B&B's and the 5* Clarence - this topped them all and I'll def. be back.",5,2012,04,30
208,"Yep, it's as good as the reviews","I've toyed with staying here for special occasions for a long time but the price has put me off as there are many top hotels in Dublin city that are less expensive (and closer to the city). As it turned out, my wife and I were heading out to the RDS for an exhibition last weekend, so I decided to bite the bullet and book a room (and dinner in Roly's just down the road).
If clean, luxurious, professional, boudoir-esque is what you want from a boutique hotel, this is it. I've long used TripAdvisor for guidance when choosing hotels and it delivered again this time.
Room was large with recessed ceiling and exposed roof truss. Bed was very comfortable. Staff professional yet friendly. Breakfast in room was very good. Just to register constructive criticism to keep this review balanced, slightly burnt toast with breakfast and no bath (a double shower though).
If you want a romantic getaway in Dublin, this is the one (for us anyway)",5,2012,04,23
208,Chic but now the wrong type of shabby,"Lovely staff and obviously was a very good hotel when new but it is lacking investment. TV in bath did not work, bed sagged to the middle, sofa was stained and light bulbs were not replaced. It is a good walk to town but easily manageable and parking at the hotel is reasonable. Did not eat dinners in the hotel but breakfasts were excellent although they need to find away to cool the room in the beautiful morning sun. ",2,2012,04,22
208,"Cool, Chic and Friendly","Staying here on business was a pleasure. A thoroughly modern hotel in decor, the staff were friendly and attentive, the location was ideal and the rooms were comfortable.  The food here was great and the bar was a perfect place to meet up.",5,2012,04,10
208,its still amazing!,"this is the second time at the dylan hotel, its still amazing and the customer service is second to none!. the food is excellent and resonable prices.

its about a 10 - 15 min walk from Grafton street but well worth the travelling time.",5,2012,04,08
208,All Five Stars,"An excellent experience.  Modern, centrally located (short walk from the Green).  Staff was extremely friendly.  Rooms were large, unique, with all the extras.  Full bar including a cigar menu.  Perfect passing through as a tourist or for a weekend get a way.  Will be back for sure.",5,2012,04,03
208,Cool atmosphere and service,"The Dylan is one of Dublin's coolest hotels but as a Dublin, I haven't had the opportunity to stay there, instead I've been there for lunch, brunch, dinner and drinks. The hotel is at its best in the summer. The outdoor areas and simply fantastic, they're even better than the interiors (which are a little too eccentric for my tastest). 

Food at the Dylan is a good but by no means great. The a la carte menu is over priced, as are drinks. Brunch is reasonably priced but the menu lacks favorites such as eggs benedict. Pity. 

What really lets a hotel like this down is the service. It can be slow and lacklustre. Staff tend to be forgetful and show no initiative. 

Moral of the story, go here for breakfast in the sun, a drink in the evening and make sure you're not in a rush.",3,2012,04,02
208,Stylish hotel in lovely location in dublin,"Such a great weekend at the Dylan, from start to finish. It is a stylish hotel in a great setting and has such a great atmosphere. Went down for a rugby weekend and it was just perfect. Lovely room, only complaint was bed was too small, I'm used to bigger beds! But the bar is great, amazing cocktails and lovely nibbles. Had dinner in restaurant and was lovely, service was great. The breakfast was also lovely and has a nice area to sit outside on a sunny day. Only criticism really is that some of the communal areas etc aren't as clean as I would like them, but then I am very particular about that. The staff were very friendly. I would prefer to stay in this area rather than central Dublin as it is just gorgeous!",4,2012,03,30
208,THE best hotel in Dublin,"Even locals will tell you that this is the best place to stay in Dublin.  Yes, it's not directly in the City Centre, but believe me this means you will get a decent night's sleep without the drunken crowds stumbling past your window when the bars close.  This was our first trip out of the US, and the staff was very helpful and friendly as we tried to work out the kinks in our approach to international travel.  They helped us figure out train ticketing and bus access.  They also upgraded us from a normal room to a suite.  The suite was fantastic, and large even by American hotel standards.  The bed was comfortable, the appliances were new/modern, the bathtub had a TV on its far wall and the shower was of the quality you'd expect from a spa.  The whole hotel made me think of a modern French bordello, and not in a bad way.  The decor was modern and cool-looking.  The breakfast there was also the best Irish breakfast we had our entire trip (and we ate an Irish breakfast at three other hotels while we were there).  The room prices are a bit steep, but you actually get what you're paying for.",5,2012,03,28
208,Stylish & hip. An excellent choice.,A very stylish & hip hotel. Nice big room with a very comfortable bed. REN toiletries. The staff were also extremely helpful in dealing with my requests. Great for work or pleasure!,5,2012,03,27
208,"Great Hotel, polished staff","We stayed here at St Patricks weekend and it was really good. The room 407 was amazing ... not much in the way of  natural light but this  was  compensated for by the clever design  of the room. Everything was as it should be for a 5 star hotel. Great fluffy robes and really nice REN toiletries ( which are not that easy to find in Ireland). The bathroom had a heated floor and although the lighting seemed dim there was a fab mirror- perfect for getting ready. The pre loaded i pod was also a nice touch. We had  mojitos  in the bar which were well made and  breakfast in the lovely, light filled dining room.  Highly recommended",5,2012,03,26
208,"Plush, hip hotel with great staff...","I stayed here for 10 days while on a work trip.  The staff here was extremely helpful, friendly, and willing to cater to or help with any needs or concerns.  I played golf over the weekend and the staff booked tee times, took care of my clubs, and made the experiences a pleasure.  Every morning, the staff had my coffee ready as I left to go to work.

The rooms were clean, large, and modern.  The bed was comfortable and rather plush.  The bathroom was large and spotless  and filled with great toiletries.  I'm not sure you can expect anything more from the modern, reasonably-priced, urban hotel.  

All in all, it was a great experience.  One word of caution is that the hotel is quite far from city center.  If nightlife is what you are seeking during the week, it won't be found anywhere near Dylan.  Also, there are limited restaurant options in addition to the hotel in the immediate vicinity.  This isn't the Dylan's fault (obviously) but should just be noted depending on what is important to you in your stay.",5,2012,03,24
208,Great hotel just out of the city,"Everything about the hotel was what we expected; from the great service to the contemporary decor.

A good 20 minute walk from the city centre, but pleasant on a warm, dry day.
",4,2012,03,23
208,Excellent,"I stayed in a ""Style"" room - very nicely laid out and very spacious. Excellent toiletries and plenty of water etc. provided by the turndown service.
A confusing incident happened in the restaurant where the staff seemed unaware of the offer we had. It all got a bit embarrassing at the time, but was subsequently sorted out by the staff member who followed up with my wife. She was assured that the staff would be better informed in future of the details of any offers which are available. 
I would definitely go back there - location, ambience, etc. was perfect. 
Oh yes, and the espresso Martinis were ridiculously good!",4,2012,03,23
208,Stay somewhere else,"I stayed for one night at the Dylan and did not enjoy it, our room was really noisey and the bed very uncomfortable the service was really poor we waited 45 minutes for breakfast! I emailed hotel manager to complain and she did not even reply.  In dublin I have stayed in much nicer hotels I wanted to give the Dylan a try but it was just a let down.",2,2012,03,09
208,Terrific haven in city centre,"Hotel is very well appointed. Everything is top class from the reception staff to the patio areas and interior decor. Plenty towels in room and spotlessly white robes in the closet. Room service was superb. Very quiet too. Room was a little dark. Not a problem for most but I do like a lot of light! Valet parking very efficient. Nothing seemed to be a problem to the staff. I think they make the hotel. So pleasant and without any airs and graces. I would have no problem recommending the hotel. The breakfast was very nice;  Eggs Hollandaise, top class but toast was dry and hard! Minor issue but important to note. As a cook I believe the small things matter. All in all I would return and next time request a room in the front of the hotel, where the sunlight was streaming in through the windows of this stunning building. One note, no hair dryer in room but I am sure if I had asked for one it would have been supplied immediately!",5,2012,03,08
208,Wonderful stay in a beautiful Hotel!!!,"Myself and my boyfriend (and small dog) recently stayed in the Dylan for one night and our only wish was that we were staying for longer!!! Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Really good location, walking distance to great restaurants,pubs and the city centre. Even though it is so close to the busy areas it is in a lovley secluded and quiet area, no noise disturbance(had the best night sleep). The rooms are lovely, everything you could wish for and the bathroom was very spacious(I loved the shower!). We had room service, which was very prompt and the food was lovely. We both ordered Steak. I found the heated platters great for keeping our plates and food warm, great idea! Also the cocktails were delicious, also great atmosphere around the bar, I think there must have a been a party as it was quite busy, not that it affected service or anything. We found all the staff from reception staff to valet all very polite and friendly. As a person that works in the hotel industry I really must applaud The dylan for it's excellant level of service and its friendliness and warmth of staff, hotels like this are few and far between. Looking forward to returning again in the future!",5,2012,03,05
208,Great Hotel,"Have stayed in The Dylan a few times and can't fault it. This time we were staying as we were going to see Dirty Dancing in the Grand Canal which is only a short journey away.

The room itself was large and very welcoming. A nice touch on a arrival is the hand written note and not just an informal print out from the hotel and also 2 gorgeous brownies had been left for us also.

The staff are very helpful and there is a lovely bar also which does a fantastic selection of cocktails and a lovely restaraunt also. Great place to stay for a special occassion or if you are heading to events in Grand Canal, Rds or the Aviva",5,2012,03,05
208,never disappoints!,"After staying in D4 Berkeley for a night this was pure luxury!!
Not our first visit to the Dylan but I don't know why we ever try anywhere else. Simply can't be beaten for comfort and service and great value too!!",5,2012,03,04
208,Great Boutique Hotel,"Spent one night here on a work trip and would highly recommend.  Really spacious, clean, quiet and nicely decorated rooms.  High quality finishes including extra technology elements such as MP3 player with its own ipod loaded with music from the hotel.  Excellent bedding with lovely sheets and pillows -
The location was great too for me - only a short taxi to our offices.  Staff were pleasant, helpful and well organised when I arrived, so no long waits to checkin and out.
I had breakfast downstairs and this was delicious though a little over-priced, so try to get it included in the room price.",5,2012,02,29
208,Enjoyable stay at this lovely relaxed hotel,"Recently stayed for 2 nights in a ‚ÄòStyle‚Äô room. Room itself was lovely, spacious, quiet and very clean. 
The hotel we found very relaxing and quite chilled. It was nice to have modern yet relaxing type music in the lounge areas, where you could sit and relax (especially after spending a day walking around the city.) The staff appeared to be very friendly and efficient. We were made to feel welcome throughout our stay and I felt this to be genuine. 
We ate in the hotel restaurant on one evening- food was of a high standard, excellently presented. Yes both the meal and drinks were expensive, but that‚Äôs normal 5 star prices.
We did think though 21 euro for a continental breakfast a bit steep, so we walked a little way into town and ate at Foleys bar- excellent full Irish breakfast for 9 euro including tea and toast (so good we ate there 2 days in a row)
Did have to request bottles of water but this was quickly rectified by staff. Bit disappointed about the complementary tea tray- only 2 tea-bags and 4 little pots of milk, no biscuits. However left a message for housekeeping and again this was rectified even provided a little bottle of fresh milk, which I thought was a nice touch.
Overall a lovely stay, would certainly recommend this hotel, just bring comfortable shoes!",5,2012,02,28
208,Boutique hotel in a great location .,"Boutiquey without trying too hard. Just nicely done. The iPod in it's Bose dock was playing Deane Martin when I entered the room. Nice touch to have the music on. √úber trendy efficient staff. Breakfast service was super - and one of the nicest breakfast menus I've seen. Valet parking for 10 Euro. Was on my own so didn't get to take full advantage of the mini-bar which contained amongst other things, champagne a Karma Sutra pack and a disposable camera. Looking forward to going back with my wife next time (because of the ahem...atmosphere and the funky d√©cor of course, not the mini-bar contents!)",4,2012,02,25
208,Superb experience!!,"Thoroughly enjoyed our weekend break here, very refreshing to see a hotel with style and personality. We had a beautiful meal and the service was fantastic! Only downside was the bed was quite small but the room overall was cosy, modern and provided everything that we needed. Will definitely be recommending Dylan to my friends.",5,2012,02,22
208,Fantastic Stay - Each Time!,"I've stayed at the Dylan twice in the last 6 months while in Dublin on business.  The rooms are unique, the bathrooms stylish, and the staff is first-rate.  The staff bent over backward to ensure a wonderful stay.  They arranged for a local yoga class, found a fun farm-to-table restaurant, exchanged currency, and ensured that all of my needs were met.  I would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,02,18
208,Lovely break in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, good standard of accommodation. Room was on first floor facing the street so felt a bit exposed when curtains open, shame as lovely setting. Books deal through expedia so never know if you get a less popular room? 
furnishings good and bed very comfortable.
The location, although a small walk from buzz of centre of Dublin was brilliant, good local pubs, restaurants and cafes. We did not eat in hotel as menu although good didn't appeal and breakfast was expensive. 
Staff were helpful and friendly.
The only downside was the lack of tea and coffee replenishment and milk cartons for this hotel made it look cheap. We stayed at a premier in prior to coming out and they had a better selection and not just one tea bag each! didn't want to seem english and ask for more tea so my own fault especially as I did ask for some toiletries that were not replenished and felt silly for asking..!!",4,2012,02,14
208,"Cool, boutique Hotel in Dublin","I stayed here on a business trip in 2011, and thought this was a great hotel. Cool and quirky and just a fun place to stay. Nice bar and restaurant, it's also in a good location, 10-15mins from the city centre on foot",4,2012,02,12
208,Hip hotel,"We were drawn by the hip environment.  W-like, youthful and colorful with fun decorative splashes.  WiFi everywhere.  In a residential neighborhood about a 20 min walk from the center city - a great walk as you'll pass many well ranked restaurants.  Went for the upgraded room and it was so worth it - spacious, comfortable, heated floors in the bathroom, hot water maker for tea, and an excellent AC/heater that was even quiet!  A few minuses... there is no place to work out on premises - and the place they have access to is minimal - so if a gym is important this place won't work well.  The hotel restaurant's wine list is lacking for new world options...  and the bottles we had were clearly not stored well at all.  But overall we are glad we stayed.",5,2012,02,12
208,Beats the best,"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin for two nights and then at the Dylan and it's the Dylan that wins without question. The rooms are lovely, helpful and friendly staff are on hand (Madison when I booked the room in particular). The place has style (does risk being a little OTT) but gives it a lot more character than places like the Four Seasons where you'd think you were staying in your Grans spare bedroom. Would stay here again.",5,2012,02,11
208,"Great hotel, excellent location.","Very modern, luxuries hotel. Located with in walking distance to the city center. Check out the corner coffee shop for breakfast or lunch.",5,2012,02,03
208,Great boutique hotel in a great location,Have stayed here a couple of times and its always a treat. The rooms are very cool and individually styled  - so much nicer than the generic furnishings you find in most hotels. Great bar - although the restaurant is overpriced. There are so many good places to eat within 5 mins walk for much better value. Staff are fantastic - they have nailed the concept of service! Yes its expensive but worth it for a special treat.,5,2012,01,30
208,Slow service. Not as cool as it used to be.,"The building and rooms are impressive however the Dylan needs to get with the timed and realise that there is a recession in Irelsnd. The rated are still overpriced and the service is slow in general. I remember when this place was buzzing. However it is still probably the trendiest hotel in Dublin if that's what you want as The Morrison Hotel on the quays is looking dated. It's quite a walk into
Town from the Dylan so be prepared to taxi back and forth. Over rated I think.",3,2012,01,22
208,Class,"Had the pleasure of staying at the Dylan this January excellent Hotel, Class service ease of parking great food beautifully bedroom and the Breakfast is a most enjoyable experience. The hotel is expensive but for that special occasion its money well spent and the staff are superb so if you want a really enjoyable experience I can highly recommend the Dylan Dublin",5,2012,01,20
208,Want for nothing,"This place is awesome, the people , the luxurious rooms, and lounge. Very cool design in a great area.  Ten very nice restaurants and pubs in an adjacent neighborhood.",5,2012,01,10
208,"Luxurious, chic hotel, close to Dublin city centre","We spent two nights in the Dylan close to Christmas, and had a wonderful stay.  The staff were excellent, always willing to accommodate any requests.  We had dinner in the restaurant one of the nights, which we both found delicious.  The Dylan is a very chic hotel, but it also has a chilled out side to it, and I was a big fan of the dj who stops by a few nights during the week.  The rooms themselves are exquisite, with a bose stereo system and Dylan ipod welcoming you to the room.  The gym is perhaps a little small, and unfortunately there is no pool or jacuzzi, which would be a great addition, but otherwise this is a top class hotel and we had a wonderful hotel.",5,2012,01,02
208,A Christmas break away...,"A romantic weekend had been planned in Dublin, albeit with a side order of Bath vs Leinster thrown in! Fantastic service from the off - a courtesy call the day before, bags taken up to the room, chocolate brownies and welcome note, large room equipped with Bose sound system, pre-tuned iPod, B&O phone, dressing gowns and slippers etc. Speedy room service, Guiness on tap, great party atmosphere in bar on Saturday night - even the locals choose it as a social gathering! Only gripe would be the controversial items in the fridge - seedy karma sutra packs made it feel like you were in Amsterdam rather than Dublin. Suggest ditch the kinky stuff for toothpaste in the bathroom! Will definitely return - just maybe next time with someone who appreciates it. Tom, Somerset",5,2011,12,22
208,True 5 star hotel,"I stayed there at beginning of december for a night on a girly night in the city. We had booked a twin room which was honoured but the beds were very close together and single sized ie 3 ft sized. That said the linen was excellent and the beds comfortable. The room was quiet and thre was a balcony if you wanted to smoke, ashtray  provided. The staff at front desk were more than willing to help re suggestions  for things to do, we did not avail as we knew dublin well. Overall a pleasant stay if a little pricey, friendly staff and lovely location. ",5,2011,12,20
208,Excellent boutique hotel,"This is a really lovely hotel and great if you want to be slightly away from the hustle and bustle of Friday and Saturday night Dublin.  It's in a quiet residential street and even though we had a room right above the restaurant it was really peaceful.  (You might want to double check this in the summer though when they have tables outside). The staff at the hotel are charming, efficient and extremely helpful.  Definitely get a rate including breakfast - they have a great range of breakfast choices but if you go for the Irish breakfast you won't have to eat again until dinner. Our standard double room was spotless and a decent size.  The whole place has a nice vibe and we enjoyed the dj in the bar whilst having a night cap on Saturday night.  We had dinner in the restaurant on Sunday night and the food was extremely good - the menu is a prix fixe. I wouldn't think twice about staying here the next time I go to Dublin.",4,2011,12,18
208,Bursting with personality and charm...,"The Dylan is a rather eccentric property with a design that echoes somewhat of an old-fashioned charm, while fusing it with a decidedly modern approach.  With its youthful, friendly and helpful staff, The Dylan feels more like a luxurious private mansion than a hotel.  The five-star boutique hotel manages to feel very discreet, yet welcoming and personable.

The hotel is all about personality and subtle little touches such as the incredibly delicious brownies that await you on arrival, and the special goodies that you can find after the nightly turn-down. In addition to the traditional minty chocolate left on your pillow, you can expect to find complimentary bottles of VOSS water and a unique aromatherapy ‚Äúsleep well‚Äù spray.

The rooms are not exceedingly large, but comfortable, made to feel even larger due to the placement of mirrors across one wall. Some rooms come with terraces, which is a nice thing to have, although there is no real view to enjoy. The amenities in the room are very well thought out though, including a flat screen TV, very large bottles of fine shampoos, conditioners and bath salts, heated towel rack, vanity kits, slippers, wi-fi, an overpriced mini-bar (sadly, a staple in nearly all hotels), and an ipod with Bose speakers. The ipod, thoughtfully, comes loaded with some music and Dublin city audio guides, so you can take it with you on walks around the city.  Unfortunately though, with all these great amenities, one very important thing was overlooked: the bed.  The bed & pillows are on the harder side, and not as cozy as expected ‚Äì although some people swear that sleeping on a hard bed is the better choice for your back.

On sleepless nights, the hotel also has a library for guests to borrow books and a plush bar. In the morning, they can awake to some delicious treats served in the hotel‚Äôs breakfast room ‚Äì buffet or a la carte, the breakfast there is well worth having.

Located in an affluent suburb, The Dylan‚Äôs surroundings are without a shortage of nice pubs and restaurants, but it is definitely a bit removed from the more ‚Äúhappening‚Äù parts of the city and the major tourist attractions.  However, they are all within a short bus or taxi ride and a 15 minute walk to Grafton St and St. Stephens Green.

Chic, charming, elegant and bursting with personality, The Dylan is sure to host a memorable stay. Definitely one of the more unique hotels ‚Äì a special place.",5,2011,12,17
208,"When in Dublin, Dylan.","The Dylan was a hip, classy, clean, modern, accommodating, very friendly hotel. If you are staying in Dublin, stay at the Dylan. You won't regret it and will begin planning your next trip back before you leave. By the way, the beds were the best we've ever slept in and can't find any like them anywhere in the U.S. We'd go back just to sleep on those beds.",5,2011,12,17
208,Great hotel; a little away from the action,"The Dylan was a great a hotel.  Our room was quite large; a big surprise for Europe.  The staff could not be more friendly and helpful; truely amazing!  Especially Zoltan.

Some potential nits:
The Dylan is a little outside of central Dublin (though it is actually a small city).  So most things are a 15-45 minute walk rather than 10-30 minute walk but it didn't bother us at all and the price was much more reasonable than comparable more centrally located hotels.

Breakfast at the hotel was a rip off! 21EU for  a continental breakfast , 25Euros for full breakfast.  A cafe across the street and seemingly always open had fresh baked pastries and great coffee for less than 5EU and a full breakfast for 10EU!

Last thing, if internet access is important check ur room.  Ours had trouble with the wireless though in the lobby and other rooms it was fine!

overall a delightful hotel and I would recommend it!",4,2011,12,14
208,Trendy place in Dublin,"Trendy hotel within walking distance from the city center. Beautifull designer furniture. Very polite and effective staff, Breakfast had a good variety as well you could choose from a menu that offered hot. Dinner menu could be a bit more extended. Spacious room (305), with confortable beds and pillows. Valet parking and wifi worked perfect. I highly recommend a stay here while visiting Dublin.",5,2011,12,10
208,Comfortable,"Overall very good hotel. Room was a good size - underfloor heating and heated towel rail good features in bathroom. However lack of shelf space in bathroom, no bath and could hear  noise in corridor, from lift and neighbouring rooms. Bed and pillows were quite uncomfortable. It is a good 10 minute walk to St Stephens Green (Best Coffee on the Green was good for a quick pitstop).
Eating in was a bit pricey, though food was good. Good alternative was the Waterloo Bar and Grill round the corner at half the price and a great alternative was the Bang restaurant in Merrion Row (similar price to hotel, but very tasty food). Also expresso bar across the road cheaper alternative for breakfast.",4,2011,12,03
208,Excellent Hotel within walking distance of Grafton Street,"On arrival of this hotel we asked could we check in to be told the room wasn't ready, this was fine as it was only 11am.  The girl at reception told us they could park the car and take our luggage for us, which was great, and they would give us a call when the room was ready.  I went to use the bathroom and when I came back my husband had been talking to the receptionist and when she found out it was my 40th birthday she upgraded us with no extra charge and as there was an upgraded room ready she let us check in there and then.  The room was just beautiful, lovely and bright, spacious and even had a tv in the bathroom!  Our whole experience of the hotel was first class, when you pay a bit more for something you always hope its going to be ok but this was so much more.  The staff were all very pleasant and helpful, without being ""over the top"".  

I would say this is a hotel close to the city centre which is very modern, without being pretentious, it is very comfortable and cozy - it doesn't give you the feeling of a big city centre hotel where you are only a number, you actually felt the staff the actually cared and wanted to help.  Hopefully we will return again sometime.",5,2011,11,28
208,Worth every penny.,"I always worry when I book something that costs a little more than I am used to spending. You woant to make sure it's worth the cost. My husband and I found that it was completely worth it. It was the perfect hotel for us - welcoming, chic without being pretentious, comfortable, modern and yet cozy, lovely staff, and delicious food. We plan on going back to Dublin in the future and we will definitely be back at The Dylan.",5,2011,11,08
208,Interesting hotel with major faults,"I recently spent two nights at the Dylan - it was my first (and possibly) last time staying there. My experience does not match what others have found.

First off the positives:
- The location of the hotel is fine for those requiring access to the south side of the city centre. 
- The room was spacious and well furnished
- Complimentary wifi worked fine with a decent signal throughout the hotel

Now for the negatives - there were several issues encountered as part of the my stay:
- on the first night, a dog barked for most of the night interrupting my sleep and others. The hotel has a pet-friendly policy which is hidden away on the FAQ section of their website. I did raise the issue with a member of the staff on the following morning and got an answer which suggested that the pets had priority. Given I had paid almost 200 euros per night to stay there, I found the attitude a little hard to understand.
- Soundproofing between rooms is poor.
- Car parking is valet only and is expensive.
- During my stay, I did not feel very welcome. The staff can best be described as aloof.
- The television in my room did not work properly - would not power off or change channel.
-  Breakfast was included in the room rate - it is not worth paying for separately. Over-priced  and lukewarm on both mornings.

In general I would not recommend this hotel - it appears to be a carryover from the Celtic Tiger which has not moved with the times.

Final note - I did leave a comment card for the manager outlining the issues I found and have given the hotel time to respond. However I have not received any response leading to this negative review.",3,2011,11,01
208,Excellent again!,"My husband booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday. We had stayed here in the past and it is a special place for us.
Once again we were given a spacious room which was decorated beautifully.
The bed was massive and uber-comfy. The bathroom was spotless and full of towels and toiletries.
On arrival there was a card and some chocolate brownies left in the room for us, a lovely touch.
Room service breakfast was delicious and plentiful, and as before the staff were friendly and welcoming.
Can't wait for our next visit!",5,2011,10,31
208,Think before you book,"I booked this hotel with high expectations of a relaxing and luxurious weekend. 

The interiors seem nice from afar but on closer inspection were shabby and in need of repair.  

The main bar is small and inadequately designed in terms of layout and function.  The staff were friendly but lacked any real training in basic hospitality, appearing flustered and under pressure, the male toilets were dirty and the bins were overflowing with wast paper, on route to the toilets the light fixtures were covered in dust and cobwebs.

We booked a suite hoping to indulge in some luxury and comfort normally what you would expect from a boutique hotel. 

The room was small and disappointing for a  four star hotel.  The material and soft furnishing were cheap and poor quality .  The bathroom was completely dysfunctional with low grade fixtures, not marble as advertised on their website. The shower head was wrongly positioned over the bath, making it unsafe to shower, with the taps at the opposite end of the bath. The bathroom door opened into the wash basin (pic attached ).. The alcoves in the room were dusty and dirty..

I complained to Grainne the hotel manager about my room and she apologised that she could not relocate us as the hotel was full,  From a customer service point of view I found the manager's attitude amateurish.

I have stayed in better Dublin hotels such as The Morgan and The Westbury at half the price! while I was complaining the hotel openly admitted that prices had been hiked up  to coincide with an Irish rugby match.     I have attached pictures & strongly advise against paying for this over priced under value hotel.",1,2011,10,30
208,"Great service, will return","Trusting the Tripadvisor community payed off. The Dylan truly is a very nice place to stay in Dublin, close to downtown even by foot, but quiet and peaceful at night. I especially appreciated the service, which was better than anticipated even for a boutique hotel. Add to this the affordability and you indeed have a hotel I can only recommend.",4,2011,10,30
208,Our best stay in Ireland,"Msot of our our nights were spent in B&Bs (which is great fun in Ireland) but I wanted to splurge in Dublin and the Dylan did not disappoint. The location is a quiet neighborhood but it just a short walk to Stephens Green and Grafton Street so that was perfect.

The staff was great, my room was very nice. I've not quit telling friends about the flat screen in the shower, lol.

Modern, clean, service and location. What more could one want?

I will definitely return!",5,2011,10,22
208,first rate,"Having stayed here a few years ago.I hoped it was going to be as memorable this time and it did not disappoint. The room was beautiful and the staff were excellent and not intrusive unlike in similar hotels.its only a short walk to stephens green, so the quietness is a bonus.I have no problem in recommending this hotel as it ticks all the boxes for a stay.Especially a romantic one.",5,2011,10,15
208,Try something unusual just outside the central box,"Tucked away on a small street just outside the Grand Canal off Lower Baggot Street, the Dylan Hotel is somewhat off the beaten path, but in south Dublin you can walk anywhere in half an hour, so we thought it was a great location. The Dylan is not a suit-and-tie kind of place. The decor is a bit funky, and I might add, some of the patrons as well, but it is all good. The area had many restaurants, cafes, food stores, taxis and bus stops, so we never felt too far from anything.
The hotel staff was very welcoming and helpful.  Like many, we arrived too early to check in, so they held our bags and had placed them in our room before we returned from a walk.  Any question or trouble we had, be it with the internet, balcony door, or ordering a taxi, was taken care of quickly and pleasantly.
We had requested a quiet room, and were placed on the third floor.  The room was clean, spacious, and well-equipped with expected items: robes, a safe, plenty of closet space, evening turn down with goodies, comfortable bed, music, flat-screen TV, morning paper. The only complaint we had was that the bathroom, which was otherwise large, had too little space for personal items and too few hooks for towels.  
The hotel has a restaurant and a nice bar, which are open all day.  
We would certainly stay here again, and recommend it to others.",4,2011,09,19
208,Swanky and Stylish,"Stayed at the Dylan with another couple from Chicago.  While the Dylan was not our first choice for location it was a hotel with style and great service.  Nicely decorated, comfortable rooms and a helpful staff. This hotel just oozes with ambiance and the staff is super helpful.  A great lounge and excellent bartender was the icing on the ""cake"".  It was worth the walk to St. Stephens Green.",4,2011,09,15
208,Nice but a bit 'fake',"Its a lovely place to stay for a romantic night or weekend.  Lovely rooms, nice restaurant.  Bad points: after a few moments of us checking into our room, their staff kept knocking on the door offering us water. Whether they genuinly were worried of us being dehydrated (although mini bar does supply you with (gasp) a little quater bottle at 3.50 euro - or simply were trying to sell some more (we were unclear whether this was complementary, so decided not to drink it eventually;-) ) - either way, it was quite annoying.  The strawberries in chocolate upon our arrival were not so numerous as one would like them to be and although they have a lot of 'naughty' funny items in the mini fridge (like camasutra kit and fruity condoms, etc) - they clearly didn't think it through til the end, as at the check out they manage to actually ask you whether you've used any of these items and which ones were those.  Luckily enough, we didn't - but I just imagined my horror of having to recite used items in numerical order if I did, with people standing (also waiting to check out) behind me!:-)
Overall, its an 'ok' romantiky place to stay - thei bar is a bit 'strange' for want of a better word, slightly smelly and a bit like Lilly Bordello VIP room - but quite nice nevertheless.  Breakfast is not included (which is annoying) and makes it quite an expensive stay if you were to order one (around 27 eur for a full irish one).  Good point - I really thought it would be an excellent venue for a small wedding or a brilliant place to wow your girlfriend (boyfriend)!",4,2011,09,12
208,Beautiful hotel - service requires attention,"This is a beautiful hotel with interesting and original d√©cor and top quality rooms. Each room is different. I have stayed here five or six times, had a different room each visit and have always been pleasantly surprised. This time I had room 208 which has a small balcony. The hotel restaurant is excellent and quite reasonable if you have the set dinner menu. The cooked breakfast is exemplary and highly recommended.

The only drawback is, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, the patchy service. When I arrived the person on reception was on the telephone to a potential client. I stood at the desk for a while and was completely ignored. It would be easy to cover the phone and say ‚ÄòPlease take a seat, I‚Äôll be with you as soon as possible‚Äô, but no! The receptionist continued describing the rooms, the various packages available, and studiously avoided looking at me or acknowledging my presence in any way. In the end I gave up and went outside for a cigarette. When I returned she was still on the phone, discussing with the same client the various restaurants in the locality. Finally, fully ten minutes after I arrived a second person turned up and checked me in without a word of apology. 

The combination of beautiful hotels and rubbish service is so common these days. What are management and owners thinking? Do they not read the reviews of their own hotels? Hire more Swiss!

I was so annoyed by the experience of the check in that I denied myself the pleasure of eating dinner in the restaurant and went round the corner to the very excellent Langkawi Malaysian restaurant. (46 Upper Baggot Street). This a very good place with top quality real Malaysian cooking.",4,2011,09,09
208,Happily stay at this beautiful hotel anytime,Walk and walk.  so much to see.  City hop on hop off bus is wonderful to get locations.  Walk tour to Wicklow 1 hr from Dublin so worthwhile,5,2011,09,06
208,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel ! ! ! !,"We absolutely loved the Dylan from the moment we got out of the taxi. Zoltan was there to escort us into the lobby and carry our luggage. We didn't find out till later that he is a partial owner. My fiance and I had spent the previous week in London and were exhausted from all the walking. Not to mention I had proposed the night before arriving in Dublin. The Dylan was like a spa retreat for us. A great place to relax and leisurely see the city in all its glory as well as to fully bask in the fact that we had just taken our relationship to the next level. Whenever we needed something, Zoltan was there. Whether to recommend a restaurant, walking route or bus schedule. I cannot believe the price we were able to get on expedia for what I now consider a luxury boutique hotel. Thanks to everyone at the Dylan for making our trip to Dublin truly memorable.",5,2011,08,22
208,Nice Hotel -pricey but good,"This was a last minute business trip. Hotel is a bit out of town for my liking and the easiest way is to grab a taxi. Check in and Welcome efficient but non descript. You need to pay a deposit of 50euro a night for mini bar etc on arrival. Beware of this if you only have a debit card like me cos it will take the ‚Ç¨50 off you.

Room was beautiful and the bed was very comfy. I didn't stay for breakfast but then again the hotel is 2 mins walk from Baggot street where there is loads of cafes AND there is a tiny little cafe accross the street from the hotel which is very nice.
Room came with a safe which was very handy for the ipad etc. Room service was excellent.

Nice little touches include: ipod in the room playing music when you come in, little hand written keycard holders, a nice velvet Z on the door handle for sleep. Basically all you expect with a little extra thrown in.",4,2011,08,19
208,Loved it!,"We stayed here on a two night break to Dublin.  A chic 5* Boutique hotel, comfortable beds and good toiletries. About a ten minute walk to Dublin city centre.We did not eat here but staff were very helpful recommending good restaurants. Be warned though, Dublin is a very expensive city.",5,2011,08,11
208,Terrible service and staff attitude,"This is the first time I've ever written a review but I felt compelled to do so after a really, really disappointing experience at The Dylan Hotel in Dublin. It's beautifully done, but the warm Irish welcome that comes naturally in other establishments is non existent in this hotel. 

I was expecting better things after speaking to a couple of the (Irish) reservations staff over the phone. They were friendly, helpful and really warm and Barry went out of his way to accomodate us when I needed to change our booking at the last minute. 

When we actually arrived to check in - completely different story. The two staff on the front desk were so aloof and unfriendly. After a crazy explaination about needing to take a 50euro deposit due to it being a visa debit card (at 200 euro for the room for 1 night with no breakfast, I'd like to think we'd be good for 50 euro!!) the two staff then completely ignored me for TEN MINUTES whilst my husband was outside trying to scramble change together to put in the parking meter. 

Nobody else arrived during this time and they stood robotically behind their screens ignoring me. No offer to take our large bag up to the room, no offer of a coffee or friendly chit chat ""had we come far, would i like a look around etc.""  This place is supposed to be 5 star! If anything, the odd snotty glance to see if I was still clogging up their reception area (and we're quite well heeled not scruff bags in case you were wondering!). When my husband came back in after sorting out the parking meter he was flabbergasted the bag and (me!) were still sitting there. 

After settling into our room, we had arranged to meet local friends in the bar. And this time it was the turn of the bar staff to be utterly crap. No pleasant greeting, no offer to help carry the drinks to the outside tables, just attitude, attitude, attitude. The final straw was when I politely asked a passing waiter if he could please call us a taxi as we had a restaurant reservation. He barely glanced in my direction and said ""do it at reception."" 

That was the final straw. My husband flipped out and went to reception and asked to see the manager. The duty manager (who was one of the aforementioned check in staff) was very apologetic and they didn't charge us for the drinks we'd had in the bar and offered us complimentary bkfast the next day. All very kind of him, and we appreciated this. BUT and it's a big but, no amount of free booze or sausages would make us return to this hotel until they sort out the service and attitude of staff which I imagine comes from the top down.  The owner and managers could do with a trip to a few local B&B's to see how genuine, warm Irish folk greet their guests and make them feel valued and well looked after. Stunning decor but a bitter disappointment in terms of customer experience.",2,2011,08,01
208,Dylan... a real gem of a hotel.,"Stunning, chic decor and spacious rooms with Italian marble bathrooms are offered at this 5-star trendy boutique hotel. The Dylan hotel is located just a nice 10-minute walk from Dublin city centre. However, breakfast was not very good and very expensive. There is a lovely small restaurant oposite the hotel which does a super breakfast at half the price. Be aware Friday nights the hotel main bar area is swamped with local youngsters.",5,2011,07,29
208,"Fab hotel, but...","The Dylan is lavishly presented and very photogenic, no expense has been spared in its stylish presentation both outside and in, and beautiful colours have been used.  It is set in a tranquil leafy area of Dublin with a green space opposite.  It is quite tucked away, but that makes it more 'exclusive' in my opinion.  The public areas are highly impressive and the bar is great.  HOWEVER I was disappointed in the 2 bedrooms we saw.  The bathrooms were great and the bed very comfy.  BUT The air conditioning emitted a really horrible smell of stale water and was freezing.  Happily there is an 'off' switch.  The first room we were in was very small and quite dark, with no bath which I had requested and on booking had been told would be no problem.  Reception at first declined to move us but after some persuasion (and explaining my medical condition which requires a bath rather than shower), eventually we got moved to the room next door which was larger and had a bath, but had the same horrible smell from the air conditioning and worse - the window was totally screwed shut, so no hope of clean fresh air.  The hotel had already struggled to move us as it was apparently booked up so we put up with it, but were very overheated and airless, and had a very restless night. Staff are overall civil but we didn't feel a  'warm Dublin welcome'.  I'd recommend you phone hotel directly to get the best price and discuss the rooms, we managed to get a deal which included valet parking (normally 20 euros per night) and chose to save lots more euros by eating breakfast at the truly excellent cool atmospheric cafe bar across the street which is open from morning to night.  I would stay again - but would have to have a different room than the ones we saw!  Oh, and check out the guesthouse Number 31, for a true Dublin welcome!",4,2011,07,28
208,"Fantastic Hotel, Suberb Location","My Wife and I decided to spend a relaxing weekend in Dublin and chose the Dylan for its unique style. The staff were more than helpful and saw to our every need. The location is seccond to none, located on a  exclusive street in Dublin's mose upmarket and expensive area, however only a 35min walk fron Dublins Museums and Shopping districts. We decided to eat  in the Dylan restraunt on our first night and found no fault with any of the food however the wine selection was pricey to say the least. I definitly would reccomend the Dylan for anyone looking for a luxury break in Dublin. We will definitly return to the Dylan.",5,2011,07,22
208,Nice place but....,"Don't make the mistake of ordering any food here. We made the mistake of having breakfast when we first arrived and were waiting for our room to be ready. 

I didn't like the location very much either. The walk to and from the city center was nondescript and the neighborhood surrounding the hotel lacked much in the way of amenities or decent restaurants. 

However, the hotel staff was excellent and the rooms were nicely done with very comfortable beds. There was a nice little lounge area downstairs with some outdoor seating too.",4,2011,07,21
208,Fabulous boutique hotel 20 mins walk from Grafton street,"Lovely building, very helpful staff and cool decor. A very trendy hotel with an intimate feel. Staff were very helpful.

Room was well equipped although if I was being overly critical I felt the bathrooms needed updating to be in line with everything else as this really is quite a trendy place! As with any inner city lodging, the rooms are not massive and ours was quite dark, but those minor points aside, fabulous service and an easy stroll into the centre of Dublin. Great for a romantic weekend away, but our daughter was equally at home here (5 years old). 

One tiny gripe - I felt the Euro 20 was a bit punchy for parking.",4,2011,07,11
208,Our Ireland trip,"The staff at the Dylan was very helpful to us. When we arrivied and our room was not ready they offered us a cup of coffee or tea we had a (1) cup of coffee we were charged 21 Euros for that cup of coffee. (we did not dispute the charge we needed to get to the airport) 
 The room was nice but not what was listed in our travel plans. Things that were listed in the room were not there. 
The Dylan is in a peaceful part of town not a far walk from anything you have in mind.",3,2011,07,06
208,"Lovely area, great food, decent rooms","The Dylan hotel is lovely. Tucked away down a quiet lane, just off the main street. The food is great, the service is friendly. The rooms weren't really my style. It was dark and I had a view of a brick wall, the bathroom is small- though credit to the awesome triple shower heads and great toiletries.",3,2011,06,28
208,Great hotel!,"Beautiful rooms, great service and very romantic!  Could not fault this hotel in any way!  Well worth the money.",5,2011,06,16
208,Try hard and succeed,"Whenever I stay in Dublin, I always end up being stressed out by the traffic and noise everywhere. 

The Dylan Hotel was an eye opener for me, revealing a quieter and more civilised side to this great city.

You get what you pay for in terms of creature comforts, e.g. excellent beds, individually designed rooms, well equipped bathrooms etc. 

The restaurant serves very agreeable food although sadly nobody working in the restaurant seemed to have thought about what wine could work with the dishes on offer (beyond ""white with fish, red with meat"") - a lamentable oversight given that so much effort obviously goes into the food and that the wines are not exactly cheap. I hope they fix this. 

But here's what makes the Dylan Hotel stand out above every other hotel in Dublin: the staff.

Virtually every single member of staff we met displayed the exact right balance of competence, professionalism and courtesy that is so lacking in other pricier hotels. Even the cleaners seem to enjoy their jobs! 

Tip: when booking, do like us and request a quieter room that doesn't overlook the courtyard or front where people sit drinking and smoking at night. Less interesting view, but better sleep!",4,2011,06,14
208,"Comfortable rooms, but disturbing decor and unprofessional staff","We chose this hotel thinking it would be a ""fun"" hotel for a group of girls (we were in Ireland for a bachelorette party). We found the decor to be of very bad taste, looking like a strip club more than like a hotel! The staff wasn't professional at all, we asked for recommendations for a restaurant and were sent to what was supposed to be ""the best sushi place in Dublin"", which turned out to be a very average restaurant. Most importantly, their credit card system was down at checkout, and it ended taking so long that it made us miss our flight back to Geneva (needless to say that since there is only ONE daily flight to Geneva, we had to pay excruciating fees to get on another non-direct flight). Lastly, they charged us ‚Ç¨60 for a breakfast that we never took. Never again.",2,2011,05,31
208,out of the ordinary well worth it,spent a week at the Dylan ans when I forst walked in I thought oh no. Very retro but then you get your room and it is great large clean and modern. I travel the world and it is nice to go somewhere a little different friendly staff great food and a bar that draws in the locals. overall A1,5,2011,05,31
208,Fantastic Hotel even if the decor is a bit naf!,"It was quite a while ago since I stayed there with my partner. An impression was made the second we entered the lobby with the very professional ladies on the front desk all in very sleek dresses and more than willing to look after you and ensured we were checked in with ultra precision. The extra touch that made it 5 star was being escorted to the bedroom and shown the various extra facilities of which there are numerous. The ipod playing on bose speakers was top-noch, The bed and memory foam matress were also exceptional. Upon exploring the rest of the hotel I noticed a reading/relaxation of some type. All I can remember is feeling somewhat patriotic as there was so much green everywhere. It was like the liffey on st. paddys day! Thats taking to the extreme but the interior could be a little less overstated.
We got over ourselves quite quickly and hit the long island ice-teas at the cocktail bar before dining which were expensive but the quality was there on presentation and glassware all the same. Moving onto the restaurant we shared a quail dish to start which was quite good. The fish for main was unfortunately far too salty and seemed as though is was seasoned with wet hands as there was definately large clumps of salt on the skin and not very edible.  Again service very professional.
The Dylan delivers on 5 star standard. The 2 little comments I would make is that a little more relaxation in the interior would have been nice but its a little late for that at this stage so we'll put that to bed immediatly. The second is that there seem to be no reel face floating around to welcome and make a connection. I wouln't expect it from a city center hotel but it was reasonable quiet when I was there and a little involvement from management to personalise it experience would be great. 
All in all I had a great time and would be happy to reccomend to anybody.",5,2011,05,20
208,Good Hotel Overall,"Stayed in the Dylan  one night, easy great check in, fantastic fron desk staff, never sampled the bar or dining areas so can't comment, Valet parking cost 20 euro's which was a bit pricy but saved having to feed the meter for on street parking. 

Room was clean but quite small, bathroom had underfloor heating and a suffocatingly warm at times, but great for stepping out onto after a shower. views were to the front of the hotel and looked out onto a leafy suburban street. 

Overall good hotel, great attentive staff but for me, location was a downside if you are visiting Dublin for the first time as about a 20min + walk into the city centre. lack of unpaid parking if you are travelling by car adds to the cost of an already slightly overpriced room. 

Cafe across the road was worth a visit!",3,2011,05,20
208,"Looks great, but attention to detail pretty Poor","Myself and my company used this hotel recently for a business meeting. Style wise its beautiful and perfectly situated. However what lets it down is the attention to detail of the staff and management.  I attempted to phone the day prior to check what parking was available.. I tried 6 times at various stages during the day and there was no answer from the main reception number, I gave up eventually.   On the day, the room flagged as capicity for 40 was cramed and uncomfortable at 20. there was no water or even glasses on the table and we had to (after several requests) go and find water and glasses and fo what we would expect as basic in a 2 star conference room let alone the dylan. the coffee and tea breaks were equally unsupported by the staff with food on the tables, but plates and utensiles arriving at various intervals of lateness during the short breaks. My thoughts are if a hotel can not support business meetings they just should not accept them and focus on what they do well. the dylan is no doubt a lovley boutique hotel,, but it is by no means a place for a business meeting.",3,2011,05,19
208,Perfect!,"We stayed here for two nights whilst in Ireland, and could not recommend it highly enough. Located about 15 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the centre, the Dylan is definitely in the nicer part of the city. The staff were all so helpful and polite, in particular the Head Receptionist - Madison (who very kindly upgraded our room) and also recommended the Chophouse (a must!). The 'Full Irish' was definitely the best that we had during on our stay throughout Ireland. A great place to stay!",5,2011,05,09
208,style and substance,"Great hotel full of style and great staff who were courteous and helpful with dinner suggestions.Nice size rooms with lots of light.Good nights sleep as hotel is in quiet part of town.Lots of cafes,shops and dining options around the corner.A 20-30 minute walk to downtown-not a problem for us as we enjoyed the walks.Great outdoor seating area where one could enjoy cocktails and snacks.Breakfsat included which they gladly delivered to room at no extra charge.
Would def stay here again.Thanks for a lovely stay in a great town.",5,2011,05,02
208,Perfect little honeymoon.,My partner and i chose the Dylan for our honeymoon because it was 5 star and modern and a reasonable price. The service and was rooms were amazing and the staff treated us like royalty. I will be coming back here in the future and will recommend it to everyone. Best place to go if you want to go to dublin but dont want to stay in the city itself quiet and pleasant.,5,2011,05,01
208,Outstanding service and decor,"This was the very best place we stayed on our 4 week UK and Ireland holiday. It was quiet, the service was above and beyond. The rooms were amazing and so comfortable. Parking was no problem with concierge service provided. Not as close to the city centre as I might have hoped but then it would not have been so serene so it all balances out in the end.",5,2011,04,25
208,Nice but extremely overpriced!,Stayed here with my wife for a week-end break. Was going to have breakfast but the price was ridiculus so excellent cafe across the road at one third of price. The rooms are very nice and there is a decent ambiance about the place but the charges ie 30-40 Euros for parking etc annoyed me.Overall its good but not worth the money by a long way. Attracts a seemingly well heeled but very posey crowd.,3,2011,04,25
208,Without question the best hotel in Dublin,"What a gem of a hotel. I stay a couple of times a year with my husband and it never fails to impress me. From the incredible decour, amazing food and service to the yummy cocktails, it is hard to see how they can improve. I love it!",5,2011,04,20
208,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed here for three nights for my other half's 40th birthday. I had researched Dublin and as we like the smaller hotels i felt this would be right up our street.

I was not wrong. It has an unsual decor, a bit Malmaison I guess which we really liked, the staff were incredibly helpful, they could not do too much for you and were always chatting and helping us with out arrangements.

The bar downstairs is a great little place, full with locals during the night and a good place to have a coctail

The room was spacious with a great bed, all the facilities you need and a good bathroom.

The location is very good, with bars and restaurants around the corner, you can walk into town or it is a short taxi ride.

In short I was very very happy and I would recommend this hotel 100%",5,2011,04,09
208,Gem of a hotel,"The Dylan is a real find. 
Located off Baggot Street & not far from Ballsbridge it's a boutique hotel with friendly staff and great food. Great atmosphere at the weekend and quiet enough for work meeting & lunch during week. 
Highly recommended.",5,2011,04,04
208,Wish I could copy the d√©cor for my home!,"We went to Dublin for a three day visit to coincide with St. Patrick's Day. Upon checking in at the Dylan, we were notified that we would receive a complimentary upgrade and ended up in a very spacious and quiet room.

The hotel was a little ways out of the centre of the city, but we found Dublin to be quite small and very walkable. St. Stephen's Green was only about a 15 minute walk, and Trinity College Dublin/Temple Bar, about 10 minutes beyond that. We had uncharacteristically sunny weather and walked everywhere we went. We started each day off with yummy Irish breakfast in the sun-filled restaurant, and ended each afternoon/evening with a cocktail and nibbles in the funky hotel lounge. All of the food was very yummy. 

The thing that made the biggest impression on me however was the d√©cor. If you are a design nut, you'll enjoy the eye-candy of this hotel. It is whimsical, modern and elegant all at once. If you aren't a design nut, you'll be equally impressed by the good service.",5,2011,03,30
208,Very friendly helpful staff,"I stayed here for two nights with my husband, the overall experience was great this was due to the very helpful and friendly staff who seemed to effortlessly help and who were willing to please.
The hotel decor was tasteful  the rooms were clean but could do with a freshen up of paint on the walls and if they provided tea/coffee making facilities in the room it would be a bonus.
The food in the restaurant was tasty and well presented.",5,2011,03,27
208,"Great hotel, let down by noise at night","My husband and I have now stayed here twice and had a really enjoyable stay both times.  The service from all staff has been excellent, even down to the concierge giving my husband directions to a pub over the phone when he decided he wanted to watch the rubgy while shopping in the centre of Dublin,

Yes, the hotel is a little out of the centre but it's easily walked in 15 minutes.  The front desk ordered taxis for us if we wanted to eat out elsewhere in the evenings.  Sitting in the bar or the library with a drink was another pleasant way to spend an hour.

The only thing that let the hotel down was noise at night.  On our first stay (about 3 years ago), we had a room with a window over the outdoor area beside the bar.  The noise from this woke us at night (I was pregnant then and needed my sleep).  On this stay, my husband had to phone reception in the early hours of the morning to ask them to break up the party going on in the room next door (admittedly the singing was in tune).

Yes, it's expensive.  What city hotel isn't. Just avoid the extras that all hotels charge ridiculous amounts for

I would definitely go back again.",4,2011,02,28
208,ok- nice hotel,"stayed here recently on a business trip to Dublin  ckeck in was ok ,room  clean and  nice love the dylan music the food in the restaurant was average service could be better overall this hotel was ok an I would return again",3,2011,02,25
208,"Nice funky boutique hotel, but quite a bit out of town","We stayed in the Dylan Hotel for a long weekend. The hotel itself is quite funky, but the rooms are relatively small and less exciting than the rest of the hotel. Minor disadvantage is that the hotel is not very centrally located and a 15 to 20 minutes walk to the city centre. We took one of the packages which included a dinner, but that is not really worth it, you are better off just booking the restaurant separately as it works out a lot cheaper.",4,2011,02,25
208,Hugely Disappointed,"My husband and I were looking forward to staying at Dylan as a post-Christmas treat. 
I was hoping it would be fun and trendy and similar to the Hotel Du Vin chain where we have stayed in the UK. 

Sadly, we were extremely disappointed by our stay. Upon arriving at Dylan we received a rather cold and officious 'welcome'. No one offered to help us with our luggage and the man on the reception desk seemed more concerned about obtaining our credit card details than providing good customer service. 

Having entered Room No. 105, a ""Style Room"", which was tastefully furnished, I noticed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities and no still or sparkling water, despite the website assuring us of their presence. As we were very cold and eager for a cup of tea before setting off to explore Dublin, my husband popped down to reception to request some tea making facilities and was told this was no problem. 

However, we were then forced to wait for what seemed like an eternity before a girl arrived with a kettle ‚Äì but no cups, tea bags, milk etc. She informed us she would retrieve the same. A further 15-20 minutes or so later, we had still not received any tea, milk or cups and were beginning to despair. I went down to reception and was told the tea etc. was on its way. Finally, the tea bags, cups and milk arrived, but when I went to pour the milk, it was solid and had clearly been ""off"" for a considerable period of time. My husband took the milk down to reception to complain and was provided with some more milk and an apology. 

We were very disappointed at this start to our mini break and throughout the weekend we were continually dissatisfied with the service provided to us. The staff were neither friendly nor courteous. 

We also found the hotel to be too far out of Dublin centre - at least in the winter. It is probably a much more pleasant walk in the spring/summer. If we returned to Dublin, we would definitely stay in the centre of town. 

When we arrived home, I realised I had left my nightdress in the hotel room. Some days later I telephoned to ask if it had been located and when I received confirmation that it was there, I was told that the assistant would have to check with someone more senior if I would be charged postage for the return of this (small,  light size 8 silk nightdress). Whilst I appreciate it was my mistake for leaving the nightdress, I was flabbergasted by the implication that I may be charged a few pounds of postage for such an item by a hugely expensive  5* hotel which prides itself on ""exceeding customer expectations"".

To be fair, I wrote a letter of complaint and received a swift telephone call of apology from the manager who said she would investigate... 

It seems that our experience was highly unusual given the majority of the reviews on here, so perhaps we were just unlucky that weekend. I would not recommend staying at Dylan.  

On a positive note, we enjoyed Dublin's sights and ate at some lovely restaurants (the Avoca Cafe, The Blackboard Bistro, the Cafe at the Chester Beatty Library) and the people outside the hotel were warm and friendly and welcoming.",2,2011,02,16
208,I have been a Four Season client for some years,"I have just had 3 days at the Dylan Hotel, I normally travel and stay at the Four Seasons/Wesbury.
The GM at the Dylan convince me to try it out and see what I thought, experience excellent staff are warm and helpful, food excellent, beds and pillows excellent.

To sum up my experience I really enjoyed myself, the walk into town is about 10-15mins which I found good excercise after there  fantastic breakfast .

Well done to all the staff who seem to work well as a team, you have got my business from now on. A Mains",5,2011,02,15
208,TOP HOTEL,I took my staff to the The Dylan from Manchester for our annula Christmas party.  Food was superb - rooms to die for - staff are extra friendly.  Everything from start to finish was fantastic.  The Dylan is around a 10 minute walk to the shops 15 minutes to Temple Bar area - however the concerige gave us some local bars to try which were fantastic.....Great place to stay for couples - friends - groups.  The bar is good too........,5,2011,02,08
208,Perfect weekend!,"We had a wonderful weekend at Dylan. Our flight was cancelled to Dublin at the last minute and we arrived much later than expected. On arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was extremely comfortable and spacious. We also had a late check out on Sunday which was great as we had an evening flight. Staff were all polite and friendly and the reception staff in particular were very helpful. Breakfast was very tasty and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Location is good, about 20 mins walk from the centre, but we we enjoyed seeing a bit more of the city. We would definitely go back.",5,2011,01,31
208,"If you are used to staying to top hotels, don't stay here","From the photos on the website, I was very excited about taking my boyfriend here for his 31st birthday. I thought for once that we would stray away from the big 'quality' hotels. However, this was a big error and the overall stay was disappointing. The room was ok (very small) but the bathroom resembled something more like a travel lodge. It had a cool sink, but the rest of it was very functional with functional looking pvc windows throughout. There was a smell of naf air freshener combined with tobacco in the room at all times. The whole hotel was roasting hot (tshirt/vest only) but the staff did not seem to agree with this. The bar seems to be a Saturday night hot spot for Dubliners, although many of the girls looked like prostitutes and the throbbing music could be heard from our room until 1am. We went and ate at the Merrion hotel on the Saturday night and we wished that we were staying there, just had more tasteful style and class. Now that we are home, I have just received a bill for 4.95 (about ¬£3.80) because they forgot to check this mini bar before we left-seems very very petty and as it was their error, I am shocked that a '5*' hotel has done this. If you are used to real 5*, then you will soon realise that this is not in the same league. Not boutique, just all a bit naf and not cheap either!",3,2011,01,28
208,Style (and price) Over Substance,"Just back from a weekend at the Dylan to celebrate a friend's significant birthday.  It's very modern and very stylish, though so much so that I expect it to look very dated in a couple of years.

I think reviewers' opinions are entirely determined by their room allocation.  Our friend's had a nice, large room with chaise longue, windows with a view and a large, comfy bed.
Our room was about half the size, had no view and a bed smaller than the one we have at home, despite being the same class.  However, neither room had a bath, instead we both had a large shower.  I don't mind this but my wife does like a hot soak before we go out, and why not ?

The bar was also very stylish and I suspect the whole place will need redecorating in a year or two in order to avoid looking stale.  The location is good and, if I can afford it, I would stay there again, I'd just be a bit more demanding about the room.

Finally, who pays 30Euro for breakfast when you can cross the road to a rather nice, modern cafe and eat just as well for half the money ?  The pizza restaurant around the corner is rather good too.",4,2011,01,24
208,Perfect spot for a weekend with friends!,"Two friends and I stayed at the Dylan for a weekend in August. Our room was spacious (they even set up an extra bed for us); it was super quiet; the bed was very comfortable. The hotel is very trendy and hip. That said, the staff was very helpful and very friendly. We really enjoyed our weekend.",4,2011,01,17
208,Excellent in almost every way,"As the title says, excellent in almost every way - rooms, service, food and value (although we were travelling on a Mr and Mrs Smith / Times 2 for 1 deal, which helped with the value).  A little far from Dublin's night-life, but quiet as a result.  Very expensive breakfasts, but great, so worth trying at least once during your stay.",5,2011,01,11
208,Style over Substance....,"The hotel is all about style, and has a great reputation - nearly everyone who asked where we stayed was impressed to hear it was the Dylan. Unfortunately this is at the expense of substance. 

They were offering great deals in December against their standard rate and so a colleague and I stayed for 4 and 3 nights respectively. The hotel makes a lot of its boutique nature and its true that its small, nicely decorated and they serve an good, though extremely expensive (if not in your rate) breakfast. The staff were friendly and helpful eastern Europeans for the most part.  There is a great bistro opposite which we ate at, called the Express - strongly recommended. 

The real problem, and this is fundamental in any hotel is that the beds, known as ""Seventh Heaven"" and touted in the in room literature as ""the best nights sleep you will ever have"", are just way too soft and I found them very uncomfortable. 

Whilst I realize this is a subjective view, my colleague and I both independently noticed this and suffered poor and un-restful sleep for it.  My room, on the front of the hotel (313) was also much smaller than hers on the back, and a little noisy / lit from the outside. I would also probably avoid any rooms near the lifts which could be noisy and noise from the corridors was clearly audible in my room. 

So stylish yes, and internet was included, but unfortunately, its a no return because a good nights sleep is more important than anything, and the award for the most uncomfortable hotel bed of 2010, and the most noise intrusion from public areas goes to the Dylan, Dublin.",3,2010,12,20
208,one of the best Boutique hotel i've stayed at,"The Dylan has this wonderful and rare combination of being very stylish, urban, and sophisticated yet also personal, intimate and warm. Having arrived to Dublin during the heavy snow we felt like ""orphans of the storm"" seating at the friendly Bar, restaurant and the fantastic  signature suite. Couldn't thank them enough for  the warm welcome after driving for more than 7 hours to Dublin (the heavy snow mentioned above..)  their manor simply suggested  ""your troubles are over and we will take care of everything for you"". There are always minor faults i.e. we enjoyed the restaurant's atmosphere and friendly stuff more than the food itself but it's all negligible. The Dylan's success in creating this mixture of stylish yet personal service & atmosphere makes it one of the best urban hotels that we've stayed at.",5,2010,12,11
208,What a fabulous hotel!,"Stayed here for a few nights at the beginning on December. What a beautifully decorated hotel, room was gorgeous, staff were very attentive and friendly, didn't try the food but had a few drinks in the bar after a night on the tiles (I hate when my nights are ending ha!) no complaints at all. had the breakfast in the morning, again lovely staff, breakfast was very tasty. Next time I'm in Dublin, this is where I am staying!",5,2010,12,09
208,The Best !,"Everything about the Dylan was perfect. The room, service, food, location all excellent",5,2010,11,16
208,"stylish, friendly and central","stayed for one night, including dinner. there was no hot water that evening so endured a cold shower. the room cost was reduced by 20% which was appreciated. the hotel staff are friendly, courtious and helpful. service at dinner was attentive, although the food was disappointing. stayed in one of the larger rooms which was stylish, clean and had the most comfortable hotel mattress i've ever slept on! the hotel is central, about 15 minutes walk to the city centre. despite the problem with the water i enjoyed my stay there.",5,2010,11,14
208,Amazing total luxury !,"Myself and my husband are just back from our annual winter break. We decided to treat ourselves to a luxury treat and picked the Dylan boutique Hotel. it did not let us down the decor of the hotel and rooms was so different so romantic and  chic amazing ! The rooms were nice and spacious with a luxury feel. It was my birthday and on our arrival rose petals were scattered on the bed in a love heart shape such a beautiful touch. The breakfast was fantastic and had a great choice from hot to cold. The bar atmosphere was really relaxing and the staff were so friendly and attentive. There is also bar food served and you have  a choice to dine in the resturant, but we never got that far because the bar food was great. Last but not least the front of house staff were amazing, friendly, and so helpful. Location great for walking distance to shops bars and resturants. Overall i have to say staying at the Dylan was a real treat one we will never forget, but one we will definitely be returning to.",5,2010,11,09
208,Fabulous!,"Stylish with real quality to back it up. Rates not cheap in travelling alone,  but nice treat. Gorgeous decor and room, excellent toiletries. Reasonably priced food and drink. Good service, short walk to town.  Thought breakfast choices were a bit sparse in comparison to general decadence but really this is a very minor issue. Would defintely stay again when in this area of Dublin.",5,2010,10,14
208,Wonderful hotel with fantastic staff,"Just back from another weekend in Dublin, this time celebrating a special birthday and stayed at the Dylan Hotel. We had a meal for 18 people on the Saturday night and the food was wonderful, service perfect and everyone enjoyed it. Half our group ordered Irish beef and it was all cooked for them as each requested. Brilliant chef.",5,2010,10,11
208,Wonderful stay at the Dylan,"My wife and I travelled to Ireland with a small group of friends. We had a wonderful stay at the Dylan. The hotel is stylish, clean and quiet. The service is excellent; we were especially helped by Madison at the reception desk. but everone went out of their wat to assit. 
The food was excelllent, especially the irish breakfast. 
The Dylan is in an affluent, quiet nieghborhood. This was perfect for us but might not be for someone who wants to be in the middle of the action
For us, we loved it!",5,2010,10,09
208,Highly recommended,"Just had three nights at the Dylan as part of a rather exhausting long overseas trip. Starting off at the Grand Hyatt in Hong Kng probably wasn't a great idea due to the standard it set. I certainly wasn't in the best of moods after a rather miserable stay at the Hyatt in Toronto and the toffee-nosed attitude of the reception staff at the Park Lane Hilton in London.

Well, the Dylan has proven to be a breath of fresh air. Everything from the attitude of the staff to quality of the rooms has been first rate. It's the little things that make such a difference in a hotel and it starts and finishes with the attitude of the staff.

We booked a meeting room and they went out of their way to make sure it was in line with what we needed. There was even the very nice touch of the manager asking us if everything had met our needs late on the our last night when we were having a drink outside and for us to find that the drink was complimentary.

That's not to say everything is perfect. I think tea and coffee facilities in the rooms would be nice as would having an iron and board in each room instead of having to request it from housekeeping but this is really picking bones.

I noted the comment about the hot water system. It just takes a bit of patience to work out the system. Life was a lot easier when hotels simply had more conventional systems rather than the new-fangled ones we are seeing everywhere today.

I also did not find the rooms tiny at all. I had a spacious room right at the end of the corridor. 

Overall, the hotel just had a really nice feel to it. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin in future.",5,2010,10,09
208,Surpised at hotel - very very good at reasonable cost,"Welcomed into this hotel with open arms. Everything was ready for my arrival even though they didn't know what time I would. Quickly checked in and into suite for the night. On entry, iPod playing in room, massive bed, great bathroom (with TV in wall for ladies in the bath!). Called reception soon after checking in as I needed a shirt ironed. Within minutes, it was whisked away, ironed and brought back for me....great service.

I didn't eat in Restaurant as had already eaten but menu looked great. Location good, Tesco round the corner, Pizza Express (Milano in Ireland) and a few bars.

Great wifi connection in hotel - able to easily surf / use FaceTime etc.

Had a courtesy wake up call I had arranged, checked out the following morning very quickly, taxi waiting for me. Very smooth and slick.

Highly recommended from me",5,2010,10,01
208,Loved It,"Stayed at the Dylan on dinner and breakfast special on Saturday night as a Birthday treat for my partner. Gorgeous hotel tucked away in lovely quiet location.  Service from staff on arrival was great. Room not huge but very comfortable and funky as is the whole decor of this hotel.  Meal in restaurant was fantastic.  Bar was buzzing, though prices not for the faint hearted!  All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for a special occasion.",5,2010,09,29
208,Dublin Hideaway,"Stayed here with my wife for an overnight and dinner. Really great experience. Food in restaurant was excellent. V. Funky decor.  The cocktails in the bar after were amazing and the staff very hospitable.  We loved the bedroom and the bed v. comfy.  We missed breakfast next morning as we had a lie on, but the brunch across the road in Cafe Expresso Bar was memorable.  Well worth a visit.",4,2010,08,23
208,Another Outstanding Visit To The Dylan.,"Another brilliant stay at this outstanding hotel. Came over on a flight that was late - we had gig tickets - but this was no problem. We were offered an early dinner and then the staff on reception booked us a taxi to take us to the gig. As usual, dinner was excellent and the staff attentive. I can't quite believe people find fault with this hotel; it offers excellent value for money. Yes it is expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for. The fact that the bar and restaurant are always full speaks volumes. We will difinitely be going back.",5,2010,08,20
208,Tiny Rooms and Ridiculous location for a supposed 5*!,"The location of this hotel is hardly 5* luxury...it is behind the main thoroughfare of busy Baggot street and is located beside rented properties, where upon arrival we had to disembark from our car to move a wheelie bin from our path as we approached the hotel (this is not 5* living despite us paying 5* prices).
The reception staff were friendly however when we checked into our 'luxury' rooms I was shocked and dismayed as to how small the rooms and beds were...very disappointing as for the room rate we paid I expected a lot more space! 
The standard of cleanliness of the room upon arrival was quite good however the following night after the room had supposedly been cleaned the bin in the bathroom had not been emptied and there was hair in the bathtub. Obviously the accommodation staff are only concerned with properly cleaning departure rooms..not acceptable! 
The food in the restaurant was mediocre and we waited quite a long time for our courses. 
Overall I felt I was ripped off and would never recommend this hotel as a 5* luxury breakaway.",3,2010,08,19
208,Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In,"I've traveled quite a bit (although I don't typically fork out for 5 star hotels) - and the Dylan in Dublin is hands down the best hotel I've ever stayed in. They were offering a special for 3 nights for the price of two, and the reservations manager accommodated us and let me, my sister and my mother all stay in one room together by adding a small bed (which is uncommon in Europe.) Thus, we were able to stay there more cheaply than paying for two rooms for three nights at a mediocre hotel - so we were already happy with them before we arrived.

The reception/concierge staff is what truly made this visit exceptional. They greeted us by name when we *first* arrived (how they knew it was us, I have no idea.) When we arrived in our room they had provided a delicious birthday cake in honor of my mom's birthday, in addition to a selection of water (plain or fizzy) and truffles (all free.) 

There are only 40 or so rooms total in this boutique hotel, and it shows in the service. There was never a wait to speak to someone. The receptionist/concierge did everything  (not just check in) - they called us taxis, offered maps, gave wonderful recommendations for places to visit, helped us find a bar that had been recommended to us, etc. The breakfast that was included with our room was amazing - an incredible selection of not only buffet style food (pastries, fruit, yogurt, etc.) but also an entire menu of hot items - all included in the price. On the second morning, the server *remembered* what I had ordered the day before and asked if I had enjoyed it and wanted it again, or wanted to try something else. In addition, one evening we came home late and didn't realize that the restaurants around the hotel would close early. When we arrived, the concierge asked how our evening went, and I bemoaned the fact that we hadn't eaten in time. He called the kitchen and they stayed open for another 20 minutes just to serve us. The employees were truly, truly exceptional and they should all be given tremendous raises (and no, I'm not related to any of them.)

The hotel decor is fantastic - very unique and beautiful; the concierge told us that it was all made by hand for the hotel. This is not your standard Danish Modern (ie: Ikea inspired) decor found at most upscale hotels; for example, the chair next to the welcoming desk looks like a cross between a ladies corset and Natalie Portman's hair in Star Wars (just trust me.) While it sounds wacky, it was actually incredibly sumptuous and tasteful. Throughout the hotel there are gems like that - and every chair/couch I sat in (and I tried all the ones I came across) were comfortable and cozy. 

I simply cannot say enough about this hotel - I haven't even talked about the exquisitely comfortable beds, large bathtub (separate from the shower), free internet access, the gorgeous library/living room area where you can read and relax or watch the rugby game... If I were a rich woman, I would travel back to Dublin regularly just to stay at this hotel.",5,2010,08,09
208,Very good but sorry cant say its 5*,"Just back from 2 nights at the Dylan and don't want to complain but have to say that its just not 5 star its quite a good 4* and the reason that I am not totally pissed off  is that we paid 4* prices. so here goes with the bits that need a bit of work- finding the place is hard as directions on the website are not great and the location is not logged on google earth ect so satnav wont pick it up. 
check in perfect and this has to be the most outstanding feature of the hotel - excellent welcome and concierge outstanding. 
Room - really funny as very lavish in the d√©cor but it is tiny!!  Room servicing is pretty poor we left the hotel before 8am and come back about 2:30 and room hadn't be serviced girl came around about 3ish think the idea was to do the servicing and the evening turn-down at once, so one of the points that let down the 5 star status - big-time. 
Bar and food - Service very friendly but not very competent and soo slow - we had barfood and was very good and reasonably priced for a '5*' property. 
overall for the two evenings in the bar not packed but not enough experienced staff to sell drink- they must loose out a lot on sales due to this fact. 
Breakfast and service - the worst aspect of the hotel - head waiter is quite polite but not really an effective manger of his area. day one was fine we were in a rush out and got away in great time. day two ordered of menu 'light aerated pancakes'  got two LUMPS of stodge - I didn't complain just didn't eat them and the waitress asked if i didn't like them and i just said no, leaving it at that or so I thought, i then overheard the waitress saying to the head waiter and when my husband left the table the guy came over and what started out as a very begrudging 'sorry' turned into me getting a very heavy lecture in pancakes- with the customers at the next table feeling as uncomfortable as I did. Jist of conversation was - they were crepes and the chefs choice of type and quite acceptable across the world and not the 'british' type pancakes made with yeast???? I replied that on the menu I ordered the 'light aerated pancakes' of which I was served the heaviest lumps of doughy stuff that physically couldn't be eat, i did ask if he has seen them and he eventually said no. this guy made a presumption that I didn't know  what a pancake was, and i didn't tell him that I have  taught pastry to degree status for the past 25+ years  and worked  in four 5 star hotels during my career and spend most of time now advising standards and menu design. The other point I didn't like about this guy was that he addressed his staff in a very unprofessional manner in front of customers - he gave a young guy a 'good' telling off about were he should fold napkins and that the young guy should remember he will get into 'trouble' if he didn't do as he was told!  This and the room service would prevent me from recommending this hotel to friend unless they were getting a price for 4* accommodation during horse show weekend. I didn't say anything at checkout because the staff were soo good that I didn't feel they should have the hassle. will forward a recipe for pancakes though!! back to the 4 Seasons for us and I think a quick trip to Ten Square or the Merchant Hotel in Belfast for the food, beverage and accommodation staff at the Dylan me thinks - but then again the maybe just as far as Meath to their sister hotel the Dunboyne.",4,2010,08,08
208,Great for city break,"Fantastic and stylish hotel, perfect for down time and romantic getaways.  Great staff, quality bar, nice mix of guests and decent restaurant.  Minor niggles:
1) Air conditioning in the room didn't seem to do anything - opening a window solved the problem!!
2) Mini-bar prices! (can never understand why expensive hotels think that this is acceptable)
3) Location not the best for easy access to the city centre (15-20 min walk)
Other than that high recommended as a treat...",4,2010,08,02
208,its amazing!!,"we have just returned from a long weekend at the Dylan Hotel, its about a ten minute walk from Grafton street, however it has some good bars around it.
The interior is very stylish and well kept. the staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. I would recommend this hotel to couples looking to stay in a fabulous hotel as it has a nice buzz about it in the eveings in the bar area. the food in the restaurant is good quality and good value for money.
i will definately be returning to the Dylan. 

Top tip for a trip to Dublin, you can buy a three day travel card which gets you from the airport, on and off all the green sightseeing buses and all the local buses. local bus number is 10 or 10a from grafton street where you will be dropped off by the airlink bus. all for 26 euros each. we just had to pay to get back to the airport via the bus link for 6 euros each. well worth it.",5,2010,08,01
208,"Stylish, friendly and fantastic service","Just returned from a weekend break in the Dylan.  Had a fabulous time and would thoroughly recommend for a fantastic break in luxury.  Not cheap, but high quality, so worth every penny.
It is a little remote from the centre, but no more than a short walk away (10 minutes).  Its enough to mean you can enjoy the energy and atmosphere of Dublin, but retire to a peaceful, quiet setting.  
Staff are friendly and very attentive.  Despite arriving close to midnight, and walking through the wrong door into a busy bar area, the bar staff spotted us and came straight to us to help us and point us in the right direction.",5,2010,07,26
208,Fabulous hotel!!,"My fiance booked this hotel as a surprise and to propose to me!! I thought the hotel was gorgeous I loved the decor even just in the reception! My fiance had arranged with the hotel to hire the library to propose to me and he says their communication and arrangements in the planning process were excellent! As well as allowing him to keep it secret for me, they were very discreet! 

The room we stayed in was huge and I was impressed with all the little touches such as ipod and station in room, heated tiles in bathroom, balcony and the comfort of the fantastic bed! I also loved that the staff put a bottle of water and chocolate near your bed with a lit candle at night! Much needed in the morning if you have a hangover!!! 

The breakfast had everything you could want and the cocktails in the bar were fab! I love Dublin and had been several times but thanks to the Dylan they made my engagement an even more special time! Will definitely go back!",5,2010,07,16
208,"Very good, but still not perfect","The first room had noise from outside air confitioning, but then I changed rooms and the second one was quiet.
Hot breakfast is a la carte and they serve well-sized portions. Cold breakfast is buffet, good, but every next day the variety was smaller.
Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Shower head is fixed on the ceiling and is not adjustable in height. Also, sometimes there were water mixing failures in the tap.
Design is very extravagant.
Location is somewhat peripheral (you need a bus to the city center).",4,2010,07,14
208,Very good but one or two flaws,"Stayed on dinner and breakfast special on Saturday night. Birthday treat for my wife, without the kids, bliss. Service from staff on arrival was great. Room not huge but very comfortable with nice extra touches.  Dinner was only Ok. Had the slow cooked lamb which could have been a bit more tender and a little more moist. Spuds were undercooked and burnt!? A little extra sauce helped. Couple next to us seeemde to have the same problem and a gravy boat and creamed spuds arrived half way through their meal. My wifes cod was lacking in taste.

Bar is funky and buzzy. Cocktail prices not for the faint hearted.

Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment. Arrived down at 11am on the dot to find a barrier half over the entrancetothe restaurant and to be told that cooked breakfast no longer available, only buffet. Slightly miffed but became more so when 20 minutes later hot breakfasts were still being served to other guests who obviously arrived 30 seconds before we did. Good thing Im not Michael Douglas. 
Mentioned this on checking out. Were told manager would ring later that afternoon. Still waiting 3 days later.
All in all would recommend to others but closer to 4 than 5 star experience, maybe 4.5.",4,2010,07,06
208,not quite worth 5 stars!!,"me and my husband have just come back from a 3 night stay today and had to write a few things.... huge problems with our check-in
                        problems with the tvs
                        problem with banging gates
                        problems with poor food
                        problems with scoulding water out of both taps.....
                        no tea or coffee in room
I am very sad to say, but a list of problems!! 
both me and my husband work hard and like to enjoy a little lux when away. It started with check-in decline my card! even though my bank saying i have the money and there should be no problem using my card while away.. i am then told that the reason there were problems was because they were also trying to take and extra 300 euros for our stay ontop of the 520 euros for our room!!! when asked reception informs us this a safety deposit which will be returned on check-out!!! since when is this standard practice!!!! I would understand if we were a rockband!!! we were at no time informed of theese extra charges otherwise i would of made sure i moved more funds, this left me feeling very upset.
No movie channel as it didnt work at all, we reported this but was not resolved by check out. on the plus side we were offered another room to watch a movie in but this was on our last night and we had a very early start so didnt want to watch one then!!
ROOM 204- VERY noisy banging gate to the next door block of flats. kept us awake half our first night!!  reception were very good and moved us to another room. xxx
Food in the resturant was not too bad, staff were great though as was staff in the bar.
I too had a few issues with the hot water. brushing my teeth in very warm water was not a pleasent experiance.
We have stayed in a fair few 4 and 5 star hotels across the globe and have NEVER not had tea and coffee in our room.  We stayed at the crowne plaza at dublin airport for our 1st night as we had a late flight in. this a 4 star and even they had a kettle.
at the dylan tea,coffee cost 6 euro per person! in room and 4.25 euro at the bar.

All in all i would of liked to say our stay was wonderfull, that we come home well rested and it was worth the 1300+euros we spent over a weekend, but i just cant! 
In whole the staff were wonderfull, the hotel interior was funky, but THE DYLAN let them down. 
We are so sad that our stay was not what we expected and feel cheated out of what was ment to be a luxuary break away from the stresses of kids and work.

208,Luxurious stay walking distance to city centre,"We stayed 1 night in this excellent hotel; we love Dublin and have been going there regularly for 20+ years but this is by far the best Dublin hotel we've stayed in.

The staff were friendly and helpful (especially on Reception).  Rooms are a decent size for a city hotel and well furnished, with little extras like an ipod and luxury toiletries supplied.  

Surrounding area is a leafy part of south Dublin but a short walk to the bars on Baggot Street and then into Stephen's Green / Grafton Street.  Car parking is expensive but secure.  

We had the breakast and dinner deal and it was excellent service, quality of food and overall value.  The bar and dining areas are pleasant to sit in and there is a real buzz about the hotel (we stayed Fri-Sat).  The overall vibe is cool but comfortable - a difficult combination to pull off, but they did it well.

The only down side (and it wasn't major, but seeing s someone else mentioned it here) was that when we finished dinner / breakfast and just wanted to sit over a coffee, no one lifted the plates away.  So I dropped a point for service there.

However extra points for attitude of staff; when we said we'd forgotten to let them know we were a member of their particular hotel loyalty club they provided us with free cocktails (which are excellent) on our last day - perfect end to a great stay.

We will be back at the Dylan.",5,2010,07,06
208,Lovely 5 star hotel.,"Brilliant welcome.  Very trendy boutique hotel.  Luxurious rooms, Lovely food, lovely courtyard to sit in with extensive wine and cocktail list.  Staff very attentive.  A great 5 star stay *****************
Only downside 20 euros to park car for day.  But would not stop us going again.  Great location to visit grafton street and temple bar area.",5,2010,06,29
208,Still delivering such perfection,"This was our 2nd trip to the Dylan as we stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon.  Given our flights were changed then, we didn't get to spend as much time in the hotel as we had hoped.

We returned this past weekend for my wife's 30th birthday and it's still as good as our first impressions and I'm glad I didn't risk staying anywhere else.

From the free upgrade to a suite, to the little touches and friendly staff, this hotel really does have it all.

If I was to find anything to grumble about it would be the bathroom.  The room was spuerb in every way - spacious, comfortable and luxurious.  But the bathroom was extremely average.  The door was in an awkward place - even if it had opened into the suite rather than the bathroom this would've helped enormously.

But it really is such a small gripe compared to everything else this hotel has to offer, so if you can afford it, don't bother going anywhere else in Dublin for 5 star service...!",5,2010,06,28
208,"5 Star Room, 5 Star Food & 5 Star Service!!","I just want to say big big thank you to all the staff for a lovely stay in the Dylan. 
The Dylan exceeded my expectations. 
It was a gorgeous room so thank for the upgrade, really loved it. 
The same person checked us in and out and he was really good‚Ä¶tall young guy, forget his name. 
He parked my car so that I would not have to get up early‚Ä¶so nice. 
The beds are so amazing and everything in the room was perfect, powerful shower, sockets for hairdryer near mirror, big fluffy towels, lovely products...5 Star all the way!
Breakfast was gorgeous, staff so friendly and called by name, which is always nice‚Ä¶.especially the crockery‚Ä¶love Villeroy & Boch!
Sat outside after breakfast before heading off and I could have stayed there all day. 
Had a look at your menus and it is really fantastic value.  Early bird is fantastic value with an extremely varied menu.

It was such a treat  I have to say that I have a new favourite getaway!
Location is fantastic, so near the centre but perfectly hidden fro too much hustle and bustle.  Perfect for romantic break or a girls weekend
My husband felt exactly the same and thinks that your cocktails are second to none. 
The staff are so personal and there really is a lovely atmosphere.
I will honestly be recommending the Dylan. 

WE WILL BE BACK VERY SOON!",5,2010,06,24
208,fantastic...but a little far from everything...,"we just left  the hotel just two days ago after a 3 night stay, but let me say the following..we arrived on wed morning at 630 am after a 6 hr flight from ny...they told us check in was at 11am but feel free to relax in the lounge and enjoy  the complimentary continental breakfast which included top quality prosciutto, cheeses, fruit, breads and jams, croissants in addition to some of the freshest juices ive ever tasted...we were exhausted as it was a 5 hour time difference and after a half hour the manager told us theat a room had opened and would be avaiable at 800..we were thrilled..we arrived to a music by ipod playing room, that was clean and a very decent size...we hit the bed in a bout 5 seconds and it was heaven...most comfortable bed i can remember...as for bathroom, after a 5 hr rest..i walked in to a heated floor...now i must tell you this was a fantastic touch...especially in the cool mornings...overall staff was friendly, courteous, food was delicious as we had one night of room service...saturday night after drinking in town we returned to find a very crowded and charming lounge, inside and out, not wall to wall people but enough to realize it was a popular spot for young and older...i cannot recommend this hotel enough, unless that is u wish to be closer to the center of the city..but other than thats its a nice walk to and from as we did this twice...ty dylan for making our first 3 days in ireland memorable...",4,2010,06,21
208,Very Hot or Scalding?,"We have just returned from a one nights stay in the Dylan. We arrived on a Sunday evening and we were able to avail of free parking outside the hotel on the public street or pay ‚Ç¨20 per night in the hotel car park. We chose the street. On weekdays you have to pay for street parking. This commences at 8 a.m. and costs ‚Ç¨2.90 per hour.
Reception were helpful and were were given a room on the second floor overlooking the street. The room was small but adequate. There was a flatscreen T.V, iPod, dressing gowns, good air conditioning but no tea or coffee making facilities which was disappointing. We were disappointed to find that we had no bath but a double shower. The area around the sink had no place to leave any toiletries, other than a toothbrush, so we ended up leaving them in the room.
Before heading up the town we decided to freshen up but discovered that we could only get very hot or scalding water from both the hot and cold taps! There was no cold water whatsoever. It was impossible to shower or even wash your hands and downright dangerous with very hot water shooting from the side jets. When leaving the hotel I pointed this out to the staff at reception who said that they had never encountered this problem before. Well that is not the case!  If you read the review dated the 11/12/2009 from juliejulei on this forum you will see that she had the same problem and also brought it to the attention of management. I think it is time that the Dylan does something about this problem before somebody scalds themselves.
Breakfast at the hotel was average. The fruit bowl was rather dry as was the hot breakfast. Service could have been better. We ended up clearing away our used dishes/plates ourselves even though the restaurant was very quiet. We were not offered top ups of tea/coffee etc.
The Dylan Hotel is a nice hotel. A lot of the furniture is designer/arty but not comfortable to sit on. The plates/cutlery in the restaurant is arty and fussy with petal shaped plates and cups. Great if you like this type of stuff.
Prices in the bar are expensive. Cocktails between ‚Ç¨12 and ‚Ç¨19.  Try Searsons pub around the corner.
You get a complimentary newspaper, bottle of water and piece of chocolate as a guest.
I have mixed thoughts on this hotel.",3,2010,06,14
208,Love this funky hotel!,"From the moment we stepped inside this hotel I knew I was going to love it.  We travel a lot and to experience something a bit quirky and different is always a thrill.  The hotel staff on the front desk were great and very welcoming.  We were travelling at the time of airport closures due to the volcanoe and they kept us constantly up to date with this.  All the room are different - from the Ipod dock with music playing to greet us to the cool bose phone.  The toiletries‚Äô in the small but perfectly fine bathroom were lovely and such a great size.  Brought them home to enjoy!
The bar was awesome, I couldn't take enough photos of the furnishings - the outside area was packed with smokers and non-smokers, with great seating areas, large tv screens and heaps of gas heaters, much needed when we were there!
We stayed in for dinner as we were tired after a long drive - but glad we did as the cuisine was superb.  Fast forward to breakfast - what can I say - superb.
Only disappointment was the fact that we only had 1 night at this fabulous hotel.",5,2010,06,13
208,For that special weekend getaway..,The Dylan is luxurious contemporary boutique hotel but maintains a personal touch.  It's location is great and the cafe opposite is a must before you head home.   It's perfect for a girlie weekend or for a weekend away with that someone special.    The rooms are really spacious and overall great value for money.,5,2010,06,08
208,"Cool, trendy hotel ... but losing some of its shine & borderline 5-star","to be fair, I stayed at this hotel on the backend of my trip to Ireland after staying at the Ritz-Carlton Powerscourt immediately before (so we were a bit spoiled)

PROs
- staff very accommodating & service impeccable
- decor/design was 1st rate & room features/amenities were great (e. g. iPod stereo)
- great bar and restaurant
- quite reasonable price

CONs
- having gone over the top with design, some the pieces are not as durable as simple furniture & showing signs of wear ... overall, hotel is 12-18 months away from needed a refurb
- suite was a bit smallish (I'd say c. 400sf)
- whilst staff was attentive & accommodating, they weren't very knowledgeable about Dublin
- overall, this hotel is borderline 5-star",4,2010,06,03
208,Fantastic service all round,"I had a surprise party for my boyfriend in the library and the entire set up was fantastic. our friends agreed, the whole night went swimmingly. We then stayed in the hotel and the service to the room and in the restaurant was fantastic. The staff were really friendly and helpful and the food was fantastic. I would definately recommend the Dylan for a night out or to stay in. I'll certainly be going back...",5,2010,06,02
208,Attention to detail not quite there....,"Very nice hotel but I feel the attention to detail wasn't quite there.  Our room decor was nice, and the room size good (although the bed seemed really small!), but the damp smell in the communal hallway was really off putting.  I requested a quiet room when I made the booking and was impressed when this was honoured at check-in.  I'm glad I made this request, as I'm sure some of the other rooms above the outdoor bar area would be really noisy (at weekends especially when the bar was really crowded).  The hotel clearly attracts an ""in"" crowd, and I believe some celebs have been spotted here, but it disappointed me that 3 types of cocktails could not be made for me because they had ""run out"" of the required ingredients.....to me a 4/5 star boutique hotel which is obviously trying to cater for such clientelle should be more prepared (and also employ more bar staff, as the wait time for drinks was excessive).

The food was OK.....we only had breakfast here, and I liked the buffet cereals, fruit etc.  The cooked breakfast wasn't the best I have ever tasted, but they were very eager to please, and made me a nice omelette to compensate for my fussy taste!

The hotel is in a good area, with Dublin's city centre easily accessible by foot.  During our stay, there were always taxis outside the hotel, which was really convenient.

All in all, a decent hotel that could probably do with upping its game slightly.",3,2010,06,01
208,"Fabulous Hotel, Great Service, Wonderful In-Room Amenities","Stayed here for one night as a treat and was very pleased.  The decor is really interesting, the bar is lovely, especially the outdoor areas on a nice evening.  For the ladies who wonder about the hair dryer quality (as I do), this one is top notch.  The bathroom products are REN, and the room has a fabulous rain shower head.  We stayed at the bar a bit later than planned and the staff was more than accommodating.  The location is excellent, with a nice stroll into the city center/Baggot Street area.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a nice city break, even if you never leave the premises.",5,2010,05,26
208,"Right Off St Mary's Road, Dublin","I just returned from a great stay at The Dylan Hotel in Dublin IE. I travel to Dublin with some frequency and generally stay near Trinity College in the Temple Bar area. I decided to stay a little bit out of town ( but still only a 15 minute walk into City Center) to experience another part of the city. The Dylan is in an area known as Ballsbridge, off of Lower Baggot Street. That area is residential but has many fine restaurants and shops and is a very charming locale, but still near the center of Dublin. The Dylan is a boutique establishment with forty something stylish rooms within. The Lobby and restaurant are in the older part of the building and the new wing is adjacent. Lots of outdoor areas to dine or enjoy a pint or two. Very friendly and helpful staff, because of it's size, they know just about every guest and address you by name ( alway a nice touch). Very much enjoyed my visit to The Dylan and the area and of course Dublin and it's populace are always a delight. High recommend.",5,2010,05,26
208,"Great experience overall, Madison in the reception adds class!","My stay in Dylan hotel was an amazing experience. The rooms are big and clean and there is attention to detail which makes a big difference. The hotel's restaurant had a wide selection of wines, great food and the personnel was very knowledgeable on the wine list which was very helpful. The experience at the reception was great with Madison being very helpful and kind and with a lot of class. Hotel decoration is extremely posh.",5,2010,05,20
208,My Little Gem in Dublin,"I feel compelled to write a review on Trip Advisor and yet my selfish part doesn't want me to share this hotel with anyone. Dylan is a little hidden gem, off the beaten track but yet close to city centre. The staff are wonderful, the rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is great. As a business traveller, I want a swift uncomplicated check-in, which Dylan does. They offer free internet and nice turn down service, complete with bottle of water and an Irish chocolate.",5,2010,05,08
208,Why is this hotel not number 1!,We have stayed here several times and cannot fault it. Lovely quiet location and friendly staff - quality!,5,2010,04,27
208,Pure class,"I took my husband to the Dylan for a birthday surprise, and on a recommendation from a friend. It certainly lived up to expectation. The reception area is rather minimalist, which is expected in boutique hotels. Very quick check in and as we arrived slightly early from our flight, I expected to just leave our bag and return later. However, the room was already available so we were able to go to our room immediately which was a bonus. When we got to the room, the ipod was playing music ready for us. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. I have to get one of those beds. Huge bathrooms with rainforest overhead showers and Ren toiletries, large size shampoos and conditioners etc. The hotel offers little extras, such as a complimentary shoe shine service, which is what I think makes this place a bit special, and more of an experience than your average 5 star hotel.

We spent the evening in the bar, where the cocktails are to die for. The bar is very cute with odd sized chairs (think Alice and Wonderland), some were a bit uncomfortable, but we moved to one of the couches, and eventually the outside terrace. Since Dublin is a rather expensive city, I found the drinks and food at the Dylan to be very reasonable indeed and comparable to any high street bar in the city. We felt there was no where else to go out that evening since it is apparent that well heeled locals all migrate to this destination for a good night out anyway. We had a lot of fun in the evening.

There were chocolates left on our bed after turn down service, which is another nice touch. Breakfast in the morning was beautiful. A huge Irish breakfast which we could not finish it was so large, and I am a big eater. A choice of fresh pastries and fruits, cereals, smoked salmon and all the accompaniments, cheeses, meats are all available too before a cooked breakfast. We loved the Dylan and I won't hesitate to recommend it. They have a most civilised check out time of 12pm, which is just another great thing about this place. We didn't eat in the restaurant but judging from the breakfast, I certainly think it would be a good experience. The restaurant looked very happening on Saturday night and Sunday brunch, people were utilising the outside terrace wining and dining. I imagine I will think about this hotel a lot. I could not fault anything about our stay here, except the fact we had to leave. It is a bit of a walk from the city centre, (more like 20 mins I would say honestly). But its manageable and quite good to get a bit of exercise). Buses run up and down the street to the centre also.

Highly recommended!",5,2010,04,26
208,"Excelent Stay, helpfull staff, highly recomended","We stayed in the Dylan after booking online. overall We were very happy with the hotel. Everything was spot on. All the staff were extreemly helpfull and we were always greeted with a smile. We really were made to feel special. The staff were also very quick to help. When we had a problem with out TV and safe in our room the response time was very fast.

We ate in the bar one night and found it expensive however the food was good. 

There are only 2 things that i would critisize and they are the limited restaurant recomendations from the hotel staff. They really seemed to struggle when we asked where to eat. I would suggest doing a little research before you go. Very frustratingly you are not allowed to take the toiletries, they charge you !",4,2010,04,06
208,"Good service - horrible decor, OK location","We were moved to this hotel as the Conrad informed us they were fully booked - when we checked the reviews on Tripadvisor we were happy to see that it was rated so highly.

Overall the service in the hotel is very good with friendly attentive staff - our inclusive breakfast was also of a very high standard.

However, the decor in the hotel really is terrible - lime green sofas with grey carpets, studded leather walls and ceilings in the lift are two examples of the horribly over the top interiors of the place. It felt like they were trying to make the hotel as modern and luxurious as possible, but horribly missed the mark. 

The location is also OK, with it being tucked in a nice quite backstreet and is about a 20min walk from the center.

Unfortunately i just couldnt recommend this place due to the pain it caused my eyes!",3,2010,03,30
208,top notch service and location,"arrived after a transatlantic flight... at the Conrad which was overbooked... shuffled over to the Dylan.  They can move me any time if this is the result.   Fabulous service at checkin with great effort to get us quickly to our room so we could clean up.  Great room with large bed, wonderful shower, and nice amentities like IPod and dock.  The bar is fabulous... great for a late night drink after hitting every pub in town on St. Patty's day.  Will most definitely stay here next time.",5,2010,03,18
208,Should have been 5 out of 5 but wasn't,"I spent one night at The Dylan hotel following a recommendation from a business contact in Dublin.
Hotel is genuine boutique, down a quiet street in a pleasant neighbourhood.
It is a good 15-20 minute walk to the city centre, so perhaps not the best location for sight-seeing, but for a city centre hotel it was certainly quiet and peaceful.

THE GOOD:
- Stunning decor in public areas and my room
- Very spacious bedroom
- Large bathroom with monsoon shower and underfloor heating
- Free wifi
- Good breakfast selection (although I did not try anything cooked)
- Funky bar

THE BAD:
- Coffee at breakfast - tasteless
- Perhaps a slight lack of atmosphere, despite the ornate decor
- Sound insulation between rooms is not great...yes, I could hear my neighbour peeing in the early hours...several times!

THE UNACCEPTABLE:
- Even with the ventilation switched off, there was a constant, loud buzzing noise in my room which was audible all night, even with ear plugs.

....and that's why it does not get full marks. It would not stop me staying there again, but I would check the room is quiet.",4,2010,03,15
208,"A year late, but I still think about our stay!","We stayed last May, so this is extremely late and actually I thought I'd written a review but obviously had never got round to it! That's probably because when we were there in May we got engaged and have been planning our wedding ever since! So regardless of everything else the trip was a massive success anyway!

But I did want to leave a review (albeit so late) because we had a truly fabulous stay. The hotel is in a great location, not in the centre of town but a really nice walk of about 10/15 minutes into the centre of Dublin. The location is really quiet, which was perfect for what we were looking for, and the hotel itself is stunning. The building, the interiors - it's all gorgeous. We had a front facing room which we loved - the bed was massive, the decor was fab and the bathrooms was lovely. I particularly loved the phone and iPod dock in the room!

Breakfast both mornings we stayed was great and the service was quick. We had dinner on one night and cocktails on the other night and both were great. The cocktails were maybe slightly overpriced but I think that's more Dublin prices than Dylan prices. 

The day after we got engaged we actually spent most of the day in the room (celebrating and nursing hangovers) and on that occassion particularly, I was so pleased we'd chosen such a gorgeous place to stay. 

It's a trip I will never forget for obvious reasons but the hotel made it even better.",5,2010,03,15
208,Spectacular....,Stayed in the Dylan last week in the signature suite and must say we were more than impressed. What a room!!!! What a bed!!!!. Cant fault this hotel in any way. Staff were so helpful and friendly they made us feel very welcome. Thanks Dylan........,5,2010,02,22
208,Didn't want to leave,"My wife & I stayed here for one night over Valentine's weekend. Not a huge hotel, but for us that just adds to its charm.

Its modern & quirky, with excellent staff who make everything from booking to checkout enjoyable & effortless.

We had a ‚Äústyle‚Äù room which was really comfortable & spacious. Every detail seemed to be thought of.

The meal in the restaurant was gorgeous, the service was excellent & the wine was too good. Afterwards we had drinks in the very cool bar.

We finished our stay with breakfast in the room which was lovely.

Our biggest problem with the Dylan was having to leave!",5,2010,02,20
208,dissapointing!,"On arrival ,reception very helpful. My friends and I went shopping and on return went up to our room through a series of dark corriders. Room was average and bathroom tiny.
Had been looking forward to dinner but food was average to awful. I had a few minute slithers of smoked salmon and one of my friends has the goat's cheese pie which consisted of goats cheese squeezed into a pie dish with afew pine nuts and tomatoes squeezed in also. Lobster for main was fine but the treacle tart and raspberry ice cream for dessert was inedible!. The waiter asked if I had enjoyed my untouched dessert and when i said no he ignored me.
Breakfast was awful, the poached eggs were hard as rocks and by the taste, i think the chef poached them in vinegar with a dash of water!
Will not be going back as there is a true five star not very far from the dylan!",3,2010,01,31
208,Hidden Gem,"I'm late writing this review but it had to be put on paper the experience we encountered in this hotel.
We had the pleasure of staying in this hotel in December and brought clients out for dinner, from the start to finish the experience was something else.  Need to mention Barry who was so efficent and Madison who on check is an asset to this hotel :-)
The rooms were luxurious, spotless and dinner that night was superb.  Breakfast cannot be faulted.  This hotel is tucked away you would nearly pass it but a visit is a must.",5,2010,01,25
208,Very disappointing,"Myself and my partner booked to stay at The Dylan after reading about the hotel in a sunday magazine. After reading all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor we booked to stay in one of the Signature Rooms.
When we arrived at around 17.00 we were met by hotel manager to tell us that they had overbooked and that they were transferring us to the Four Seasons. We found this really disappointing as i had confirmed our booking twice only a week before our stay to make sure everything was ok.
The Four Seasons was extremely nice but the room wasn't to the same standard as we had originally booked and also we didn't feel we had brought the correct attire as when we went down to the vodka bar in the evening, all the men had dinner jackets on and the women evening dress. This made us feel very uncomfortable and out of place.
I would advise anyone who wishes to stay at The Dylan to triple check their booking before their trip otherwise they could be left feeling extremely disappointed.",2,2010,01,19
208,nice hotel,"As we stayed at the Dylan in January we got a good room rate. The room was nice and we liked the fact that it had movies, fully stocked mini bar and a heated bathroom floor.  The bed/mattress was of a very high quality. 

Room service was quick and the food lovely. Disappointed with service at breakfast but all in all the stay was well worth the money we paid.

One improvement the hotel could make is with the doors slamming near the bedrooms. We were woke up at 6am with doors repeatedly slamming in neighbouring rooms.",4,2010,01,07
208,Perfect!,"Myself and my husband decided to treat ourselves to a overnight stay at our favourite hotel between Christmas and New Year and once again we were absolutely delighted with Dylan.  On arrival we were very warmly greeted by the reception staff and were thrilled to be upgraded to the Signature Suite.  The room was massive and lush.  I thought the bed looked a little short, but on closer inspection it was just because it was sooooo wide that it just looked a bit short.  It was very comfortable too.  The bathroom was great with a huge shower and a bath so big you could nearly swim lengths in it.   Luxury is relaxing in a deep hot bubble bath with a g&t and watching tv!!  We had a couple of drinks in the bar, the strawberry daquaris are to die for.  Breakfast was delivered to our room and was fab.  Once again,  we have not one single negative thing to say about this wonderful hotel.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some luxury and a home away from home.",5,2009,12,29
208,Luxury and style done in a very friendly way!,"This is a simply fantastic hotel - we enjoyed our stay immensely.  The rooms are stylish and elegant, and with fabulously comfy beds. The bar is fantastic, with a great range of drinks and house cocktails (try the one called bramble!). As for the restaurant, what can I say - the food is GORGEOUS! If you want a bit of peace while you're there, take time out in the ""library"" - a very relaxing way to spend a few hours in the afternoon.
The most impressive thin about the Dylan is however, the staff - they are brilliant. Very friendly, very helpful, and very attentive - but not in an intrusive way. I couldn't praise them more. 
The hotel is in a quiet, georgian area, only a 15-20 min walk (along a straight road) from the main shopping/pub-restaurants area off Grafton Street, so you're not too far away from all the nightlife if you want to spend the evening out, or shop during the day  Overall we were very impressed, and we'll definitely be going again.",5,2009,12,22
208,Trendy minimalism,"Just recently stayed in the Dylan for a weekend trip to Dublin from London. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful upon arrival. Our room was small, but it was not lacking in anything -- in particular the bed was very comfortable.   The location was great off the main road and only 15 minutes walk to St. Stephen's Green. Also note that across the road is the Expresso Bar which has fantastic brunch. We also had a full Irish breakfast in the room one morning and it was top-notch too. Check out the bar downstairs -- although pricey (which is Dublin in general).",5,2009,12,19
208,The Fantastic Ms. Fox,"On a recent stay we were initially apprehensive as our reception was a bit chilly and we were greeted with plumbing problems in our room.  The problems were quickly resolved and we we given a new nicer room.  The room design and layout was perfect, the bed and bath comfortable and the amenities top rate.  While the hotel is a bit of a schlepp to the main attractions of Dublin, I would not hesitate recommending it.  In particular, Madison Fox, the concierge/front desk staffer, was very helpful in providing spot-on restaurant and nightlife recommendations, even suggesting one or two very cool places which were so far off the beaten track that I was sure we were the only yanks in the place.  Kudos to Madison.",4,2009,12,18
208,Good but not quite great - small details need resolving,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dylan for a long weekend to celebrate my birthday.  We chose the hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and the rate (3 for 2) that we found; note that although the hotel claims best rates, we found that we could book the dates we wanted through tablet hotels but not through the website (arr Thursday dep Sunday).  

The hotel is well located and as per other reviews, 10-15 minutes walk away from town.  We arrived late at night and were shown to our (standard) room; the first impressions were generally pleasant, but I realised that the Dylan lets itself down on the smaller details.  Arriving in early December, the heating in the room was c. 24C, so far too hot and stuffy for most people.  The lighting is very modern / mood - unfortunately this means that there's no real lighting if you wanted to work or read in the room.  Our room was located in the newer section of the building, and we could hear the bar noises from below at night, and other sounds from above during the day.  

Our room was slightly on the small side (I think the bed was a small queen or large double) but it was the cheapest, so perhaps this is understandable.  The room faced the street; however, as a first floor room it seemed a shame that we had to have the curtains drawn during the day - there was no privacy / sheer blind option to allow natural light to come through without being seen by people on the street.  In general the rooms were decorated to a high standard, and felt clean.  

The shower was pleasant and the products by Etro were nice but very strongly scented.  Our bathroom would have benefitted from heated floors, and more storage around the basin - we hardly had room for our toothbrush by the sink, and ended up keeping everything else in the main room.  The bathrobes provided were nice but slightly different from one another, and not as soft as I would have expected.  Furthermore, whilst these were hung up each day by housekeeping, they failed to do the small things like re-tie the belt (which most boutique / top end hotels would).  On the matter of the bathroom, we were unfortunate and found on two occasions that there was no cold water available (a rather bizarre twist on the norm) - not easy when brushing teeth!  We did mention this to management on departure and they seemed surprised and said they would look into it.   

The Dylan kindly provides small bottles of water at night; however, these are only replaced at turn-down service, which means that even after housekeeping has visited, empty glass bottles of water are left out!  Note that there are no tea / coffee facilities in the rooms.  On the subject of beverages, we were also incorrectly charged for an item from the mini-bar following departure.  

On the plus side, the Dylan does some things well.  Free wi-fi was available throughout the hotel.  Breakfast was divine and included in our rate, although at c. EUR 30 per person it would be steep if not.  There was also a thorough selection of newspapers and magazines (ie, the Economist) available in the breakfast room.  The staff were very accommodating and friendly.  

I'm sure that this is undoubtedly one of the better hotels in Dublin; however, compared to other leading worldwide cities, it falls short.  The Dylan should concentrate on refining the boutique details of the hotel in order to become truly world class.",4,2009,12,11
208,friendliest  staff;lovely hotel would highly recommend,"We spent three nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the Dylan,and we had a lovely time.The staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable,nothing was too much trouble,they even lent us a suitcase scale as we were flying with the dreaded Ryanair.That was our only mistake we had never flown with Ryanair before and never will again,interestingly neither would anybody we spoke to in Ireland.However the Dylan more than made up for our awful journey both ways.W e booked through Mr and Mrs Smith and would also like to recommend doing this as we had breakfast included free as we booked through them.",5,2009,12,08
208,"Big boutique, big on its design","This is a fine hotel in a nice, big house about a 10-15 minute walk from St Stephen's Green. The location is probably better if you already know Dublin and are happy to be off the beaten track - it gets a little tiresome trekking it into town a couple of times a day if you want to go visiting things - but then the area itself has charm, right next to the canal and very well positioned for plenty of excellent restaurants. You could spend most of your time in the room though - it's very comfortable, cosy, and private, with a great Bang & Olufson sound system, etc.. They've clearly made a major investment in this place, and have made a point of the ""design"" - everything, from furniture to door handles, is what might be classed ""funky"", a bit like a VIP lounge at a club, which personally isn't to my taste and so was a little off-putting as I have a feeling it could date quite quickly (if it hasn't already). To me it started to look a little cheesy, but that's just my personal taste, as I like things a bit more classical  - have a look at the website and if you like wavey, curvey, plastic extravagances, etc. then you'll love the place. We didn't try the food as we were out too much, up too late and had too long a list of restaurants to go to, but it has a good reputation. It did seem, for the size of hotel it is (very large fo a ""boutique""), that the communal areas were pretty limited and the small reception doesn't seem to gel with the ambitions of the hotel. But as I say, you could as happily stay in the room. All in all, a comfortable place that, if you like this kind of design and don't mind the location, is a good choice. Nice staff too.",4,2009,12,07
208,PERFECTION! Best hotel of our trip!! LOVE the Dylan!,"If you go to Ireland you MUST stay at the Dylan! It is beyond wonderful.  I have trouble sleeping at hotels but this one was so lovely and the beds are so comfortable that I had three perfect nights of sleep. We had a huge room with fabulous decor and even the rollaway cots were great for my twin boys. Our first fantastic impression was how the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us when we arrived after such a long flight overseas- they let us check in early and we had a much-needed nap!! We thank Simon and Fiona, and all the staff were lovely!! Breakfast was delicious and the dining room is unique as is the very stylish bar area. The boys loved the brownies that were brought to the room each evening along with chocolates and water for the bedside. The staff also offered great places to eat and supplied us with a map of the city. We are very picky and this hotel just exceeded our every expectation!! We already want to come back just to stay at the Dylan again! Thank you to everyone at this unique and wonderful smaller hotel! We loved it!!",5,2009,11,25
208,Perfect,"Stayed for three nights whilst in dublin for muse concert.  a little tricky to find but prob more a satnav issue!!  valet parking very useful and included.  check in was swift and they promptly ordered a taxi for us to go to the o2.  room a good size and very modern with some nice touches like lights under bed, ipod in the room.  bathroom large with great products.  we messed up the safe pretty much straight away and within 30 mins it was fixed.  fifteen min walk to shopping area or quick taxi.  breakfast lovely with no queues or hanging around.  all staff at the hotel were very attentive, friendly and helpful.  ive stayed in a lot of dublin hotels and this was easily the most enjoyable experience yet, will def return.",5,2009,11,18
208,Unpretentious funk!,"I was one of 4 travel agent friends who were after a ""girls indulgent trip away"" experience and asolutely found it here. Given our profession we have seen many many hotels but this one, it was agreed, is most definitely the best of all.  

I cannot in any way fault this hotel. The staff were absolutely amazing, the decor was really funky without feeling pretentious, the cocktails were massive (though they came at a price), the breakfast was amazing, the rooms had everything you need and more.  For those who really appreciate the special touches you will enjoy the ETRO bathroom condiments & stylish 5 star furnishings. Turn down with chocolate appears a rarity these days but again, they didn't disappoint. 

Stayed there 2 years ago and am still raving....love it love it love it!",5,2009,11,16
208,Seventh Heaven!,"Amazing hotel in a quiet area of Dublin about a 20min walk to St Stephen's Green. Fantastic rooms in a completely unique and eclectic style. The concierge could not have been more helpful to us. I had been treated to this as a birthday surprise and we got an upgrade room which was the best in the hotel...champagne chocolates .. the works all laid on for you and nothing was too much trouble!
Breakfast totally worthwhile...u will not need to eat lunch!! Dinner in the restaurant could not be faulted either.
All in all a fantastic place to stay.
If you are visiting Dublin a tip is to go to Avoca, Suffolk St and have lunch in the restaurant at the top of the shop.. no finer food or atmosphere to be had in the city!!",5,2009,11,02
208,Very stylish hotel in a quiet location a short walk form the city highlights,"The design and fit out of this hotel as a real 'wow' factor. It makes a pleasant change from the fading glory or bland minimilist design of so many hotels. From reception onwards the service is good. Special touches like the discreet delivery of a bottle of champagne to the room are taken of. Our junior suite provided a comfy sitting area, flat screen TVs, music system and a wake you up shower. The restaurant and bar are so good that you will put off going into the city for a night out. When you do go into the city centre it is a pleasant walk. One route is too follow the canalside walk to the redeveloped dockside area which is now home to apartments & restaurants. The thing lacking at this hotel is the sound of an Irish accent!",5,2009,10,25
208,Super,"Had a wonderful stay at the Dylan, it is expensive but when you are treating the wife for her birthday it is well worth it. Food & Service was excellent, we also had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager Siobhan what a pleasure to meet someone who knows what they are doing.",5,2009,10,21
208,A Little Piece of Heaven on Earth!,"Simply a gorgeous hotel! I spent ages trawling around for the perfect hotel for our 5th wedding anniversary. The Dylan kept popping up when I went searching ..... it's the number 1 hotel on Trip Advisor itself, so I went for it. They are doing a superb deal of 3 nights for the price of 2 incl breakfast (I think that's on thru October and November 2009 but check the hotel website). Upon arrival in Dublin, we took a bus from the airport (not the aircoach) as far as O'Connell Street (cost us 6 euro each, one way) and walked the rest of the way, as that's what the bus driver said we had to do - that's a hell of a hike with luggage I can tell you! When I do it again, after looking at a map, I will take the Aircoach to any stop in Ballsbridge (7 euro each, one way) and walk from there, as it's heaps closer!!! You could obviously get a cab, but it will cost around 35 euro (we did that on the return at rush hour and it took us an hour). When we arrived at the hotel our room was not ready, but it was only 0830am! However, we did all the check-in paperwork, stored our luggage and spent time relaxing/drinking in the hotel's relaxing lounge before moving to the lovely outside bar area (with outdoor TVs!) until the room was available - all very smooth. Our room was ready before the 3pm check-in time and our luggage already in it....also, we had been upgraded and had an anniversary welcome gift (brownies) from the manager! Had a fantastic room (The Experience Suite) with THE most comfortable bed. We had dinner in the restaurant that evening - scrumptious. The next day, we walked to St Stephen's Green (15 mins) and spent most of the day in our favourite drinking venue, Cafe en Seine in Dawson Street.  The next evening, the lady I booked our stay with had placed chocolate dipped strawberries in our room as a gift - how touching!  The Dylan is definitely not ""central"", but for me was in a perfect location - away from all the noise and a lovely walk into town. The staff are great, the hotel is beautiful (the decor is awesome), the service knockout and the bedroom just perfect. If you are looking for a trendy little oasis away from it all (and not a hotel with lots of bars/space/facilities) then this is where you should come. I will DEFINITELY stay here again - it's certainly not cheap, but then you get what you pay for I feel!  We just loved the Dylan and by looking at 99% of the reviews here, so does everyone else.  Try it, I think you would find it very hard to complain :)    (Note: I work in the Event Industry, have done for 20 years, and have stayed at many many hotels a the expense of clients which makes booking my own holidays very hard as I have been very spoilt and have very high expecations!  Take it from me, this hotel holds its own and I could find nothing negative to say).",5,2009,10,19
208,Smallest roms in Dublin - really disappointing,"Very expensive for such small rooms, the bathroom is smaller than a travellodge hotel bathroom, nowhere to put a washbag no bath in the bathroom. No privacy from the windows as there are no sheers or blinds. The bedroom is so small you can only just walk around the bed. Staff a little bit of attitude when you ask for anything. Very expensive additional breakfast charge. Not a central or walkable location. Room cleaning is very late in the day if you are staying for more than one night.",1,2009,10,16
208,A Hotel worth the Hype,"This has to be one of the 'must stay hotels'. I have stayed at a number of top big named hotels all over the world. However looking at the standard of hotels in Dublin I wanted something special. And my stay here was certainly that. From the time we checked in the who feeling of the surroundings made it feel the bespoke hotel it claims to be. Upon arrival the reception staff were warm and welcoming  and gave us all the information of the hotel and surrounds we needed. We were shown to our room and met with one of the most sumptuous areas I have stayed in. Everything was furnished to a very high standard. Extremely clean and nothing left out that we needed to request. A trip to the bar was fantastic with fantastic Drinks, food, seating area and ever thoughtful staff made it feel relaxed yet exclusive and I can understand why the fashionable locals use it as there watering hole. 
Yes the walk to the centre is a bit far but only 15 min max. However it is direct and a very colourful walk even though. It does however give the hotel a feeling of privacy as the hotels in the centre are surrounded by very busy pedestrian areas.

There is so much to say about this hotel but hopefully you will stay and prove me right.",5,2009,10,15
208,Great Staff,"The staff at the hotel were great. One of the tours that I wanted to go did not operate on the day that I wanted to go. They went the extra mile and found one that did operate.

The hotel is very modern and in a nice quiet location. It is a bit further than I would have liked to the  Grafton area (about a 20 minute walk). This doesn't sound far but after walking all day it seemed far at night.

There weren't too many restaurants really close by.

If you are going to stay here, make sure that you get directions from the hotel. Even though I had the address, toursit information at the airport couldn't help me. The bus transfer from the airport didn't know either and let me off no where close to the hotel and then the taxi driver didn't know where it was. He had to ask another taxi driver.

Once you are there and know where you are, it is easy to get around. It is just that the side street that it is on is not well known.",4,2009,10,08
208,PARADISE FOUND IN DUBLIN!!!!,"I stayed at the merrion earlier this week, which was a gorgeous hotel with great facilities  , but rather cold customer service, came back to dublin for one night on my way out of the country and opted for a change- and m so glad I did!!! this place is paradise!!!!
the hotel itself is very  well done , great stylish interiors, lovely comfortable beds (a huge plus for a girl with a broken vertebrae, I slept like a veritable baby, a happy one!)
lovely bathroom, beautiful amenities , etc..love the shampoos, huge generous bottles, this place knows what makes a person feel at home:)..
but what really made this place for me is the customer service, every single last person who works here is an absolute treasure..from front staff and their very warm and efficient welcome to the adorable guys in the bar - esp that fellow with the wild hairdo, the tall one, I love these people! would move in here if I could..a definite home away from home..
the hotel is a TINY bit off the beaten path but I enjoyed that, the neighborhood is the best in dublin and you feel it, the calm..there was a lovely fat cat sitting out in the street every morning making me feel I'd come home to Mayberry , but only a block away all the shopping and pubs, and a great cafe just across the street.
very chic crowd, young and old, and everyone I met here as guests were all lovely humans..thank you Dylan! bless you and may you have a long happy life, wonderful place:)",5,2009,10,08
208,"Fantastic long weekend, best hotel staff EVER!","Just returned from a fantastic long weekend at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin. The staff at this hotel is superb and the service is personal without being stuffy or smothering by any means. They went out of their way at every turn, even going to the length of helping us secure dinner reservations at some top restaurants on a very busy weekend as we had neglected to book them in advance. 

The room was spotless, spacious, quiet, and everything you would expect from a top hotel. 

One thing to note is that it is a bit of a longer walk from the Dylan to popular areas such as Grafton Street and Temple Bar, but on the other hand, I have stayed at hotels in those areas before and found them very noisy, especially at night, so I appreciated the peace, quiet, and elegance of the Dylan by comparison. The neighborhood is actually very nice and there are a number of shops and pubs nearby (and the restaurant and bar at the hotel itself are both fantastic). 

I would DEFINITELY stay at the Dylan again - in fact, I can't wait until the next time I am in Dublin and have the opportunity to do so!",5,2009,09,26
208,Coolest Place To Stay In Dublin,"The Dylan hotel sets out to be different from any other hotel in Dublin and in many ways reminds me of the Soho Hotel or Covent Garden Hotel in London. This is because the people that use the hotel (not necessarily the guests) for its bar or meeting spaces bring with them a sense of youth, style and coolness. Of course they would only like to be associated with a venue for a reason and the Dylan's decor, staff and private club ambience give them everything they need when looking to meet with friends.

Of course I wasn't one of those cool people but it was interesting looking inside the fish bowl anyhow. I also really appreciated the bar staff that knew how to make a good cocktail, the beautiful bedroom, the best outside smoking area in Dublin and the fact that whilst I was on business I did not feel as if I was staying in a business hotel.

The things I didn't like were 1) The fact that if you didn't need a turn down service at 6PM you never then got water put in your room (they should come back at a time when you are more likely to be out at dinner and not dressing for it) which meant that you had to pay for mini-bar water 2) The uber-coolness (arrogance) of some of the staff 3) the ‚Ç¨20 overnight parking charge.

Location wise the Dylan is in one of my favourite areas of Dublin. It is on a quiet road but round the corner are numerous restaurants. It is also a pleasant 15 minute walk into the centre along Baggot St. 

Overall the hotel is an excellent place to stay in Dublin. I also believe that you would get a greater sense of modern Ireland / Dublin staying here rather than places that attract large numbers of foreign visitors such as the Westbury, Fitzwilliam or Merrion. As with all hotels in Dublin at the moment there are also deals to be had and I felt that ‚Ç¨199 (without breakfast) was good value for the quality of the hotel. Be careful of the drinks bill though.",5,2009,09,25
208,Good - but.....,"This is overall a really nice hotel. Great location, in a quiet residential area, easy walk into city - maybe 15 minutes. Service is excellent, we were permitted to check in slightly earlier having arrived off early flight. Late check out to 3pm without too much fuss. Just a few small points I guess. The reception area is looking tired (grubby carpets) and can get quite crowded during the peak times - but the staff are efficient and intelligent and so this is quite painless. We breakfasted across the road - great cafe - on the first day having first been told that we could have b/fast in the hotel - only to discover that actually the kitchen had just closed and there was no flexibility. It didn't concern us as the cafe opposite was great value. We did b/fast in hotel the following day as included in the rate - and I have to say it was excellent (probably better than the cafe but 3x the price). Supper the night before was also excellent and pretty good value - great buzz for a Sunday evening.
The biggest let down for us was the room - which was a Style room - but we struggled to understand why. It was small, with a tiny bathroom (not as clean as it could be and needing some TLC). Uninspiring decor and the most awful bed (not a fan of latex mattreses at all so this is very much a personal thing). The most irritating thing of all was the noise from slamming doors in the corridor, not once, but at least a dozen times during the night, not sure whether it was the fault of staff or guests. We complained the next morning - but - I am not sure it was taken terribly seriously.
I think with a different room we might have had a different experience.",4,2009,09,24
208,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for two nights on a short trip to Dublin. Don't be put off by the fact that the hotel isn't in the centre of town - it's a very short (and pleasant) walk to the main shopping/eating areas of the city, and the location is nice and peaceful.
The hotel itself is fabulous - amazing decor, lovely rooms and really great staff who are genuinely helpful and friendly.
Would love to go back - in fact it's worth the trip to Dublin just to stay in this hotel.",5,2009,09,17
208,Loved this hotel...will get back if I can!,"This is the best hotel I have tried in Dublin....!
I really enjoyed my stay. The management certainly understands what luxury and service are about. There are nomistakes....the hotel smells good, it's trendy, the rooms are clean and very well furnished (TV, Ipod's, etc...). 
I met with the chef, a girl from Belgium, would anybody know her name?",5,2009,09,16
208,Wonderful,"We stayed at the dylan 2-4 September and it was fantastic.  This was our 3rd visit and it was as good as we remembered.
Everything is perfect, from the welcome at check in to the quality of the room, dining it's all wonderful.  Everyone is friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  It may be a bit more expensive than other hotels in Dublin but it's worth every penny.
We'll definitely be back",5,2009,09,07
208,The Dylan is a fabulous hotel,"I stay at the Dylan on a regular basis. It is a very good hotel indeed. They really understand service and care about their guests. It's fairly small - 40 odd rooms - so they can treat people as individuals.

The rooms are all beautifully decorated and the beds are very comfortable. The food is excellent. I've had room service a couple of times too and it's been great. 

When something has gone wrong - I had a problem with the hot water one morning - the response of the hotel has been quite brilliant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stylish, comfortable place to stay where you are treated as an individual and not just another guest.",5,2009,09,04
208,I wish I was back!!!!!,"As the title suggests, we wish we were back there right now!!!! This hotel is like a four leaf clover, unique!!!! 

From time of arrival to when it was time to leave the hotel staff were the most pleasant in every way. Yes this is an upmarket boutique hotel but the staff are so down to earth and relaxed, and that counts in ever way to make you feel most welcome as they did with us.

The hotel is very up to date on style and comforts with touches such as personal in room i-pod and everything else expected from a hotel of this quality.

Food is just superb here and the portions are not shy either which was a tick on our box unlike some posh establishments out there  where you can all to often be served  a rocket leaf with a drip of balsamic vinegar and be expected to accept it as fine dining.

On arrival at airport take the aircoach which will stop at The Old Schoolhouse hotel. When you get off the bus walk along to along the road in the same direction as the bus. You will come to the junction with Haddington Road. Cross and continue along Northumberland Road and take the first cut off on the rifht into St Mary's Road. Continue along this road and once you get to the end you will see the hotel on the right hand side. All in it is about ten min walk.

The hotel itself is set within a quiet upmarket area with none of the hustle and bustle noise you can get when residing in city centres. To walk to the centre starting at  St Stephens Green you come out the hotel turn right and walk to the end of the road bringing you out onto Baggot Street. Take a right again and it is straight all the way about a 15 to 20 min walk. 

To get to the centre and many other attractions i,e dublin zoo, and temple bar area you can get the number 10 bus from outside the spar shop on Baggot street. You just walk out the hotel as above. Walk along Baggot Street and you will see Spar on the opposite side of the road. It is only about 3 min walk from hotel.

We also went to the Guinness factory and Dublin castle  and we saw Riverdance show which was fantastic.

Thanks to my wife for my birthday treat x",5,2009,09,02
208,Best hotel we've ever stayed in...,"I don't usually write reviews but was so impressed with The Dylan hotel that I felt it warranted some serious praise! I took my girlfriend there for her birthday weekend, booking through the respected Mr & Mrs Smith site. The service, attention to detail, comfort, food & drink - everything was flawless. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Perfect for a romantic weekend or a business trip. The only sting in the tail was the sterling to Euro exchange rate!

A fantastic weekend - thank you all very much at The Dylan.",5,2009,09,02
208,Amazing,"We stayed here for our 1st Wedding anniversary a year agao and as the other reviews suggest it's amazing. Room was large, bed unbelievanly comfotable, bathroom amazing and the etro toiteries were the best i've ever used. i even asked to buy some of them but they gave me some extras for free and I'm still using them for special occasions. Service was first class throughout the hotel. Breakfast and dinner were delicious, although expensive, but well worth it. Location is a bit far out, but for the 3 nights we were there it didn't cause any problems, just a longish walk to the city centre or a taxi. I'd definitly return if I was going to Dublin again - the best hotel we've been too.",5,2009,08,26
208,Amazing,"We were treated like royalty, the rooms were spotless, loved the terrace (front and back), the entire hotel was furnished and decorated WONDERFULLY.  The staff was so helpful. This was honestly the best place I have ever stayed.  Say hello to the fabulous Food & Beverage Manager Martin Meade!",5,2009,08,26
208,Perfect,"We got married here on the 30th july 2009. It was fantastic! the staff ,service, food quality of hotel was superb. We had months of dealing with various members of staff about our upcoming wedding (only thing that was a little frustrating staff kept changing and we had to keep dealing with new people about details for our day..but it didn't make any difference on the day!) Martin the resturaunt manager in particular was briliant...All the staff gave that personal touch which you don't always get in a 5 star hotel.And as some top hotels like this can be a bit pretentious and staff can be a tad stuffy this was totally the opposite.. If you go to dublin this is a real treat to stay here and if you don't stay at least  eat in the resturaunt the food is honestly some of the best ever! the rooms are fab too so definitely worth a stay. I can't wait for an excuse to go back! Thanks for making our wedding pefect!",5,2009,08,24
208,Boys Golf Trip to Dublin and Scotland,"I arranged a golf trip to Dublin and Scotland via Ron Smartt at Traveling through the Fairways  @ http://www.ttfgolf.com/  who arranged from me and my 2 sons ages 23+21 to stay at the Dylan ... A great boutique hotel with excellent service and very comfortable rooms. 

It's a 10 Euro cab ride to anything exciting but worth it.",5,2009,08,21
208,Attention to detail,"We stayed at the Dylan for three nights.  It didn't start off well as we were at the end of a long week of driving and the signage (because of local rules) was very small.  We missed it and drove around for 20 minutes and finally got guided back by the concierge .. we had actually turned around at one point in the driveway next to the hotel. I was tired and a little irritated at myself as much as anything else.  But, once we got out of the car everything was great..  The bags were immediately sent up and the car was parked.  I was running out of clean shirts and the laundry was very quick.  I had to send out a package.  The concierge got it boxed up and sent on its way and arrived the next day .....my family members actually commented on how nice the packaging was.  The 2nd day as we came in .. the lady at the desk called my son over by name and gave him several sweet treats for the next day ....(not sure if the extra sugar rush was a good thing for a 6 year old or not ;-) )
My only caution is that it is a little of a hike to the center of the city expecially with a smaller child.  We walked into town in the morning but had to cab it back in the evening.,,,although the cab drivers were all very pleasant",5,2009,08,17
208,Best Hotel In Dublin - Don't Stay Anywhere Else,"Stayed at Dylans and had a 5 star first class experience. Truly unique boutique hotel in a non-touristy high class Dublin neighborhood with only a 15 minute walk to the center of town. The walk to the town center on Baggot Street was truly enjoyable because you pass many good restaurants (e.g., Hugos), pubs and shops, Another unique feature to the hotel is that it has a lovely patio where you can sit outside and enjoy your drinks and meals, and the food was  exceptional. Most important was the attention to small details and the service we received from the staff. We checked in with our 2 teenagers and when we arrived at our room the IPOD stereo system was playing our type of mellow chill music while the music programed for our teenagers  room was their favorite type of rock/pop music. Also, when we checked out we went for breakfast and requested the valet to retrieve our luggage and car. When we finished breakfast the car was waiting outside and our luggage was already packed inside the car. We don't receive this type of service and attention to small details at other 5 star hotels. Don't stay anywhere else in Dublin!",5,2009,08,13
208,loved the dylan,"We just returned from dublin and stayed five nights at the dylan.  Overall, it was a great hotel and I would highly recommend it.  We travel extensively, and stay in nicer hotels.  I liked the dylan because it has a small, intimate feel.  The staff and service were top-notch.  The rooms were clean and spacious by European standards.  Decor is Philip Stark/Bordello.  If you stay here, eat at Miller's Pizza around the corner.  Great value and great pizza.  Also, O'Donoghues pub and Toner's Pub on Baggot Street nearby were both authentic and enjoyable for a quick Guinness.",4,2009,08,12
208,Really Lovely,"Just returned from a three-night stay in the Dylan, and have to say we were very impressed.  We‚Äôd been invited to a friend‚Äôs wedding (unfortunately not taking place in our hotel!) and wanted somewhere fairly central but with a relaxed, though luxurious, atmosphere, and this really did tick all the boxes.  The staff on the whole were great, the room huge and well decorated (with really cool Bang & Olufsen phones) and possibly the most comfortable bed that I‚Äôve ever slept in (available to buy through the hotel no less!).  Only two minor complaints - the bathrooms are on the small side (as noted by other reviewers), so you could only really get one person in there at a time; and the promised pain killers we phoned down for (well, we had been to a wedding!) never arrived ‚Äì even though the person I spoke to originally was insistent that someone go out and buy them for me.  Minor really, but that‚Äôs the trouble with aiming for perfection ‚Äì people expect you to deliver it‚Ä¶",4,2009,08,11
208,One of the best hotels in the world,"I travel a lot for business and was very surprised and concerned when I hopped into a cab and asked to be taken to the Dylan Hotel and the driver didn't know the hotel.  This was actually quite common, so be prepared to explain the location.  However, once I arrived and went to the room I was pleasantly surprised.  Everything in the bathroom was top of the line, including an amazing shower- two options a waterfall from ceiling or 3 faucets.  You hardly notice how small the bathroom is.  The room was small but very aestetically pleasing to the eye- beautiful furniture.  The front desk staff was nice and helpful if you're standing in front of them.  I called down a few times and was told I would receive follow-up calls but never did.  I ordered in room dining and the sandwich was tasty.  The hotel is a convenient walk into the center of town- about 15mins.  It's in a very nice area and I always felt comfortable out at night.",5,2009,08,09
208,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!!!!","Nothing more to add - apart from the comfy bed, the super room, the decadent bathroom, the great food (dinner, breakfast and bar), the staff - ready and willing to please and help and seemed to be genuinely able to remember our names!  lovely quiet location - only marginally spolied by the bar becoming ""THE PLACE"" for the young and trendy to celebrate - and my husband and I certainly dont fit that description (or at least he doesn't!!)  The trip was a bithday gift to my husband(daughter paid the fare from London and I paid for the hotel - but I got to go too!!)  We had a wonderful time.  Thank you so much.",5,2009,08,04
208,There's a reason this is number 1 on Tripadvisor - it deserves it.,"We chose the Dylan based on a friend's recommendation and on its #1 rating on here. It was absolutely lovely - eccentric and luxurious decor, charming and helpful staff, great room, comfortable bed, nice little extras like a chocolate at turn-down and use of hair-straighteners if you need them, and gorgeous toiletries in the bathroom. The breakfasts were great and they even had gluten-free bread on request. The only tiny negative thing I'd say is that there are no tea or coffee-making facilities in the room, which seems unusual when everything else was above and beyond what you'd expect. All in all - an excellent hotel. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for and there was a good '3 nights for 2' deal on ther website.",5,2009,08,04
208,Clearly the Best in Dublin,"The Dylan has a great combination of 'hipness', style, comfort and elegence.   I've  been hesitant to stay here in the past because I was worried about location being too 'far' from center of things.  In fact, it's very walkable to St.Stephen's and the immediate area is very nice.
The place  just has a really great feel - sort of a small Four Seasons meets The Viceroy.  Bed's are AMAZING and all amenities outstanding.   Food and bar both excellent, although, as you'd expect, not inexpensive.
In reality, Dublin doesn't really have many true 4/5 star hotel options.  Clearly, The Dylan is it hands down.",5,2009,07,24
208,"Love it, Love it, Love  it!!!!!!!","Just back from yet another great stay in the Dylan. Had decided to try out Number 31 off Leeson Street for a change but when we arrived there late on Friday night the room was less than satisfactory. A swift phone call to the Dylan and they arranged us to view a couple of rooms and we had our pick. What a great place. Expensive yes, but the rooms are second to none and the service excellent. Nothing is too much trouble. The three concierge guys are brilliant, Nuta, Augustin and sorry but can't remember the name of the third guy but he is cute and remined me of Joey from firends-always big smile on his face. Oh to be back in that luxurious bed again........Until the next time!!!!",5,2009,07,19
208,Unbelievably Wonderful!,"I usually avoid traveling because I do not like sleeping in hotels, no matter how highly rated they are.  I spent four nights at the Dylan in Dublin and it was the most comfortable hotel stay I have ever had!  I did not want to leave the Dylan.  The decor was beautifully trendy, the rooms were spacious (we stayed in a total of three during our visit, all were fabulous), the beds were amazing, and the hotel restaurant was delicious (great complimentary breakfast spread and a unique dinner menu).  However, the greatest part of this hotel is its warm and welcoming staff.  Every worker that we came across in the hotel was a true pleasure.  The waiters and bartenders were extremely friendly, and the concierges were best of all.  The concierge were very approachable and took excellent care of us...they extended themselves to us more than necessary.  Without their recommendations we would not have seen the incredible sights in Ireland that we fell in love with.  I cannot wait to spend more time in this country, and another stay at the Dylan is a definite.",5,2009,07,14
208,Great Hotel with Excellent Service,"Stayed here for four nights and would definately return. Staff were very attentive and helpful Coutyard Bar was lovely but in good weather it was difficult to find a seat as it was well frequented by locals. Although a full breakfast appears expensive, you can choose from lots of other options. I like porridge and they made it as I wanted. Nothing was to much trouble. 10 min walk to Grafton Street. Bus fron airport drops you off at Pembroke Road. Hotel is a five minute walk. Bus cost 8 euros. Good restaurant called Chai Yo ( Thai /Chinese )about 5 mins walk , this was recommended by hotel",5,2009,07,13
208,nice hotel but don't undrstand what all the fuss is about,stayed for one night as we were attending the bruce springsteen gig at the rds - hotel is in a nice location and is really quiet - yes it is decorated beautifully but i can't really see what all the fuss is about - maybe i was just expecting too much - the service we received couldn't be faulted and all members of staff were very pleasant and helpful but there was just something missing - i have stayed in 5 star hotels throughout the world and feel that the dylan just did nothing for me - there seemed to be a lack of atmosphere within the hotel - as though the people who were staying there were trying too hard. while we did have a great time both at the concert and at the hotel - the bed is so comfy!!!! it isn't a hotel i would be rushing back to -just my opinion but i would prefer to spend my cash on staying somewhere with a bit of atmosphere  - if you are going i am sure you will enjoy your stay but it just wasn't for me,3,2009,07,13
208,Liked it a lot,"Stayed at the Dylan recently. The location was nice, sure some things were a taxi ride away but the neighborhood was nice. Loved the room, the bed was indeed comfy, loved the lamps by the bedside, loved the decor. Only thing I did not like was the bathroom, almost an after thought. Combination shower and bathtub, which I really don't get. No light at all and you could not stand in front of the sink if the door was open. And I was staying in what I suppose is a junior suite. Other than that is was lovely. The restaurant was nice, the terrace bar was incredible on a clear, dry, warm and unusual night in Dublin. The service was fine and tried hard. I would always go back to the Dylan when in Dublin. And kudos to all hotels, like the Dylan offering free wi fii. Excellent idea.",5,2009,07,06
208,fantastic hotel fabulous staff,"I have just returned from a short stay at Dylans, It was to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and we decided to spend her special date in a special hotel.........The place was amazing, from the moment we arrived, champagne on ice and a card and choclates from the hotel, we were treated with absolute pleasure.  We chose the magnificent signature suite and we were not dissappointed, everything you would expect from a 5 star location.  
Dinner and drinks were the start of a great evening made all the more special due to the attention to detail paid by the very friendly staff.  Overall a great time was had and I would like to thank each of the staff and managment for the fabulous time they gave to us, definately will return.",5,2009,07,05
208,Amazing!,"My boyfriend booked the Dylan for my birthday in April and WOW, when we got there it was total luxury! the attitude of the staff was very friendly and nothing was too much trouble, the bar was relaxed while beeing trendy. Our room was lovely, the AMAZING bed that you never wanted to get out of was special! The whole hotel had a relaxed atmosphere but still had a great buzz to it. The gadgets in the room were also a great touch.only disapointment was that we only had the breakfast one of the two mornings as it was the best cooked breakfast I have ever tasted!! a little out of the way for St Stephens green and shopping etc but a nice walk if its not raining.",5,2009,07,05
208,amazing hotel,"without doubt the best hotel i have stayed in, anywhere in ireland.the rooms were beautiful and the staff were superb. it is a 15min walk to stephens green, but through a safe and lovely area of dublin.the food there is of the highest class and if there is only one fault with the hotel is that at some point ,one must go home.sometimes you hope a hotel is as good as its reviews and myself and my wife were not disappointed.we will definately be back !!!",5,2009,07,01
208,Wow - 5* & more - has to be the best hotel ever! Can't wait to go back!,"We usually stay in the Merrion Hotel but a friend recommend dylan as he frequents dylan for Friday night cocktails...... from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we felt so special. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful, the room was just class, - so many little touches that made the night so special. A personal welcome note with devine dylan brownies... 

We had dinner in the restaurant and availed of the early bird menu for only 30.00 euro per person - superb value for money. Great choice, excellent service and yummy food... excellent wine list at very reasonable prices - staff fo efficient and so friendly.

The hotel is just so different and very special - the design element is just amazing - wish I could have brought home most of the hotel... 

Overall excellent value for money, felt truly spoilt and very special.... the only downside is that we had to leave.... have stayed in many hotels in Dublin (we like our little nights away in Dublin even though we live near Dublin) from the Merrion to the Shelbourne but dylan tops them all off... a very well kept secret.... but can't keep it to myself - have to share it.... 

We will be back..... just wish it was this weekend!",5,2009,07,01
208,Triumph of style over function!,"This is a good hotel but it could be so much better. Perhaps we visited on a bad four days? I don't think it is worth all the hype in the other reviews . It may have been good once; but I had the impression they were resting on their laurels in the restaurant and bars! The breakfasts were diabolical and the service poor. My poached eggs with bearnaise sauce came with so much vinegar you could have easily seasoned a plate of fish and chips with the remainder on my plate. When I pointed out the problem  I was told that Irish people like vinegar. Thanks! It really helped to know that when I was hungry because I hadn't been offered an alternative!
The second day I decided to play safe with a continental breakfast. I'm afraid it was no better. The toast was of brown bread, not white as ordered,  and covered with a generous layer of crunchy black carbon on one side. Again the error was ignored and no alternative was offered. This time I was wise to their tricks and filled up on the buffet. 
On the third day the toast was burnt again. The coffee is very good, though.
Had breakfast not been included in the room price I certainly would not have paid for it!
There were good things. The room was very stylish although the wardrobe door fell off its hinges!!! The bed is comfortable. The bedside lights are 4 foot high and floodlight the whole room so you can't read in bed if your partner is asleep. The toiletries are a joy but the towels are thin. 
The concierge was excellent and managed to find us a booking for a popular Michelin starred restaurant at 4 hours notice.Thank you! 
Compared to other boutique hotels in Europe in the same price range the Dylan does not make the grade. Staff should visit the de Witt Istanbul  in Istanbul or the Hotel Harmony in Ghent. I'm sure profitable lessons could be learned!",3,2009,06,29
208,"Need a ""Karcher""","Stayed for two nights over the weekend with two friends. The rooms are lovely and the location is fabulous although I have to say the place can be very dirty. When we entered the bar we were a little bit chocked by the staff uniform. Wasn't expecting them to be that relaxed, for a 5 star! What really put us off, was the bar itself (you could see beer running down the bar), the filthy tables on the terrace (10 min to clear and wipe the table) and the state of the floor at the back.",3,2009,06,28
208,Perfect Venue for a Special Weekend,"Just caught our breath after a fantastic weekend at The Dylan.

My now fiancee and I stayed for two nights, and on the first I popped the question ... thankfully, she said yes!

The staff at The Dylan were superb in helping making the weekend special. I'd been in touch by email in advance telling them of my plans for the proposal and they couldn't have been more helpful.

They reserved the beautiful Library room for me at an agreed time and I proposed there. It was perfectly decorated, fire lit, candles, champagne and a fabulous platter of delicious food laid out for us.

The curtains were pulled across the doors to allow us privacy and when I peeked out the concierge seemed to be standing guard to prevent any interruptions.

Afterwards, anyone we encountered from the hotel staff, were very kind to us and offered their congratulations in a very discrete but warm fashion.

The hotel itself is really cool, modern and funky but classy too. Very comfortable beds, mini bar stocked with all sorts of weird and wonderful things.

Lots of little touches that make it a great place for a special weekend away.

The food and drink there although expensive is very good, especially the cocktails, and the bar is a great place if you enjoy people watching.

A funny little incident that summed up the excellence of their customer service and gave us a great laugh is worth sharing:

On our return to our room from a drink at the bar, I stopped by the reception desk and asked could they send an iron and ironing board to the room.

We stepped into the left and hit the button for the 2nd floor. In the 15 seconds it took to get there I said to my girlfriend ... ' the mark of a really good hotel is how long it takes to get an iron delivered to your room, there's probably someone sprinting up the back stairs as we speak'

The lift doors opened, we turned right into our corridor and sure enough a lady was leaving our room having delivered our ironing board and iron.

Says it all.

Top class hotel!",5,2009,06,24
208,Wow!! - highly recommend!,"My boryfriend and I stayed here for one night in June as part of his 30th birthday celebrations - we were really impressed and would highly recommend it for travellers! The hotel itself is beautiful and in a great location; the room was lovely and spacous and we found the ipod system a great extra. The bathroom was clean and I loved the under fllor heating. Philip Pankov photos of Ireland decorated the room and were a great touch! The staff went out of their way to be helpful and friendly during our stay - they even left a birthday card and mini cakes in our upgraded room!

I can honestly say this is the best hotel I've stayed in in Dublin and would highly recommend for visitors to the city!",5,2009,06,15
208,form over function,"Emphasis in the hotel is on contemporary style and unique decor . The high style in this hotel often overlooked the ease of function of some features.  The controls for the heated towel rack and heated floor where either so high as to be unreachable or so low that is made them hard to work.  The temperate control had no light near it so you could not see what you were setting.  The bathroom fixtures required some trial and error to operate. Some of the furnishings are not standing up to the wear they experience from hotel use.
The distance from the city center was considerably longer than I expected from other reviews.  Unless you plan on using taxis this is not a convenient hotel for touring.  It is an appropriate venue for business.
The staff was attentive and the breakfast very good.  Being in a residential area the dining opportunites in the area are limited and time sensitive.  Definitely not the area for nightlife.",4,2009,06,13
208,"Great Hotel,  Great Location","The hotel lives up to all the positive reviews.  We really enjoyed our two nights there.   The room was very nice.  Very modern decor.  They are located in a quiet upscale residential area right next to a church and small park.   It was fun to hear the church bells ring in the morning.

The staff was very nice and accomodating.   We arrived at the hotel at 6:00am from a international flight.  They were able to give us both our rooms.  A nice treat.  A quick shower and we were refreshed and ready for a long day of touring and pubbing.  

There is a Tesco grocery close by which was convenient to purchase snacks, wine, beer, etc.  

The Hotel Bar is VERY pricey.  Almost double the prices of pubs in town.  We did bring our own wine down and enjoy sitting at the tables in the front of the hotel and just relaxed and people watched.  

There are several pubs and restuarants in close walking distance.  O' Donahuges is a famous pub less than 10 minutes walk.  It is about 10-15 minute walk to catch the hop on hop off bus.  

There is a bus stop very close.  The Dublin Bus drivers are very nice.  Just hop on, tell them where you want to go, then tell you how much and even yell when it is your stop.  Makes riding the bus real convenient.  

I would definitely go back.   Enjoy.",5,2009,06,11
208,An unforgettable experience - The most comfortable bed in town!,"I was looking for something special for our 3rd wedding anniversary and found The Dylan by chance. My husband and I had never been to Dublin before and I wasn¬¥t sure what to expect. The Dylan¬¥s website looked very nice and they were very supportive answering all my questions by e-mail so I gave it a go and booked one of the style rooms for one night incl. breakfast. 

Staying at this hotel made our one-day-visit to beautiful Dublin extra special. Arriving at The Dylan early at 9m we were welcomed very warmly and were glad that an early check-in to the room was possible. Surprisingly we were offered a complimentary upgrade to the signature suite which was an unforgettable experience. The most beautiful room I have ever stayed in and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!

This hotel is not a bargain but definately worth a visit if you¬¥re looking for something to make your stay in Dublin extraordinary. Even though it¬¥s located a bit away from the city centre this shouldn¬¥t put anyone off. Just take a taxi or a beautiful walk of not more than 20 minutes passing Stephen¬¥s Green. 

The breakfast was delicious, all the staff extremely friendly and the house itself a very stylish and eye-pleasing adventure. We felt so comfortable it was hard to leave. Well deserved 5 stars and more!

Thank you DYLAN, we¬¥ll be back!",5,2009,06,11
208,"This is a fantastic hotel, especially when sun is shining!","I stayed one night between June 2nd and 3rd, the weather was fantastic! Everything was smooth checking in at the hotel, having a shirt ironed. 
We had a meeting in the patio at the entrance, then later we moved into the garden at the back of the Hotel. Later on in the evening we had dinner at the restaurant and I have to say that it was a very relaxed and attentive service. I can strongly recommend this hotel.
Peter",5,2009,06,08
208,Lovely place to stay.,"The Dylan really is a lovely hotel.  The staff are warm and friendly.  Most staff are from Europe and I would have liked to have met more Irish staff to get the 'feel' of Dublin, but I guess this is like any hotel in a major city.  Every single member of staff that we encountered (about 10 in total) were sincere and very curtious, and made us feel very welcome.
It was my husband's birthday and there were lots of little personal complimentary touches, ie mini birthday chocolate brownie with candle after dinner, card in room, chocolate brownies in the room when we arrived.  So thoughtful and really made it special for him.
The restaurant was wonderful and I would recommend for a special occasion, expensive, but well worth it.
We booked a Style room and got a Room/breakfast package for e229 per night.  The breakfast was fine, but I was pleased it was in with the price because I would have gone elsewhere if I'd have had to pay the e30 price for an Irish breakfast.
The only disappointment was that the bathroom was rather on the small side, and for an upgraded room I would have expected a larger space, the bath was small and there was only one sink and no way was there room for two of us in there at once!  Yet the room itself was spacious and very chic. Room 109.
Our room did not have a view as it was raining and as our room was over the bar garden area the massive umbrellas were up.  This is a shame because the lanterns are lovely when lit at night so it would have been pretty to look down on them.
The hotel is situated in a lovely area and we only had to walk about 15 minutes to Merrion square where you can get all the transport around the city.  We got a 24 hour ticket on the hop on/hop off tourist bus.  You pay on the bus and it takes you clock wise around the city.
We got a taxi from the airport and it cost us e30, but on the way home we caught the airport bus from down the road from the hotel and it was only e8 each, but its takes just over an hour, so give yourselves plenty of time.
I would highly recommend this hotel to a friend going for a special occasion or short city break.",4,2009,06,08
208,An absolute gem of a hotel,"What an absolute gem of a hotel this is. Set a gentle 10 minute walk from the centre of Dublin in a leafy side road, this hotel had sumptuous rooms (even the most 'basic'), attentive, helpful staff and good food. The outdoor spaces were especially great for relaxing in on a sunny afternoon and the staff ensure you are kept well watered as you laze around.
We stayed for an anniversary and arrived early on a flight, but were shown to our room on arrival at just gone 10am; this has never happened before and was an unexpected surprise- You usually have to drag luggage around with you until the 3pm check in. 
The room was as you'd expect from a more expensive hotel, but the i-pods, double shower and fluffy robes are a nice touch.
There's no denying the hotel is pricey, but you do get what you pay for and it was interesting to note that the bar prices in the hotel were actually no more expensive than in the city centre. As a romantic break this was an ideal choice.
Take no notice of the reviews that say there are hidden costs at the hotel; this is not the case and you'd have to be blind not to notice the mini bar costs and the prices of other stuff on offer. You don't have to buy them; it's not obligatory! Some people want the moon on a stick.
With a bit of luck, we'll be back at some point in the near future.",5,2009,06,02
208,"Nice Hotel, but something missing","My husband and I just returned from a two week whirlwind tour of the UK and Ireland. I gave the hotel 4 stars, but I feel mixed about our experience there. Here are some good things about the Dylan: lovely hotel, nice rooms, comfortable bed, good breakfast (beautiful if the weather allows you to sit outside), quiet neighborhood, great suggestions from the concierge. We stayed for 3 nights including breakfast. 

Here are some of the negatives: If you are looking for an ""exclusive"" feeling experience to pad your ego, this may be the hotel for you. If you are looking for a small, unique, and warmly attentive experience, you may want to look elsewhere. I have to second another reviewers opinion that certain people are a bit too snooty. I don't want to pay close to $350 USD/ night to feel exclusive. I want to feel pampered, taken care of, and waited on. The Dylan is a nice hotel, but for the price- it has a great deal to live up to, and I just don't think it did all that it could. 

I emailed the hotel 1 week in advance to let them know we would have to leave around 4 am to catch a flight and asked them to arrange a packed breakfast to go. We did get coffee and tea and that was nice, but no scone or croissant or anything. Another downside was that they don't have a laundry service on Sunday. I understand that some countries shut down on Sunday, but it seems that something might be done to accommodate all needs; and when one travels, laundry is usually a need.

All in all, nice hotel- but not the Irish experience I was looking for.",4,2009,06,01
208,Top drawer uber cool hotel - expensive and worth it,"I stayed here with my wife for a night at the end of April.  It was excellent.  The lady on checkin showed us to our suite and made everything very easy.  SImon behind the bar was incredibily helpful and ensured we always had a very expensive cocktail in hand, but they were well made and served in a very cool bar with different feels in different areas.

Breakfast was brilliant the next morning and worth pre booking oto avoid paying 27 Euros on walking in.

No down sides - I have stayed in hotels like this all over the world and this was up with (if not) the best.",5,2009,05,27
208,Stylish contemporary hotel with excellent food and service.,Fabulous place to stay.  The location is ideal with a short walk into the centre. The rooms are spotless and the staff attentive.  A must is the cocktail bar; try the chocolate martini if you dare (because they are addictive). Would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to returning.,5,2009,05,24
208,Awesome...Stay Here!,"Short cab to Trinity College. Amazing breakfast across the street and great bar scene, very hip. Staff is incredible, we changed our reservations three times due to flight delays; they responded timely in each case. They allowed for early check in (7am which was desperately needed). The surrounding neighborhood is incredibly beautiful. The staff made superb eating recommendations (try the Dobbins). Stay here you wont regret it.",5,2009,05,23
208,Fabulous!,"I found The Dylan by chance and knew nothing about it before I booked.  It ended up being the best part of the entire business trip to Dublin.

Lovely upscale location, fantastic staff and up to date modern and very comfortable hotels.  We got stranded in Dublin due to a snow storm if you can believe it and the Dylan arranged for a car to be sent to the airport to retrieve us and immediately rechecked us into our luxurious rooms.

I would definitely go back for a return stay!!",5,2009,04,30
208,Perfection,"My husband and I stayed at the Dylan to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a lovely experience: all of the staff are great, good service is clearly a priority, the rooms are gorgeous and the fabulous decor continues throughout the hotel - from the restaurant to the reception area and the garden. 
We ate in the restaurant and the food was very good. We chose from the a la carte menu and only paid 30 euro each. I paid a tab which included lunch, evening meal and drinks and it only came to 93 euro. I think this is reasonable especially considering the top quality of the whole experience of eating and drinking at the Dylan.
Although the Dylan is relatively expensive you do get what you pay for and once we had been around town a bit we realised that prices are pretty high throughout Dublin right now. Don't let this put you off though! Dublin is a truly great city.
Room service is prompt and pleasant. In fact the staff help you with anything they can at any time. Finally, we loved the location. We have stayed in Dublin many times before and it is a noisy old place! However the Dylan is in a beautiful area, on the way to Ballsbridge. It is about a 20 minute walk or a quick taxi ride from the main city area so it is quieter but still has a nice bustle about it.",5,2009,04,26
208,"fantastic experience, must visit soon!!","This was a special treat for my very hard working husband,it took along time lots of research to find a very special hotel. We had a ball, the staff are extremely efficent, friendly and more importantly very decreet. I had booked some special treats which added to our experience, had i known in advance that there were various treatments we could have had i would have booked them also. We had a meal in the resturant, the atmosphere, food ,service were incredible . I think its the Dylans attention to detail that makes it so special. We will be coming back, but for alittle longer i hope.",5,2009,04,20
208,UNBEATABLE HOTEL in Dublin,"Everithing about this hotel is great, except the price, but we did go with a promotion (one of the three nights was free), so even that was ok. The room was exellent, the bed coudn¬¥t be more confortable. I have to say that the service was impeccable, everybody werw helpfull. Our rate included the breakfast, wich i highly recomend, because otherwise would be very expensive (something like 30 euros a person, at least). If you want they¬¥ll serve you in the room, no charge.
The location was good. 
The outdoors of thos hotel are amazingly beautifull.
If you can, don¬¥t miss the oportunity to try one of the best hotels in Europe.",5,2009,04,07
208,Beautiful hotel but had a couple of service issues,"As others have said this is a beautiful hotel and we enjoyed our stay. However I did find the staff a bit snooty ('up their own ar*e' according to my elegant wife). We booked dinner for 8:00 and when we arrived in the dining room were told to come back at 8:30 without apology or explanation and they tried to serve an expensive bottle of Sauvignon Blanc at room temperature. They do, however, serve an excellent freshly cooked breakfast.

Our room was good but had only one small window looking onto a service yard and the mirror in the bathroom had a huge crack across it! Also if you are in town for leisure, the Dylan is a longish walk (30-40 minutes) to the centre.

Nevertheless this is an elegant, beautifully designed hotel and would stay again but next time hope to get a better room and better service.",4,2009,04,06
208,Sublime !!!,"I'm not going into a long winded review here, I just felt I could not let time go by without giving this Hotel the praise it so deserves.
We had a two night stay, from the first moment of arrival to being shown to our car on departure it was faultless.
Our every need and request was met with frightening speed which I have never experienced in a hotel anywhere in the world. I am very hard to please !
If you are travelling to Dublin book this hotel above all others.
I am so impressed and am so looking forward to returning :)",5,2009,03,30
208,The best hotel I have ever been to!,"This hotel is truly fantastic! We stayed there last August on a weekend away and we had the most amazing room. It is slightly on the outskirts of the main city centre but its a short bus ride away, or a nice walk. The whole hotel is decorated with style and elegance. I really did love this hotel - might be slightly biased as its where my Fiance proposed! We ate in the restaurant one night which was awesome! The food was just delicious. The dessert I had was outstanding! I would definately stay here again, without hesitation!",5,2009,03,23
208,Fabulous!,"Highly Recommend.  If I were to go back to Dublin, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.  This hotel is in a historic building yet modern and clean inside.  The rooms are a nice size with nice touches such as heated floors and towel rack.  The service is wonderful with nice touches such as complimentary orange juice brought to your room in the morning.  The bar is fun but not too much of a scene - buzzing but not packed.  The location is convenient yet removed enough to be out of the crowds.  It's an easy 10 minute walk to the train or to St. Stephens Green area (Shopping, restaurants).  Also, free wireless in the rooms.

I stayed here and at the Shelbourne (which is also beautiful) and would chose the Dylan.  We had also considered staying at the Morgan (also a boutique hotel) but were glad we didn't when we saw that the Morgan is right in the heart of Temple Bar...tons of drunks and college aged tourists on the street in front.

While in Dublin we had fantastic meals at Peploes and Eden - both recommended.  We also did the Musical Pub Crawl which is a bit touristy but was a LOT of fun.  Also recommended if you like music.",5,2009,03,20
208,Great Hotel,"We stay in Dylan Hotel for 2 nights and it was amazing.  We arrived by car and just as we stopped at the hotel a very nice gentleman came to our car immediately and took our bags and parked the car.  Everyone was so friendly and efficient.
I loved our room, it had a nice sofa in a little alcove to sit and relax in, after a day shopping (St Stephens Green is only 10 mins walking) and I loved the unfloor heating in the bathroom.  The beds are so comfortable, (I wanted to bring the mattress home).
Lots of choice for breakfast and everything is fresh and service was excellent.
I look forward to staying in this hotel again.
Its a real treat.",5,2009,03,17
208,Forget X Factor this hotel has WOW FACTOR,"Stayed in Dublin for two nights in February and I fell in love with this hotel. The service is second to none, the rooms are fantastic, the bar and resturant are out of this world.  Everything is just amazing I have never stayed anywhere where the saying the guest is always right rings so true. 
Breakfast to Movie Night in your room the attention to detail is amazing.   It is the hotel where you book in and wish you could stay forever, I cannot wait to return, definitely the best hotel in Dublin.
It is an amazing hotel with wonderful staff, I have recommended it to all my friends the best place I have ever stayed.",5,2009,03,03
208,Wow!  What a great find!,"This hotel is nestled in a ritzy little quiet neighborhood in Dublin.  It is incredible!  Trendy, elegant, and beautiful.  The rooms are awesome, not too big, but you can't beat heated tile floors in the bathroom, especially with the cold Dublin weather!

My wife and I were at first hoping that we could stay at the Ritz but unfortunately it was sold out during the dates we were going. (which we hear is breathtaking but way out of town anyway)

The Dylan is absolutely a great find if you are looking for a great trendy place to stay in Dublin.  This is very Wish in style with the same caliber service.  Simply great!  My wife and I were so pleased!  

p.s. ask for a corner room if you can.",5,2009,02,26
208,Valentines Getaway,"We had been looking forward to this break for quite a while & it was well worth the wait.  Arrival was smooth & simple.  We had lunch in the bar and loved the burger.  Dinner in the restaurant was a real treat.  They have a great value menu on at the moment for ‚Ç¨30 and it was fantastic.
After a lazy morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast and then for a walk down Baggot St.",5,2009,02,23
208,"Great stay, only a couple of minor issues","We stayed here in Feb 2009 - our first time in Dublin. We chose the DYLAN based on the reviews in TripAdvisor and we weren't disapointed overall but there were a couple of minor things that you should be aware of:

PRO's:
- location good - away from city centre - about a 15 min walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton St (we got the AirCoach from airport, not cheapest but fastest, costing 8 euros pp, - we were dropped off at the junction of Pembroke Rd and R118 so only a 10 min walk to hotel)
- good choice of local shops (Tesco, coffee shop, newsagents, etc. right around the corner), an ATM at the corner of the road, pubs (The Waterloo highly recommended) right around the corner, restaurants in walking distance (go to The Orchid down Pembroke Rd) if you don't fancy the hotel restaurant
- The hotel restaurant is excellent though - definitely worth a go, but 5-star prices to match!
- Stylish rooms, nice atmospheric bar, pleasant and helpful front desk and concierge
- Nice toiletries provided in bathroom
- MP3 player and Bose docking system provided in room with a good selection of music
- Free use of internet in reception area (allowed us to check in return flight on line and print boarding cards!)

CON's:
- When we arrived at 130pm, our room should have been available to us by 1pm. We had to wait around and in fact went in to the bar for a drink (which the hotel didn't offer to pay for by way of an apology). We did eventually get in to a room (not the room we were originnaly scheduled to take though!) by 215pm.
- Breakfast prices are high
- We stayed in Room #208 which was nicely decorated but had little daylight through a single balcony door - the view from the balcony was not particularly attractive (see photo)
- Noise can travel through the walls and corridors - we were both woken up on our last night by a guest in #209 choosing to open and close their room door continuously and letting it slam over and over again. Once a hotel member of staff came to assist the guest I felt compelled to make a comment. Whilst the hotel can't mitigate for other guests, the staff member should never have tried to undertake a placatory conversation at midnight outside the room in the corridor! Still worthly to note that noise does tend to travel through the nearby rooms, and we asked for a quiet room when we booked through expedia.

Overall a pleasant stay. We would recommend the hotel (but noting our concerns) and possibly stay there again should we go back to Dublin.",4,2009,02,19
208,great place,"I stayed at the end of January for a work conference.  I have previously stayed in the Fitzwilliam, Merrion, Four Seasons and Harrington Hall, and none had been special enough to have to return rather then try somewhere new.  So the Dylan was my choice.  The hotel is outside the main centre of Dublin but I saw this as a plus rather than a minus.  There are all the amenities and local pubs and a couple of chain eateries (Milano, Bagels etc) just around the corner.  The walk to Stephens Green is about 10 minutes.
Checkin was a bit strange.  Not sure why so many places now do ""personal checkins"" and ""in room checkin"" and other alternate styles.  Here the poor man on reception walked back and forth from the desk to me perched on a low sofa, with clipboards, wireless card terminals etc.  he kept a smile, but if I was him I would get tired of the process very quickly.  Just standing at a reception desk and signing in is so much easier and quicker.  But this is a personal point, and did not affect the service or friendliness I experienced.  I was shown to my room which was in the new wing.  It was small but had everything I needed.  My bags arrived 2 minutes later (nothing worse than sitting on a bed waiting for an hour for your bags - another pet hate of mine).  Very clean, with fluffy robes, slippers, powerful hairdryer.  Full range of TV channels, and a good table and chair to do some work.
There was no bath in the bathroom despite there being ample room, worth checking if you are bothered by these things.  
The vibe downstairs was always good - very friendly staff, very cool bar area and all nicely laid out.  Taxis when called arrived promptly.
I had breakfast in my room one of the days - it came exactly on time, although they did miss one of the things I had ordered.  The price was ridiculous really - there is a diner round the corner where you can get a full irish for 1/4 of the price.  Everything was very fresh and well presented, but more than 30 euros for some pastries, toast, fruit, tea and juice was silly pricing.  
The style is very baroque, but sensible and comfortable.  Not like Babington House for example where questionable style wins over convenience and comfort.  The bed was fine for me - fantastic sheets, and housekeeping was efficient and timely.
No complaints, there are always deals to be had on the rooms, and I had a lovely experience.  I would definitely stay here in Dublin again.",5,2009,02,12
208,Amazing!,"We spent 3 nights at Dylan and we had a fantastic experience. Everything was perfect, cosy, beautiful, charming, genuine...

Staff was very helpful and kind.

The bar make you feel you are a star! We spent actually 2 evenings at the bar enjoying the different rooms and styles. 

Dylan is at only 15 minutes walk from the very centre of Dublin and Temple bar area. 

While in Dublin, I suggest you to do the Hop on Hop off tour, the Jameson Whisky tour (very interesting) and definitely the literary pub crawl. This is a must, unless you do not like theatre, beer and Irish literature. The 2 actor-guides are simply amazing.

I will definitely be back in Dublin soon and also at Dylan.",5,2009,02,12
208,The best hotel in Dublin city centre!,"I love Dylan, i have stayed here many times, it is small and cosy and elegant.  The food is fantastic and the staff are sooooo friendly.  The rooms are so colourful and warm and they ahev all the facilities you would need!!! I love Dylan and I'm looking forward to going back soon!",5,2009,02,04
208,"excellent service, ok hotel","Good points: excellent service from staff, lovely bathroom, peaceful, pretty view across gardens, free WIFI in rooms

Bad points: bit of a walk to town, about 15 mins (but it is a nice, safe walk), bed too soft for us!, no kettle in the room... i do like my tea!, a bit too OTT baroque style

We got a good deal on this hotel, so the price was comparable to the bland Jury's etc hotels in Dublin centre.  Worth paying a bit extra for this hotel, but my max would be ‚Ç¨120 for this. 

The staff really are excellent, I absolutely cannot fault the service, and I don't think I have ever experienced better.",4,2009,01,15
208,Stylish and Luxurious,"The balance between being stylish and luxurious would appear to be a difficult one to get right e.g. The Sanderson in London. The Dylan successfully manages to offer well designed rooms and facilities as well as exceptional service and great attention to detail.
The location is not bang in the centre of Dublin but this hotel is a destination in itself for the excellent restaurant and bar. It's only a 10 mins walk from St Stephen's Green and therefore you're more likely to get a great night's sleep than some of the alternatives in the centre.   
From the welcome to the check out, the staff are really thoughtful and couldn't have been any more helpful. 
Despite the modern style of the hotel it is certainly not minimalist or alienating to anyone. I found the Dylan a fantastic place to stay in Dublin for the money.",5,2009,01,13
208,not 5 star,"Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site.
booked by phone and got better deal than on hotel web page.

however i was really disappointed with hotel.I dont know how it is rated as a five star.

booked style room and breakfast was included in package. for 209 per room

arrived to a reception that looked like a tempory work station with two laptops.
on our arrival husband was asked for credit card details eventhough i had previously booked with laser card. the receptionist asked him to key in his pin (which he could not remember )to process 350 euro charge.

when my husband asked why we were been charged 350 before we had even stayed and the price quoted to us was 209,receptionist said""in case you spend over the room charge in the bar etc""

My husband refused to validate it and receptionist said thats fine we would not charge you that anyway in your final bill.

I was shocked at how ordinary room was, i had previously stayed at G hotel and that was fabulous. 
receptionist said the style room was next room up from basic luxury room.I have stayed in nicer three star hotel rooms.

room was very clean,but boring lots of white paint and wood --no style!!!
lots of little touchs like ipod,mini bar etc all with a price tag.

went to look at restaurant menu,foie gras and truffle shavings!!!
decided to grab a burger in bar--over done burger!!!

great vibe in bar-really busy.
but discovered that terrace outside of bar was underneath our bedroom window so got no sleep till after one.

breakfast served till 11.we missed it -(own fault)and asked receptionist if we could purchase a coffee and croissant in hotel.She called waiter and said look after this couple,complimentary breakfast as they had included it in our package.

waited 10 mins to be served a pot of tea and six slices of slightly warm bread(toast?). 

never asked if we wanted coffee,sugar etc.
on their menu,they had scones and croissant that they could have offered us.

save your money,stay somewhere nicer and more reasonably priced.",3,2009,01,13
208,Amazing time at the Dylan!!,"My fiance and I travelled to the Dylan in Dublin 2 weeks before Christmas for a romantic break and I'm so pleased I found the Dylan.

The Dylan is an amazing boutqiue hotel set outside the main city in the best residential area of Dublin.  The main shopping area and restaurants, Temple Bar, River Liffey, Grafton St etc is about a 15-20 minute walk away but moments by taxi.  

The hotel is definitely a worth while stay with super friendly staff and an amazing concierge service.  They couldn't do enough by helping to select super restaurants and booking us taxis etc.

The hotel is incredibly stylish and contemporary with a funky twist and we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a Style bedroom . The bed was lovely and comfortable and the bathroom had a rain shower and a bath.  We were left complimentary chocolates and the minibar is fully stocked with all sorts of goodies - including karma sutra kits!  We had a nice garden view.  The bathroom has underfloor heating and they left us complimentary bottled water each night and little notes on our pillows which charming quotes!  Also in the room is a hairdryer and straightners an ipod and docking station and flat screen TV.  Lots of Dublin literature and magazines and bathrobe and slippers although my fiance had problems fitting in to his with his size 11's!

The restaurant appears lovely at first glance although we didn't eat here as we wanted to experience the restaurants on offer in the city.  The bar is amazing and definitely the place to be seen in Dublin!  Very young, trendy and elegant crowd sipping cocktails - the bar menu is also worth sampling.

We ate at One Pico on our first night which was incredible, the food, service etc. all highly recommended, a fine dining experience.  The second night we ate at Il Primo which is a lovely little italian bistro, very small and intimate but a perfect contrast to the previous night.  Good tasty food and wine and a romantic ambience.

We visited the Guiness Factory which is large and quite interesting although lots of stairs to climb to reach the free pint of guiness at the top - fab views from the 'very busy' look out bar though.

It was a really lovely break and the taxi drivers, of which we met many, were all terribly friendly and very chatty!  The traffic is at its busiest during the week and unlike London, much quieter at weekends as the Dubliners go out of town.  

The Dylan really made our break though as a luxury hotel it really hit the spot, highly recommended!!  We will absolutely return.

Downside: A small one but as our room was situated just by the lift area there was quite a lot of noise from other guests banging doors in the early hours of the morning!  Just discourteous guests or perhaps those door closers would be an added bonus!",5,2009,01,04
208,Great break in Dublin,"We picked the Dylan because of its great reviews on trip advisor. We were not disapointed.
The check in was very quick and we were quickly shown to our room.  We had 202 which has 2 aspects and looks over a little park.  The room was fantastic.  It looked brand new.  The bed was extremely comfortable and was turned down each night.  The bathoom was very spacious with a great rain shower.

The hotel is only 15 mons walk from the St Stephens Green so there are many different restaurants to choose from if you choose to eat outside the Dylan.
The Dylan has an extremely trendy bar and serves great cocktails. It is apparently the place to be in Dublin.  
The breakfast was extremely good.  The full Irish is one of the best cooked breakfasts we have ever had.
All in all a great place to stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish luxury hotel in Dublin",5,2008,12,29
208,"Stunning, the epitome of Irish style and hospitality","This hotel is the absolute picture of perfect modern Irish hospitality. Exquisitely restored, it is sumptuous without being vulgar, stylish without being fake, and fantastic without taking itself too seriously. Friendly, kind and genuine staff make you feel exceptionally welcome, and take care of every detail. The building itself is a sight to behold, it is a complete work of art, and really defies description. A perfect balance of modern irreverence, Irish build-craft, and international glamor, it just oozes confidence from every corner. We stayed in two different rooms, and each one was perfect in every detail. Opening up the beautiful door is like opening the lid of a jewelery box, everything inside glitters and just begs to be touched. The lighting is perfect, giving you bright task lights and an ambient cool glow in the evening. The ceilings, with beautiful natural wood beam inserts, are calming and warm, and the bathrooms packed with decadent toiletries you actually want to use. Valet parking puts away and retrieves you car in a heartbeat, room service is fast, and picking cool drinks from the massive bar menu is almost as much fun as drinking them in the sexiest bar ever. You feel like a rock star, a real one, not a tacky X-Factor winner massacring your favorite rock classics..! If you don't think this is the most brilliant hotel ever, don't embarrass yourself by telling everyone, the stunningly unique and joyful experience that is the Dylan has been wasted on you. But hey, cheer up! There are over 3800 Holiday Inn's worldwide, and many of them even have a free breakfast buffet.",5,2008,12,22
208,Some positives but not an experience to justify the cost,"We went on a mid-week break in December.  There were many positives; the food was excellent, the rooms were laid out very well and the staff were largely very helpful and attentive.

However, there were also some negatives; on our first night we set the aircon in our room; it turned out that it was faulty and was heating the room.  This only became clear at about 3am when the room reached over 30 degrees, I didn't fancy the upheavel of moving room at that time of night.  In the morning we complained and the impression I got from the reaction of the staff was that they knew there was a problem in advance of giving us the room but didn't want to put the room out of order.  They moved us into a room where one of the TV's didn't work although this didn't bother us very much.  At the end of the stay they tried to charge us the full price for the first night when I complained they took a bottle of wine off the bill which at around 10% of the nightly rate I said that I didn't believe this was adequate but it was the best they could offer.

Not an experience that justifies the price tag!",2,2008,12,15
208,Disapointing breakfast,"Our stay in the Dylan Dublin was ok, except for the breakfast that is very poor. There was  no bread, cheese, and just some cold cuts on Saturday and nothing except for some smoked salmon on Sunday. Besides that the breakfast room was not clean, as there were huge spider webs in the breakfast room (inside of the window).

Asking the staff for bread, cheese or cold cuts, it was as if the staff did not understand it...The English language skills of the staff during breakfast are very poor. 

A complain at the reception upon check out was heard but not even an apology followed. This is not the way it should be handled, especially if you claim to be a 5 star hotel

P.S. don‚Äôt bring the CD that is in the room, you‚Äôll be charged for it and the compilation does not run smoothly  it has some hick ups‚Ä¶

Staying at a 5 star hotel should be perfect, this was not. We will not stay there again, than we prefer staying in a 5 star hotel that offers 5 star services like the 4 seasons.",2,2008,12,13
208,Wow Factor,"I booked this hotel for a two day break for my partner's birthday. The minute I spoke to reception I knew we were in for a treat. The receptionist was professional yet welcoming and friendly. The whole hotel has the ""Wow Factor"" from the minute you walk through the door, and just oozes luxury. The whole interior design is amazing and it takes a while to take in all the  detail.  Our room was gorgeous, a tasteful mixture of comtemporary and decadence with a huge bed and seating area with a large flat screened tv mounted on a pole in the center of the room. You could swivel it around to view from the seating area, or from the bed, what an innovative idea!  There was an ipod dock, and complimentary music, thick good quality robes, large fluffy towels, and luxury toiletries.  The bathroom had a huge walk-in shower with side jets and deluge shower, a very large bath, and tv on the wall.  There was a turn-down service whereupon the bed was re-made, towels and toiletries were replaced and chocolates were left on the bed.  The bar was a treat, so was the service, the staff and breakfast, which consisted of a buffet of cerials, fresh fruit platter, yogurts, cold meats and smoked salmon, a good choice of juices, and excellent choice of hot dishes.  I am well travelled but can say hand on heart this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I can't fault it and can't wait to return.  Congratulations to the Dylan and all it's staff - a cut above the rest.",5,2008,12,10
208,Very unique and friendly Hotel,"I read about the Dylan hotel in the NY Times travel section and when  I checked out their website was hooked immediately. The Hotel is in a quiet location, yet fairly close to the city centre, the staff is extremely helpful and pleasant, our room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. We also enjoyed having drinks at the Hotel bar (they mix some mean martinis!). I certainly wouldn't mind going back in the future. If I absolutely had to find a flaw... maybe the buffet breakfast could use an overhaul.",4,2008,12,01
208,Perfection -well almost!,"Not usually the adventurous type, this did seem a curiousity hotel from the web and other TRip Advisor reviews, so the one night booking was made with some trepidation..... I need not have worried. Fabulous from the minute we stepped out of the car. A mix of new and old Dublin premises the candelit entrance draws you in straight away. Front desk staff treat you like you're the only valued customer in the world. Escorted to the room and shown all the facilties (including underfloor heating and how to work it!). Superbly presented room, bed was divine, iPod dock, courtesy umbrellas (for the Irish mist), everything to make it personal. Forgetting to pack the toothpaste was remedied by the front desk in minutes.

A few drinks in the friendly but discreet staffed bar, before the front desk staff went out of their way to try and book a treatment therapy for my wife in their sister hotel, Dunboyne Castle, over the course of the following days stay.

After a trip round the sights in Dublin, we returned to the room late on to find the flower petals spread on the bed and beautiful little chocolate owls. After a sound nights sleep breakfast was perfect, booking out faultless, and even allowed us to leave the car in the valet parking all day until we departed late afternoon.

Quite simply the most impressive hotel for detail, care and attention I have ever had the pleasure to stay in....but don't tell anyone as they'll all want to go there.

Now an inhouse pool/gym would have created perfection.....",5,2008,11,28
208,nice hotel,i stayed here for one night and enjoyed this hotel .the staff are excellent and were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.the rooms are large and very comfortable and clean.breakfast was good but not excellent.overall i could not find any faults with the hotel but i dont think i would stay here again as i would still make the raddisson at golden lane my first choice in dublin simply becuase it has a much better location and the breakfast is much better.both hotels are around the same price but getting a taxi in dublin at 2am is impossible !!...........you dont need a taxi when staying at the radisson,4,2008,11,17
208,Stay at the Dylan!,"My wife and I visited Ireland for the first time in October 2008. Our first stop was Dublin to run the Dublin Marathon (also our first ever marathon). We chose the Dylan based on the many positive reviews here on TripAdvisor.

Let me just say that this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We arrived at the hotel at 6am after coming in on a redeye. We had nowhere else to go so we went to the hotel thinking that the best we would be able to do is drop off our luggage and then roam the streets and find somewhere to eat breakfast and crash in the restaurant booth for a little while.

To our surprise, the front desk team located us a room and allowed us to check in AT 6 AM. It was an incredibly generous gesture considering check-in time is 3pm.

Our stay just got better from there. The room was very big (king size bed) and spotless. The bathroom was also very spacious including an oversized shower/tub.

We got room service many times and the food was perfect each time. A special shout-out to Patrick the concierge who helped our friends pick out a great wine/dessert gift that we discovered in our room one afternoon. Our friends said he was incredibly helpful and followed up with them via phone calls and emails until all the arrangements were completed.

The Dylan bar/lounge is also great - open 24 hours to hotel guests. We took advantage of that one fun night :).

The location of the Dylan is great and you are just around the corner from a bunch of pubs, shops, etc. and about a 25 minute walk to the city centre. There's also a great breakfast/coffee/espresso shop across the street.

The Dylan is a bit pricey, but I can honestly say that it was worth every Euro! Since our return, I have recommended the Dylan to all of our friends and recommend it to any of you looking for a great hotel in Dublin.",5,2008,11,14
208,Complete tranquility!!!!!,"I scoured the internet for a hotel to stay in whilst in Dublin. The trip was booked as a surprise for my husbands 40th birthday ,and I wanted to go to a hotel with a difference and boy did we get that.
The welcome we received on check-in was first class and the fact that Liz, the lovely lady on reception, took us to our room and made sure that everything was satisfactory and explained the service available to us made a great impression on us. 
The rooms are very plush and lavishly decorated with a great modern feel, and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was wonderful to feel on bare feet especially after spending six hours exploring Dublin City.
The food was superb and service in the bar and restaurant was exceptional and the fact that we saw two very famous boyband singers eating there kind of gave us an idea of just how highly rated the hotel is.
As a rule we would normally stay in the usual 5 star chain hotels but after our stay in the Dylan we've had a real eye opener and now know what the real meaning of 5 star is!!!!!!

Sarah, South Wales UK",5,2008,10,20
208,Ultimate experience,"Stayed in this hotel october 11.Words fail to describe this hotel you just have to stay there.From the moment you check in until you leave the staff here just cannot do enough for you and do it like its a pleasure for them rather than for you.When we checked in our room was not ready so they gave us an upgrade to a suite.When we saw the suite we were impressed to say the least it was beautifully appointed and had three tv,s even one set into wall in bathroom.The bar was equally impressive with beautiful decor and fantastic service.When we retired to the room the bed had been turned down and a chocolate and bottle of water had been left on each side of the bed .This kind of attention to detail and thoughtfulness is what sets the dylan apart.If you want somewhere special this is it without a doubt it is well well worth paying a little extra to stay here you will not be disappointed.This hotel is acredit to its management and staff and i look foreward to staying here again.",5,2008,10,12
208,Disappointing,"This was a very disappointing experience .
We arrived  mid afternoon and were intensely escorted to our room in the attic of the hotel . The room had a window but you had to stand on a lipstick stained sofa to see out . Stained and torn bed linen was to follow ............
We arrived back at 11.45p.m and requested a drink in the empty bar 35 mins later the night doorman  sorted our request I must say my husband could have pulled a better pint!!!!!
Anyway in the morning there was a power cut in our room when I was in the shower.My husband checked the fuse box with little luck .
We then showered in the dark and I mean dark .
Upon check we commented on the problem and the difficulty on requesting help when you are in the middle of a shower this was greeted by shrug of the non English speaking receptionist's
 shoulders and no apology . This wasn't the Irish hospitality I had expected .
Our previous  visit  to Dublin was to the Four Seasons and I can say my next visit will be to the Four Seasons where 5 star means 5 star !!!!",2,2008,09,27
208,Quite a Place,"The Dylan is really over the top.  The reception areas, bar, and restaurant were out of this world-like stepping into Wonderland.  The staff was friendly, and I thought they'd be snobby!  The room, however, is where the hotel really shone, with an amazingly comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom, tv on a swivel pole in the middle of the room, great desk, etc., etc.  We commented that it might be the most amenity rich room we'd ever stayed in.  Room service was divine.  There really isn't anything to complain about here if you go into it knowing it's a very contemporary, hip kind of place.  The only detractor was that the location just isn't very central, a good or bad thing depending on what you're in Dublin for.",5,2008,09,17
208,Dylan is faultless!,"Where do I start?! I booked the Dylan for our first wedding anniversary and although slightly worried about the distance from the centre, the bus stop was 1 mins walk away, so no problem there. 

I called the hotel the day before we arrived to arrange a few special extras. Strawberries and champagne on arrival plus a hot bath with rose petals. When we arrived the following day, I cancelled the bath as it was late and I didn't think we'd have time for it. Anyway, during our meal at the Still restaurant, I must have mentioned how tired the both of us were,because by the time we got back to our room, there was the hot bath free of charge!

We were upgraded on arrival to a 'style' room and my husband couldn't contain himself! ""This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in..."" he could have gone on for hours bless him. The decor may not be to everyone's taste, but I certainly enjoyed the effort they had gone to to design the room. The bed was huge (king I suspect), possibly too big unless shared with 2 more people!

The Still Restaurant is pure quality. The food was amazing and service impeccable. It's one of those places where everyone is well trained, happy to serve and also extremely attractive (sorry hubby!) They were kind to fit us in late in the evening (we'd only arrived at the hotel at 9pm) and serve us with the most succulent steaks they had. 

As it's a boutique hotel, there's obviously no pool area, but I think this may spoil it and attract families, which is not really the point of the hotel. Perfect for a romantic getaway. I hope to go there again in the future.",5,2008,09,13
208,Chic & Comfortable,"The Dylan provides a great combination in both style and comfort. Tucked away on a quiet residential street, the bar is a happening scene, but once you get to your room it quiet and comfortable.

Great room design and the beds are wonderful. The staff is as friendly and helpful as you'll find in Europe.

Go across the street for breakfast. They have great oatmeal",5,2008,09,07
208,Best in Dublin,"This hotel ticks all the right boxes. Top notch service, perfect rooms, the most amazing beds...best bet in dublin.",5,2008,09,05
208,Very nice but certainly not the best,"We only stayed for two nights, a Friday and Saturday.
 Our first room was average in size with a large bathroom but it had a view looking over the back of the kitchen and dustbins. We asked for another room if possible with a nicer view. We were offered another room with a lovely view but it was smaller all round which we took. Bed was comfortable but not huge and linen was top notch. The funky decor of the room was not to our taste but the bathroom was stylish and luxurious.
Apart from the beautiful, stunning yet  very comfortable  lime green and white lounge the rest of the public areas were again not to our taste-funky and dark and not very functional.   
All staff that we encountered were exceptionally friendly, efficient and professional.
We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was expensive but very good.
It was a good 20 minute walk into the centre of Dublin which was fine, we enjoyed the stroll.",4,2008,09,03
208,Perfect stay at the Dylan,"Fantastic and professional welcome set the tone for our 5 day stay at the Dylan . The hotel is located a 12 minute walk from the heart of Dublin on a quiet street.  The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The outdoor terasse is a great place to unwind at the end of the day and the bar has great atmosphere, music and a lively crowd until later in the evening.Definitely recommended.",5,2008,09,02
208,Dylan Excellence,"This is the second time I have stayed and yet again the room, service, food and staff are second to none.  One of the best kept secrets in Dublin and one hotel that I will return to again and again.",5,2008,09,01
208,hip hotel with heated bathroom floors,"Let me clarify that if my rating scale were only for England/Ireland, this would merit a 5.  However, I'm comparing the Dylan to hotels across the world.

This is a hip hotel with creative decor - not your standard-issue room or furniture.  We especially liked the heated tile floors in the bathroom, as well as the heated towel racks.  Our room was quiet and had a comfortable bed.  Internet access is free.

I also liked the downstairs library, which was a good place to hang when I was up in the middle of the night from jetlag.  We didn't go to the bar, but we saw that the prices were only slightly higher than nearby pubs.

The Dylan is within walking distance of a main street that has many restaurants, pubs and stores.  The main tourist sites are a bit of a hike - but still do-able if you like long walks.  I'd avoid the expensive hotel breakfast and walk down the street for cheaper fare.",4,2008,08,31
208,everything and more!,"We stayed at the Dylan for one night during a 10 day trip to Ireland.  The staff was fabulous, gave us the history of the place and of our room style when we checked in. If you go the Dylan website, you can specify the temperature you want your room to be when you check in. 18 degrees it was! they have great bath products and a fantastic shower. The iPod stereo in the room was perfect, espeically since we forgot our chargers when we packed. Yes, it is a little pricey, however if you want an ultra hip hotel that is not pretentious, then this is your place. the staff genuinely seemed like they loved what they did and wanted you to love the hotel as much as they did. Cheers to that.",5,2008,08,24
208,Ultra hip and sexy,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights and loved every second. The decor is simply amazing. Striking colors, Alice in Wonderland-type feel mixed with hip upscale looks too.  Heated bathroom floors, Voss water delivered at night. Everything was so romantic from the ""pleasure kit"" in the mini-bar to the mirrors to the super comfortable bed. What impressed us as well was how eager the staff was to meet any request we had. We loved Simon at the bar - best bartender we met in Ireland. We liked that it was on a quieter sidestreet and we didn't mind the 15 min. walk to downtown. Enjoy!",5,2008,08,17
208,all design,"Incredible design in the rooms as well as in the reception. Lots of technology. Caring and helpful staff. A very nice hotel, we've really enjoy our stay there.",4,2008,08,16
208,Amazing hotel,"We booked the Dylan after reading reviews on this website and doing a lot of research...and we were not disappointed. After reading that you are not guarenteed a bath in the Luxury rooms we decided to stay in a Style room, and it was definitely worth it! 

The room was very spacious with a huge, comfortable bed ( I had the best night sleep ever), a large dressing table and mirror (complete with plasma TV, iPod and B&O phone), a table and chairs and a large mirrored wardrobe. The fixtures in the room were stunning and really unique. Even the carpet was really luxurious! 

The bathroom was fairly small but perfectly formed with underfloor heating, which could easily be turned off if it got too hot. The bath was absolutely enormous, definitely big enough for two! 

Of course the decoration throughout the whole hotel was amazing, and guests can use the beautiful library, bar area or terrace. I think the highlight was how we were treated there. We are only 19 and turned up wearing jeans but we were always treated with respect and nothing seemed too much for the staff. I had forgotten tothpaste and they provided a tube of Colgate at no extra charge, delivered to the door within a minute. The picture on our TV also went a bit wrong and within 5 minutes that was sorted out. The turndown service, with complimentary Voss water, chocolate and note was a lovely touch, as were the chocolate brownies on arrival. Even the complementary slippers were very comfortable!

Yes, the hotel is expensive, but you get what you pay for. The only slight negatives are at night there was a little bit of noise from the bar, but not too much and it was only about 11pm, and the location is about a 20 minute walk to Grafton Street, but the hotel will book you a taxi (15 euro to the centre in rush hour), or provide you with a large hotel umbrella. We discovered on our last day you can catch the number 10 bus from the main road for 1.05 euro, which takes you all through the city centre. 

I will definitely be returning!",5,2008,08,14
208,Kitch and noisy,"Nice place but a bit too far from center town, staff very kind and ready to help. The room was small, the furnishing really kitch with colors like a '80 disco, all very clean. We stayed three nights but unfortunately with a room on the road side, be careful if doesn't rain the party goes on at the bar and you can forget to sleep. The fact you have a good hi-fi in your room is positive, the problem is when the guest of the room next to you like loud music... Next time we'll be in Dublin we will try other hotels. Is the first time I totally disagree with the comments of other guests. Our low rate is due to the quality/price connection",2,2008,08,12
208,Loved this hotel,"We stayed at Dylans on the first night of our Honeymoon. This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff couldn't do enough for us from the minute we walked in, they were friendly and attentive. Our room wasn't quite ready so we sat outside and had a drink. The bar has a really chilled out good atmosphere and the food was lovely and fresh.

We then got taken to our room with the biggest most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. 

Later we had the bath experience with strawberries and champagne which was very romantic and relaxing. 

The breakfast was lovely, with a real choice and friendly attentive staff. I couldn't recommend this hotel more to anyone looking for a five star experience with friendly staff and a very chilled out atmosphere.

I hope to stay again soon,
Sarah Ness",5,2008,07,30
208,Amazing,"I arranged this trip quite a whileago as a surprise for my husbands 30th. I was probably a bit neurotic, to the point of annoying, in wanting everything to be perfect so sent millions of emaikls to the hotel.  Their replies were always swift and never made me feel like I was being a pain!!
We were urgraded to an experience room, which was fab and had the b ubble up package on our first night - champagne and strawbrries in our room and rose petals. 
The room was beautiful and the bed was the best I have ever slept in.  The bathroom was stylish, although bath not big enough for 2!
The staff were brilliant especially Simon who received dozens of emails from me.
The meal in still was lovely if a little expensive but the whole trip was one of indulgence so we didn't mind.  
Strawberry daquiri's in the bar were to die for and I coud've happily drank more of them 
Have read reviews that the bar is expensive- having spent the afternoon in the temple bar area, we found no difference -you have to be rich to drink in Dublin!
I would love to return to this hotel I am dropping sledge hammer like hints to my hubby to repay the favour for my 30th 

Definitely reccommend this hotel",5,2008,07,26
208,Recommended!,"Went for a weekend break with my boyfriend last weekend - and we were both very impressed with the Dylan. Obviously still very new, trendy, cool decor in rooms and bar, staff extremely helpful and attentive. Overall had a great stay - and from walking round Dublin I can't think of anywhere else I would rather stay when visiting the city. Situated in a lovely area as well, off the main streets, leafy and quiet. Perfect to escape the tourist hubub of the city centre.

Only tiny tiny quibble was with breakfast - watch out, it's not included and make the most of it, or you will get charged full whack even if you barely have anything ;)

Apart from that - definitely recommeded, especially for young couples.",5,2008,07,25
208,Great little boutique hotel,"We finally arrived at the Dylan Hotel. It has changed both ownership and name in the past year, so the cab drivers in Dublin were unsure at first as to the location. The hotel‚Äôs staff was very accommodating and helpful in answering all of our questions and providing suggestions for dinner etc. 

The hotel halls are dimly lit. The rooms were very modern, equipped with flat screen televisions and many, many channels!  The rooms are not large by any stretch, but very comfortable. The shower in the bathroom was great! A rain shower with side jets to boot! 

We stayed one night and were sad to move on. I would love to go back again. 

Most things were within walking distance. We were quite far from the Temple Bar area, but Grafton St., St. Stephens Green and lots of places to dine were close by!",4,2008,07,24
208,Fabulous........10 out of 10,"I stayed at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin last night. My room was elegant, stylish and luxurious. The staff were very curteous, helpful and went out of their way without being overbearing. 

The decor in my room and all of the various downstairs was fabulous - I would happily have taken any of it home.

I didnt eat in the restaurant but the bar menu is fab, with one of the best cocktail lists I have seen.

I will definately be returning to the Dylan and cant recommend it highly enough.",5,2008,07,17
208,You don't understand,"I was meant to live at the Dylan.  This is the ultimate experience.  The staff is beyond exceptional. We had a great room with a little balcony.  It was like being ""Alice in Wonderland.""  The hotel is spotless, chic,  the rooms very comfortable and staff is always there to help. We stayed for 3 incredible nights.  We had a very early check-out and it was so nice to have a breakfast tray delivered to our room.  Am I going back, I have no doubt.  The best part, after returning to work after 16 fabulous days in Ireland, my husband called to see if I had booked us back for 2009.   We highly suggest you put this on your ""top 10 list of places to stay"" and do it soon!",5,2008,07,14
208,Boutique on a quiet side street,"Very attentive staff, super clean and comfortable rooms, and off-beat decor, made this a really great place to stay.

We stayed another night at The Clarence, and would be hard pressed to recommend one over the other.

The only thing worth noting is that this a bit off the beaten path of the Temple Bar area (why we chose it, and would choose it again).",4,2008,07,10
208,Absolutely Amazing,"Well i booked this hotel for a surprise treat for my boyfriend's 21st birthday and it was so so bloody amazing! We got a free upgrade to one of the best rooms in the hotel which was actually a suite with 3 plasma tvs among other things! even one in the bathroom! I had asked for champagne and strawberries to be sent up to the room but unfortunately they didn't turn up. but once i had been down to reception and mentioned it, they were so apologetic and sent them up for free as well as some surprise chococlate dipped strawberries later on in the evening. The staff couldn't do enough for us and we felt like royalty! we arent the normal type of people who stay in 5 star hotels (students from up north) but we felt very welcomed.
I wouold recommend this hotel to anybody! it is in a quiet part of dublin, 5 minute taxi ride away. quite a long walk really but would be good if nice weather. it cost about 5 -7 euros to do the journey using the city taxis but more like 12-16 euros if using the taxis arranged for you by the hotel.
i cant stress enough how beautiful the hotel was and it was such value for money in an expensive city!
go, go, GO!",5,2008,07,07
208,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, beautiful decor, very attentive and personal staff!  Close walking distance to Grafton St. and the Temple Bar area but in a quiet neighborhood.  Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2008,07,07
208,The Dylan was amazing!!,My husband and I stayed at the Dylan during our European vacation. It was amazing. The style is very unique and is like no other. The staff was more than accomodating with helping us book dinner reservations and anything else we needed. An excellent choice for Dublin!,5,2008,07,05
208,Ultimate Unique Hotel for Couples,"My boyfriend and I had 5 days to totally relax and unwind....so we booked the Dylan because of it's luxury, good location and as an ideal place to be away in a couple's environment (no kids!).
The location was further away from the city centre than I'd hoped but it was such an easy walk in and only took 15 mins to get to Grafton St. 
The staff were fantastic, on our arrival we were greeted by staff who took our cases from the taxi and immediately whisked it off to our rooms whilst we had a drink in the bar and soaked up our surroundings.
Our room (115) was decorated very uniquely and we could not find fault with it except the lack of tea and coffee making facilities.....that and the fact that the room next door had a door that slammed and nearly drove me to distraction especially when being woken up at 3 am by our noisy neighbours!
The staff accomodated absolutely everything we asked for......a bucket of ice from the minute we called to it's arrival was less than 3 mins.....and the request for an ironing board was even less in arrival time!
We ate in the hotel once and it's was an outstanding meal....Matt the head of the restaurant for the evening was extremely knowledgeable on wines and we found the waiting staff's knowledge of the menu excellant.
Overall, this hotel was outstanding and obviously very expensive.....but I was not in the least disappointed by it or it's staff.
On returning to Dublin I would not stay here  again as I feel that it is a special occasions venue that I'd like to keep as a unique first stay in Dublin. If you have the cash and want to stay away from hoards of tourists and children......I'd definitely recommend it......perfect for honeymooners who have only a few days!",5,2008,06,30
208,Absolutely Loved This Hotel!,"I booked the Dylan as a birthday present for my husband,we stayed for 2 nights checked in on the 25th and out on the 27th june,i wanted a hotel close to the centre as i had also booked us to see Riverdance at the Gaiety theatre on the Wednesday evening! Which i must add was out of this world!!
We flew in with Ryanair,my first time flying with them and i have to say they were very good,dead on schedule there and back..
On the way to Dylan the cab driver informed us that the hotel was in the better part of Dublin,we checked out on the Friday morning but aparantly at the weekend Dylan is the place for everybody,even the rich and famous to go to,they all hit the bar and hang out there,aparantly its the place to be at the weekend..
Ok so on arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the delightful staff who i must add were just lovely,we were shown to our room by Maddison who was an angel,she was extremely helpful and really nice,in fact all of the staff there seemed genuinely nice and pleasant,they all seem to know your name as soon as you have checked in,and all cannot do enough to help..we decided to walk into town,it was a lovely day when we arrived so we had a lovely walk this took around 15 minutes and is literally just on one straight road as you walk around the corner from the hotel..
On our first evening after seeing the show we were told by the cab driver to check out some of the trendy bars down Dawson street,we went to one called Cafe En Seine,we had a great time,this place is huge and very trendy,before we new it it was 2am so we left and headed back to the hotel,the second evening we went for dinner at a restaurant called Hugo's,we had a lovely meal though i do recomend booking,the hotel were great and will do this for you at your request,though if your a beer drinker avoid avoid avoid! they dont sell any beer at all.. even though we had a great time and a lovely meal..after dinner we went literally across the road to a couple of irish pubs one called o'donoghues where they played live music and you really new you were in Dublin being here it was great,we then went to another one across the road which was great fun and the staff were lovely,though i cant remember the name by this time i had had far to much guiness.
All in all we had a fantastic stay,the hotel was just lovely,it is very modern and trendy we stayed in room 103 and loved it..the only thing is it does not have a gym or spa or swimming pool,it is a small boutique hotel.But if you want any of these facilities they are not to far away and reception will advice or book you into your every need they can not do enough for you..",5,2008,06,28
208,A boutique gem,"A lovely boutique hotel - decor may not be to everyones taste
but it is a great hotel for those that like something a little different.
Very clean and comfortable. Bar and Restaurant lovely (but quite pricey !) Location 5 minutes taxi (15 mins walk) from centre of Dublin. Would recommend for a special weekend away.
There is also a great cafe opposite for breakfasts.",5,2008,06,23
208,If you like Malmaison you'll love Dylan,"An excellent hotel, if there was a malmaison in Ireland this would probably top it!    We stayed here for my husband's 50th birthday.   I rang the hotel before we arrived to organise some surprise balloons and cake on arrival  they had upgraded us to one of their experience suites.    The room was lovely, soft duvets, large bathroom with a TV in the wall! 

The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  We didn't eat in the restuarant, but we did have a few of the divine cocktails from the bar.    At night this hotel is where society people from Dublin come to chill out and it is a fun happening place.

It is about 20 minutes walk from Temple Bar, but its benefit is that it is in a quiet location, so you can get away from the noise after a big night out and relax.    There is also two or three good restuarants and another trendy bar within 5-10 minutes of the hotel.

Only one small complaint - as in all european hotels there was no coffee making facilities and  room service tea was a little pricey at 12 euros a throw!",5,2008,06,17
208,Good but very overpriced,"Stayed here recently on business for one night. Hotel is very stylish there is no doubt and the staff were very friendly. The lady at reception was very pleasent, even escorted me to my room, walked me into it and showed me how the phone worked. Bizarre I thought. Decor is good, very clean but awful chairs, very uncomfortable. Nice touch of taking out the robe/slippers and leaving out some water for you in the evening.

Food is ridiculously bad however. As a food critic, I have never experienced such pointless extravagence on a plate. The prices are outrageous and in no way reflect the standard of food provided. In ""In room dining"" menu is hugely expensive and very very tasteless. A bizarre menu/pricelist ruins what otherwise is a very good hotel.",3,2008,06,16
208,"Amazing, Stylish Hotel, Highly Recommend it!","Stayed for one night June 2008... 

This is truly a magnificent and beautiful hotel. The design is modern and unique. The bar and restaurant looked cool and trendy, but unfortunately we had already made plans for dinner elsewhere, so I'll be back to try the restaurant another time. Even the corridors leading to the rooms are stylish and full of character. The attention to detail and excellent service was evident throughout my stay. The staff really can't do enough to ensure a pleasant experience, and its clear that they take pride in the hotel. They were helpful and polite but also discreet. We stayed in a 'Style Room' - it was spacious and luxurious and immaculately clean, with the most comfortable bed, flat screen tv, stylish phone and ipod with docking station... I had pre-ordered drinks to the room when i booked the room online, and on arrival we found the bottles waiting in an ice-bucket for us. This was a really nice touch. There is also a fully stocked mini-bar with a few extra treats, but knowing how expensive such items can be, I resisted the temptation to open anything! There are quite a few shops on nearby Baggot Street, if you wanted to take a walk and buy some snacks or drinks yourself it would be a cheaper alternative. The bathroom had heated tiles, and a powerful hot shower, double sinks, and really nice products. We did not hear a sound from other rooms or the corridor during our stay, the hotel feels very private and quiet. Breakfast was served to the room the next morning, it was hot and tasted good. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Dylan hotel, and wished that I could have stayed for another night! If you'd like to indulge yourself and experience an amazing hotel, i'd recommend it. Their website gives a good indication of the quality you will experience at the hotel.",5,2008,06,09
208,Relaxed extravagance!,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights after new year. The Dylan was the perfect antidote to the bustle and cold of the January sales. The staff were unobtrusive but extremely helpful, even coming up with a set of GHDs for my girlfriend.
The decor is opulent and there are a couple of especially nice touches: the library / tv room and the outdoor seating / smoking area with 2 large plasma screens for watching sport.
Needless to say the breakfast was great and the bar was both well stocked and expertly manned, even at 3.30am!",4,2008,06,08
208,Wonderful place.,"What a wonderful place!  Our three-night stay was fabulous.  The staff is superb, the decor is like a fantasy has come to life, and the designer's attention to detail is amazing.  In the Dylan, the expert lobby staff makes each guest feel welcome and relaxed.  We dealt with two lovely ladies in Reception and one eagle-eyed doorman, and each one made us feel that our needs were his or her primary concern.  Housekeeping is terrific.  A thoroughly great experience.  Worth every dime.",5,2008,06,02
208,Loved the Decadent Dylan!,"We spent 3 short nights in Dublin, and couldn't imagine a better hotel. I had contacted the concierge prior to arriving because we were coming in from an overnight flight and were really hoping to be able to check in early. The Dylan allowed us to check in at 7am!!! This is unheard of! We were so pleasantly surprised and grateful to get into our funky, modern room right away and take a long nap!
The location is set back from all the action, about a 15 minute walk..and we really liked the feel of having our own little neighborhood. There is a great cafe directly across the street for a much less expensive breakfast, and a school with a playground next to the hotel which gives it a very local, safe feel. 
Loved the Dylan! Definitely recommend it!!",4,2008,05,29
208,Pure Class,"I booked the Dylan as a birthday surprise for my other half, as it looked stunning and had such great reviews on this site.  

The concierge service and welcome was so friendly and the hotel is just so lush.  Gorgeous decor, really funky design and obviously money has been spent to make it just right.  

The best thing were all the little touches throughout the stay such as bottled water and chocolates with a little card on your pillow each night, a welcome card saying happy birthday to my other half and when I asked for hair straighteners, a choice of curling tongs or straighteners brought to the room in about 10 minutes!

I had put on the online booking form that it was a birthday weekend away, and on arrival we were upgraded to a Style room, which was gorgeous, and had delicious brownies waiting for us in the room.  The bathroom had under-floor heating and the bed was huge and soo comfortable we had a hard job getting up!

Throughout the stay staff were really friendly and helpful, even offering to book our Guinness brewery tour online for us, as you save 10% and beat the queues.  The service and food in the bar was great too.  

The only slight downside is that you are a little out of town - it's about a 5-10 minute taxi ride to the Temple Bar area, which costs about 10 Euro, otherwise in daytime buses run from Upper Baggot Street nearby, which are 1.05 Euro each for the same trip.  It's a bit of a walk otherwise and maybe we are just lazy but we only did it once.  It's a really minor point though as the hotel is so lovely it makes up for it, and there's no chance of being disturbed by rowdy stag / hen parties passing after pubs close!

I had initially reserved another Dublin boutique hotel but after the seeing terrible reviews it had on this site changed my mind and booked the Dylan and I'm so glad I did.  If you can afford it I would definately recommend staying there, but it certainly isn't cheap!  It was my first boutique hotel experience and any other big chain hotel will have to go a long way to beat this.  We didn't want to leave!",5,2008,05,28
208,A fabulous place for looking around the city,"This is an amazing hotel.  The room we stayed in wasn't the biggest ,but the facilities were excellent.  Loved the ipod in the room with great tunes.  The whole hotel is beautifully designed every detail has been thought through.  The breakfast was fab especially the chairs!!  A real chic retreat!!",5,2008,05,27
208,stylish city oasis,"Had a fabulous weekend break in the Dylan. Staff very helpful. Had booked 2 rooms for 1 night instead of 1 room for 2 nights - no problem  - staff changed everything and gave us a beautiful room. Room spacious with lots of mirrors though could do with more lighting. 
Breakfast fabulous, extensive menu - we didn't need lunch.
Within walking distance of main shopping area. Staff happy to book restaurants/taxi etc.
We will be returning & recommending it to our friends",5,2008,05,27
208,Lives up to expectations,"I've just returned from a great trip in Ireland. We stayed at the Dylan since we thought it would suit our taste and the hotel did not disappoint. Note that it is a bit far from the main attractions (e.g. Temple bar) but if you are lucky and the weather is nice, it is not an unpleasant walk (about 20 minutes). The design of the hotel is somewhat overwhelming,..very post-modern with a lot of 'baroque' details and bright colour schemes. The breakfast room (also a restaurant at dinner time but I did not try it) is all white, flooded with light - it  guarantees a cheerful start of the day. BTW, a note on the breakfast buffet: not the most imaginative I've seen.
Overall the hotel looks stunning now, but I wonder how quickly its design will date. In any case, even if you are not staying at this hotel, it's definitely worth checking out the bar on a Friday night when it buzzes with a very beautiful, young crowd. Also good on a sunny day is the little terrace at the back, where we had a great club sandwich with our pint of Guinness.",5,2008,05,27
208,Wonderful Dylan,"We stayed at Dylan as part of a company incentive trip.  Dylan lived up to our expectations and more.  The staff are lovely, and went out of their way to be helpful.  Its most unusual to find a hotel bar so busy with non-residents, but Dylan is a very popular place for cocktails and the bar gets very busy at the weekends.  

The hotel rooms were very comfortable, althought the bathrooms a bit small.  Breakfast was great as were the cocktails.

I honestly can't find a single fault with this hotel.",5,2008,05,26
208,A Splendid Boutique Hotel - Great Design and Wonderful Service,"Exquisite boutique hotel off the away from the crush of tourists. My husband and I were delighted with our stay... a comfortable bed, roomy bathroom with television built into wall (to watch while soaking in the tub), very spacious, quirky and fun decor. It's perfect for travelers who enjoy eclectic design and pampering. If you want a sedate, predictable environment, The Dylan probably isn't for you. Our room overlooked the hotel terrace/entrance, but no matter how busy it was below our room was very quiet. Morning wake-up calls included an invitation, ""Would you care for orange juice?,"" which we gladly accepted. The concierge and other staff went way above and beyond helping us try to find a souvenir for our son - hats off to Z! We didn't dine in the hotel, but the restaurant and bar were very busy. We'd gladly stay here again.",5,2008,05,25
208,Great cocktails,"Dylan is tucked away in a quiet part of Dublin. About 20 mins walk from the main attractions.
The service levels from the staff are very good - whilst the concierge wasn't a 'native', he did have a good knowledge of the surrounding area and was able to help us with local info.

We stayed 2 nights in a 'style room', which was light and airy and overlooked a small courtyard. The room itself was furnished well including a pre-loaded ipod. The in-room minibar didn't actually keep anything cool and was wildly overpriced (as are many other boutique hotels); although we did have a laugh at the kama-sutra kit and condoms that were available to purchase !

The bed was very large and despite being touted as having one of the best matresses available, I found it way too soft and hot to sleep on. 

On the first night we ate in the Still restaurant. We both had the 5 course taster menu. The food was good, but it lacked the final finesse and the seasoning was a little hit and miss. The sommelier made some excellent choices with the wine and obviously had been briefed well on the flavours of the food. In fact, she was one of the best I've seen. Between us, we had 2 taster meals, 2 half bottles of reasonably priced wine and one desert wine - this came to 370 Euro - about 100 euro too much in my opinion.

The second night we had drinks in the bar in the small courtyard outside. The cocktails and service were again excellent. The only thing I would say is that the number of seats are restricted - so if it is a nice night, get out there early ! 

Overall the hotel was 'good' but not 'superstar status', I don't want to sound too negative as the hotel is definately amongst the top 5%, but for me it just lacked that little extra for the money that was being paid. Would I stay here again ? I would probably look elsewhere first and if another top end hotel wasn't available then I'd come back. Would I eat here again ? No - overpriced and not quite there.",4,2008,05,22
208,Only Ok Unfortunately,"Stayed at the beginning of May for my boyfriend's birthday and although the hotel was lovely and very classy, we were treated in a rather odd way, perhaps as we are only 22 and were both wearing jeans! From the outset we were treated in quite an off hand manner, certainly nothing like people have been saying on here, worse luck for us.  We had to wait 20 minutes for our room, then were shown to the wrong one and it was only on us telephoning down to ask where the celebratory beers were that we had asked for were, that we were told we were in the wrong room - no apology!  It seems that not everyone's money is the same.  I have been so so lucky to stay in some fabulous hotels and I must say this one had a very odd and uncomfortable atmosphere to it, I wish I hadn't wasted my money.",2,2008,05,12
208,"Glitzy, but lacking charm.","The Dylan Hotel is without doubt a top hotel, and if you like to stay in a glitzy designer wonderland and rub shoulders with the rich & famous, wannabee WAG's etc it is the place to stay.

We ""splashed out"" to stay at this hotel but frankly I found it a bit soul-less and I have truthfully stayed in better for a lot less (but perhaps not in Dublin). 

Service was great, staff were attentive, helpful and courteous.

Strangely though I ended up taking a dislike to some of the other guests. Ok so they had paid for the experience, but the sight of people who were unencumbered and perfectly fit and able standing  at the entrance to the bar waiting while a porter or concierge walked across the lobby just so they didn't have to open a door was ridiculous. Also despite being told that if the bar was crowded guests could always use the residents only lounge, when my wife went in to the lounge she was told very curtly by some spoilt debutante that ""this room is booked"".

So,

A good hotel - absolutely!
Great Service - you bet!
Expensive - don't even ask!
Would I stay again - No way - it's just not my scene.",4,2008,05,09
208,The Dylan was supurb,"The Dylan Hotel is outstanding.  The service is impeccable.
The decor is interesting and cutting edge.  No detail was
left undone.

I am a single woman who just turned 60 in January and
the trip was a gift from my children. From the time I arrived, the service was wonderful.
I  was treated like the Queen of England and loved every
minute of it.

I am a decorator and found the furnishings to be a blend of modern, art deco and Rococo.
The colors were both upbeat and soothing. You would have
to experience the decor to appreciate it's exquisiteness.
Each room was decorated so beautifully and the linens
were fabulous.

The staff was delightful.  Patrick, the head concierge was
charming, attentive and sincere.  He was a plus to the
overall experience.  All of the staff were attentive.
I particulary enjoyed Z, Simon and Martin.  IF I forgot a name,
I am truly sorry.  

The location of the hotel was ideal.  In the evening, I took
walks and found the area lovely. MY walk to the center
of town everyday was most enjoyable.

There is nothing about the Dylan I would change.
I recommend it as the BEST HOTEL IN DUBLIN.

Sincerely,

208,Our Days at the Dylan,"We stayed at the Dylan for three nights in April.  This hotel has a very hip, young and ""designery"" vibe, particularly in the common areas, however, the rooms are appropriately toned down and restful.  The staff was helpful, polite and well-informed.  The bar is great, but expensive, which is to be expected in these sorts of cool boutique hotels.  The only negative I noticed was that it is a hike (we walked everywhere) from the Dylan to the areas where most American tourists will head (i.e., Grafton Street, Temple Bar, the museums, etc.)  So in a sense, the Dylan's location is not a negative, because the area is far more upscale and un-touristy than the locations of many other popular hotels.   All in all, I would recommend this hotel to people falling in the 18-35 age group and for any ""older"" folks who are young at heart.",4,2008,05,01
208,Beautiful hotel !!,"Stayed here for 2 x nights and must say its one of the nicest hotels I have been in ,. so modern clean and the food was delicious ! Cant recommend highly enough !",5,2008,05,01
208,Great hotel in a great neighborhood!,"The Dylan is definitely a cozy, trendy hotel to stay at.  The room was small but comfy.  The service was great, and the people very friendly.  It is a little out of the way, so make sure you know where it is.  Our cab driver from the airport didn't know exactly where it was, and he was making me a bit crazy, driving like a maniac, while typing it into his GPS (which the Dylan is not on).  

It is pretty pricey, though.  But it is in the poshest neighborhood in Dublin.  The only reason I didn't select an excellent rating, is that I think you could get more for the money.

Forget room service.  They charge 30 Euro for breakfast.  There is a great Espresso Bar across the street.  You can get a great breakfast there for about 10.",4,2008,04,29
208,Hip and Fabulous at the Dylan,"Just arrived hom from an 8 day stay at the Dylan hotel.  In a word-fantastic!  The hotel is about 35 minutes from the airport and about a 15 minute walk to the shops on Grafton Street and Trinity University.  Since my friend and I traveled all over, we had to go to Heuston Station (15 minutes away) Busaras Bus Station (20 minutes away) as well.  The front desk was always happy to arrange a taxi for us each time we needed one.  I also spoke with the hotel (via email) about restaurants and transportation before we arrived there and they were prompt and helpful.

Rooms:
Rooms were immaculate and very well decorated.  The bathroom had two sinks, a shower stall and a pretty large tub.  There was a GREAT hairdryrer in the room (which is huge for me) and toiletries in fairly large sizes (although I didn't care for the scent).  They had a flat screen TV and a large door to a fake balcony, but it allowed plenty of air inside the room.  There was no alarm clock, but there was a Bose system with an ipod with a variety of music.  I brought my own Ipod, and was able to enjoy my own music while there.

Service:
Service was impeccable except for the one night we asked for ice for my friend's foot and they forgot.  Other than that, the front desk was helpful, wake up calls were always on time.  Turndown service was lovely (with Dylan's Candy chocolates and water).

Bars/Restaurant
The bar is pretty hoppin' on Fridays and Saturdays, but prepare to PAY for your drinks.  If you are traveling from the US, the dollar is lower than the Euro, so what might cost you $9 in the US is going to cost you about $14.  A bar bill for 4 drinks ended up being about 70 Euro (almost $100).  However, the bar was clean, fun, and the bartenders were great.  Since we only ate in the restaurant for breakfast, again, it cost us a fortune, but the food was excellent.  Again, the service was lovely.

Location:
The hotel was close to everything, and on a very quiet block.  Although Taxi was necessary to bus,trains and airport, you could walk even around the corner and stumble upon a Tesco (like a supermarket) and some bars/restaurants.

Pros:
Great location
well decorated
fun bar
good food
excellent service
Irish paper every day
fantastic hairdryer
24 hour room service
wonderful decor

Cons:
no gym on premises
only one restaurant
food an drinks a bit pricey
no spa on premises

All in all, I would definitely stay here again.  It's not a good hotel for families, since the bar is usually busy pretty late, and there is not much for kids to do.  I also do not believe that they have any rooms with double beds.  My friend and I just shared the king, we never bothered to ask for doubles since we didn't spend too much time in the room.
Also, there was a mistake on our bill and they fixed it immediately, my friend and I also had some difficulty making a local call and the front desk immediately confirmed a tour for us and left all the information in our room for us without being asked.  What a great place!
Tip:  Check out the bar around the corner for a great after work crowd and the restaurant across the street  (Expresso) for a nice Irish cheese appetizer that's to die for!",5,2008,04,28
208,Fantastic Experience,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel in january for a weekend break. The overall experience was fantastic. The service during all the meals was second to none. The staff were very friendly and courteous. More importantly seemed to enjoy their jobs. The wine list is very extensive. The waitress recommended a beautiful bottle of wine to me. 

One of the customers recommended the castle bar to try the new galway hooker ale. I was quite impressed as i normally would not drink ale. 

I was not surprised to see it rated as number 2 in trip advisor for Dublin hotels. I think it deserves to be number 1. As they have a good product in a good location with great service. What more do you want.",5,2008,04,16
208,Classy chic and modern,"We stayed here for 1 night thinking it was the best that Dublin had to offer and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is very small and discrete - even when we pulled up outside we weren't sure we'd found it at first. Once inside you are looked after very personally by the friendly and professional staff. The concierge takes your luggage while the manageress shows you to your room and gives you a quick guide to whats what, such as the B&O phone, the ipod and Bose sound dock and the very well stocked fridge!

The bathroom and shower are excellent. The beds are apparently specially made for the hotel (quite believable as they are exceptionally comfortable). There is a turndown service in the evening where you are left bottled water and chocolates.

Robes and slippers are provided as well as a fantastic umbrella - for which we were most grateful! You can purchase almost anything in the room - we bought an umbrella.

The breakfast is excellent (although pricey if not included). The hotel bar is very chic and has a strong following from non hotel guests also - well worth a visit.

In summary - we'll most likely be staying here again if we visit Dublin in the near future.",5,2008,04,15
208,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is a well kept secret, not even tourist information knew of the hotel, and finding it was really hard at first.

However this was worth the finding. This is a seriously trendy, luxurious hotel.

The staff are lovely from start to finish, and the rooms are beautiful.

Good location for Dublin City, about a 10 minute walk..helped to walk off the beautiful Breakfast.

Overall, a lovely hotel..worth the high price in every way...loved it!",5,2008,04,07
208,Fantastic Quirky Hotel,We stayed one night at the Dylan - what a fantastic experience.  Room was perfect - the choc. brownies to die for!!  The ipod even had walks round Dublin loaded!  As it is a small hotel the staff knew who you were and were very helpful and friendly.  Lovely touches everywhere with fun designer furniture round each corner making it such a fun place to be!  Only comment is if you want to stay here be prepared to spend - no tea/coffee making faciilties in the room so you have to order on room service - breakfast very expensive but there is a lovely cafe across the street and another just round the corner if you perfer to go out!,5,2008,04,07
208,The Dylan Hotel in D4....haunts of movie stars and us!,"The relatively new "" Dylan"" hotel in Dublin 4 is the cities only five star boutique hotel and it lives up to the brand recognition!
We stayed recently and loved it!
Our room 101 was called the "" Experience"" suite complete with 7x7 bed , flatscreen tv, personal  ipod docking station, designer lights of all shapes and sizes completing a truly wonderful assault on the senses.
The compliment this futuristic interior design, the ensuite boasted a bath, seperate shower and nozzles!
The built in bathroom tv also enjoyed surround sound which helped may soak up my senses in a bath full of my favourite "" Etro"" bathing products.
The Fine dining was done at "" Still"" which is near te trendy bar offering a small a la carte menu.
This was produced exquisitely with local produce done in an international way.
The library was unusal combination of white leather and lime green boudoir chairs.
The library books were recovered especially and boasted a true selection of the ultimate clasics.
The breakfast menu was one of the best I have ever seen with a wonderful selection all individually priced.
If you like style, big beds!, posh location and a chance to hangout with the beautiful people..........vist Dylan in D4.",5,2008,04,02
208,Stunning Hotel & 5 Star Experience,"Absolutely Fabulous Hotel - Dublin's Version Of The G Hotel In Galway!

 From the moment I called Fiona to check the rate and availability, I was blown away by her warmth, and professionalism, she was attentive, comprehensive and extremely personable. Nothing was too much trouble and we were shown to a spacious and very bright room with IPOD and well stocked mini bar! The bathroom was great too!
Fiona even managed to allow us to book in much earlier than normal, rather than have us hanging around. We had a fabulous lunch (Club Sandwich) and strawberry martinis were to die for! 
We then went upstairs for a soak and to relax and had a  problem with our bath, we were instantly moved and upgraded to a style suite for the inconvenience and were blown away by the room in general. I loved the hotel interior and atmosphere, which I would describe as suburban boutique glamor with an Irish twist and found all of the staff welcoming and professional. 
I usually frequent the Morrisson and The Morgan and although the Dylan is not as centrally located, it makes up for this is so many other areas, I will most certainly be back and would recommend this fine establishment to anyone. 
A total treasure and a credit to the team involved.",5,2008,04,02
208,Fantastic atmosphere with a staff to match!,"Wow.  My friends and I had an absolutely delightful time at the dylan.  First off all, Simon did a fantastic job making us feel comfortable.  He showed us around the hotel.  The whole time we were there he was able to not only take care of our needs, but he even anticipated a few before we knew we needed anything!  Cian at the bar was also very fun and quite talented at making tasty drinks.  The rooms are very lovely,  with plenty of room to move around.  It was a bit chilly in Dublin when  we visited and I cannot tell you how much we were thrilled by the heated tiles.  We spent most of our time relaxing near the bar.  What a great atmosphere there!  It reminded us a lot of Chateau Marmont in  Los Angeles, with its laid back, relaxed vibe.  
The rooms are very clean, the staff is very attentive and their service is of the highest quality.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Dublin.  Hopefully they will
 have Simon and Cian there to take care of them.  However, we did notice all of the members of your staff were very kind and attentive.  After traveling for two weeks around the UK and Ireland, this was the best hotel we encountered.  We will be back!",5,2008,03,24
208,Friendly staff but no chance of a lie in or an early night.,"We stayed for 3 nights. This is a beautiful hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful, i forgot my toothpaste and they went and fetched me some with no extra charge (nothing is too much trouble), the breakfast is also great and sounds expensive but even eating in pubs or cafes costs just as much and is not as good. Dublin is a very expensive city! The only issues we had was the soundproofing, at 8am you can hear the cleaners banging up and down the corridoor and you can even hear them putting the paper on your door. Seems a shame as we wanted to lie in and we would not have expected this from a 5 star hotel. At 2am on all three nights we could hear people being loud in the corridoor and outside in the bar. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and although the customer service is good i have stayed in 4 star hotels with this level of style and comfort. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and i can imagine if you have not done this then you may be more impressed with this hotel. I only ever base my reviews on facilities location and value for money and in my opinion Dylan does note excel in any of these areas.",3,2008,03,16
208,An amazing  hotel,"i stayed here for 2 nights in march for my boyfriends birthday and it was brilliant. 
i emailed the hotel the day before to request some beers on ice in the room for our arrival as a suprise for my boyfriend which they very kindly supplied free of charge and even wrote a birthday card for him.
we sampled the famous brownies which were also in the room on arrival which were delicious.
we were made to feel very welcome, as soon as we arrived the porter took our cases from us and we were shown around the hotel, then to our room.
on the 1st evening when we got back to the hotel we found a note put under the door offering us complimentary breakfasts on both mornings as it was my boyfriends birthday, that was such a lovely gesture and of course we agreed! the breakfast was about ¬£30 each per morning if we had paid! so we were very pleased about that and it was absolutely delicious. we had it in the restaurant on the first morning then in our room on the second, and i have to say they only bought 1 cooked breakfast up instead of 2, but i didnt complain as i did have cereal and toast, i just missed out on the cooked breakfast but it was complimentary so i would have felt cheeky to complain!
the hotel has amazing decor, and they have the best of everything, heated floor tiles, the cutlery and crockery, even the phone in the room. 
each evening we were given complimentary water and chocolates and offered the bed turn down service. 
the bar was obviously the place to be and quite busy, its really trendy and cosy and the staff are very attentive. this does reflect in the price though!
we ate in the restaurant one night which was about ¬£120 for a 2 course meal for 2 and 1 bottle of wine!! it was nice but a bit too posh for me!!
overall we had an amazing stay and would go again, the only thing which wasnt great was we had a dodgy tap in the bathroom and couldnt get cold water so had to use bottled water to brush our teeth, but if we had mentioned it they would have sorted it out straight away.
when we had to go they called us a taxi and the driver was telling us how nice they were at the dylan and told us all about the celebs who stay there.
thanks to the staff at the Dylan who helped make my boyfriends birthday very special.",5,2008,03,16
208,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location and Fantastic service","We stayed at the Clarence for our last Dublin visit but were impressed by the rave reviews on this website so went to the Dylan this time....so glad we did!  From the moment we were collected at the airport (arranged by the Concierge) to our departure the service was faultless.  It was obvious that the staff at the Dylan appreciated the stunning interior of the hotel too and took pleasure in our pleasure.  The outside bar area is amazing and we can't wait to return in the summer...although its warm and dry throughout the year. The interior design is truly unique and the hotel offers real 5 star luxury without any of the stuffiness often found in more traditional hotels. Guests are made to feel comfortable and can relax instantly. Its about a 7 min walk to St Stephens Green/Grafton Street (or a 2 min taxi ride) so you can be in the hustle of Dublin City Centre easily and just as easily retreat to the casual splendour of the Dylan in its leafy setting.

15 march 2008
we""re stayed in february one night,  it is really lovely hotel, staff are excellent and the decor is very nice. is really a great place to stay. i also like to thank Siobhan to provid""us a great stay.",5,2008,03,15
208,What a FABULOUS hotel.,"From the moment we checked in at the Dylan I knew we were in safe hands the staff treated us like royalty, extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. 

The Hotel decor is Sumptuously devine and very contemporary. The lime green and grey lounge is stunning with the mirrored fireplace making an interesting feature. All furniture is individually designed and it doesn't look like they have scrimped on anything.

The rooms were spacious, not overly fussy but with all essentials you need. Easy to access WiFi, Ipod  and speakers with pre-loaded music, bang and Olufsen phone, plasma TV etc. I have a really bad back and struggle to get comfy beds but the beds at the Dylan were luxurious, although some may feel they are too soft, I could have stayed in bed all day long! 

The bar is expensive so be warned but the atmosphere is comfortable and again all the staff are great - we were stuck for a place to go on a Monday night, asked the bar staff who came up with a great recommendation that ticked all the boxes. 

The breakfast is divine, if you don't see what you fancy on the menu - just ask and the chef can rustle up just about anything.

All in all a very very good stay - highly recommended. Stay at the Dylan if you your budget stretches to it...you won't be disappointed.",5,2008,03,13
208,Wow Fantastic!,"On a girls/ladies trip to Dublin from the UK, we chose this hotel due to the impressive reviews and fantastic website.
Out of date sat-nav-less taxis found this an unknown place to find so make sure you have the address and keep a close watch on their fares! 
On arrival this place is beautiful on the outside. At night, candle-lit lanterns welcome you through the doors to extremely welcoming and friendly staff, who are polite and in the least bit snobby despite the uniquely exquisite interior and our strong Leeds accents!
From the ceiling lights to the cutlery this is a design dream. Even all the books in the library have coordinated green dust covers to compliment the rest of the decor.
Our room was located next to the lift on the first floor, but this did not affect us in any way. Noise was at a minimum if at all.
The furnishings and layout was again stunning and all amenities were catered for in the bathroom and at the bedside. Water on an evening for through the night and chocs always helps! 
We only had one problem ‚Äì that the TV remote didn't work ‚Äì and we were quickly offered another room and sincere apologies. 
Staff were always helpful, with requests, taxis, recommending places to go, throughout the hotel, and were as chatty or as quiet as you wished them to be.
Our only meal was breakfast in the hotel, which was stunning from the cinnamon figs, amongst other fruit, with creamy yoghurt to the traditional irish white pudding, served as part of the full breakfast.
A thoroughly enjoyable stay which we highly recommend and will hopefully repeat in the not too near future.
Well done Dylan and its staff, you deserve to be number 1 in Dublin.
Thank you.
PS Anyone who who does not enjoy this amazing place must be too old fashioned to appreciate modern tastes and original experiences.",5,2008,03,12
208,every bit as good as described,Unfortunately we were only staying one night but it is really the most lovely hotel. The decor is modern but sumptuous-colour and taste abound.  The dining room for breakfast is elegant and peaceful with super menu-the staff are extremely pleasant throughout the hotel and I loved the rooms.  The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in with super bed linen. Great selection of music on the MP3. Bathroom towels are fluffly and fresh and I loved the heated bathroom floor. Planning my next trip already and I will stay for longer. if you get a chance to stay and you like style with friendliness go right ahead and book it. Loved the bar for people watching-very friendly staff and extensive cocktail menu,5,2008,03,03
208,Loved it....,"Spent two nights at the Dylan in early December 07 for my husbands 40th. The decor was out of this world and I spent most of the time starry eyed and taking photographs (I am an Interior Designer so it was allowed!) Loved our room but don't recall any chocolate brownie..missed out there! I was a little disappointed in our room when I visited our friends room which was vibrant with red soft furnishing etc, we had duck egg blue - but it was still nice. Loved the Ipod and went out and bought one, loved the mood lighting but it was a bit tricky to switch off, esp after a few alcoholic beverages!  The extras were a bit of a rip off, the petals and champers in the bath etc...The mini bar was a bit scary in that you dare look too close at what you were be charged a fortune for incase you dislodged it! I particularly loved the selection of Dylan tunes on the ipod and the CD which, probably naively, thought it was complimentary but it was on the mini bar tariff (I think) but not in the mini bar of course so that wasn't very clear...until I got home and had a letter saying oops you forgot to pay for it!!! One more gripe was the complimentary hair straighteners that kept being taking away after we had gone out and one afternoon while in the bar having drink before getting ready to go out, got back and they had disappeared!! Would have been easier to take my own!

On the whole: Food fab, staff fab, location fab...Great weekend!",4,2008,02,27
208,absolutley gorgeous,"the dylan is really beautiful.  staff are excellent - welcoming and friendly and not snobby as can sometimes be experienced in hotels of this kind.  the decor through out this hotel is just beautiful - its really a great place to stay, it feels luxurious and decadent, and the chocolate brownies in the bedroom when you arrive are very impressive indeed!  My husband loved the IPOD and all the other gadgets.  fab place, go!",5,2008,02,25
208,What a hidden gem!,"What can I say, the hotels postion in the ratings on tripadvisor is thoroughly deserved! Fab rooms, decor and extremely friendly and efficient staff!
Stayed here for 1 night with my wife and wish it could have been a few more nights! 
Lots of great touches in the rooms and love the TV over the bath! 
Tasty Brownyi n the room too! 
Great cocktails in the bar and I would reckon the smoking area is as well designed as the interiors of other hotels in the country!
Will be back soon, we hope!",5,2008,02,24
208,Very disappointed - overpriced,"We stayed at the Dylan for 2 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon.  Got off to a bad start when we got picked up by a taxi at the train station and he had no idea where we were talking about.  

Arrived and checked in to a very small room.  The decor was nice and champagne and petal turn down awaited us in our room (my husband had to pay quite a premium for this)

I ordered room service during our stay and informed the girl on the phone I wanted a club sandwich with no dressing - she asked if I just wanted a chicken and bacon toastie then and I said it would be perfect.  They arrived to the room with 2 fully dressed sandwiches.  When I rang to ask for the plain one the man argued with me that they ""don't do just plain bacon and chicken toasties"" and I must have been mistaken.  Eventually someone returned and replaced the sandwich.  

Later on we ordered the ""movie package"" at 15euro if I remember rightly (for 1 coke, tub of buttered popcorn and a tub of icecream) - unfortunately it would seem they had run out of the buttered popcorn and only had salted - noone told us this we only found out when we started eating it (yuk)

We went to the bar for cocktails and while it looked nice enough the cocktail I had was really awful but at the price I felt I had to try and finish it  lol!

Husband had paid for the package including champagne on both nights though on checking out they tried to charge him E70plus for the second night's bottle.  Again after much explanation and husband goign to show them the email that confirmed everything etc they agreed it had been paid for.  

Although they knew we were honeymoon before we arrived there was no mention of it during our stay and on checking out when husband replied to the question of what our stay was for we were informed ""oh we must do something special for you on your next stay"" - at almost E800 for the two nights in a cramped room?  No thanks.

On the plus side, the bathroom was nice enough as was breakfast but it was nowhere near worth the price we had to pay.  

Don't get me wrong - I'm not a hotel snob I've stayed at much cheaper hotels in Dublin and elsewhere but had a much better experience.  At this price I just expected an awful lot more.",1,2008,02,18
208,What a treat!,"I took my husband to Dublin for his 30th in January and had seen the Dylan advertised in a magazine.  I booked direct with the hotel and getting a favourable rate for bed and breakfast, well it worked out cheaper than going with the other low cost sites!  It was still a bit on the expensive side but I have to say every penny was completely worth it.  The hotel is very chic and ultra modern but with their choice of colour schemes felt very warm.  We were greeted but the friendliest staff and fantastic concierge.  A real treat was being upgraded to a superior suite - pure luxury!  They booked out tickets to the Guiness Storehouse which was great as it meant we didn't have to queue when we got there.  We were shown to our room which was quite literally amazing - the best we have every stayed in.  Very spacious, beautiful interior, cool plasma tv, ipod with a selection of cool music.  Gorgeous bathroom with tv in the tiles!!  I had asked for a complimentary box of chocolates for my husband and the biggest box was waiting for him.  A member of staff came up to give us some complimentary bottles of water!  In the evening they organised a cab for our trip into town, although we could have stayed there as the restaurant was very plush.  In the morning we had breakfast in the dining room and again the service and manner of all the staff was outstanding, the food was to die for, beautifully presented and nothing was too much for the staff.  We left our luggage with them as we were sightseeing until the end of the day when we returned and they organised a cab for our return to the airport.  All in all this was a fantastic trip, both husband and I felt very spoilt here at the Dylan.  If you want a really special place to stay in Dublin where the service and everything about the hotel is a real treat, the Dylan is the place to go.",5,2008,02,14
208,Perfect!,"The Dylan is just fantastic. It is so stylish and funky. We loved everything about the place. Breakfast is fantastic, once you have got over the shock of the cost. 

It is a bit far out from the centre of Dublin,  but you can walk to most things.",5,2008,02,05
208,Couldn't be better,"I could write a book but I'll refrain. I travel internationally 12 to 16 times a year all over the world. The Dylan is the best hotel experience I've ever had. Great facility, superb service. We were upgraded one room level, had a great view, everyone we dealt with was helpful beyond cause. The room and amenities were excellent, and the bed was the best I've slept in at any hotel anywhere. 

Great location, away from all the noise and mayhem, but close enough to walk to Grafton, Temple Bar, all the great sites. 

Doesn't get better than the Dylan and I'll never stay anywhere else when I travel to Dublin.",5,2008,01,29
208,Funky boutique hotel,"Having read the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor, and needing a place to stay in Dublin overnight, I decided to book a stay at the Dylan Hotel. Suffice it to say, I wasn't disappointed!

The hotel itself is very stylishly decorated and each room is different, with its own quirky decor and nice little touches like heated flooring in the bathroom & under-bed lighting. There's a great sense of fun about the place too, with a 'Karma Sutra Kit' as part of the mini-bar offerings and a 'movie menu' with popcorn & ice cream etc. 

My room was a little small and had no view to speak of, but I had a pleasant night's sleep and very much enjoyed the ultra-comfy bed! Some of the room service options and mini-bar drinks were on the expensive side, but I was willing to overlook that for the hotels' stand-out feature: the service. 

I was warmly welcomed by the hotel manager on arrival, and all my requests were met, including an early check-in, which was very much appreciated! 

The location is also very good, being a short walk from the city centre, in a very pleasant part of Dublin.

Overall, I would highly recommend a stay here. As a business traveller, I have stayed in countless bland chain hotels, so to check in somewhere like the Dylan made a very welcome change!",5,2008,01,24
208,"Beautiful and interesting decor, great service","I stayed at the Dylan for one night, and was bumped up to a bigger room, and treated to amazing service and a fantastic room.  I had a drink at the bar at night, and had breakfast in my room in the morning, and both were fantastic.  The only slight hitch was when I asked at the front desk how to turn on the heated floors in my bathroom they didn't really know, but I was able to figure it out eventually.  Definitely a treat.",5,2008,01,21
208,great boutique hotel,"We had 1 nights stay for my husbands birthday. We really enjoyed it , the food, the room everything was perfect. Will return",5,2008,01,19
208,Loved the Dylan,"We only had one night at this fantastic hotel, and chose it because of the positive reviews on this site.  It is absolutely fabulous, the staff are so very friendly and super efficient.  We ate in the hotel restaurant and every course was a delight!

The breakfast seemed rather expensive so we chose to walk down Baggot Street towards St Stephens Green and had a lovely full Irish breakfast in a small cafe.  

We will definately be going back, hopefully in the summer when we can use the terrace bar which looked so inviting, even in the pouring rain!",5,2008,01,16
208,Divine Dylan,"We arrived in the pouring rain and were greeted by a doorman with an umbrella and the warming glow of the candles in the entrance. The moment we walked in we were impressed. Checking in was a breeze and so personal, not like at the Bellagio! The staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating. We were shown to our room and given guidance on how to operate the IPOD, phone and plasma tv.  The room was spacious with easy chairs and a table. (Excellent choice of magazines available) The walk in wardrobe was fully equipped with a powerful hairdryer, shoe cleaning kit, slippers and huge, fluffy dressing gowns, even an umbrella for those ever present showers!  The bathroom was a delight. A bath big enough for 2 and an enormous walk in shower. The heated floor is sooooooooo good. All the complementary bathroom accessories were delightful and plentiful. Often towels are rather skimpy - not here,  full bath sheets are provided. 

We were fortunate to have the room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard but not able to utilise it due to the Dublin rain! Breakfast there would have been great.

The beds are described as seventh heaven and I'm not going to dispute that. It was the most luxourious bed I've ever slept in. The sheets were divine and the pillows perfect. The turn down service is another little special thought,  complementary chocolates and bottled water on the bedside tables and a night time verse on your pillow.

Pre-dinner cocktails in the lounge bar are not to be missed - especially the Dylan Special. 

We opted for dinner in the Still restuarant on our first night and were delighted with our choice. We ordered the 10 course taster menu, if you go there, DO NOT MISS this experience. The staff were wonderful, fully explaining each course. Dinner was a 3 hour gastronomic delight. If you have the opportunity to pre book, ask for the high backed dining chairs. The sommelier was discreet and suggested excellent wines to complement the dinner perfectly.

The buffet breakfast choice was exceptional and the hot food cooked to order. On our second morning we had room service - EXCELLENT, and plenty of time to enjoy the papers.

Although a brisk 15 minute walk from the centre of Dublin, it's well worth staying a little off the beaten track. Only one small detail overlooked - I do love tea & coffee making facilites in the room. This hotel is an experience and worth every single penny, thank you all, I will definitely be coming back.",5,2008,01,08
208,Distinctly average,"After pouring through numerous previous reviews, I felt sure that the Dylan Hotel over New Years would be the perfect choice.  

Having stayed at the Radisson SAS on the outskirts of Dublin previously (a wonderful country 5 star hotel).  I wanted a change and be right amongst the action.

The disappointment began when I saw the room, it was small with no tea or coffee making facilities.  The bathroom was tiny with no bath and absolutely no counter space.  There was a sink placed on a slab of granite no bigger than 30cmx30cm!!!

I simply can't work out why so many people rave about this place.  The bar was nothing special but the prices certainly were!  Bring your wallet at 13 Euros for a cocktail....not made particularly well.

We could not get reservations in the restaurant on any day of our 4 night stay despite being patrons of the hotel which was very irritating.

The most disappointing thing about the hotel was the location!  it was no where near the centre of town or St Stephens Green...which meant taxi fares soon mounted up.

Frankly you are paying a LOT of money for average accomodation, probably no breakfast in your rate, a bar so expensive you wont use it and a restaurant you cant get into.  Go elsewhere.  An EXPENSIVE mistake.",2,2008,01,08
208,Fantastic,"I took my husband here for a birthday treat.  A two night stay but wish we could have stayed longer.  The room was sooooo nice we didn't want to leave it.  
Fantastic bed, chairs, plasma screen, ipod, the bath was fab for two and even had a tv built into the tiled wall.
Attention to detail in this hotel is second to none,  if i can ever afford it again, I would love to return and stay longer than 2 days.
A home from home and couldn't want for anything during your stay.  The best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.
The staff are also very helpful and friendly.",5,2008,01,04
208,Absolutely Amazing,"We stayed at the Dylan on the last night of our honeymoon.  We had a bit of trouble finding it, since no one he had asked ever heard of Eastmoreland street, but once we called the hotel directly, they gave us perfect directions.  

We arrived in the rain to the beautiful site of lit candles everywhere.  The concierge took our baggage and keys, to park our car for us.  We were immediately blown away by the fabulous decor and service.  We were led to our room and given explanations on how to work everything and where to find what we needed.  They even left us a personal note and some fresh brownies, which my husband claims to be the best he has ever eaten.  We ordered room service for dinner and the food absolutely was exquisite. 

We loved the iPod and the plasma tv too.  The bathroom was amazing in itself.  The heated towel racks and comfy robes were excellent additions.  We were also very pleased to find bubble bath and bath salts.  Great to have on a honeymoon.  The tub is a bit high off the ground, but there is a handle to hold while climbing in an out.   The hair drier in the room was also fabulous.  It was the best blow-dry I had the entire trip. Finally, were were impressed with how affordable the phone call we made from our room was, compared to the other hotels we stayed at in Dublin.  

We simply loved everything about the Dylan and would come back in a heartbeat.",5,2008,01,02
208,Go. Now....,"We stayed for one night in October, but the experience was so relaxing that it felt like a long weekend. The attention to detail here is astonishing, both in terms of the devilish decor and the staff. If any hotel, anywhere, claims to have better staff than this, don't take them seriously. 

Although we arrived early (about 11am), our room was ready and waiting.  The staff unloaded our car and took it off our hands for the day. As we wanted to go straight into town, they suggested a couple of restaurants to try for lunch ( Hugo's is fantastic!).

The cocktail bar and the restaurant are outstanding, too, while our six year old daughter devoured a delicious cauliflower risotto. 

Breakfast the following morning was first class. Having the car delivered to the front door, loaded and ready to go was (yet) another nice touch.

Go now. This is pure class....",5,2007,12,27
208,fab stay,"Stayed 2 nights for our anniversary. Will definately return. Friendly service and nothing too much trouble.  Bed amazingly comfy. Room large, spotless and glamourous.  Concierge helpful and restraunt incredible for dinner and breakfast.  
No tea and coffee making facility in room which didnt bother us but it did seem a bit odd to be charged for water from the mini bar. I would expect that to be compimentary for the price of the stay.
So great hotel in a a great location worth the expense.",4,2007,12,20
208,How Funky !,"Stayed at the Dylan over three nights at the end of November.

The people who designed this hotel must have had great fun in doing so and must have stayed in/ been inspired by  many top end rooms resulting in the eclectic mix which is the Dylan.

Lovely attention to detail everywhere with the best bed ever...

All our needs were catered to with the staff faultless with great room service, turn down and the still restaurant offering up a meal of some quality.

The only thing wrong with it....ten minute stroll into the city centre is mentioned which is more like twenty five.....

Situated in a beatiful georgian suburb but a little bit too far out of town.

Doubt you will beat the atmosphere elsewhere though. Ver y Very nice...",4,2007,12,14
208,Absolutely Fabulous,Wow and Wow again - This was our second stay at this divine and delightful Hotel - everything was simply perfect again - dinner in the Still Restaurant is an absolute MUST - and I am still dreaming of my fresh banana daiquiris in the amazing cocktail bar - We can't wait to return again but in the meantime we can only say that the pleasure and priviledge of staying at the Dylan in Dublin is what it must be like to be looked after like royalty !!  Thank you so much and very many thanks to Siobhan Delaney - they Dylans General Manager on attaining your recent Hotel award - you are to be congratulated !!,5,2007,11,30
208,Welcome back...,"The first and last time we stayed at the dylan it's fair to say that the service left something to be desired. 
I was contacted directly by the manager - who's fantastic passion for delivering good service was clear to see. She had read my review and asked for an opportunity to prove just how wonderful a the 'dylan expereience' really is. We accepted their request and booked to stay for our wedding anniversary. 
We arrived a little early but had called ahead and were delighted to find our room ready for us and the best description i can offer is wow! Having been given a complimentary upgrade we fell in love with the room immedaitely. 
Having viewed many rooms on hotel websites i am often left deflated by the actuality of the room on arrival. Not with the dylan. 
Our room - well suite - was fantastic and dominated by the most ornate bed that wouldn't look out of place in Venice. 
That said, the hotel's style (boutique) design was never in question - it was their service. 
This time round they couldn't be faulted. What came across was a natural service, nothing felt scripted or 'put on' in order to impress. 
I can't sign off without mentioning the fantastic 'still' restaurant which made our stay even more memorable. For lovers of fine food then you simply MUST eat here - it's well worth the money! 
All in all the dylan has found a place in our hearts and i think their kind offer is testament to how much they value their service and fast-growing reputation. 
Forget the Clarence or the Four Seasons, the dylan is the place to stay! 
In fact, we're off again very soon...",5,2007,11,28
208,Just perfect,"From the moment we arrived at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin to the time of our departure everything went perfectly. We were taken to our room and the receptionist explained all the details of the heating, TV & i pod in the Bose speaker system. The room & bathroom were exceptionally clean with dressing gowns, lovely fluffy towels,large bottles of toiletries etc.,umbrella for use during our stay and a well stocked fridge. We had dinner on our first night and only regretted we didn't on the second. The food was beautifully presented and absolutley delicious. The service was attentive , friendly and very discreet. Our snack lunch on our day of departure was equally good. Every time we met any member of staff they were the first to greet us with a cheerful comment. It is a long time since we have stayed in such perfect surroundings and the hotel fully deserves 5 stars!
There was only one complaint they didn't have a brochure of their sister hotel, however this was posted to us and it  arrived two days later!",5,2007,11,27
208,Delightful Dylan,"Just returned from one night at the Dylan. An amazing hotel. The furniture is unique, fabrics are high quality and the staff just can't do enough. All the staff refused any tips as well which I thought was a nice touch.
I booked the Breakfast/dinner package which saved over a hundred euros at least. The food was fantastic and breakfast was delivered to our room for no extra charge.
The hotel is about 15 mins walk from the city center but it was nice to be tucked away in a quiet residential street.
You must stay here. You won't be disappointed!!",5,2007,11,19
208,"Great hotel, bad room service.","I came to Dublin for work a while back and spent 2 nights in Dylan Hotel. I must confess I didn't spend much time in the hotel but I fancied the stylish design. The bed was extremely comfortable and the BOSE speakers make me feel right at home. It felt great to be in the room after a long day at work.

The only negative comment I have about the hotel is the room service. I returned to the hotel around 3.30AM one night. I felt kinda hungry so I took a look at the room service menu. I had my eyes on a club sandwich so I phoned the reception to place an order. To my desmise, all they could offer was chicken sandwich and some other sandwich. I remember the menu offered a wide selection of bread but on that particular night, they could only offer brown or white. Anyway, I wanted some chips as well but they could not offer that either.

I ended up having a lousy chicken sandwich (with no sauce, not even butter but only ketchup). It was quite a bad experience especially after a long day + night at work. I am surprised by the limited selection of food they offer. I am fairly sure other hotel chains in Dublin offer a wide selection of food around the clock. 

Oh yes, the breakfast wasn't that good either, though the dining room was superb. I ordered a pancake with strawberries and it wasn't good at all. The pancakes were a little burnt.

Other than the food (even the steak I had for dinner wasn't that good), Dylan Hotel is a great choice for all!",4,2007,11,13
208,Like its Namesake Bob - A Legend in its Own Lifetime!,"We were put onto the Dylan by our daughter who had stayed there just after it opened late last year and hasn't stopped raving about it since.

We booked a Style room for 3 nights over a week-end and from the moment we arrived, we realised why our much-travelled daughter was so impressed. 

This is a unique hotel in every sense of the word, from the quirky ocassional furniture to the superb staff who simply cannot do enough for you and always with a smile.

The room which was on the 3rd floor was large, very comfortable and overlooked the a beautiful courtyard at the back. The bed was truly Seventh Heaven! I never usually sleep well on my first night away, but I had no problem this time around. My only slight gripe was that we didn't have a bath which would have been nice to relax in after a day walking around this fabulous city.

We ate in Still on the Friday evening and the food was superb if a little rich - but that's probably because I went for a combination that you only usually find in the heart of the Perigord in France.

The breakfast which we devoured in bed was enough to keep us fuelled for the rest of the day!

The only other little gripe is that the Dylan is a brisk 10 minute walk from St Stephen's Green which is OK at the beginning of the day but a little daunting when your tootsies are throbbing!

Finally, we had a coulple of little issues that we drew to the attention of the team at the front desk. The way that these issues were dealt with should be held up as an example of PR perfection.

I'll elaborate. I'd arranged for a bottle of champagne to be in our room on arrival, but despite email assurances and the fact that we arrived on schedule, our request was ignored.

Within 5 minutes of expressing our disappointment, our champagne arrived in our room complete with a bowl of fresh strawberries, a handwritten note of apology from the Duty Manager and two fantastic complementary chocolate gateaux.

Everybody makes mistakes. Its how they handle them that separates the excellent from the also rans.

Thanks to all of the Dylan team for making our stay such a memorable one. We cannot wait to return.",5,2007,11,13
208,Worth the walk! You'll never want to get out of bed....,"I'm sure my opinion of the Dylan is a little squewed as we were upgraded to the massive 3rd floor Luxury room, but I feel a stay in the standard room would have been just as impressive. The staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful yet not overly pampering. The decor and ambience of the bar, bedrooms and library was an interesting and successful mix of Art Deco, 70 chic and garish extravigance. The Bathroom in our suite was exceptionally well lit and the massive bed was the comfiest I've slept in for years. 

Although we didn't eat dinner in the restaurant, the Bar was groovy, and breakfast (included in our Mr and Mrs Smith Booking) was great. 

If there is one down side, it would be the location. However, the Georgian streets around this area of Dublin are very attractive despite the  relative lack of eateries, and the peaceful environment is a haven from the areas around Grafton street (about 20 minutes walk). There are some great coffee houses and sandwich bars, but an attractive 10 minute walk towards St Stephens Green will bring you to some great bars and classy restaurants. 

In all, its worth the money if you are willing to make the most of the great rooms and deep baths, the busy bar and relaxing terrace and library.",5,2007,11,05
208,It is chic and casual,"What a fantastic place,  the toys were all very cool. Clearly the owners have spent money and it was money well spent. The bathroom floor was great! For me the difference between this hotel and the other cool hotels in Dublin is the people who work there, very down to earth , did not try and be ubercool. Other hotels should take note!

Patrick at concierge - Excellent
Simon -Bar -Excellent
Fiona- Desk- Excellent",5,2007,10,29
208,Fantastic Experience,"I have recently spent three days at the Dylan - and what an experience it was. From the special ""lavender spray"" that goes on to the pillows at night, to the great attitude of all the staff. This hotel makes you feel very special - without being overly pretentious. The first night, we dined in the restaurant - and had probably the best meal I have ever had in any hotel restaurant. I highly recommend the Beef - it was so flavorful and tender.

The room was well equipped - even the bathrooms have TV's in them! The location is perfect - just a 20 minute stroll from Stephen's Green - and all the Hub-bub of shopping.

I would highly recommend this hotel - whether you stay for business or pleasure - it's a real ""home from home"".",5,2007,10,29
208,Fanatstic,"best dirty martinis we've ever had..wonderful staff, excellent food..and the most fabulously designed room and bar.  Probably one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed at.",5,2007,10,27
208,Dublin's Best...or for that matter...anywhere's best,"A quaint  beauty on a quiet little lane. Originally built in the 1890's as the Dublin's Baggot Street Old Nurses Home the exterior is itself a work of architectual beauty.  

Enter a well appointed 'lobby' that would be better described as a comfortable greeting longue and a warm staff welcoming you as if you were an old friend returning to stay with family. 

The rooms and service are top draw. How about thermally heated black marble floors in the bathroom!  The rooms have beautiful furnishings that are top quality....not the usual hotel cheap, but  top quality./ 

Room service, staff, bar and eateries leave nothing to be desired.

Make a reservation....you will remember your stay",5,2007,10,27
208,"Fantastic and Luxurious, A Wonderful Experience","We have just spent the most amazing weekend at the Dylan Hotel in Dublin.  The decor is fantastic and very unusual with a high attention to detail.  The service was superb and your every need catered for.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and are all individual.  Very spacious rooms and good size bathrooms with lots of lovely extras such as a docking station for your ipod, bathrobes, slippers and lovely toiletries.  We spent a few pleasant hours in the bar and also had a lovely meal in the restaurant.  It was expensive, but a wonderful experience and I will be returning.",5,2007,10,22
208,Truly Great Experience,"Its hard to know where to star when everything was so wonderful.
Lets get the basics over - staff fab - hotel fab - food to die for - room 109 just excellent - design and decoration so so pleasing - service...well they couldnt do enough for us (look out for Patrick on the front desk...top fella )
We went there for three days just to get out of London - we were meeted and greeted the second we stepped out of the cab...i was already exhausted fom a non stop talking cabbie who filled on the past 500years of irish history.
Within minutes we had checked in and shown to our room...our luggage was already there waiting for us..coats already stored in the wardrobe. 
We were shown in detail our room...all I wanted was to know how to operate the flat screen and what was in the mini bar...jane sorted all the rest out...... 
Now I dont know about you but a very important element for me in a hotel room is the shower...this can effect my whole stay...i was not dissapointed....i marveled at its power and versitility..its piping hot water and abundance of salts...shampoos...scrubs and gels.......ooooooo i was going to be sooo clean !!!!!!!
Smelling clean and fresh we hit the resturant and WOW what a delight.....after dinner we relaxed on the outdoor heated patio and drank to the sound of water fountains while watching the flickering of romantic candles (not that I do romance)
The rest of our time was spent sightseeing..we took advice from a very informative front desk...each nite we returned we we forced to give detailed report on our adventures...this of course meant more time spent in the bar and on the patio
Who ever you are...if you decide to stay at the Dylan you will not be dissapointed....make the effort to talk to the staff, they are there to help...and enjoy helping..the staff are a important part of your experience !
ENJOY THE CRACK !

208,Delightful experience,"Stumbled across this hotel, and were very thankful for discovering a gem.

We stopped at Dylan for just one night en route to Dublin Airport, booking a 'Style' room, and certainly weren't disappointed. The room was well proportioned and welcoming.It was styled in such a way that mixed old with new - no detail was overlooked. 

Staff were very friendly, knowledgable, and attentive without being over-the-top, whilst there was a relaxing ambiance in the bar and restaurant to compliment this.

The hotel is situated well within walking distance from St Stephen's Green.

Definitely one to remember and go back to.",5,2007,09,30
208,"Loved, loved, loved the Dylan!","Our family of four, children ages 10 and 12 stayed at the Dylan for three nights. It was extraordinary. The hotel and rooms were fantastic, but the staff was most amazing. We hugged and kissed them when we left. It is luxury personified with the feeling of staying with friends. Among the best hotels we have ever stayed at. Book now!",5,2007,09,29
208,Perfect in every way!,"I chose to book the Dylan for my boyfriend's 30th birthday as a surprise after visiting their website which made the hotel look amazing. We definately weren't disappointed!

Check in was very quick and we were shown around the hotel and the facilities in our room, which was perfect. We both loved the fabulous interior in the whole hotel and the rooms.

We ate out the first night, reservations made by the hotel staff and came back to the hotel bar for some wonderful cocktails afterwards. The second night we ate in the hotel restaurant to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The meal was wonderful.
Breakfast was also very good, we ate downstairs the first day and in our room the second day. 

We did get out and about a bit as it was our first visit to Dublin, but I would have been equally as happy lazing about in the hotel. The beds are sooo comfortable!

Overall not cheap, but a wonderful treat!!!",5,2007,09,24
208,Just fabulous,"My boyfriend and I booked our 2 night stay on a ""two nights for the price of one"" deal.

We were impressed immeadiately with the charming receptionist.  The room was great - the ipod station with the pre programmed mixes was lovely, the heated bathroom floor a treat, lovely toiletries, fab bed - and we spent a decadent afternoon lounging in bed - ordering room service - and just chiling out.  And that sums up the Dylan - it was a treat to hang out at the hotel, not simply a place to flop at the end of a hard days sightseening.  Expensive - but a real treat.  the only thing that would have been good would have been tea making facilities - sorry if that makes me seem plebby but I do like a good cup of tea.  But - overall a fab place.

208,Worth Every Penny,"Firstly apologies that this review is a few weeks after our stay (end of Aug) - I think I was so chilled out after our weekend away that I am only just starting to get back into the swing of things!

My boyfriend booked us a weekend at Dylan's as a surprise and neither of us were disappointed with the choice of hotel - from before we even stepped off the plane in Ireland, we were provided help from the staff after I posted a question on the forum here - yes they do read it!

The decor is quite lush and everyone who works there seemed to be enjoying the experience.  Our room was delightful - my other half was in heaven with a choice of 3 flat screen TV's to watch at any one time - the bed was so comfy I didn't want to get out of it, but I soon realised that the delicious breakfasts were worth getting out of bed for!

The staff really couldn't do enough for you - concierge booking restaurants, suggesting places to go etc etc.  You could argue that this is their job and what they are expected to do but they were very pro-active in their approach and didn't make you feel like you were being a pain.

I would like to say a special thank you to Simon Cunnick for sorting out our restaurant reservations, room upgrade and generally for just taking an interest in us and for seeking feedback.

I would deifintely recommend a stay here if you want to explore Dublin or a base for the rest of Ireland.  I suggest you book the restuarant in advance - it is well worth it and save some room for some cocktails as they are fab!

Enjoy!

208,The Perfect Hotel,"I have to say that I missed this hotel terrifically after we left. It was our first weekend away without the kids and we couldn't have picked a more seductive place if we tried - in more ways than one! The website gives you an idea that it's something quite special but on spending time there, you realise that all hotels should be like this. The staff can't do enough for you (but not in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable or 'waited' on - which personally I don't like), the decor is super-stylish, the food fantastic and the general ambience second to none. As others have said, the outdoor terrace is lovely. Yes, it's a little pricey but I think you do get what you pay for. It's not as stuffy and old-fashioned as some 5* resorts, and I love the fact that even the staff are dressed and styled. Tip: park outside at the weekend, it's free. After filling out our feedback forms, the general manager of the hotel wrote to ask us to post our feedback on this website - usually I would've ignored such a request (busy lives etc) but I'm making a point of doing it for Dylan. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel - unusual for me as I'm both a hotel and restaurant snob! My husband and I even enjoyed the 20 min walk into the hub of Dublin city centre. My only reservation is that as it becomes more popular, the secret will be out. If you want to impress someone, take them here. Well done Dylan. Others should take a leaf out of your book.

208,Fantastic Hotel,"This is a great hotel for a special break. We've just returned from a four night stay and the whole experience was fabulous! We were fortunate enough to be upgraded on arrival and the room and facilities were fantastic, very contemporary, as was the hotel overall, the opposite of minimalist  - lashings and lashings of luxury!

208,A Unique Experience,"If you need to celebrate a special event, an opportunity to get away and relax or simply want a shopping spree in one of the favoured cities in Europe then dylan should be your first choice. It has everything. 

It has unique and luxurious bedrooms, an amazing library and stunning restaurant. The surroundings really make you feel that you have film star status. 

With 44 rooms it offers that individual service and first class customer care that larger hotels find it impossible to provide. The staff are friendly, efficient, young and very keen to deliver a professional service.

The location is within a short walk of the city centre and gives you an opportunity to walk off those calories after a delicious Irish breakfast.

208,"Dylan, Perfection","From the moment we arrived at the gates of the Dylan Dublin we were taken care of. We were greeted by  staff dressed impeccably in black who took our luggage and swept us up the steps into the haven of tranquility that is this beautifully designed boutique hotel. We were seated and checked in from our seats without even having to stand at reception. Instantly every trace of stress melted and we relaxed. We were given a tour of the hotel and noticed the attention to detail such as exotic floral displays placed strategically and stylish decor and furnishings all to an exceptionally high standard. 
We were then taken to the room which was bright and furnished in a unique style with an amazing orange headboard. There was the Dylans signature music playing from a pre loaded ipod together with a flat screen T.V. The room was perfect. The bathroom was designed in luxurious style also. There was a generous selection of Etro toiletries which were gorgeous.
In the evening we had cocktails outside on the terrace which was a buzzing and trendy location for Dublins fashionable. Breakfast was a feast! Everything from full irish breakfast to fresh fruits, pastries, cakes and much more,served in the dining room or out on the terrace.
 We couldnt fault the Dylan and  every member of its team was courteous and polite.We loved it so much we returned for a second visit which was even better as we were upgraded to a suite! Again it was  furnished in the Dylans unique style with a huge bed.The bathroom had a T.V. set into the bathroom wall. Our stay was once again perfect and we cant wait to return  .
The Dylan experience is made so special by the team who are dedicated and focused on the needs of their guests.
",5,2007,09,08
208,In a word --- OUTSTANDING,"Would all hotel managers and owners in the British Isles please take note - as of now, the Dylan is the standard that every hotel has to try and live up to. Best of luck!

We stayed at Dylan a few days ago and from the moment we arrived we knew we were in for something special, as the immaculately dressed staff greeted us at our taxi and took our bags to the foyer - elegant and fashionable simultaneously. We were taken up to our room by a young man who casually informed us that we would be receiving a free upgrade to the Signature Suite. I would later learn that Colin Farrell rents this room when he stays in Dublin, and the moment the door is opened you see why.

The room is superbly appointed with original and stylish furniture, enormous king size bed, plasma tv that can swivel to be viewed in any part of the room, and Bose speakers plus ipod. The bathroom has its own LCD tv, double ended bath, huge shower and top class fittings. The designer clearly took their time to seek out the best and brightest furniture, starkly contrasting with most large chain hotels with the same drab 'neutral colours' the world over.

Downstairs the Dylan has its own bar, usually I find these have been tacked on as an afterthought, but the bar here is a hotspot of its own, crammed on both Friday and Staurday night with the bright young things of Dublin. Definitely a chav-free zone, and even if you're not staying at the hotel, go to the bar and mingle with the locals, we didn't go anywhere else on either night and couldn't recommend more highly!

Location is approximately 20mins walk from the smart shopping area of Grafton Street, alternatively take the no.10 bus, or the concierge will have a taxi pick you up in minutes. Approx 25mins ride from Dublin airport. Also there is an award winning restaurant across the road called Expresso Bar (brunch by day, excellent freshly-prepared fare by evening. Reserve for the evening) which provided us with amazing supper. The Dylan's own menu looked pretty good too, but you'll need deep pockets.

The staff treated us like royalty throughout our stay, nothing was too much trouble. Until proved otherwise, the Dylan is my home from home in Dublin, and I can't wait to go back!

208,Amazing Hotel,"Stayed at the Dylan for 3 days in August and had a lovely time.  My partner and I were there for my birthday and neither Dublin or the Hotel disappointed.  The hotel is a nice 15 mins walk from the centre, but round the corner there are plenty of bars, restaurants and shops, also a very good bus service. The rooms have everything you need & more, robes, slippers flat screen tv, ipod with selection of music, bed you don't want to get out of but did because we didn't want to miss the fantastic breakfast, freshly cooked and brought to table or room.Nice bathroom with lots of nice toiletries. Turndown is lovely, they leave you a card and chocolates on your pillow and a complimentary bottle of water. Complimentary daily newspaper if wanted.The hotel has a nice welcoming feel to it and the staff are the best, very friendly and positive and really helpful without being over the top. There was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which I would have liked, but then you have room service and I think it was a 24hour bar whilst we were there. Can't wait to go back.

208,Wow!!!,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We stayed for 2 nights in a ""style"" room and will definately be returning.  Staff fell over themselves to help us and nothing seemed too much bother.  It's the first place we've ever stayed in where the staff actually seemed happy in their jobs and pleased you asked for something.  Decor in the rooms was stunning and the bed.....well we've emailed the manufacturer direct to see if we can get one.  Fabulous!  7th heaven indeed!  Bose MP3 player in the room had a choice of music for everyone, toiletries were luscious and robe & slippers provided was the finishing touch.   Night time turn down service with free bottled water, delicious chocolate and a card on your pillow.

Ballsbridge area itself is very cosmopolitan with coffee shops, juice bars etc in walking distance.  Regular bus service into town which is 10 mins away, although most guests took taxis given it is a 5 star hotel.  

We found ourselves not wanting to go out much over our 2-day break and sipped wonderful cocktails in the bar, sampled their oysters and entertained our guests.  The full irish breakfast seen us through until dinner time - it's huge and delicious.  We had breakfast in bed for no extra charge too.

Can't wait to go back.

208,Dylan Heaven,"Have stayed at Dylan on two separate occasions, once with my partner and then with my girlfriends, and am just waiting for another excuse to stay again! I am totally in love with this hotel and now refuse to go for drinks or stay anywhere else in Dublin! I really couldn't say anything negative about it if I tried...As soon as you enter the hotel you feel like a VIP. The decor  has really got the wow-factor - stylish and funky, the Bar is amazing and the atmosphere throughout Dylan is so chilled that you really feel at home. I found the staff exceptionally  nice, the guys at the Welcome Desk just couldn't do enough for you and the Bar staff were very friendly and chatty, and I think  that this is such a nice and refreshing change from the stuffiness which you can come across in other 5 star hotels. I also found the prices very reasonable, nothing seemed to be any more expensive than any other bar or restaurant in Dublin city. The rooms I stayed in on both occasions were gorgeous, with lovely extra touches to them.  I had breakfast to my room and have to say it was delicious, and was served beautifully. I really would recommend Dylan to anyone staying in Dublin...it's a real treat and just has something different about it to any other hotel in Ireland.

208,Night at the Dylan,"We stayed at the Dylan for a ""romantic"" night away. We were going to see Rod Stewart too! Rod was amazing and the hotel was pretty special too! We were upgraded complimentary which was really nice. This was my first time to stay in a 5 star. The room was spacious and the decor fab. Personally I felt a bit out of my depth but thats my fault. The staff were nice. But everything out of the minibar was v expensive. And I did think it was very cheeky to charge ‚Ç¨20 for valet parking. I rang hotel from outside in the car when we could not find an entrance to the car park. I was asked was I booking in and when I said yes they said they would be out straight away. They never said there was a charge and we had tipped the valet. Overall I would not go back again.
",4,2007,08,14
208,Great Hotel!,"Hotel was great.  Large rooms, comfy beds, great bathrooms, and excellent staff.  The only issue was the location.  It was a bit out of city central, but an easy walk.

208,best outdoor terrace in dublin,"We decided to treat our selves to a night in dublin without our little boy. A friend had recommended the hotels restaurant so we phoned and asked had they any packages. One nights B and B plus dinner for 320eu in a delux room. We thought this a really good deal as dinner alone would be around 80eu per person, so we booked.We were not dissappointed.We pulled up outside and immediatly a doorman arrived umbrella in tow as it was pouring to escort us inside. You can park outside the hotel free of charge at weekends but there is a valet parking service available at 20eu per night, this is probably essential mid week as parking spaces will be hard to find.Once inside we were met immediatly by a very friendly receptionist called Fiona... no standing in line here. We were asked to take a seat we filled in miinimal paper work and we were escorted to our room, bags would follow later we were informed and they did.The decor in the dylan is fabulous very modern  with some very unusual pieces of furniture but extremly comfortable. Our room was lovely all mod cons and all the extras one would expect from a 5 star hotel. I think one of the best features of the hotel is its outside terrace, its fab ,comfy ,candle lit ,and even though im not a smoker i enjoyed it immensley. The service in all areas of the hotel was excellent and the food in the restaurant certainly lived up to our expectations.One thing, when we were quoted our rate idid not get an email confimation so had nothing in writing this posed a bit of a problem on check out as they charged us 395eu. They said 320EU WAS FOR SINGLE OCCUPANCY. Anyway we paid but i was a bit peeved, however 2 days later i received a letter apologisng for hte error and they refunded our credit card... so well done and i would love to go back.",4,2007,08,13
208,Rip Off Dylan Hotel,"Stayed at The Dylan Hotel, Ballsbridge, Dublin for one night in July, lovely  hotel, food very good, but would not return, due to the fact that we felt that the hotel operated a hidden charge system.  We paid ‚Ç¨390 for a one night's stay in a moderate room, and also dinner, on top of this we were charged ‚Ç¨20 for parking our car in the hotel car park, ‚Ç¨15 euro for what we thought was a complimentary CD of hotel music which was left in our room, and also ‚Ç¨5 for a small bottle of water! We felt we were ripped off completley.

208,Simply the best!,"Just returned from the Dylan - what a place! Amazing!  It was my 40th birthday weekend and  we where a party of 14!  Everyone agreed it was the best hotel anyone had ever stayed in (and most very well travelled!!!).  The staff could not do enough for you and made us feel so welcome.  The rooms, bar area, restaurant and various reception rooms are simply breathtaking and perfect for a special celebration - Kiera Knightley and Daniel Radcliffe were there too so word must be spreading!!!  

We took dinner in Still restaurant on the Friday night which was amazing, the food was 'sublime'!  Could not fault a thing - all 14 of us where very impressed - lots of little extra touches like sorbet between courses was very refreshing too!  The staff in both restaurant and bar all very well trained and friendly!  Last orders for breakfast (not to be missed!) was 11.00 - very sociable!
 
The concerge and reception helped enormously, providing taxis, information and lots of fabulous 'Dylan' umbrellas when it rained!
Again, nothing was too much trouble for them!  Wonderful!  

I would return tomorrow if I could, however the children were slightly 'miffed' that I had not returned with Harry Potter's autograph!

Dublin to me is now definately 'The Dylan'!  The perfect escape!

208,Magical Dylan,"My husband and I stayed at Dylan in June 2007 and had the most wonderful stay.  Yes the hotel is expensive but it is truly a special place to stay.  We upgraded to a style room which was truly stylish, a good size for a city hotel with all the trimmings B&O phone, i-pod, flat-screen tv and some little extras in the fridge.  Really loved the heated floor in the bathroom.  Everything so clean.  The bed so comfortable.  Breakfast was a very relaxing start to the day.  We had a meal in the Still Restaurant again expensive but a very enjoyable eating experience, food top class and the bar very cool.  Loved the candle lit lanterns. Dublin is a magical city which we visit often and now we have experienced Dylan I cannot imagine where else to stay.

208,interesting,"Booked this hotel at the last minute after no availability in Merrion.
Liked the look of the old exterior and contemporary interior.
Easy to find by car which is strange in Dublin.
Concierge team an absolute delight - helpful, enthusiastic, polite and friendly.
Bar was fantastic-  tried four different martinis and the glasses were amazing.
Let down by the room.  We were given a disabled room.  Bathroom was like a tiled box.  Not up to normal wet-room standards.  Underfloor heating is not necessary in hotels and in addition to the heated towel rail and the halogen lights the temperatue in the room was unbearable.  Air-conditioning could not keep up.  We complained about the heat several times to no avail.
Would go back for a drink but not to stay.

208,Perfect Romantic Getaway,"Stayed at the Dylan for a night for a special treat and it certainly lived up to our expectations. Everything from the decor to the staff was fantastic - not sure about some of the reviews on this site which complain about the size of the rooms as ours (307) was much larger than in most Dublin hotels.  It is a little bit out of the centre of town but close to fantastic restaurants in Ballsbridge - Roly's is a personal favourite - and it's easy to get into town but with such a fantastic bar in the hotel its a wonder you'd want to! Breakfast again was great - service a little slow a times but you dont come to this hotel to be in a rush! Will definitely be back!

208,Dylan Rocks!,"Our family stayed at the Dylan for two nights during our trip to Ireland this summer.  We live in Chicago and thus are accustomed to fancy, trendy, modern, antique - all sorts of hotels.  However, I can say, without a doubt, the Dylan is easily the coolest I've ever seen.  Everything about it - the building itself (a fusion of two seemingly separate buidlings), the amazing color schemes, the glamorous decor (trendy without going over the top), and the delectable menu and service at the restaurant/bar, Still (not to mention the incredible design of the restaurant,bar itself).  Together, our family stayed in four rooms at the Dylan and we were amazed to find that each room was completely different but equally gorgeous in its' own way.  The lush details, like the ipod in each room, the B&O phones, the brownies and hand-written welcomes upon arrival, the 24-hour room service and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff  (special thanks to Magali Chamson) skyrocketted the Dylan to the top of our list.  Staying at the Dylan was like being wrapped in one of those dreams that you don't want to wake up from and when you finally have to - when you have to leave - all you want to do is go straight back to sleep and pray to God that you'll fall back into that same amazing dream.

208,Decandent and Delightful,"Stayed in the Dylan Hotel in July 2007 to celebrate a 40th birthday with my wife. The Dylan is a boutique hotel with sumptious decor. We had booked a style room bed and breakfast package and found it wonderful. The staff are extremely helpful and the room was kitted out with flat screen tvs, ipod and a waterproof remote control if you were compelled to channel surf the bathrooms's lcd tv while showering!. The bar in the hotel was great with seamless service. The breakfast which was included was another delightful highlight of a wonderful stay. Definitely a five star with tons of personality and  a decandent style. We loved it!!
",5,2007,07,25
208,Most Comfortable Bed Ever but the Trendy Decor will Date,"We stayed in the hotel as we were attending a concert in the RDS, 15 mins walk so the location was ideal. The staff were warm & friendly.
The hotel is an interior designers dream as this was evident from the
vibrant colours and very modern furniture. Our room was quite small &
so was the bathroom. Loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom and
the ipod in the bedroom. The bed was definitely the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Couldn't get a seat in the bar. I would say this is a pre-club haunt for the locals. We sat outside, which was reserved for residents. Bit disappointed that we couldn't order a sandwich as we were told only room service was available but we were with people so this wasn't an option for us. Enjoyed my stay but overpriced as 395euro for the room for 1 night (breakfast an additional 60euro for the two of us). Had breakfast across the road in the Espresso Bar, definitely overrated as ours was cold and soggy,
probably because they were so busy.

You can part directly outside the hotel at the weekends for free but beware Valey Parking will cost you an extra 20euro, as my friends found out when paying the bill!
",4,2007,07,21
208,Best hotel EVER!,"LOCATION: 25 min walk to the main sites, not the best location, but trust me, to stay here it's worth it.  Safe walk in a nice neighborhoood to sites.  Quick 10 euro cab ride.

HOTEL: I have never been more impressed by a hotel.  No corners were cut and only the best of everything was done here.   Heated floors in the bathroom, heated no-fog mirrors, etc.  Everything from the coffee cups to the mirrors and furniture to the mini bar will have you say ""wow"" and leave you impressed.

Stop looking for places to stay and book this hotel, you may never experience a hotel like this again.
",5,2007,07,17
208,Average,"The Dylan is a stylish hotel and the public areas are very impressive. The staff who greeted us, checked us in, parked the car and carried our bags were very professional and pleasant. The cocktail bar was very nice, and the cocktails were excellent. 

The room itself however was a HUGE let-down. It was really small, and this was not helped by the bell-boy putting up a luggage stand on the only free floor space. There was just enough room to get round the bed, and while the table and chair were very nice the room would have been more spacious without them. Curtains / bedlinen were good quality, but I did not think the room was designed particulary well or impressively. The bathroom was even smaller, no bath - just a shower, and no space round the basin for toiletries etc. The shampoo etc were good quality and big bottles. Breakfast was 30euro per person, so would recommend the cafe straight across the road!
",3,2007,07,16
208,Fantastic Hotel!,"We stayed in the Dylan hotel for one night while attending a concert in the RDS which is apx 15mins walk from the hotel.

We were greeted warmly and shown to our room and filled in on how to use everything. The room itself was gorgeous, really comfie bed, warm towels, underfloor heating in the bathroom and wonderful powerful showers. Everything was immaculately clean.

We had a few drinks in the bar before the concert and again staff couldnt be friendlier, even down to getting ciggerettes for you. There is a lovely outdoor terrace with comfie chairs, candlelight and water features.

We had dinner in the Expresso Cafe across the road from the hotel and it was gorgeous and very reasonable though i think we were lucky to get a table earlier in the evening, booking would prob be advisable if you were goin later.

We returned from the concert to a very busy bar, full of dublins elite so be warned to bring ur best evening wear :) lots of dresses and suits.

Breakfast the following morning was gorgeous and again the staff ever helpful and friendly.

All in all i couldnt find a bad word to say about this hotel. The decor is fantastic, really modern and stylish and the staff are friendly and helpful in every way. Everything is spotless. A return visit is definitely on the cards. Its an absolute must for anyone looking for a special hotel for that romantic weekend away.

208,A High Quality Experience,"Dylan Dublin is a unique experience. Modern, high quality facilities and accomodation that modern yet comfortable.

The staff are excellent and understand the true values of high qulaity customer service with a ""smile"".

I would recommend Dylan either for business or pleasure.
",5,2007,07,02
208,Fanatastic Hotel,"Booked this hotel on the recommendation of  reviews from this website and what a result! As my wife and I arrived at the Dylan  we were instantly greeted by friendly staff, they even booked our Guiness Factory tour as we checked in.

We ate dinner in their restaurant which was wonderful. We would also recommend the hotel bar -very stylish!

Across the road from this hotel is a smart restaurant and coffee bar. We had afternoon drinks at this place and sat next to us was Louis Walsh (X factor) , my wife spend time chatting to Louis , a great genuine guy , as I chilled with a newspaper. 

All in all a great time was had at the Dylan! Top marks!
",5,2007,06,25
208,Fantastic Hotel,"I Was expecting a very good Boutique Hotel and that is exactly what I got. I stayed at The Dylan with my wife on the weekend prior to my midweek stay for work and we had a great time. The check in process was fast & staff very friendly, after being shown to our room, which was large beautifully designed, very clean and great amenities, the member of staff showed us around all the facilities. The bed wow! One of the softest I have ever slept on, the cushions as soft as putting my head on a pile of feathers.
The breakfast was delicious and the restaurant was unique in design. Room service was as you would expect any 5* hotel to be, cool mini bar items just to round of my stay.

This hotel has been open since September 2006 and I hope it will be open for a very long time.
Highly recommended

208,"Dylan Hotel, Dublin - Great Hotel & Staff","The Dylan Hotel in Dublin is a superb hotel and should not be missed.  It is off the beaten path from busy and congested downtown Dublin, yet you can get to all the popular tourist hangouts via walking or a short cab ride.  The hotel is modern, clean and newly renovated.  The staff is fantastic as can be seen in this example.

My wife and I started our Europe honeymoon at the Dylan.  The stay was great and we had a wonderful time.  The time came for us to leave and catch a plane to Venice, we were a bit rushed (our fault) and the concierge brought our car around.  The drive to the airport was a bit challenging as we have never been to Dublin before.  Halfway to the airport we realized that in all our haste we forgot our luggage!  There was no way we could get back to the hotel, then to the airport and make our flight!  We called the Dylan and the concierge (Zoltan I believe his name was) immediately rushed our bags to the airport in his own car and met us at the departure gate.  We made our flight with only minutes to spare.  Now that is the best service I have ever had from a hotel staff and I guarantee that when I reture to Dublin we will stay at the Dylan.

We stayed in the Dylan in mid April.From the moment we arrived
we had the most wonderful experience.From the valet parking to the exceptional serivce throughout the hotel,the staff were fantastic. Try the Cosmopolitans in the bar,before dinner,in the restaurant.We had the tasting menu,it is not to be missed.
The hotel is ideal,for a relaxing break,central to the city and the Dundrum Shopping Centre.We are looking forward to our next trip there.Go on spoil yourself - or better still let the Dylan team spoil you.

208,Lovely decor - small rooms,"Boutique style hotel with excellent decor and very attentive, friendly and efficient staff.  Reasonably good and quiet location roughly 10 minute walk from Grafton Street.  Good quality furnishings, TFT TV, iPods, B&O phone, spa jet style shower and very comfortable bed.  Overall, probably not worth the cost (cheapest room ¬£190 bed only) due to the rather cramped room.
",3,2007,05,29
208,10 out of 10,"We stayed for one night as a treat to ourselves. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable e.g the receptionist escorted us to the room rather than the usual point and vague directions. She made sure we were happy with the room and explained how everything worked. My husband loved all the gadgets particulary the Bose ipod station.  

Anything I asked for arrived within a minute or two. All staff were extremely polite and attentive at all times.

We booked the Style Room and I'm glad as I believe the standard rooms are a bit small.  Our room was very big and we had more than enough space plus a king size bed. The bathroom was a joy containing seperate bath and shower and two sinks (again very large). The underfloor heating, non steam mirrors and massage shower plus rain shower head were major plus points.  We had drinks in the bar which was lovely too. Breakfast was excellent if a little slow on service but it was a minor complaint. All in all we loved it and wil definately be back. This is a very modern hotel, extremely stylish, very 'in' right now in Dublin and what makes it stand out is all the thought and attention that goes into the little details. Five Star.",5,2007,05,28
208,Definitely Dylan,"I stayed there in mid April and I cannot say enough positive things about it. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful with any questions or concerns you might have. A fresh bottle of water is supplied in the room everyday. The bar and adjoining outdoor area are perfect for any adult beverage enjoyment you might have. The whole hotel is very smartly adorned and candle filled at night for an
extra special romantic touch.

It is located in a very quiet and quaint part of town. There are great pubs just a couple of blocks away and it's a short walk or even
shorter cab ride to the more popular areas.

As far as other reviews that claim the rooms are small, not all are. I stayed in a corner room that was very large and had a small balcony. The bed was two beds put together but it added up to a huge and comfortable nights sleep.",5,2007,05,22
208,wonderful Honeymoon,"Had three nigths at Dylan for a short honeymoon and from the minute the taxi pulled up outside the hotel the service was second to none.I was feeling a bit sick after suffering the smelliest taxi driver that I have ever encountered.A glass of water was waiting for me in the room how they got there before me I dont know. The hotel turns into a sea of candles at night perfect for a romantic break. Our room was huge with stunning decor and our every need catered for. Oh and the beds are out of this world. The walk to Graffton street is easy only about 10 mins. We will be returning for our first anniversary.
",5,2007,05,16
208,Excellent choice,"I chose the Dylan for my husbands birthday and was so pleased I did. We have travelled across the world and stayed in many luxury hotels and this is definitly up there with the best. I dislike hotels where all the rooms are indentikit but here they are all different and with out of the ordinary furniture and decor, all very stylish and contemporary with very comfy beds and a great shower. 

The service was great and friendly, we arrived early morning but they said that a room would be available in 20 mins so they gave us a pot of tea and coffee whilst we waited. They also gave my husband a cake and a card on his birthday which was a very nice touch. 

The position was residential and quiet and about a 15 minute easy walk to Grafton Street which was lovely to do of a morning after a few Guiness the night before !! I couldn't fault the Dylan and would thoroughly recommend it.
",5,2007,05,07
208,Quaint but pink,"The Dylan was a pleasent enough experience, however its distance from Grafton Street was not  compensated enough for by the room .. expensive yet tiny and minimalistic in everyway...for the money that you would spend and the service you expect, the Four Seasons, not that faraway beats it hands down...quaint but just not there yet...
",2,2007,05,06
208,Excellent,"Spent one night in the Dylan recently with my wife and had a great time. The service from all the members of staff was exceptional and I would not hesitate to go back. Only negatives are the rooms are quite small as people have said and it is reasonably expensive I fealt compared to some other 5star hotels I have stayed in. All in all though I would not hesitate in returning.
",5,2007,05,05
208,Love the Dylan!,"Booked a night in the Dylan for my boyfriends birthday. He didn't know where we were going so he really got a kick out of it, having heard great reviews from work associates. We booked a good deal online on their own website. (be sure you bring a printout of the booking confirmation with you as there was one little bit of confusion as to whether breakfast was included in the rate, which it was, but they didn't seem to have this recorded). 
The service and the welcome was fabulous. The decor was stunning. We were lucky cos the weather was gorgeous and we sat out on the terrace for coffee the next morning with the sun streaming down on us and it was so peaceful and quiet - hard to believe you're in the centre of Dublin. The rooms are small, so don't expect them to be huge, other hotels in Dublin have bigger rooms. The beds are also normal double so if you're used to King-sized at home, you might find it a bit of a squeeze! But the mattresses are super-comfortable, and the showers are great with lovely full-size Etro toiletries. Slippers and Robes are provided. I told them it was his birthday and they left the yummiest chocolate brownies in the room for us. The breakfast was gorgeous. Will be returning...

208,Cool & Unique,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Dylan. Great bar (that can get really busy) with a cool outdoor area for summer nights & smokers. The room we had was on a higher floor and was quite small, but very cozy and clean.  Really enjoyed all aspects of the hotel.  Locationwise, it's a little outside the city center-- 20 minute walk into town, but in probably the nicest area of Dublin. Great place for a weekend break for couples or friends.
",5,2007,04,23
208,Wonderful stay,"Booked the hotel based on the reviews found here and sooo glad I did!  The staff is absolutely wonderful, they truly do cater to your needs and go out of their way to help you.  The decor is  contemporary all the way and oh so lovely.  In terms of the rooms, yes the bed is absolutely out of this world; the bathroom is a highlight with the warm tiles and wonderful toilettries as are the other special touches (B&O phones, Bose soundDock - which made my hubby very happy).  It is a hotel that opened late last year and there were a few Dubliners that I talked to who had not heard of it...certainly a well kept secret!
",5,2007,04,08
208,Excellent service shame about the room,"This is a glam boutique hotel where the service is excellent they really do look after you which is to be expected from any hotel in this day and age but alas does not always happen!
its 25- 30 min walk to Grafton street 
However our only quibble was the room for 245euro you could not swing a cat in it . It was uncomfortable due to its size on getting out of bed u had to bend sideways to avoid cracking toes on a chair
The bathroom great sized shower which lacked pressure and a sink where there was no room to leave vanity/wash bag so u use the floor!! For me it was not enough to declare good toiletres, under floor heating etc if the room is so darn small it takes away from it all.
I would compare this hotel to the Hoxton in london in terms of location and similar design with the Dylan been more wallpaper pinks and greens boudoir chic alas with smaller rooms its in nice area outside city centre with trendy eatiers nearby which I believe 245 euro was 2 over priced if they lower their rack rate they might just corner a niche market in Dublin ie; why stay here when I can be bang in centre of city for a few dollars more!!!!
I have paid this amount and less for 5 star hotels with lavish rooms,  everything laid on...
",3,2007,03,28
208,Absolutely Loved the Dylan,"Just come back from a fantastic 3 night stay at the Dylan hotel with my boyfriend. Initially we really struggled to choose somewhere to stay in Dublin, mainly due to the lack of choice available at the particular time we where going and to be honest the cost of some the hotels and what they were offering. I have to say that initially I thought the Dylan was going to be too expensive for a weekend away, but the reviews and the hotel website won me over.  And I am SOOOO glad!!

The Dylan is pure luxury, the room was fabulous with all the added extras you can imagine and want from a hotel.  The best thing about the whole stay was definitely the 7th Heaven bed; I couldn‚Äôt sleep properly in my own one when I got home!!! The heated floor in the bathroom was another favourite of mine!  There were also little touches, like the turn down service, which always left you a bottle of water each and a little chocolate that made the stay special.  The mini bar also has some surprises if you so wish!

The Dylan‚Äôs location is to be fair a good 10 minutes walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street, but a lovely walk after the also fabulous breakfasts at the Dylan.  Although I would agree with some other reviewers that the breakfast is a tad expensive, however ours was included in the price and the service was impeccable. 

The hotel bar was jumping on both the Friday and Saturday nights and is clearly a place to be seen in.

Overall as you can read, if you are looking for a luxurious and contemporary hotel, with fabulous service and all the little touches that make your stay extra special in Dublin then the Dylan is the place for you.

208,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed with my parter here as a suprise for 1 night. The hotel was clean, and modern, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
The room was absolutley fantastic, with the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! The bathroom was pure luxury, I particularly liked the shower and heated floor tiles.
I had a small problem with getting a refund but back onto my card, after a deposit had been taken, but the staff were very obliging and sent me a cheque in the post. I would definately stay here again, and would recomend anyone to this hotel.
",5,2007,03,27
208,Great Hotel,"We had a 3 day visit to Dublin & this hotel and found it to be a great stay.  Staff extremely helpful thoughout, from pre trip recommendations on restaurants to visit (which we had a good experience with unlike a previous reviewer, luck of the draw maybe), to arranging for a couple of gifts to be set up in the room for my partner on arrival.

The hotel is very modern throughout without losing a 'friendly' relaxed feeling & we found their restaurant and bar facilities worth a visit.

As previous reviewers have said, this hotel is slightly out of the centre of town, but just a short 10/15 minute stroll which was no bother & would be a very quick taxi ride - it was worth this small inconvenience for the quality of the stay I thought.

One tip - the breakfast is v expensive but almost directly opposite the hotel is a great little cafe which serves excellent cooked breakfasts (seems to also do a v good trade in lunches & evening meals too), so unless you are on business/expenses, this is a convenient and cheaper alternative.

208,Great Hotel Only one bad experience,"Stayed at the Dylan and i have to say that it was a experience, Loved it. Stayed there for four nights from the 6th of March till the 10th of march and everything was what i expected there are only a few grumbles that i could outline: 
1. turndown was a little short of good as they knocked on the door asking if they could turn down the room when they knew that we were going out as we booked a taxi with the reception team, just maybe that they could have checked with reception wheather we were going to be going out or not as this performance happend twice and both times we booked taxis to go out. 
2. asking the concierge to book a table at a good resturant in the local area we went for his reccomondation and unforunallty this is not a great experience as this was a pretty adismal experience as it was our last night and we wanted something nice but in the Local area, maybe they need to brush up on local knowledge. 

But overall would reccomend anyone to stay here as it was extremly good.",4,2007,03,12
208,"Fantastic staff, brilliant hotel","Being a Dub myself I have stayed in many places in the city, however this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff just could not do enough for you, extremely helpful and with a great sense of humour. Hip hotel with a great bar for people watching - don't think about staying anywhere else in Dublin - go on treat yourself, you're worth it!
",5,2007,03,12
208,"Nice room, poor restaurant","My wife and I stayed over one night in the Dylan and its indeed a stylish well apointed property with nice room and well thought out design. The bed was great, and we did not have the noise issue suffered by other guests in this review.

However, the restaurant was another matter. At front of house the stay were pleasent and helpful, however the food was a big disapointment. My wife had red mullet which arrived over cooked, dry and tastless. When we complained a staff member returned and suggest ""that's how chef always cooks red mullet"" - a replacement was brought which was edible. but disapointing. My beef fillet was an excellent piece of meet but absolutely picked in salt, which impacted the dining experience. The starters were passable, but barely just, with an overpowering duck jus reduction on the fois grois that. once again. overpowered the dish - again we gave this feedback but nothing was done.

Im summary, this is a delightful boutique hotel with a nice bar and smoking area, but eat elsewhere.
",2,2007,03,11
208,"Finally, a good boutique hotel in Dublin","This hotel is pretty fancy for Dublin.  I grew up in Dublin and remember when fancy meant tinned peaches for dessert.  I travel back a lot and normally stay at The Clarence, The Morrison or The Westin.  The Dylan is totally different to these - or any other hotel in Dublin.  Original, grown-up; the people who run it have paid real attention to the details, right down to the cutlery in the restaurant.  Someone has spent a lot of money on making this hotel, and it is a quality product.  Friendly staff, who are super-attentive, but not in an irritating way; great amenities in the rooms; pretty funky common areas; clean, fresh and modern; and it is located in a beautiful part of Dublin, which is an easy 10 minute walk to town, but nowhere near the vomit and kebabs of Temple Bar.  This place is definitely going to be my home from home in Dublin!
",5,2007,02,28
208,Love Dyaln - will be back n,"Stayed at the Dyaln in February with my partner for 2 nights, it is a sanctuary of peace, sophistication and epitome of class, special mention to Fiona for ensuring that we had a wonderful stay. 

From the moment you arrive to when you leave you are welcomed by a professional, efficient team of dedicated staff who go above and beyond what you would normally expect to find in a smaller boutique hotel...everything about the place is perfection...we stayed in a style room...fabulously luxurious...heated flooring...ipod...plasma screen tv...and the beds are definitely to die for! 

Eating in the restaurant is also a must...as the food is among some of the best that we have eaten...the service again is excellent...Couldn't fault it and the bar is destined to be amongst one of the best in Dublin...

...Only one fault...the people leaving the bar (and smokers outside) have a tendency to be fairly noisy and not always courteous to residents - earplugs in and not a problem...

...Would recommend to anyone...we will be back...
",5,2007,02,18
208,Loved The Personal Touch,"Me and my boyfriend spent three days at the Dylan Hotel in January. The hotel is approx 15 min stroll from the main shopping area around Grafton Street. Even in freezing cold January the walk was quite pleasant.  The hotel is located on at the far end of a mainly residential side street overlooking what appears to be a small park.  Many people including the taxi drivers did not know of it's existance, but when they see it everyone is very impressed. We arrived early evening and were met at our taxi by a smartly dressed attendant who escorted us along with our luggage to the hotel reception.  We were greeted by name and showed to our room by a very polite young lady who continued to brief us about all the gadgets within the room.  The gadgets included an ipod and Bose docking station, plasma tv and bang & olufsen phone - very smart!!!  Plush robes and slippers were also provided.  We got our room at a special internet rate and although it was beautifully decorated and V stylish it was a little on the small side and did not have a bath (although did have a shower for two!) considering we still paid a pretty hefty price.  Nevertheless I can't grumble as we were only there for a couple of days so it was more than adequate, and had we wanted a larger and perhaps more elaborate room we could have booked one (and paid the extra for it), I would definateley recommend doing this if it is a special occassion as I saw inside a couple of the more expensive rooms and they were fantasic.  On that note it was my boyfriends birthday that weekend and the hotel welcomed us to our room with some rather scrumptious choccie cake.  We ordered room service a couple of times, again very expensive, but so fab...what a choice, even for those on a bit of a health kick, egg white only scrambled eggs, fresh fruit smoothies with ginseng etc etc!  The mini bar was just as elaborate and even included a naughty 'night in' kit.  Every night they offered a turn down service, whereby they put out robes and slippers, got the bed ready and left mineral water and choccies.  They have though of everything at this hotel.  In your room you have a professional hairdryer, umbrella and if you have forgotten your hair straighteners you just need to call front desk and they will have some sent up straight away.  You can even hire a mobile phone, laptop, organise an babysitter or spa treatment in your room.  I actually forgot my toothpaste, a quick call and within two mins they sent a tube to my room FOC. Every time a member of the staff saw us they greeted us by name and made us feel like VIP's.  The hotel decor is very funky I loved it.  The bar is busy with 'it' people on the weekend and I was surprised to see that the restaurant (food looked fab by the way) was also busy even though in my opinion it was expensive.  Could not find fault, perfect boutique hotel...made us feel like celebrities!",5,2007,02,11
208,The experience was a treasure!,"We just returned from a four night stay at the Dylan and could not be more pleased with our experience. We immediately felt at home from the instant we walked through the doors. The personal tour of the hotel areas on the ground floor was quite impressive.  

Even though the check-in time is listed as 1:00 pm, our flight from Chicago arrived at 7:30 am and we were at the hotel by 9:00 am and were allowed to check-in upon arrival which was especially appreciated but not expected.

The room was everything we had hoped for and more, particularly the 7th Heaven bed. The plasma television was awesome and the sitting area with the bay window was my favorite parking place after a full day of walking the city & pubs.

We did not eat at Still but we did have in-room dining our last night which was excellent. The coffee service that we ordered in-room each morning was near and dear to my wife. She also enjoyed the shampoo and conditioner provided by the hotel. The heated floor in the bathroom and heated towel rack had her smiling.

A few side notes: The expresso bar across the street is a nice place to start the day, especially the fresh squeezed orange juice.
Foley's and Quays are excellent places for a nice meal and a few pints. The Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol are must sees.  Walking through the city and shopping is a must do.

Everyone we met during our stay were at a minimum pleasant and helpful but extremely social and a pleasure to converse with during  the majority of our encounters. The staff at the Dylan was no exception. They have done a superb job in each and every aspect. We hope to return in 2008. We had too much fun!",5,2007,01,17
208,Loved the look,"Only got to stay one night what a shame. From the moment we entered the hotel it was like we were celebrities. We were greeted at the door and taking over to a very plush reception area and introduced to a friendly young lady who checked us in. We were then taking  to our room and what a room, has all the mod cons you would expect from a 5* hotel and also some little extras. I Pod and docking station, funky phone and free internet access through out the hotel which is a bonus.

The bed was just amazing we did not want to get out of it, they are called 7th heaven.

We did not get the chance to dine but did have a drink in the bar and was very impressed with the very extended menu and not bad prices.
 
The whole design was well thought out and no money was spared. The staff are very friendly and helpful.

When back in Dublin again will be staying at Dylan but hope that we will get the chance to stay a little longer.

208,Young with alot to learn,"My Girlfriend and I stayed at the Dylan over the New Year period and although the hotel certainly has a unique charm it still has alot to learn.

Whilst the ""Dream Beds"" are indeed a wonderful experience it is difficult not to be woken from a deep sleep by the hotel staff going about their daily chores in the hotel corridors.

Doors banging, hoovering at 9am and the odd staff conversation right outside my door. Need i say more.

Ok I will,  the hotel only has one lift and some stepped corridors so baggage transfer was difficult and would advise anyone with mobility issues to confirm room location prior to checkin !
I would agree with previous comments that the concierge team need to be more familar with the Dublin area and would suggest a more mature employee in this area is essential!

Whilst Dublin has nothing else like it the Clarence and the Four Seasons still have much more to offer and have nothing to worry about.

COULD AND SHOULD BE DOING BETTER !!

208,Stylish place in a quiet part of Dublin,"We stayed here on the first night of a week long tour of Ireland and were not dissapointed. The Dylan is a new arrival on the Dublin boutique hotel scene, and it looks pretty amazing. From the elegant design, the quirky chairs in the bar through to the hi-tech gadgets in the room, this place has been carefully thought out with money no object.

The staff were friendly, helpful and of course stylish. 

The room was a very good size, well presented and cosy, and as always, the little extras make all the difference; great toiletries - and loads of them - water, chocs on pillow. The ipod and dock were great. 

Didn't eat in the restaurant but looked like the place to be.

Overall a great, chic and elegant place to be seen rather than to relax. Highly recommended.

208,Absolutely the Best,"Where do I begin

Hubby and I celebrated our 19th anniversary in Dublin Ireland and stayed at the Dylan.  I knew it would be a great hotel just by reading trip advisor and seeing photos.  When we arrived at the hotel we were blown away.  We expected the hotel to be awesome, but everything about the hotel exceeded our expectations.

When the staff found out that we were celebrating our anniversary, they upgrated our room.  If you do not read another word of this report, realize the hotel is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!  

The staff took extremely good care of us.  Our concierge 'Patrick' answered every question, gave us great suggestions on entertainment options and made reservations for us as we requested.    We felt like rock stars!!!!

The hotel is modern, chic and warm.  Our room was awesome.  We had state of the art TV and music available.  The toiletries were of the highest quality.  There was even a nice umbrella available for our use for those rainy Dublin Days.  We never had to use the umbrella, because during our stay, Dublin was unseasonably warm and sunny in Jan.  If I did not know any better, I would swear Patrick ordered the sunny weather to make our anniversary special.  I'm not kidding, Patrick as well as the hotel staff was just that good!!!

After returning to our room in the evening, we had complimentary treats for us and a nice card for us.  The bed was prepared and chocolates were on our pillow.  I can go on for days about the comfort of our bed--the best night's rest we had.  

I have two regrets.  First, our camera's batteries died so we could not take photos.  Second, we only had two days to expore Ireland and we  picked such a great hotel that it was hard  to leave the room!

We have traveled to many places in Europe, Asia, USA and Central America.  We have stayed at some great places as well as places not so great.   I rarely write review about hotels.  I would be remiss if I did not tell the world about the Dylan.
",5,2007,01,08
208,Nothing is too much trouble,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dylan over New Year and it was a fantastic, unforgetable experience. The hotel is luxurious and beautifully designed and the room are incredibly comfortable. It was hard for us to get out of the 7th heaven beds! 

The service in particular makes the Dylan special - nothing was too much trouble for the staff, from arranging restaurants to booking cabs to its complimentary shoe cleaning service. Nice extra touches included little chocolates and goodnight poems on the pillows at night, with complementary bottles of water. 

The bar is special, reflected in the amount of people who weren't residents, who travelled to it to have a drink. 

The only small qualm was that there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room, which can prove expensive on room service. Having said that, some of the food on offer on the in-room dining menu was very reasonably priced. It is also worth noting that it is a fair distance from the town centre - about a 30 minute walk. 

I would definitely recommend the Dylan for a special occasion or if you are looking to impress.
",5,2007,01,03
208,Spoil Yourself,"I searched so many hotels and a friend recommended Trip Advisor. Based on the reviews I booked the Dylan and I'm so glad I did.  It is an amazing hotel, it wraps you up in its atmosphere the moment you walk through the door.  It's been said over and over but the staff are ace, really friendly and helpful and they call you by your name and remember you.  Makes you feel like you're someone rather than an anonymous person staying at any old hotel.

The room was superb, very spacious, highly thought out and yes the underfloor heating in the bathroom is wonderful.  The bed to die for and hard to get out off in the morning and the ipod just adds to the overall ambience.

It is an expensive hotel, but kinda worth the pamper affect you feel, although it would be nice to have had breakfast included in the price and depending on speed of walking its about a 10-20 min walk from the main hub of Dublin.

Even so I would most definitely stay there again, the area of Dublin its in, is very quite and there are some shops and restaurants just around the corner.

Well worth the visit and stay in a very romantic hotel.
",5,2006,12,21
208,Stylish and Friendly,"Having read the previous reviews on Tripadvisor I booked a room in the Dylan Hotel for an overnight stay. First impressions were good - friendly reception staff who allowed us to book in early (about 11am) and a wonderfully designed and themed reception area, guest library and bar.

The standard room was large and very comfortable, with lots of nice touches (for example, an iPod music system, underfloor heating in the bathroom and a velvet Z for the door to let others know not to disturb you!). The bed was fantastic and the decor is very chic.

The hotel is a ten minute walk from the main shopping and entertainment areas in the city, but this then means that the hotel is in a quiet area for sleeping.

The only food we had in the hotel was breakfast, of which there was plenty and of a high standard.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for a romantic stay or for a bit of pampering! The best thing about the hotel has to be the very friendly and accommodating staff, who made us feel that we were in a  'home from home'.
",5,2006,12,18
208,A real GEM,"Well what can I cay that hasn't already been said in the previous reviews...

My husband and I spent four nights here and it truly is one of the best city boutique hotels we have ever the stayed in. The rooms are large, well decked out with plasma screen tv and i pods, not to mention the sumptuous 7th heaven bed! The staff are welcoming, friendly and nothing you ask of them is too much trouble. The bar serves a good range of cocktails and is very 'buzzy' at weekends. Menu prices were a little on the expensive side but over the road is a fabulous Expresso bar which is also a restaurant, serving a wide variety of different dishes. 
The hotel is situated in a quiet area of Dublin, about a 20 minute stroll to Grafton Street and the centre.

208,Jaw droping design with no expence spared,"Celebrated my wifes 40th birthday with a nights stay at the Dylan. It is by far the most amazing hotel we have stayed in. The staff were delightful, the room was beyond expectation and the restaurant fantastic.
",5,2006,12,07
208,Nothing short of perfect!,"From the moment that you enter the front courtyard and entrance to the Dylan - the experience begins.  And, it is nothing short of perfect.  This hotel designer, staff, and management have ""got it"".

The decor is incredible in it's uniqueness, however, has juxtoposed style and comfort.  From the lobby with it's red leather studded posts, the white library, to the red bar - each space is fantastic.  The rooms haven't missed a beat either.  The bed and linens are divine, loaded ipod to use, high ceilings, great lighting, and bathrooms that have light, space, style and beautiful amenities.

Travelling alone, I almost expected to be intimidated by the stylish, young, dressed in black staff - but couldn't have been treated better.  They called me by name, made all my bookings from drivers to restaurants, and greeted my son when he and his rugby mates came to have dinner with me in the amazing restaurant.  The restaurant is truly one of the best I have been to.

They have only been open a few months, and I guarantee, when the rest of Dublin's chic and the world's most discriminate travellers discover the Dylan, it will be THE place to be.

Could not find fault.
",5,2006,12,05
208,Magic & Sparkle give two thumbs fresh to the Dylan :-),"We stayed at the Dylan for Magic's birthday and had a fantastic weekend. :-)

We arrived very early in the day and our room was ready upon arrival. Staff were very helpful and friendly, so much so that after i mentioned that it was Magic's birthday they left some lovely little chocolate birthday cakes in our room (see pics!).  It was the little touches like this that made our stay so lovely.

It felt very decadent to be getting ready in the morning - using the complementary IPOD to listen to a bit of Frank Sinatra while lounging around in the gorgeous dressing gowns, with the plasma screen on and taking in the the sumptuous surroundings - has to be the best way of easing yourself into a weekend of enjoying the hustle, bustle and great time that Dublin is.

To boot, Dylan has the trendiest cocktail bar we saw in Dublin - full of local movers and shakers all doing their best to look fabulous - not our bag as such, but provided oodles of comedy for us in terms of people watching (and pointing, staring and laughing...)

It's a 10 minute walk into the centre of Dublin from the Dylan, which we loved as you get to see more of the Georgian grandeur that Dublin has to offer. We stopped at Foleys on the way back one night which was a nice break in the walk if you find it tiresome.

We managed to pack a lot into our stay in Dublin, places that we would really recommend are:

Guiness Storehouse: Obvious but very interesting, and great views of the city from the 360 degree viewpoint bar. Best to book tickets online as you won't have to endure the long queues to get in with express entry and a 10% discount.

Kilmainham Gaol: Little way out but just down the road from the Guiness Storehouse. Is a fantastic History lesson and gives great background of the 1916 Easter uprising that made Ireland what it is today. (It's the same prison Mr Bridger was in during the original Italian job, much to Magic's delight.)

Ice skating at Smithfields: We know this is not there all year round but it was great fun to be ice skating in the freezing cold for as long as our delicate little feet would allow! And is just down the road from a large shopping area and new tram stop.

Porterhouse bar in Temple Bar: Fantasic pub across several floors. Has its own brewery and a fabulous range of world beers for you to try. Its great for the boys in the beer stakes and has hair straighteners in the toilets for the ladies :o)

Gruel, Dame Street: We had our best meal in Dublin at this little cafe, it doesn't look like anything special but that is it's charm. it's not about the decor, it's all about the food here. Delicious, home cooked and fresh food served by friendly people in a unique and comfortable environment.

Olyesya's Wine Bar, Exchequer Street: This a sumptious wine bar which just begs you to sit down, drink and talk. Discreet and polite service, fantastic range of really high quality wines - and a range of antipasti platters which make your mouth water. Luuuuuuuuuuvelllly. It's just opposite a fantastic food shop called Fallon & Byrne, which has an amazing array of world and local produce. 

We have already recommended the Dylan to friends and family, it's a great place to base yourself when you are in Dublin to ensure that you are relaxed and refreshed enough to explore the city. The seventh heaven beds worked wonders to sleep away any tiredness from walking and drinking in this fair city.",5,2006,12,03
208,quality,"just spent 2 nights at Dylan for my beloved's 40th. although only opened 2 months ago, this place has really got it's act together. feels new with everything pristine but no sense of panic you sometimes feel in new hotels. Pricey considering it's a boutique and by definition short on facilities, but great staff, trendy and smart.  marked down because it's not central.
",4,2006,11,29
208,Oh My Goodness!! This place is amazing!!,"The Dylan was a dream come true! My boyfriend and i were looking for something 'boutique' with lots of character and a bit exclusive. I'd seen all the pictures on the stylish website and thought it looked stunning but I have to admit, I did think 'Can it really be that lovely?'. And I have to say that it was better than the web-images. The actual space is bigger and more atmospheric than I expected and despite being high design, felt very relaxed and welcoming. The staff were all wonderful and made you feel completely at home- in fact I'd like to move in (just don't tell my cat...!). We managed to drag ourselves away from our beautiful room (gorgeous furnishing), driffted down through the amazing corridors (really- they are very cool!) to eat at Still. We are both food lovers, and both the food and the service were superb. The location was great too. I'd initially been worried that it might be a bit far out of town but it was just a nice 15-20minute stroll away from Trinity and it was actually nice to get away from the bustle of Temple Bar. The area that surrounds the Dylan is a little bit like London's 'Notting Hill' with some great bars and places to eat. What more can I say, except I want to go back soon! And if you go, I hope you like it too!
",5,2006,11,03
208,One in a million,"WOW - that's all i can say about this hotel. For such a new property this place has everything almost perfect.
I work in the business myself and so would be quite critical - however I could fault almost nothing at Dylan. 
It is a really unique product - there is nothing else like it in Dublin. From the moment we entered the lobby we felt special - from the concierge who parked our car, to the front desk staff who showed us to our room, to the service and food at dinner that night, not to mention the breakfast the next morning. the decor is amazing - so often places try to be too ""cool"" and manage to get it drastically wrong - Dylan have got it just right. It is intimate and cosy yet trendy. The one thing that stuck out for me was that for such a high class hotel, it was not stuffy and you were made to feel so welcome. The outdoor terrace area is great, and not just for smokers - there are lovely patio chairs and tables, plasma screens and heaters.
We very rarely dine in a hotel we are staying in, however we had heard such good reports about ""Still"" that we thought we would give it a try. And we were so glad we did - amazing food - I haven't had a steak like it since I was in Shanahan's on the Green. The service was amazing and not at all overbearing. 
Although breakfast was not included in our rate we decided to finish off our stay in style - and it was everything we expected. The only thing I would point out is that the cold buffet wasn't as ""wow"" as I was expecting in a 5 star hotel - just a basic trestle table with a white cloth and the display could have been better, but the smoked salmon was the best I've had and the cooked breakfast was so tasty.
Overall I couldn't recommend this hotel enough - next time you are staying in Dublin city centre please try it - it's a hidden gem.
",5,2006,11,03
208,Absolutely Amazing!,"I heard through word of mouth about this new hotel that was opening in Dublin. Out of curiousity, I wanted to see what the buzz was all about. Being a jaded New Yorker, my expectations were some what squewed to the negative, however, I was very pleasantly surprised. The design of the building, from the rooms to the lounges, to the restaurant, were incredible.
The service staff, particularly a front desk person by the name of Madison, were the most professional I've seen. And, I am a professional person who travels a large percentage of my time.
If you are interested in staying at a hip, very up to date hotel, that's not far off the beaten path off the center of Dublin, this is the place to be. While the prices may seem a little higher at first, after one hour in this hotel, I realised that I was certainly getting my money's worth.
I would highly recommend this hotel, as THE place to stay in Dublin but, for now, I would like to keep this hotel as my little secret.
",5,2006,10,12
208,Fab!,"I've stayed at a number of hotels in Dublin, but nothing like this. I booked through the website because the pictures looked stunning, but when I got there the place exceeded my expectations. Wow! you have to see it to believe it!
Gorgeous decor throughout the lobby. Courteous staff, very friendly. The bar and restaurant had a vibrating buzz, it was a busy night but everybody seemed to be relaxed and enjoying.
I was brought up to the room by one of the receptionists and surprise! I got a beautiful room with a plama on the bathroom!
Oh! and the 7th Heaven bed... best night sleep in my life!
Really worth the money

208,New kid on the block !,"Firstly even though they have gone through a series of soft openings, there are still learning and its going to be a while before everything comes together. This is my only quibble ;  they are charging the highest price for their standard rooms in Dublin at present., and this is for the moment a unfinished product in terms of some aspects of servive and logistics. However I had one of the best nights sleep ever in a hotel I really did not want to get out of bed. The rooms are fantastic, contempory but comfortable, and even though in a new extension they have managed to create some character. The public areas are great , the libary reminds me of Carlisle Bay in Antiga. The room service snacks were of a good standard but the breakfast buffet was poor. In general the service needs to work to a slightly higher standard but that will come with time. Great location also.

208,"Sch√∂nes Haus, beim Personal fehlt es an Engagement","Das Hotel ist etwas Ausserhalb vom Stadtkern. Zu Fuss geht man etwa 10 Minuten bis der Stadtkern beginnt. Das Hotel ist sehr sch√∂n, die Einrichtung stylisch. Leider fehlt es bei gewissen Mitarbeitern etwas an Engagement und Herzblut.

Wir kamen um 14.10 beim Hotel an. Unser Zimmer war noch nicht parat. Die ist ok - versprochen wird es auf 15 Uhr. Dass man uns aber nur halbwegs freundlich begr√ºsste und wir uns wie in einem Kettenhotel f√ºhlten, passt nicht. Auch, dass die 3 Personen an der Reception nicht geholfen haben unsere Koffer die Stufen hochzutragen war irritierend. 

Wir kamen um 15.15 Uhr zur√ºck. Unser Zimmer war nicht parat. Die Dame hat uns dann in ein anderes Zimmer gebucht. Da wir nochmals die Kreditkarte hinterlegen mussten, dauert dieses Prozedere sehr lange. Wir fragten uns zudem, weshalb man um 14.10 Uhr nicht gleich umbuchte. Aber egal.

Das Zimmer war im Neubau und sch√∂n eingerichtet. Super auch die sch√∂ne Bar, die jeden Abend G√§ste hat und so zu einem ruhigen Treffpunkt verkommt.

Die Nacht konnten wir nicht gut schlafen. Gleich ausserhalb des nicht gut isolierten Fenster, ist ein grosses Pub. Der einzige Ger√§uschpegel in der Nachbarschaft, aber der hat es in sich. Erst um ca. 1 Uhr wurde es Still. Doch dann wurden die Glasflaschen geleert und um ca. 5 Uhr kam auch schon die Putzmaschine.

M√ºde, gingen wir am morgen zur Reception und baten um ein anderes. Zimmer. Diesen Wunsch wurde uns rasch und unkompliziert erf√ºllt - vielen Dank. Als wir am Abend ins neue Zimmer kamen, war das Gep√§ck schon parat. Leider hatte jemand die Klimaanlage auf 19 Grad eingestellt. Das Zimmer war entsprechend eis kalt. Es war unangenehm und da es keine Heizung hatte, hatten wir eine weitere schlechte Nacht und die ganze Nacht kalte Nasen.

Am Morgen wollten wir uns mit einem Kaffee aus der Nespresso-Maschine bedienen. Ungl√ºcklicherweise war die Maschine defekt.

Als wir in die Stadt gingen informierten wir das Team an der Recption, dass die Kaffeemaschine defekt ist und, dass wir eine kalte Nacht hatten. Man soll bitte schauen, ob man das Zimmer etwas heizen kann. Auf keinen Fall nicht mehr die Klimaanlage einschalten.

Vor dem Essen um ca. 17 Uhr kamen wir zur√ºck und trauten unseren Augen nicht. Die Kaffeemaschine funktionierte noch immer nicht und im Zimmer war die Klimaanlage wieder auf 19 Grad eingestellt. In einem guten Haus mit einem engagierten Team, w√§re so etwas nie passiert. Wie kann man einen Kundenwunsch einfach ignorieren?

Ich habe den Manager verlangt. Dieser ist ins Zimmer gekommen und hat 15 Minuten die Kaffeemaschine versucht zu reparieren (es lag am Strom). Da wir duschen wollten, weil wir eine Restaurant-Reservation hatten, musste ich ihn bitten sp√§ter nochmals zu kommen um die Heizung zu pr√ºfen.

Bevor wir zum Abendessen gingen, ging ich nochmals zu ihm zur reception und bat ihn, zu schauen, dass wir nicht mehr kalt haben die Nacht. ""Trus me"" waren seine Worte - und ich glaube ihm.

Um 23 Uhr kamen wir zur√ºck zum Zimmer und? Die Klimaanlage war aus, aber das Zimmer war noch immer kalt (19.5 Grad?). Ich f√ºhlte mich genarrt und ging zum Manager. Er sagte mir, er h√§tte das Zimmer vor einer Stunde gepr√ºft und da war es 29 Grad - 29 GRAD ??? Ich sagte ihm, dass dies noch nicht m√∂glich sei - und dies doch auch nicht angenehm w√§re. Mit nochmaligem Bitten hat er einen Ofen installiert. Als wir noch einem Schlummertrunk ins Zimmer kamen, wurde es endlich w√§rmer. 

Ungl√ºcklicherweise war das Ger√§t zu laut um damit zu schlafen. Und da er den Ofen zu sp√§t installiert hatte, hatten wir also auch die 2. Nacht kalt.

3 √úbernachtungen. 1 x nicht schlafen wegen zu laut und  2 x schlecht geschlafen wegen der K√§lte. Das darf nicht sein.

Vom Manager gab es dann auch keine Entschuldigung mehr. Und heute morgen hat er auch nicht nachgefragt ob es besser war.

Die smarte Lichtsteuerung im Raum erm√∂glicht es auch vom Bett aus verschiedene Lichter und Lichtmoods einzustellen. 

*Badezimmer*
Das Bad ist ebenfalls stylisch mit einer ebenerdigen Regendusche eingerichtet. Verbesserungen k√∂nnten bei der Ausleuchtung des Spiegels sowie bei den Steckdosen im Badezimmer vorgenommen werden. Das Licht im Bad sieht zwar schick aus, ist aber leider etwas dunkel und man sieht sich nicht vern√ºnftig im Spiegel. Frauen d√ºrften beim Schminken dadurch Probleme haben. Die zwei Steckdosen im Badezimmer erm√∂glichen zwar das Laden von einfachen Ger√§ten, jedoch war es nicht m√∂glich bspw. den hoteleigenen F√∂n daran zu betreiben, da in den Steckdosen keine Vorrichtung f√ºr den dritten Pin war. Abhilfe schafft f√ºr diese beiden ""Probleme"" jedoch der Schminkspiegel, der sich im Schreibtisch befindet.

208,Pro e contro,"Il personale dell'hotel √® gentilissimo ed estremamente disponibile.
Avevamo chiesto due camere comunicanti, che per√≤ sono al piano terra e danno sul retro di un pub piuttosto rumoroso, quindi abbiamo dovuto chiedere di cambiare sistemazione.
Le stanze sono spaziose e ben arredate ma non pulitissime e male insonorizzate, il buffet della colazione √© piuttosto ""essenziale"".",3,2017,08,12
208,Sehr sch√∂nes Hotel an guter Lage,"Dublin haben wir ehrlich gesagt ein wenig schmudelig wahrgenommen, umso mehr haben wir uns √ºber unser Hotel gefreut.

Es war an einer guten, ruhigeren und sch√∂neren Lage. Die Gegend gepflegt, halt ein wenig vom Zentrum entfernt aber immer noch in Gehdistanz. Dort hat es dann auch nicht mehr soviel M√ºll vor den H√§usern und alles ist ein wenig gepflegter.

Das Hotel selbst ist im Entr√©e Bereich ein wenig speziell und der Stil ist geschmacksache.

Das Personal und die Betreuung war aber absolut vorbildlich, alle Mitarbeiter ausnahmslos sehr freundlich und professionnell. 
Die Zimmer sehr sch√∂n und sehr sehr sauber. Und das Bad hatte ein Nachtlicht, endlich jemand der begriffen hat, dass man in der Nacht nicht mit der Sonnenbrille aufs Klo m√∂chte ;-).

Eine Minibar mit lokalen Snacks und einer wunderbaren Auswahl.

Der Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum auch sehr sch√∂n, sehr gepflegt und das Fr√ºhst√ºck war fein. Das Buffet ist verh√§ltnism√§ssig klein weil man alles bestellen muss. Aber das Bestellte war dann hervorragend.

Wir k√∂nnen dieses Hotel gerne weiter empfehlen.",5,2017,07,24
208,ENGA√ëADO ESO ES TODO,"Reserve este hotel a trav√©s de agencia, el fin de semana del 27 de mayo, debido a su situaci√≥n.

Por lo tanto me sent√≠a que me quer√≠an estafar, por lo tanto solo me queda decirlo aqu√≠.
Acabe teniendo  que ir al intercontinental, y despu√©s de insistir y mucho insistir ya que el personal que estaba recepci√≥n no tenia ninguna capacidad de resoluci√≥n, el director de operaciones medio compenso la situaci√≥n.",1,2017,06,07

208,Wundersch√∂nes Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"Wir waren hier f√ºr ein Wochenende f√ºr einen City Trip nach Dublin. Das Hotel ist zwar etwas ausserhalb gelegen, mit Bus ist man aber schnell im Zentrum. Zu fuss bis Temple Bar sind es ca. 30 min, bis zum St. Stephens Green ca. 15 min. 
Wir hatten ein Luxury Queen Room gebucht und haben Zimmer 311 bekommen. Das Zimmer fanden wir wunderbar mit sehr bequemen Bett, Dusche und Minibar. 
Bar des Hotels ist sehr zu empfehlen und das  Fr√ºhst√ºck war sehr gut, selten so gute Eggs Benedict gegessen.

208,Hervorragendes Hotel! ,"Das Dylan Hotel kann vorbehaltlos weiter empfohlen werden!
Die Zimmer sind traumhaft sch√∂n, mehr als sauber und bieten allerlei Luxus. 
Es befindet sich auf den Zimmern jeweils eine ""Eurosteckdose"", sodass man seine elektronischen Ger√§te ohne Adapter aufladen kann. Falls man allerdings eine weitere Steckdose ben√∂tigt, kann man sich zus√§tzliche Adapter kostenfrei an der Rezeption besorgen. 
Das Personal ist √ºberdurchschnittlich freundlich, zuvorkommend und aufmerksam. Jegliche W√ºnsche wurden umgehend und zu vollster Zufriedenheit erf√ºllt!
Der Meeting-Raum ist √ºberschaubar, aber sehr stilvoll eingerichtet und dient seinem Zweck. Mehr als 16 Personen sollten sich  darin jedoch nicht aufhalten, da die Luft (trotz ge√∂ffnetem Fenster) schnell sehr stickig wird. 
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist √ºbersichtlich, daf√ºr hingegen sehr reichhaltig und gesund. 
Einziges Manko: auf einigen Zimmern lie√ü sich die Klimaanlage nicht h√§ndisch abschalten, sodass diese nachts w√§hrend des Schlafens lief. 

Alles in allem ein tolles Hotel, in dem man sich absolut wohl und gut aufgehoben f√ºhlen kann.

208,un sogno!!!!,"splendido hotel a Dublino a poca distanza dal centro diciamo 1 km a piedi ma situato in un quartiere meraviglioso molto tranquillo e dove ci sono delle case fantastiche.
Sembra di essere un dublinese! Giardini cani al guinzaglio e si respira l'atmosfera di dublino in maniera veramente reale.
Camere molto belle affacciano in una via silenziosissima e su un parco carinissimo.
Ottima la prima colazione e massima gentilezza dal concierge e dei servizi dell'Hotel",5,2016,02,09
208,Demasiado caro para lo que ofrecen.,"No recibes en absoluto el trato que te debe dar un hotel boutique de 5 estrellas.

El hotel es agradable, en un edificio cl√°sico bien restaurado y bien situado. Barrio silencioso, a 20 minutos a pie del centro. Cama muy c√≥moda. Algunos camareros en el desayuno muy simp√°ticos y amables, aunque la atenci√≥n en el desayuno es muy irregular.

Tuvimos que cambiar de habitacion porque en la primera se o√≠a much√≠simo la m√∫sica del bar que tienen en la planta baja, en donde se celebraba una fiesta. 
Mobiliario de dise√±o moderno (un poco hortera en mi opinion), pero no hay una butaca c√≥moda ni luz adecuada para leer en la habitaci√≥n.
El personal de la recepci√≥n es correcto, aunque algo secos y muy mal informados sobre la ciudad. No te dan apenas informaci√≥n sobre planes y horarios para un domingo lluvioso, o alternativas para cenar. Si les preguntas algo, lo miran en internet como podr√≠as hacer t√∫ mismo.
No funcionaba la wifi en la habitaci√≥n y tardaron 3 d√≠as en resolverlo, aunque se lo pedimos varias veces.

La pr√≥xima vez buscaremos otro hotel en la misma zona.",3,2015,10,11
208,Hay que ir,"Muy buena relaci√≥n precio calidad. Dubl√≠n ya no tiene los precios de""anta√±o"" para los espa√±oles, hay muchos alojamientos.

208,super Service,"Wir waren 4 N√§chte im Hotel Dylan. Es war sauber, ruhig und angenehm. Die Angestellten waren √§usserst aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Das Ein- und Auschecken ging auch sehr schnell. Im Zimmer ist alles vorhanden was man braucht: TV (mit Internet), W-LAN im Zimmer, regulierbare Heizung, I-pod station mit I-pod, diverse Hygiene Artikel, und ein super bequemes Bett!
Das Beste war aber das Fr√ºhst√ºck, welches wir inklusive hatten. Das lohnt sich, denn es hat ein Buffet mit Cornflakes Joghurt, Fr√ºchten usw. dann kann man sich so viel man mag von der K√ºche bestellen. Verschiedene S√§fte, Pancakes, Eierspeisen, Bagel, irisches Fr√ºhst√ºck usw.

Il bagno della mia non era propriamente da 5 stelle ma sicuramente confortevole. √à stata una bella esperienza per un weekend lungo di ottobre. Il personale √® sempre stato disponibile e ha risposto a tutte le nostre richieste. Va bene per un soggiorno in coppia e se non ci si preoccupa di una breve camminata per arrivare in centro. 
Consigliato!",4,2013,08,28
208,"un bell'albergo, non proprio centrale","davvero un bell'albergo, personale attento e disponibilissimo, begli arredamenti, camere curate ed accoglienti
peccato che non si trovi in centro, per raggiungere il quale ci vogliono almeno una ventina di minuti di camminata di buon passo (e non sempre a dublino √® piacevole camminare dato che piove assai spesso)
altro piccolo neo √® il buffet della colazione un p√≤ scarso
per noi italiano, che non mangiamo solitamente porridge, salsicce e salmone a colazione √® un pochino penalizzante
se fosse per questi piccoli difetti sarebbe da cinque pallini",4,2013,08,25
208,Perfekt,"Das Hotel liegt sehr g√ºnstig ca. 20 Minuten Fu√üweg von den Hauptattraktionen und Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten der Dubliner Innenstadt entfernt.

Das Hotel ist ausgefallen aber stilsicher eingerichtet und das Personal sehr freundliche und zuvorkommend.
Alle Zimmer sind unterschiedlich eingerichtet aber sehr gemuetlich. Ich hatte ein wunderschoenes grosses bordeauxrotes Samtbett im Zimmer und eine schoen grosse Dusche.
Das Fruehstueck ist ebenfalls gut und umfangreich.
Besonders schoen, wenn das Wetter es zulaesst, was bei uns leider nicht der Fall war, ist auch die Terrasse vor dem Hotel, die abends von Fackeln beleuchtet wird.
Wenn ich noch mal nach Dublin komme, uebernachte ich wieder im Dylan!",5,2011,06,03
208,Sehr schickes Hotel,"Ein Hotel, das Spass macht: sehr cooles Design mit ausgefallenen M√∂beln und Materialien/Farben, man f√ºhlt sich verw√∂hnt und es ist sicher kein einfaches funktionelles Hotel. Eie Bar ebenfalls sehr trendy und sicher zu empfehlen! Das Hotel liegt eher ""im Gr√ºnen"" in einem Wohnbereich, also etwas abseits des Trubels der City - bei einem kurzen Aufenthalt ist das eher ein Nachteil - bei mehreren Tagen vielleicht gew√ºnscht!",4,2010,12,11
208,Pl√ºschig und laut,"F√ºr unseren 4-Tagestrip nach Dublin hatten wir uns das Dylan ausgesucht. Das Hotel hat uns allerdings nicht wirklich √ºberzeugt.

Es liegt etwas abseits der Touristenrouten in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet, die zentralen Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten sind aber auch zu Fu√ü in ca. 20 min. gut zu erreichen. Das Hotel ist in einem Geb√§udekomplex untergebracht, das auf viktorianische Urspr√ºnge zur√ºckgeht. Die Einrichtung wird als ""stylish"" beschrieben, was immer der Einzelnen darunter verstehen mag. In erster Linie wurde sehr viel Pl√ºsch verarbeitet. Auf Funktionalit√§t wurde bei der Konzeption durchaus geachtet.

Unser Zimmer war ausreichend gro√ü und komfortabel ausgestattet. Das Badezimmer war etwas klein und dunkel. Allerdings gab es neben der Badewanne eine abgetrennte Dusche.

Das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet war sehr √ºbersichtlich, warme Eierspeisen konnten ohne Aufpreis dazubestellt werden. Der Service war durchweg freundlich.

Soweit w√§re eigentlich alles in Ordnung gewesen. Was hat uns gest√∂rt ?

Wir hatten das Dylan bewu√üt auch wegen seiner ruhigen Lage ausgew√§hlt. Das Hotel verf√ºgt allerdings √ºber eine Terrasse, die zum Restaurant geh√∂rt. Trotz des sch√∂nen Wetters wurde dort zwar kein Fr√ºhst√ºck serviert, sie wird aber abends gern genutzt. An zwei Abenden gab es dort geschlossene Gesellschaften von mehr als 30 Personen, die laut gr√∂hlend bis weit in den Morgen hinein feierten. Da unser Zimmer fast direkt √ºber der Terrasse gelegen war, konnten wir in diesen beiden N√§chten erst im Morgengrauen an Schlaf denken.

Eine Woche nach unserer Heimreise erhielt ich einen Brief, wonach man meine Kreditkarte mit einem zus√§tzlichen Betrag belastet habe, da man mittlerweile festgestellt habe, dass aus der Minibar Gegenst√§nde fehlen w√ºrden. Tats√§chlich hatten weder meine Frau noch ich w√§hrend des gesamten Aufenthalts irgendetwas aus der Minibar konsumiert. Beim Auschecken hatte ich dies auch ausdr√ºcklich angegeben. Ich sah mich daher veranlasst, die Belastung √ºber meine Kreditkartenagentur stornieren zu lassen.",2,2010,07,12
208,Ein Traum!,"Nachdem wir am gleichen Wochenende von einem sogenannten ""Designerhotel"" wutentbrannt und total entt√§uscht in das Dylan umgezogen sind, hat sich unsere Laune
schlagartig verbessert.
Dieses Hotel ist ein Traum und das in absolut jeder Hinsicht: Zimmer, Lage, Freundlichkeit, Service, Design, Restaurant usw.
Meine Frau und ich reisen beruflich sehr viel und sind oft in guten bis sehr guten Hotels.
Das Dylan ist ohne Zweifel eines der drei oder vier besten Hotels in denen wir je gewesen sind. Absolut empfehlenswert, eigentlich ein ""muss""!
In Dublin ""the place to be""!

Gleich noch eine Zusatzempfehlung: Gehen Sie auch mal in das ""Expresso"" gegen√ºber. Den besten French Toast auf diesem Planeten essen.",5,2009,08,05
208,Semplicemente Magnifico!,"Albergo meraviglioso, curato nei minimi particolari. Ottima accoglienza e disponibilit√† da parte del personale.  Prima colazione eccellente. Assolutamente da consigliare. Cinzia",5,2009,06,18
208,Ist der service wirklich so dolle?,"Das Dylan ist schon ein feines Hotel, dass nicht zu unrecht z. Zt. ziemlich angesagt ist. Allerdings kann ich in den uneingeschr√§nkten Jubel nicht so einstimmen: Ein Hotel diesen Anspruchs sollte darauf verzichten, w√§hrend der Hauptfr√ºhst√ºckszeit (9.30 Uhr) im ‚Äì nicht abgetrennten ‚Äì Nebenraum staubzusaugen. Oder muss man die Tischdecken unbedingt im Restaurant b√ºgeln, w√§hrend das halbe Hotel dort gerade fr√ºhst√ºckt?
Wie kann es passieren, dass das als so aufmerksam beschriebene Personal zum Tee eiskalte Milch im beschlagenen K√§nnchen serviert?
Danach hat es mich ehrlich nicht mehr verwundert, dass ich einen ziemlich angejahrten Single-Malt in eine Art Becher serviert bekam, wie ihn h√∂chstens echte Kerle in einem B-Western im Saloon √ºber die Theke schubsen.

Unser Zimmer war f√ºr das versammelte Design-Mobiliar leider zu klein. Ein E√ütisch mit zwei Sesseln nicht wirklich nutzbar. Hier lie√üe sich bestimmt etwas passenderes finden. (Daf√ºr war das Bett ein Traum.)

Wenn Sie eine Beschreibung lesen, nach der das Dylan nur wenige Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt liegt - das ist ok, aber wenn Sie zu Fu√ü gehen, sind es etwa derer 20. (Ansonsten Taxi oder Bus (Linie 10)).

Wenn Sie am  Wochenende nichts anderes vorhaben, suchen Sie sich rechtzeitig ein strategisch g√ºnstiges Pl√§tzchen in der Bar. Es wird eine interessante und unterhaltsame Nacht.

Ansonsten stimmt nat√ºrlich das meiste, was Sie √ºber das Dylan h√∂ren oder lesen: Ein ziemlich einmaliges Interior, eine sch√∂ne Lage, wenn man nicht in Temple Bar wohnen will und sehr freundliches Personal.",4,2007,11,27
208,fantastico,"ho prenotato questo hotel perch√® consigliato su tripadvisor. devo dire la verit√† l'albergo √® superiore alle aspettative. √® moderno elegante, eccellente il servizio di pulizia e ricezione. anche la colazione √® superba. nelle stanze troverete qualsiasi tipo di comfort: dall'asciugacapelli professionali all'ipod al pavimento riscaldato in bagno ...√® tutto davvero superbo. unico piccolissimo neo: non √® nel pieno centro di dublino ma si raggiunge facilmente in meno di 10 minuti...e cmq ne vale la pena.
